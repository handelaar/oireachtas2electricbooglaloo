      <P>I do not propose to speak too long on this matter this morning because it has been well and truly discussed.  From now on we can simply contemplate the consequences of the Minister's action in sacking the authority.  As I was saying, the evidence suggests that the Minister's action was the result of deliberate policy on his part to &ldquo;get&rdquo; the authority, to teach the authority and the broadcasting media a lesson.  The correspondence released to the Press by the former chairman of RTE would suggest that far from the Minister having to deal with a subversive authority, the members of that authority were at all times conscious of their obligations and the statutory relationship between the authority and the Government.  There was no question of their wishing to <Col N="154" /> subvert section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.  That section says that the Minister may direct the authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class and the authority shall comply. There was no denial of the right of the Oireachtas under that section by any member of the authority.</P>
      <P>Following the Minister's directive to the authority under that section the authority sought clarification as to which organisations the Minister had in mind and exactly what were to be the limits and extent of the directive.  In the words of the former chairman:</P>
      <P>We were served on 1st October, 1971 with a vague direction under section 31.  We had been asked to do an impossible task not knowing who was to be either judge or jury of our performance and without the right of appeal that other citizens have the privilege of enjoying.</P>
      <P>These were the difficulties the former chairman of the authority saw in the vaguely formulated directive of the Minister under section 31.  As he says, this letter of the authority looking for clarification of the Minister's intention begot the bland and less than helpful reply that the directive spoke for itself.</P>
      <P>That was October of last year. Obviously, that was not the response of a Minister who wished to help a loyal authority, an authority who were not subversive of the institutions of the State but who wished to perform their duties diligently under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next communication from the Minister was that &ldquo;RTE had broadcast a programme between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. on Sunday last which was in contravention of the directive of October, 1971.&rdquo; This was precisely the kind of situation the former chairman had feared and about which he had asked help from the Minister, a situation in which the Minister would be both judge and jury, a situation in which the Minister simply said: &ldquo;My vaguely formulated directive which puzzled you last year now has this result.  I am asking you to tell me what action you propose to take as a <Col N="155" /> result of a particular broadcast last Sunday&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Minister, who was so sparing in his advice, so frugal in comment on the directive, maintained this economy of comment on the situation when it came to that second communication with the authority.  He simply wished to know what action the authority proposed to take in relation to the alleged contravention. Exactly what did the Minister mean by that question?  Was the Minister suggesting the sacking of Kevin O'Kelly?  Is that what lay behind that ambiguous question of the Minister? One is entitled to speculate.  The members of the authority were entitled to wonder what lay behind that query of the Minister as to what action the authority proposed to take.</P>
    <P>A programme had been broadcast. The Minister said it contravened his directive under section 31 and that he wished to know what action the authority proposed to take.  I do not think this kind of correspondence would suggest that the Minister was truly living up to what the Act would appear to suggest should have been the relationship between the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the authority.  The Act envisaged a partnership in which there would be mutual respect, the Minister having the supreme obligation to be the representative of this Parliament in seeing that section 31 was at all times understood and adhered to and the authority, in the day-to-day running of the affairs of the service being supreme in their area.  Of course, no statute can prescribe a working relationship. This must be worked out between the principals.  If Deputies ask a question about a particular programme broadcast by RTE we get the quite proper reply that it is a matter of day-to-day routine and one proper for the authority.  But here we have a decisive intervention by the Minister after almost a year's silence.  It would appear from copies of correspondence that the Minister refused to give the authority either any advice or any clear direction when they sought it.  Instead, he left them with this vaguely formulated directive.  It would appear that the Minister had decided on a fundamental <Col N="156" /> change of relationship between the Government and the RTE Authority. Indeed, it would appear that the Cabinet, as a matter of high policy, have decided to revert to the pre-1960 position when broadcasting was almost under direct ministerial control.</P>
    <P>Although nominally we may have an authority still, it is clear that the authority we have now can be only a mere shadow of the authority who preceded them.  The Broadcasting Act still holds but the circumstances of the sacking of the previous authority must leave those who come after them in that much weaker a position.  If an employee is fired without being given the opportunity of a hearing and if he is replaced by one who is not perturbed by the circumstances of the departure of that employee, the other person would be referred to in trade union parlance as a scab.  The new RTE Authority who are taking over as lackeys of the Minister cannot have any of the content, either the respect or the integrity, of the authority who were displaced.  The situation now would suggest that we are reverting to the pre-1960 situation. That is a backward step.  Whatever may have been said for direct ministerial control of radio in the pre-1960 period&mdash;and it was objected to at the time&mdash;it was regarded as a step forward to create a situation in which we had an authority or, in other words, an extension of the control of this House in respect of radio and television.  It is stated in section 31 of the Broadcasting Act that this Parliament and the Minister of any particular Government may direct the authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter. Of course, in the case of a State radio or television station the final authority must be stated.  Matter concerning the setting-up of a station and its funding must rest with this assembly and it was a step forward to have passed an Act whereby we shared this particular authority with a group of prominent citizens outside and they, in effect, assumed the day-to-day running of the broadcasting service.  This indicated an advance to a new and mature relationship.  It indicated a trust in that the State could have a <Col N="157" /> freer broadcasting and television service. A democracy can be classified by the kind of relationship that the central authority enjoy with the broadcasting authority.</P>
    <P>We all know of countries that fight colonial wars in the name of liberty and when any such war is over we find that the former revolutionaries control broadcasting very firmly.  Here we have a democracy of almost 50 years standing but which has now resorted to methods that belong more properly to peoples and nations only emerging from the consequences of recent war and who find it necessary, for one reason or another of State, to control the broadcasting media.  We appear to be joining that league of countries in our treatment of the authority.</P>
    <P>This Government have proved themselves consistently insensitive to the 32-county dimensions of any of their political attitudes.  The sacking of the authority is a notable instance of that insensitivity.  The truth of that can be gauged from the reaction of every member of the SDLP last weekend when they condemned the action of the Government in regard to the authority.  They were dismayed by the treatment that the Government had meted out to the authority.  They said that it would have adverse effects on their own struggle for a peaceful reunification of the country.  But, then, this was the same Government that had first announced a threat of internment without trial on this island in recent times, the same Government who tried to abolish PR.  To say the least, they have been insensitive to the repercussions of their actions in the northern part of the country.  Even that well known champion of liberty, Captain Brooke, has been shocked by this action in Dublin.  I wonder what is the opinion of that section of international liberal opinion which the Taoiseach has been at pains to cultivate in recent years.  There have been Sorenson-like speeches echoing around the world as the Taoiseach addressed this international community of liberal thought.  Admittedly, the Taoiseach has sent the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs during the past <Col N="158" /> few days to explain to the British public why the firing of the authority had been necessary.  I understand the Minister explained that he was not in favour of political censorship although his actions would smack of such censorship in so far as that section of international liberal opinion are concerned.</P>
    <P>There have been editorials in the British Press expressing criticism of the Government's action.  The Taoiseach and the Government as a whole have been anxious to point out that while there is a healthy democracy in this part of the country there is anarchy in the northern part which has arisen from the unfair distribution of power in that area for so long. The Government's action would not suggest that we acted in a democratic way.  Indeed, it would not suggest that we were very confident in the health of democracy in our part of the country. It is very important that in these dangerous days we demonstrate that we are confident in our democratic institutions, that we are not panicked into silly measures, that if we are faced with threats by subversive organisations, by anti-democratic organisations, we will be careful that our cure does not outrival the disease. It would appear on the evidence of correspondence between the chairman of the RTE Authority, the members of that authority and the Minister that the Minister deliberately stalked, deliberately trapped and deliberately fired the authority.  That sequence of events and that deliberate intention on the part of the Government seems to suggest themselves to any impartial reader of the correspondence between the chairman of the authority and the Minister.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Phyllis O'Kelly, a former member of the authority, said the government had bubbled over.  Indeed they had.  The consequences of that action is that we have an authority with no real life of its own.  Whatever the Act may say the authority has no real authority and the consequences of this loss of face must extend into the minds and the work of all the people working in the television station.  I recall the scene in <i>King Lear</i> where the servant and the fool meet Lear <Col N="159" /> on the moor.  He is in disgrace, out of his court and is unrecognisable in his adversity.  Lear says: &ldquo;How exactly do you recognise me?&rdquo; This is the substance of the actual dialogue. The fool says: &ldquo;Thou hast that in thy countenance which I would fain call master&rdquo;.  Lear says: &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; He replies: &ldquo;Authority&rdquo;.  That is what is absent here as a result of the Minister's action.</P>
    <P>The statute may still be as clear as ever on the books but the people who now call themselves members of the RTE Authority lack the real content of any moral authority.  They are Minister's men replacing people who were sacked unceremoniously and without adequate explanation by the Minister.  We have not lacked such people in the previous history of this country.  Obviously there is a full supply of them for the Minister's needs if it is necessary to sack the present authority.  It is a pretty disgraceful comment on the way we manage our affairs.  If we have been anxious to suggest abroad that this was a mature democracy, this action of the Minister seems to go contrary to that impression which we have been so sedulously cultivating and fostering&mdash;the Taoiseach principally&mdash;over recent years.</P>
    <P>One wonders what the young ladies and gentlemen of the Oxford Union thought of it.  It would not be the best way to win a motion at the Oxford Union to say that one was Prime Minister of a Cabinet who had just sacked every member of the authority of the only television station in the State because one had not liked a particular programme which they had transmitted.  There would not be much chance of getting a vote for a united Ireland from such a university body on that basis.  We have, of course, given unlimited joy to the most reactionary elements of the Unionist Party in Northern Ireland.  The tragedy is that this action was unnecessary. The Minister would have us believe we were dealing with an authority who were unreliable in their positions of trust and had to be sacked, that they were people who <Col N="160" /> might almost be equated with the subversive organisations the Minister feared.  I am no lawyer but I would have thought that the individual members of the authority might have the material for an interesting court case with the Minister under the Civil Liabilities Act, 1961, on the manner of their dismissal.</P>
    <P>The manner of the dismissal would suggest that the members of the RTE Authority were unworthy of their positions.  I hope Deputy Burke might consult some of his legal colleagues to see if, in fact, we could have a test case on this matter.  The Minister was not satisfied with the members of the authority.  They sought a directive but the Minister did not give it to them.  They finally got a letter from a civil servant in the Minister's Department saying they were out. This Minister, a short time before that, saw nothing wrong with the authority.  He asked them to remain on at their posts.  Would it not be human to think that the Minister did not suddenly come to this drastic change of opinion of the abilities and characters of the members of the authority?  Surely we give a number of weeks' consideration and a period elapses before we say that X, Y or Z is unreliable or is a person of no ability or one we would not trust. Despite this, the Minister, on the evidence, twice called this authority back to their posts so pleased was he with their performance.</P>
    <P>We could ask ourselves: &ldquo;Is the Minister a sadist?&rdquo; That may be regarded as unparliamentary but it is, to say the least of it, very peculiar conduct.  He sacked all the members of an authority a short time after he asked them to stay on at their posts. Unless the Minister is in possession of facts in regard to the authority I am not in possession of, it would appear that the members of that authority conscientiously sought help from the Minister.  This, it was suggested when the Bill was being debated here, should be the correct relationship between the Minister and the members of the authority.  The trustees of the Minister in that authority sought advice from him but he did not give it to them in written form.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> The conviction that the Minister deliberately and for political reasons decided to sack the authority, is strengthened when one realises that the Minister is, at this very time&mdash; there is a committee in session&mdash;reviewing the whole scope of broadcasting in this country.  The committee is expected to report shortly.  One would have thought that, if fundamental changes and a re-assessment were to emerge, the appropriate time would be when this report was available.  The authority have also been engaged in an examination of broadcasting and television in the State.  Their report is called <i>A View of Irish Broadcasting.</i> We have the situation in which the former members of the authority were engaged, as a result of the difficulties they had adverted to in correspondence with the Minister, in a fundamental assessment and investigation of the position.</P>
    <P>On the other side, the Minister himself had set up a committee.  Both sides were investigating independently, aware of certain difficulties but attempting to get solutions to them.  The Minister refused to put in writing any of his conclusions in the matter of the implementation of section 31.  He had given himself a great deal of manoeuvrability in his treatment of the authority by his refusal to be more specific in his letter to the authority under section 31.  But he was aware of certain problems which that authority was encountering, as was the authority itself since both parties were themselves engaged in independent investigations.  The authority said:</P>
    <P>The terms of the direction generally are so imprecise as to be unsatisfactory in principle and to place an unfair burden on the authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister had simply said to them that he did not wish to see broadcast a matter that would be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in or promotes or encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means.  The authority sought direction on the extent of this idea of promotion.  They asked whether, for example, if there is a programme, say, on a northern topic in which an illegal <Col N="162" /> organisation is referred to or the effect or consequences of certain of their actions, is one promoting their objectives by referring to the consequences of their action.  I think this is a legitimate query.  In broadcasting terms if one queries the opinion of a member of an illegal organisation is one promoting. To that question there was no reply from the Minister.  The Minister cannot, in good conscience, say that he gave the authority an adequate direction when he did not give any advice to the authority that would give a certain preciseness of outline to his ideas on this matter of promotion.</P>
    <P>We have previously referred to the fact that it was regrettable that on certain occasions one could not have a member of certain of these illegal organisations interviewed face to face so that the unsoundness, the thwarted view these organisations and their spokesmen had of certain events, could be exposed.  It is arguable whether they should or should not be interviewed face to face.  It is not a problem for the BBC evidently and it is not a problem evidently for many of our newspapers but there is a genuine difficulty here and nobody in this House wishes in any sense to see the spokesmen of groups that are not ready to submit themselves to the mandate of the ballot box advance stealthily or surreptitiously into the hearts and affections of the people of this country by giving them certain platforms.  Nobody is in favour of any such development nor I think was anybody in the authority or in RTE willing to aid such appearances or lend themselves to such promotional activities.  Their question was a legitimate one, the limitations to this idea of promoting.  When is one promoting the affairs of subversive organisations and when is one in the wake of a particular event, bringing the question impartially before people so that once more ordinary men and women may condemn with their minds, have the opportunity of seeing once more when such an organisation has committed a dastardly act or seeing through a particular mistaken policy of an illegal organisation?</P>
    <P>The Minister himself would appreciate that there was a great deal of <Col N="163" /> ambivalence in his own party towards illegal organisations, anti-democratic organisations, in the period before Christmas.  Things may have changed now.  The fact is that there was a great deal of ambivalence.  There was a great deal of ambivalence in this country up to last Christmas on how we should approach these anti-democratic organisations and their spokesmen. That ambivalence appears now to be dissipated but it undoubtedly existed.  This represented very testing and unique difficulties for the television and broadcasting medium, probably difficulties never faced before in the history of the State.  I think they honestly attempted to meet those problems.  There were mistakes.  As I would see it, and as I am sure many viewers saw it, certain prejudices existed in one programme or another but I honestly sympathise with the people who had to make those decisions, who had to put out those particular programmes.  By and large, they attempted to do a fair job.  They were dealing with events in the North that tore at some of our deepest feelings in this part of the country and if, on occasion, they appeared to err and their reportage appeared to lapse into propaganda on one side or another this was to be understood in the circumstances.  They were not alone in that partiality over that period.  They were entitled to seek clear direction from the Minister and I do not quite understand his refusal to help, by explicit direction, to say what exactly was meant when he talked about promoting the affairs of these organisations.</P>
    <P>We must, in preserving democratic institutions, ensure that we do not adopt the methods of the adversaries of these same democratic institutions, that our cure is not worse than the disease.  I am confident that the majority of the people of this State realise that the achievement of any settlement of the Northern question will not be settled by the overthrow of democratic institutions in this part of the country but we must not add to the cynicism of the general public by suggesting that henceforth Telefís Éireann is simply another arm of <Col N="164" /> government.  The late Seán Lemass said a lot of sensible things.  I did not quite agree with his formulation of the relationship between Government and RTE.</P>
    <P>I think that somebody earlier in the debate said that the broadcasting service cannot be seen as another turf station, another semi-State body because it deals with ideas and communicates with the mass of the people and in this sensitive area the relationship between it and the Government, if the viewer or listener is to have any confidence in that medium, must, to the extent that is possible under the Act, be independent.  Henceforth, the listener or viewer cannot have this feeling.  I do not say&mdash;although I should not be surprised if it were the case&mdash;that he will be faced with a procession of Government Ministers after every news bulletin between now and the approaching general election. I do not think there will be anything as crude as that, but the audience certainly cannot have a great deal of confidence that the programme they are seeing has not been vetted in the office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  They cannot have confidence that the station has the same independent status which it had two weeks ago&mdash;and even then it was not independent.  But in the weeks ahead it cannot enjoy the authority which the old service had and it will, in a very real sense, have a very different relationship with the Government.</P>
    <P>This debate has been dominated by the dismissal of the authority, as is quite proper since that was the major topic, but the Department ranges over many other areas which have been little referred to in the debate except by the opening speakers before this storm had broken.  They had the advantage of looking at a situation which appeared to be stable.  Appearances were deceptive.  Normally, we would be saying that this or that should be done, improvements should be made here and there and that this programme was good or that person was very good in a certain programme. It is rather a pity that the debate had to be dominated by this issue but the issue is of such importance that whatever political party we <Col N="165" /> belong to, all of us who believe in the importance of the democratic way of life&mdash;and I think all Members of the Dáil subscribe to this idea or they should not be here and subscribers to the laws passed by this Assembly&mdash; must regret this action by the Minister. I do not know if he is aware of it but his action has really forced the public to think for the first time, filled them with the idea for the first time that we were if not moving rapidly towards totalitarianism certainly taking steps in that direction.</P>
    <P>That is why the Labour Party last week issued a warning to the public that if the authority were sacked it would be a muzzling of RTE.  This muzzling came all the more peculiarly, ostensibly to ensure that the authority did not have programmes promoting the affairs of anti-democratic or illegal organisations from a Government which had been loath&mdash;to put it mildly &mdash;to uphold the rule of law in the past three years.  That is why we issued that warning.  I am sorry that we were proved more correct than any of us thought at the time.  We had hoped our warning would at least have served in some sense to avert what we saw as a possible train of events but that warning was ignored, at least by the Minister. But members of the public throughout the country who are not and never would be in any sense supporters of any anti-democratic organisation are truly alarmed: Have the Government taken leave of their senses?  What confidence can they have in a government that can be driven into this type of panicky measure?</P>
    <P>The point has been made that there has been some kind of division between journalists in newspapers and those in television.  I do not think so; I think all journalists realise that what has happened to RTE may very soon happen to them.  We may not discuss it now but obviously what happened to the RTE Authority cannot be separated from the pending legislation which will be brought before the House by the Government today.  This is all part of a pattern of a Government which is losing its head, a Government which stood idly by in the past three years when these anti-democratic organisations were recruiting.  Now, <Col N="166" /> later in the day it is attempting to beat an oversize law-and-order drum.</P>
    <P>Personally&mdash;and I think the members of my party also&mdash;I have taken a strong line on the matter of fidelity to the democratic institutions of the State but we do not believe that the democratic idea is served by imposing censorship of any kind on the broadcasting medium.  This suggests that we are taking over the political methods of the opponents of democracy.  If people who believe in the democratic way of life adopt the weapons of their adversaries, then the democratic State is assailed on both sides&mdash;by the groups attempting to subvert it by imposing revolver rule and also by the defenders of the democratic way of life if they adopt methods which curtail freedom of expression.  All Members of the House will, I think, take whatever measures are necessary to defend our democratic State against the imposition of anti-democratic rule, should it come to that, but the Minister would appear unwittingly to be aiding the anti-democratic forces by the nature of his action against the RTE Authority.  The correspondence would seem to suggest that he deliberately set out to alter the relationship between the authority and the Oireachtas.  There was his refusal to aid the members of the authority in response to their understandable request for advice on the implementation of his directive.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Minister wishes to revert to the pre-1960 situation in which he had direct, almost day-to-day, control over the affairs of broadcasting, and the manner of the Minister's treatment of the RTE Authority would appear to be a step backwards for democracy.</P>
    <P>All of this the Taoiseach refers to as an exercise in democracy.  We really are reaching an alarming stage when we use the language of democracy for this kind of Mafia operation on the authority. I find it incomprehensible that this should be the end of the correspondence between the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the authority.  I understand the Minister said on some news programme yesterday that he had not been sparing in his advice to members of the authority, that he had met <Col N="167" /> them frequently in discussions about this directive of his under section 31.  I am not sure whether the Minister made that statement but I gather the Parliamentary Secretary was saying something to that effect last night.  The Minister has a charming personality and is quite energetic in explaining what he really means in personal interview by a particular letter.  However, I imagine that the unfortunate members of the authority were not saying: &ldquo;We do not trust what you are saying to us here in interviews and in personal meetings but we would like certain reassurances in letter form from you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They never received those important letters from the Minister and we now see how well grounded was that anxiety on the part of the authority.  It is extraordinary that there should be no direction given from the Minister at the request of the authority from that date in October and that the next piece of correspondence is a letter dismissing them.  That is what leads one to conclude that there has been this deliberate attempt on the part of the Government and the Minister to revert to the pre-1960 situation in the matter of the relationship between the authority and the Minister.  That is why one is reminded once more of the earlier act of this Government, and the Minister's predecessor, the attempt to stop the public affairs programme &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo;, through the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; Tribunal, in those happy days when the Government could concentrate at its leisure on &ldquo;getting&rdquo; RTE.</P>
    <P>That is why one believes this action on the part of the Government was deliberately decided at a much earlier date.  The Minister stalked the members of the authority before finally despatching them.  As the former chairman said, the Minister was making himself judge and jury and the unfortunate defendants&mdash;in this case the members of the authority&mdash;were given no information on the circumstances of their guilt.  Something has been left unexplained.  The authority sought advice and was not given it, and the authority was finally sacked for insufficient reason, with consequences with which we all must now <Col N="168" /> live, a television station which from now on must appear to the ordinary viewer up and down the country as a creature of Government policy.</P>
    <P>At least it can be understood why we in the Labour Party believe that this was a pre-general election manoeuvre to ensure that RTE would relay what Big Brother wished RTE to relay, interview people whom Big Brother wished to be interviewed.  All in all, we think the Minister's action has been a bad day's work for Irish democracy.  It appalls our friends around the world, friends we are in need of at present, and suggests this State is rapidly degenerating to the shameful position of the republics that come and go in South America every day of the week.  It suggests that the methods being adopted are more appropriate to the cumainn of the party to which the Minister belongs and do not have the responsible approach of a Minister of State.  The vindictiveness of the Government's action suggests that they are not imbued with any great concern for the name of Ireland around the world, that they are insensitive to the effect on the cause of Irish unity, that they are insensitive to the predicament of those people in the North struggling by peaceful means for a united Ireland&mdash;witness the unanimous condemnation by the members of the SDLP, Messrs.  Fitt, Hume, Currie, Cooper and Devlin.  All of these men and women have been appalled by the Government's action.</P>
    <P>The Government, unrepentant, unworried about these effects, move on today to further appalling actions, further attacks on liberty.  At this time all democrats must be worried, ruled as we are by a Government panic-stricken, vindictive, lashing out in all directions, attempting late in the day to nail their colours to the mast of fidelity to the rule of law, standards which they did not live by over the past three years.  The Minister's action must suggest to the ordinary viewers that from now on they would be more properly employed listening to a gramophone record than listening to the programmes coming from RTE because the new authority cannot have the same status as that of the one <Col N="169" /> sacked by the Minister.  The Minister owes this House a full explanation as to why he felt this action was necessary. In reverting to the pre-1960 situation, he should also explain under what legislation he is operating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to protest at the Minister's action in regard to the RTE Authority.  First of all, I should like to draw attention to a few problems which affect the constituency I represent.  I wish to say a few words concerning telephone kiosks.  I fully appreciate the Minister's problem in this regard.  The provision of telephone kiosks can be very expensive. There are a few areas in County Monaghan which should have special attention.  One of these areas is a place known as Anyalla.  This place was referred to in a Parliamentary Question some time ago.  There is a post office there and the Minister says that sufficient use is not being made of the present system there to merit an outside call box.  I would like to remind the Minister and the Department that this post office is closed from 5 p.m.  On most occasions no telephone service is available after that hour.  There is a church and a number of houses in that area.  A telephone is necessary there after 5 p.m. I request the Minister to examine this matter further.</P>
      <P>There is also the matter of a sub-post office for a new housing estate in Monaghan town.  I have been told in answer to a Parliamentary Question that it is not intended to establish a sub-post office and that the present post office is sufficient to cater for the needs of the town.  I doubt this very much because of its geographical position in relation to the town.  The post office is on the perimeter and is situated in a very narrow street. There is a new housing scheme with a large number of houses situated a considerable distance from the post office.  I suggest to the Minister that he should have the possibility of establishing a sub-post office in this housing area re-examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem arises in relation to a kiosk for a housing scheme in Carrickmacross.  We have been told <Col N="170" /> that there are sufficient kiosks and that they are situated one-quarter and one-half mile from the scheme.  I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that both of these kiosks are situated within about 50 yards of each other on the main street and about 100 yards and 50 yards respectively from the post office which has also got a kiosk.  I would suggest that instead of having an over-supply in one particular place the kiosks should be evenly distributed.</P>
    <P>I would like to voice my disapproval of the Minister's action in sacking the RTE Authority.  I listened to the Minister speaking in a radio interview yesterday. The Minister has given various excuses for taking this extreme action. So far as I myself and many of the people for whom I speak are concerned we would not agree with the views expressed. We would regard&mdash;and I do not think we could be blamed for so regarding&mdash;any programmes which would now be transmitted as being one-sided. It is only reasonable to assume that any RTE Authority who would assume control at this time in the wake of their predecessors' dismissal would be inclined to have a second look at every programme and to examine carefully any interviews with people which they would be inclined to permit.</P>
    <P>It is a sad and sorry day for this country when the Minister and the Government can dismiss the authority of the national broadcasting system purely on the grounds that they interviewed somebody from an illegal organisation. The people of the country are sufficiently intelligent to make up their own minds and to judge for themselves what they can believe and what they should not believe.  I doubt the Minister's wisdom in dismissing this authority, particularly when I think of action taken in other directions.  I can recall that on two occasions within the past seven years certain action was taken.</P>
    <P>One occasion was in 1965 when the Tánaiste wrote to the managing director of a provincial paper in my constituency endeavouring to censure comments made by the editor of that paper. I can think of another occasion within the past two months when at a meeting of the North Monaghan Comhairle <Col N="171" /> Ceantair the Tánaiste was present and a number of people were appointed under the chairman, ex-Deputy Mooney, to go to see the joint managing director of this newspaper, which is one of the best newspapers in Ireland, and to tell him what he should publish or permit his editor to publish in that paper and, further, to threaten the managing director of that paper that if he failed to do this advertisements and printing from the printing works attached would be withdrawn. In my opinion, this was going too far. It was tantamount to blackmail.  It is with things like that in mind that I cannot accept the Minister's decision. We must have the right of journalists to freedom to express the news in a fair and impartial manner.  I would not be party to any member of my party or of any other trying to impose his will on the media of communication.</P>
    <P>I was amused yesterday to hear the Minister speak, he said as an Irishman and a member of the Government, about being bound to uphold the democratic institutions of the State. I do not think there is one Member of this House who is not pledged to defend the democratic institutions of this State, and I could not help wondering whom the Minister thought he was fooling or bluffing, or how he can reconcile that statement with the actions of some of his predecessors and, indeed, present day members of his party in relation to acts and events of the 1920s when the same democratic institutions as we here today are upholding were threatened.  I do not think the Minister is bluffing anybody because all are sufficiently well informed to know that this action by him is an effort to stifle a news medium which may not be particularly favourable to his party.  It is for that reason I say here today that I oppose this action of the Minister in sacking the RTE Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This debate has proceeded for some days and it has eventually turned completely on the decision of the Minister or the Government to dismiss the RTE Authority.  Initially, I did not intend to contribute to the debate <Col N="172" /> but I say that I had decided to let my views be known before the interview with Mr. Mac Stiofáin was broadcast on Sunday, 19th November. I had left this House on the previous Thursday somewhat unhappy about the trend of the debate on this Estimate because I had reason to believe that the stage was being set deliberately to bring RTE to heel.  I came to the conclusion from one speech which I had heard from the Government benches that a plan of campaign was under way, that the Minister and the Government had decided the RTE Authority were behaving in much too independent a manner and that something would have to be done to see to it that Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann became instruments of Government propaganda.</P>
      <P>I will tell the House what led me to believe that this plan had been worked out and was in course of being put into operation.  I listened to a speech being made by Deputy Flor Crowley.  That speech preceded the interview which Mr. O'Kelly had with Mr. Mac Stiofáin and it was clear from Deputy Crowley's speech that an attack was being mounted on RTE. It is true to say that the impression was given in Deputy Crowley's speech that the complaint was that RTE were giving too much time to advocates of violence, but an analysis of Deputy Crowley's speech makes it abundantly clear that the real complaint was that too much time was being given on the media to the constitutional opponents of the Government party in this House.  That was clear from Deputy Crowley's speech.  He complained bitterly about the time being given to Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and to Senator John Kelly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, then, the faulty interpretation of the directive by the authority when they decided to broadcast the interview with Mr. Mac Stiofáin must have come as a Godsend to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Whether that interview had taken place or not, the authority would have been sacked, and I believe Deputy Crowley was brought into the House to make that speech for the purpose of setting the stage for the <Col N="173" /> execution of the RTE Authority.  The RTE Authority were established by the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960. Our radio and television service is a monopoly service and, indeed, in the foreseeable future it is unlikely that an independent broadcasting service will be established here, even if a licence were given, because most likely it would be an uneconomic proposition to run an independent television or radio service against the State-sponsored organisation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is very important that we have here a radio and television service which are independent, which are fair, at liberty to give all sides of the picture.  Otherwise that service is simply turned into a propaganda machine for the Government of the day, and in the age in which we live, the moment in which the television and radio services become an instrument of propaganda for the Government, democracy dies in this country.</P>
    <P>In the past three years this Government have been paying lip service to law and order.  They have been making noises about law and order and have been doing nothing about it. This directive was issued to the RTE Authority under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, some time about the end of October or early November last year.  It was a vague and uninformative document. It forbade the authority to broadcast any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attainment of any particular objective by violent means.  The authority found itself at a loss clearly to understand how this directive should be interpreted.  It did its best to get guidance from the man who gave the direction, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, but it was simply told that the directive &ldquo;speaks for itself&rdquo;. Surely that was being unhelpful and surely that was no way to get co-operation from the authority.  I would have the greatest difficulty in interpreting that directive.  I understand the authority conveyed to the Minister its difficulty about interpreting the directive.  It got no help from the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> I put it to the House and to the Minister that the Minister knew the authority interpreted the directive to mean it could not put on physically a member of an illegal organisation on television or on radio.  The authority took the view that there was nothing contrary to the directive in interviewing such people at a remove and I believe the Minister knew that was the interpretation put on the directive and he did nothing to contradict that interpretation. Now, if that is so, and that is the case made by RTE, surely the Minister was less than fair with the authority.</P>
    <P>I have been asking myself for the last few days what might contravene this directive, what sort of broadcasting could be calculated to promote, encourage or advocate the attainment of any particular objective by violent means.  It could be said, I suppose, that to broadcast anything suggesting that a person holds very strongly that violent means are the only method of solving the problems in Northern Ireland that would violate the directive. I suppose that, if a speech by a leading member of an illegal organisation to the effect that he believed the right way to unite the country was by physical force and the only way to get the British out of Northern Ireland was to bomb them out, the reporting of such a speech could be and would be regarded as violating the directive.</P>
    <P>It has often been said that actions speak louder than words.  For the last week we have had a man on hunger and thirst strike in order to profess to the world that he believes in violence here and in Northern Ireland and the brand new Radio Telefís Éireann Authority is feeding that out to the people, morning, noon and night.  Is that a violation of the directive?  Does the Minister see anything wrong with that?  Does the Minister not think that, if a man feels so strongly in support of violence that he is prepared to die in support of violence, that would encourage young people to think that that is the right thing to do?  If RTE were guilty of violating the directive in broadcasting the interview with Mac Stiofáin then they are equally guilty of violating that directive in publicising details of <Col N="175" /> the hunger and thirst strike of Mac Stiofáin and I am prepared to argue that logically with anybody.</P>
    <P>The fact is that RTE were placed in an impossible position by the Minister. The authority got no proper directive from the Minister and that confirms my opinion that the Mac Stiofáin interview broadcast had nothing whatever to do with the sacking of the authority.  In my opinion the Minister decided, for political reasons &mdash;I regret to have to say this&mdash;that RTE were being too independent in recent times in current affairs programmes. The Minister and the Government looked ahead to 1973, a year in which there probably will be a number of elections, and decided that they must have a friendly television and broadcasting service to carry them through.</P>
    <P>I want to go on record as saying that it was the current affairs programme, on &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo;, or whatever it was on, which preceded the 1968 referendum on the proposal to abolish PR, that defeated that proposal.  About that there is no doubt.  The Government resented that, and they have not forgotten it.  A programme was put on by a couple of professors who had studied electoral systems throughout the world.  They attempted to forecast to the nation what the result would be if proportional representation were abolished and the straight vote introduced.</P>
    <P>That programme was lambasted in this House by the Minister's former colleague, Mr. Kevin Boland.  He denounced the programme and ridiculed the professors.  That programme has not been forgotten.  The Minister knows that a general election will probably be held next year.  The Government knows that certain discussions are taking place between the Opposition parties in this House with a view to presenting the people of the country with an alternative Government. I am not prejudging the results of those discussions.  I am not prejudging whether the people will be given an alternative Government composed of Fine Gael and Labour at the next election.  I hope they will.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> The Minister and the Government fear such an alternative being clearly and independently explained to the people over the penetrating medium of television.  The first shot was fired in a programme put out by RTE some few weeks ago which I saw on a Friday night.  Participating in that programme were the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Richie Ryan and Deputy Michael O'Leary.  I will not concentrate on what any of them said.  There was a lead-up to the programme which dealt with the inter-Party or coalition form of government in various countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>It was a very fair introduction to the programme.  It pointed out in a balanced way what inter-Party or coalition government was all about, how it worked in various countries in Europe, and how certain European countries had progressed under it.  By and large this was accepted as a good programme, as an educational programme, but the Government did not like it.  That programme offended the sensibilities of the Government far more than the Mac Stiofáin interview.  It had far more to do with the sacking of the RTE Authority than the Mac Stiofáin interview.</P>
    <P>All of a sudden the Government have become very sensitive about publicity for illegal organisations. Everybody knows that for the past three years illegal organisations have been doing what they like where they like in public.  They have been parading as members of illegal organisations without let or hindrance from the Government.  This is simply a political stick to beat RTE.  I want to go on record as saying that this House would be neglecting its duties in a most shameful way if it did not register the strongest possible protest at this proposal.</P>
    <P>In 1973 the Government want to have an authority in office which will answer to the crack of their whip. In recent times RTE have tended to become independent.  During the last presidential election we saw the most shameful and disgraceful use of RTE by the Government.  During that election campaign, so far as RTE were concerned, there might as well have <Col N="177" /> been no election pending.  That was not accidental.  By pretending that there was no election and that there was no campaign on foot, they succeeded in blacking out one candidate. They successfully blacked out Deputy Tom O'Higgins but, during the same week, the other candidate was at every function that could be thought of.  He was at every christening and every unveiling and every opening of anything that could be thought of, and he was on RTE morning, noon and night.  That would not be the situation if the authority continued to behave as they were behaving recently.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why the Government wanted to get rid of them and replace them by a ball of putty which can be moulded in any way the Government want.  It is true to say that the authority were sacked before the Mac Stiofáin interview was broadcast.  When it was broadcast the Minister went through the formality of writing to the authority and asking them what they propose to do about it, and what action they proposed to take.  The Government met on Tuesday. The Taoiseach went to London on Wednesday or Thursday and did not come back until Saturday, I think. The reply from the authority did not arrive until after the Taoiseach had left.  It was a reasonable reply.  On Friday, or certainly before the Taoiseach came back, the old authority were sacked and the new authority were appointed, and on the new authority two Corkmen are appointed for political services rendered to the Government.  With all due respect to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, this Government is a one-man band consisting of the Taoiseach.  Does anybody believe or will they convince anybody that the authority was sacked and a new authority appointed in the absence of the Taoiseach?  It may be said that he was consulted over the telephone.  That is possible.  I want to suggest that the deed was done before the Taoiseach left the country for London, that it was done in advance of the reply from the RTE Authority.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into the qualifications of the new authority <Col N="178" /> personally or in detail but I do say that they are a political body set up for political purposes.  The impression is given that one of them is a member of a Labour Party.  Everybody knows that that particular man was appointed in repayment for political services rendered to the Fianna Fáil Party over the years in County Cork, with particular reference to political services rendered in the last Cork by-election. That is the authority that is now going to run the broadcasting and television services, which enjoys a monopoly and which will run them in an independent and fair way.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that the sacking of the RTE Authority and the appointment of its successor was an exercise in democracy.  I said that the Government is a one-man band run by the Taoiseach and I believe the Taoiseach is getting as intoxicated with authority and pride as anybody could be and has nearly got to the stage where, in the words of another leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, he believes that in order to ascertain what is democratic or what is good for the people he only has to do what he himself thinks, without consulting anyone.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House unduly.  I commenced by saying that when this Estimate was introduced I had not intended to speak on it but having heard Deputy Flor Crowley and having seen the plot develop, I considered it my bounden duty to come in here and stand up for the liberty of free speech, for the liberty of free expression of thought in the most modern and most effective way of giving that, that is by television and radio.</P>
    <P>I want to condemn in the strongest possible way the action of the Government, first of all, in issuing this vague directive, secondly, in refusing to explain that vague directive and, thirdly, for mounting this dishonest, hypocritical plan to get rid of the RTE Authority for political purposes.  It is going down extremely badly in the country.</P>
    <P>In reference to Mr. Kevin O'Kelly, I do not believe that he should have been called as a witness in that prosecution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> I do not believe he should have been called as a witness in the circumstances prevailing.  The people resent that.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by warning the Government and warning the Minister that they are embarking on a dangerous road if they think they can muzzle public opinion.  This is another example of a Government being too long in power. A garda one time had occasion to remonstrate with a Member of this House who had parked his car illegally or in such a way as to cause an obstruction.  He was told by the Member that he was a Member of this House.  The garda very rightly said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These bloody fellows think they own the country.&rdquo; Surely, this Government think they own the country.  They have been in power too long.  They cannot tolerate time being given to Opposition speakers.  Deputy Flor Crowley cannot tolerate time being given to Senator John Kelly.  He asks: &ldquo;Is there no other constitutional lawyer in the country?&rdquo; He admits that Senator John Kelly is a constitutional lawyer but just because Senator Kelly happens to be a Member of Oireachtas Éireann and a member of the constitutional Opposition party, he says he is to be denied an appearance on Telefís Éireann. Deputy Flor Crowley asks is Deputy Dr. Cruise O'Brien the only historian in the country.  He admits that Deputy Cruise O'Brien is a historian but he wants to deprive him of an appearance on television because he happens to be a member of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Government party are enjoying more than ample space and time on the mass media, they have been in power so long that they cannot bear to see anybody else getting a fair crack of the whip or getting time to put across their views.  That is a dangerous exercise in democracy.  If that is the Taoiseach's idea of an exercise in democracy, he had better think again.</P>
    <P>I have expressed my utter and sincere indignation at the performance of the Government in relation to this matter.  I hope I have made it perfectly clear that it was an exercise which is not calculated to wipe the <Col N="180" /> unconstitutional people in this country off the screen and off the radio; it is an exercise that is calculated to wipe the constitutional opponents of the Government in this House off the mass media.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to re-echo largely the speech that has been made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  It would be very wrong if Deputies who are free to speak&mdash;of course, I refer to Deputies on the Opposition side&mdash;did not express concern at this latest exercise by the Government and the Minister in arrogant executive power. Everyone throughout the country was shocked last week to read of the removal of the RTE Authority.  They were shocked because it had been understood that, in relation to a matter which ought not to have occurred in the view of the Government and in respect of which there was some misunderstanding and confusion on the part of the authority, a civilised exchange of views had taken place.  We knew in the previous week that a letter, to which Deputy Fitzpatrick has referred, had been sent by the Government to the authority.  We knew that the authority met and were in session during many anxious hours, that they then sent a reply to the Government and that the result of that was the exercise under the Broadcasting Authority Act of the powers to sack the entire authority.</P>
      <P>When was that decision taken?  As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, the Taoiseach was in London and one might imagine him, between what he was doing there, keeping one ear constantly on the telephone to Dublin. Of course that did not happen and no one will persuade any adult person in this country to believe that it happened. The Taoiseach went to London having already made a decision that, no matter what the RTE Authority said or did they were to be removed.  They were removed at the Government meeting on the previous Tuesday.  What took place after that was a very ill-thought out exercise in camouflage&mdash;the camouflaging of a decision taken before the authority were given any opportunity to explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> We know that from the mouth of the Taoiseach himself because, when he was interviewed following the removal of the authority, he said that the decision had been taken on the previous Tuesday.  It had been taken at the Government meeting from which this famous letter emanated and then the Taoiseach went on to say that, anyway, it was an exercise in democracy.  Democracy is a term that can be used by different people for different purposes.  We know that the devil can quote scripture for his own purposes and I suppose the Soviet system of Government can be described by the current dictator as being a people's democracy; but we now have the Taoiseach's democracy and the Taoiseach's democracy in Ireland is that, if anyone refuses to be pliable to the whim and fancy of the executive, that person or group will be removed.</P>
    <P>The authority that were removed from office had been appointed quite recently.  Its composition was the result of the pressure of public opinion during the years because the first authority contained no one that was not associated and identified with Fianna Fáil.  Successive authorities were in the same mould but public opinion did not wear that.  Gradually the authority that have been removed came together.  They were appointed by the Government under the Act but were composed of independent thinking people of standing in our society.  There was Mrs. Seán T. O'Kelly, widow of the late President of Ireland&mdash;no doubt to be described as a flag-flying extremist of the most dangerous kind.  There was ex-Deputy Stephen Barrett, who was a most respected Member of this House for many years.  Also there was Professor Moody and Mr. Ó Moráin.  All were people of substance in our community. Having observed one of them I happen to know the care and dedication that he brought to his work on the authority in respect of policies and his concern in ensuring that faults, to the extent to which they existed, and well-founded criticism would receive sympathetic and earnest attention.  These people comprised the <Col N="182" /> authority that had emerged eventually after years of trial and error.</P>
    <P>Is it any surprise that, following the removal of this authority, the various people who had to deal with them&mdash; the producers in radio and television, the professional groups&mdash;should come together and issue the following resolution:</P>
    <P>We, the Radio and Television Producers of RTE, recognising that the Authority which was dismissed on November 24th was committed to a genuinely independent broadcasting service for the Irish people, that it has guided and supported the broadcasting staff in the balanced dissemination of public information and has acted with respect for the community and the dignity of the law, vehemently protest at the humiliating dismissal of that Authority.</P>
    <P>As citizens of this democracy and as professional broadcasters, we view the action of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as an assault upon the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We believe that the power vested in the Minister by the Broadcasting Act, 1960, has been abused by him in that he has placed the Authority under a legal directive so vague, that the Authority's capacity to implement it is seriously frustrated. Therefore, in the interests of Irish Broadcasting, we call upon the Minister to clarify this directive or withdraw it.  Our traditions of jurisprudence recognise the right to know the law specifically, the right to be judged impartially by due process, and the right of appeal.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Minister, in issuing a vague directive, in refusing to clarify it, and in summarily dismissing the Authority for alleged breach of it, has acted contrary to the principles of natural justice.  As radio and television producers in the service of the Irish community, we deplore as an erosion of democratic freedoms any attempt to manipulate the national broadcasting service, and appeal to all citizens irrespective of their political <Col N="183" /> beliefs, to support and maintain the free flow of information in our country.  Finally, we further deplore the use by the State of legitimate journalistic activity as a surrogate prosecutor in the courts, and express our solidarity with the National Union of Journalists in support of our colleague, Kevin O'Kelly.</P>
    <P>That is an expression of concern, anxiously and earnestly held by those who have to work in this medium under the control and guidance of this dismissed authority.  The expressions used there cannot be described as extreme but obviously emanate from people who are deeply concerned by what has happened.</P>
    <P>What is involved?  The Broadcasting Act, 1960, setting up the authority providing for broadcasting throughout the country, seeks to establish under this Act as its charter an independent broadcasting authority.  Section 18 of that Act lays down that:</P>
    <P>it shall be the duty of the authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the authority's own views.</P>
    <P>Oireachtas Éireann, when it passed the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, in pursuance of our democracy, sought to establish an independent and an impartial body to deal with this very powerful means of communication.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go back over the history of the last decade but we know that, once television came, there were individual and at times joint efforts by different Ministers to rig programmes, to change the news and to prevent inconvenient features appearing.  Telephone calls were made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries saying that, if the station reported what the President of the NFA said at such and such a dinner, it would be in trouble. Other efforts were made by other Ministers over the years endeavouring <Col N="184" /> to box the authority, the officers and the personnel into subjection to the views of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say it was due to the determination of the Directors-General in particular that the authority resisted this pressure.  It was fortunate that at a very important juncture Mr. Kevin McCourt was Director-General because he established quite clearly that the authority, in so far as a Director-General could achieve it, would function independently under the statute to give an impartial service to the people.  That does not mean the efforts were not made.  Now we have the culmination. We have an authority composed of people of standing, people who are respected in their own right in this community, people who brought dedicated attention to their duties, removed from office.  Why?  I believe this question is being asked all over the country.</P>
    <P>Surely the authority was not dismissed because a directive was misunderstood or because the O'Kelly interview was carried?  Surely that is not sufficient reason.  I think Deputy Crowley was merely expressing the view of others when he spoke.  Was it because this authority was being too fair?  They were actually carrying out what is laid down in the Act and, in doing so, it meant that the two points of view and often the inconvenient point of view might be presented. Therefore, that authority had to go.</P>
    <P>The authority was then removed. What a time to remove it.  If you intend to get a new authority you must, first of all, have them ready and handpicked.  Some of the new authority that has been appointed say that greatness suddenly descended on them without any expectation; but, whether it descended without any prior knowledge, the fact is that there is now a handpicked bunch to run Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann.  This has happened at a very good time from the Government's point of view because we face in the next six months a Presidential election. It is very important to know what is news when a Presidential election is fought in Ireland.</P>
    <P>At one time the Presidential elections <Col N="185" /> of every banana republic in South America were news in Ireland. Perhaps our own Presidential election did not rank in that way.  If it is coming up in the next six months it is a good thing to have a new authority there, people you can trust. A Presidential election, local elections and a general election are all possible in the next six to eight months and therefore the changes were made, as the Taoiseach said, in the interests of democracy.</P>
    <P>I feel that this misuse of power by the Government of this country will cause dismay and concern throughout the Republic.  People begin to see the real dangers that lie in too much power being exercised by a Government too long in office.  Impatience with the Opposition, impatience with those who endeavour to argue another point of view, a growing ruthlessness in ending democratic dialogue and a growing concern to get one's decisions accepted willy-nilly, are symptoms of power being abused.  These are the symptoms of power being abused and that is why this authority was removed from office and that is why this particular action has caused and will continue to cause concern throughout the country.</P>

      <P>It is obvious to everybody now that the normal discussions of the Minister's Estimate has completely ceased.  It has ceased because of an extraordinary happening in the Minister's Department, for which he is directly responsible.  Since this happening has taken place every Deputy felt compelled to express his opinion on what is now known as the sacking of the RTE Authority.  Every Deputy who has an opportunity to speak has a responsibility to express his views on this extraordinary business.</P>
      <P>I have very little time to look at television&mdash;I very rarely see it&mdash;but I remember a time when I was convinced that RTE had gone crazy because of the amount of time and the prominence that unlawful organisations were getting on television.  I am going back now a few years.  The peculiar thing is that nothing serious seems to have taken place at that time.</P>

      <Col N="186" /> Obviously there were no serious discussions or threats to the authority at that time when there were really serious reasons why something should have been done.  Now we get this precipitate action when very little happened to justify it.  Everybody I have met in the course of my constituency work has been appalled at the action taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Government did not appoint the members of this authority to carry out this very serious national responsibility without thinking long and hard about every individual that was asked to serve as a member of the authority.  It is extraordinary that all these people, carefully picked as they should have been, should all be of one mind about the conduct of RTE.  It was not a question of half of them splitting one way or another, having two or three opinions. There was no such split.  They were quite unanimous.  They all, by the one foul blow, got the knock.  They got the knock from the Minister, they got the knock from the Government, when it was an opportune time to give them the knock and when they appeared not to be slanting the news completely in the Government's favour.</P>
    <P>There were times when all of us felt that serious action should have been taken in relation to RTE Authority. These instances have been described. The last Presidential election was a case in point.  When one relates what took place or did not take place at that time one is open to the accusation that one is making a case for the sacking of the authority but that is not the time it happened.  There was not a word as long as it was going in the Government's favour but any appearance of criticism of any sort and we have an arrogant Government saying: &ldquo;No, you do not.  If you dare to do it we sack you and that is it.&rdquo;  And this is an exercise in democracy.  This is something the people of this country will not wear.  The sooner the Government realise that, the better.  They have just gone beserk recently on what they consider is governing.  They have failed to govern for a very long time and suddenly they have gone over backwards in the other direction and they <Col N="187" /> think they will sit on everybody.  The people of the country generally are very fair and I do not think they will stand for this sort of thing.  They will insist that there is a fair presentation of news.</P>
    <P>I, like many others, from time to time got the impression that there were certain people employed in RTE who felt that they, and only they, knew what public opinion was and what the right view was, and there is no doubt that they set out to mould and lead public opinion rather than to report.  I think that is a wrong function and I think these employees of RTE should be told that by somebody in a position to tell them.  I do not think it is the job of the Government. If they appoint an authority the authority should deal with it.</P>
    <P>If the Government felt that the security of this State was being put at risk by the RTE Authority these are all, individually and collectively, responsible people&mdash;and they would not, I assume, have been selected if the Government did not consider them that at the time they appointed them&mdash;surely the obvious thing was for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Taoiseach, if necessary, to meet them, their own friends, and say: &ldquo;Look, we are seriously concerned about certain matters in RTE.  Will you sit down and talk to us about it?&rdquo;, instead of sending a reprimand, demanding an explanation and not waiting for the explanation but having the decision already made to sack them.</P>
    <P>This is what the people are objecting to.  The approach to the whole problem, if a problem existed, was totally abnormal and unreasonable. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will have an impossible job to come into this House and explain to the House and to the country why they acted in this way, why they acted so precipitately, why they appointed the new authority so precipitately.  They did not even ask for the consent of the people they were appointing&mdash;at least some of the members have said that they were not asked, that they were told they were being appointed.  Both <Col N="188" /> the sacking of the outgoing authority and the appointing of the incoming authority were done in a most extraordinary manner.  I want to place on record my personal objection to the sacking of the authority at a time when I think there was absolutely no reason for it.  When there did appear to be reason for taking serious action there was very little action taken and there was none that was obvious. There was certainly no question of sacking the authority.  Condemnation of this is widespread not only in the House but outside it and there is no explanation really possible.  All of us on this side of the House are certainly as concerned as the Government are about preserving the safety and security of this State and the institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the telephone service, which I think is deplorable.  It is not yesterday it became deplorable; year after year we have the same debate and the same condemnation of the failure of the Department to provide a reasonable telephone service, their failure to anticipate needs and the failure of the Government to plan ahead and provide a reasonable service, their failure to anticipate population movements.  I know most deplorable cases where the Minister can neither do anything nor promise anything not only for months but for years ahead because of failure to plan ahead and have a reasonable programme and reasonable liaison with the development planners.  I do not know how closely the Department work with local authorities and planners and how far it is possible for them to say that they will do anything one, two or three years ahead.  As in many other Departments they should plan five or ten years ahead.  There should be a Government decision for planned expenditure over that period.  Everybody knows that if you decide today to provide a service it may be two years before you get the material to do it.</P>
    <P>To even the most deplorable cases requiring telephones you can say: &ldquo;You cannot have a telephone for two or three years because we have not the material&rdquo;&mdash;or the money, if the truth were told.  Neither have we technicians, <Col N="189" /> in my view; I shall come to that later. There are areas that will be without an adequate telephone service for years.  I have instances in mind such as Blanchardstown where it took years to provide a service.  They said they had all sorts of difficulties with flooding and other things but even the day the service was introduced it was deplorably inadequate.  Now, there is the rapid development of that area into a city in quite a short time but there is no provision for telephones and they cannot say when they will have them.  The same applies in Rathcoole and throughout all County Dublin where you have rapid development.  I am sure the pattern is the same all over the country.</P>
    <P>I think no private business could survive for 12 months if they carried on as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have done.  Yet this is a service which could and should pay its way.  People cannot get a service at any price.  Those who are fortunate enough to have a telephone find that it is out of order half the time.  I do not know what is wrong with the telephone repair service but the situation in Ireland is completely abnormal and does not correspond with experience in other countries.  I do not know if the material being installed is inferior, whether much of it is very old, whether it is not properly installed or whether we lack technicians to service it.  We do not even have to go outside this House to realise how bad the telephone repair service is.</P>
    <P>I work in an institution and I am not exaggerating in saying we have the technicians in twice a week on average.  Sometimes we have them practically every day.  It would be a useful exercise for the Minister to look up the file in respect of that institution and see what it is costing to keep the telephone service going in that hospital.  It is not really going; it is a most deplorable service.  I discussed this problem with a very big industrialist from abroad.  I asked him how often did they have the technical people in to repair their telephones. He said they were due to come every 18 months but that sometimes it was three years.  He said they very rarely <Col N="190" /> saw them.  This sounds extraordinary to me; I do not know whether it is correct, whether the man knew what he was talking about, but he was a very important businessman.  Has the Minister inquired about standards in other countries or inquired as to whether our technicians are getting sufficient training, whether there is sufficient supervision, whether the material we are using is right?</P>
    <P>We certainly have a deplorable service and if we are to develop industrially, induce people to set up business and industry we must have a good communications system.  We have not got it and that is one factor which will deter people from setting up business here.  I implore the Minister above all to take seriously his responsibility in regard to the telephone service.  I cannot speak too strongly about it: I admit I have not the temperament for a telephone but there are times when I feel like throwing it out the window.  It can be out of order for an hour or a half-hour and you can get no calls on it and then for no reason it becomes normal again.  You can get a technician in and he puts the telephone in order but he has not gone out of the building before it is again out of action.  There must be some explanation for this, otherwise it could not continue to happen.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say a word about changing addresses.  The Minister knows that when people have a postal address they become attached to it and frequently value it highly.  If it is changed they feel very strongly that it reduces the value of their houses and their prospects of employment.  We talk of an exercise in democracy but I would ask the Minister to regard this as an area in which he can exercise himself fully in democracy by listening to what people have to say, by being concerned about their opinions, by understanding the situation when the whole of a large community send a deputation to him saying: &ldquo;We want to retain our postal address: we bought our houses with this address; we have lived here for years and it is an address we like and value.  We do not want it changed.  You can organise your postal <Col N="191" /> service as you like but do it without changing our address.&rdquo;  I cannot understand why it is not possible to change the organisation for delivering post without changing an address.</P>
    <P>I do not know what system is carried on in the Post Office which requires that an area which was an address is now a number and must be a number, or otherwise the service cannot be kept going.  Nobody may tell me that the service has improved as a result of this; it has not improved.  Another of the things about which people complain bitterly is that they have to go quite considerable distances to claim parcels whereas formerly they had the facility locally.  We have local post offices being closed down with a loss of service instead of an improvement of service as a result of the change of address. What is democracy if the Minister will not listen to the voice of the people and to their wishes and says: &ldquo;I know better than you do and the people in my Department know better than you do what is good for you&rdquo;?  It is no wonder that Deputy Fitzpatrick and others have said that the Ministers in this Government make up their minds by looking into their own hearts and deciding what is good for people.  The people have a right to decide if they come together as a large community.  If they go to the trouble of being organised into a community and if they are all as one in their opinion that they should hold a certain address which they have had over a period of years the Minister should listen to them.</P>
    <P>In the last case I have in mind, the Minister met the people very courteously. He talked to them and said he would do what he could but in the last analysis he took away their postal address after being nice to them and giving them reason to believe that he would give them what they wanted. He gave them that hope and they went away quite happy and spoke highly of the Minister and his courtesy, but the Minister having done all that said: &ldquo;No, this cannot be done; it is not possible.&rdquo; These people do not accept and will never accept that it is not possible.  The Minister organised <Col N="192" /> his delivery service simply and solely on the basis of telling them: &ldquo;You do not live any longer where you used to live; you are now a number.&rdquo; This is one thing the Minister should explain because he has certainly failed to get it over to me and to the people who came to see him by way of deputation.  This is not an isolated instance.  It has happened in other parts of the country and there are Deputies who are aware of it. The service has got worse rather than better and there are Deputies in his party who would agree with this view and who will support me in the case I am making for the retention of the address which people always had and the attachment and the regard for that attachment which they have for that address.  I feel very strongly about the telephone service and about this question of preserving addresses.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy has a responsibility to be on record in his attitude to the sacking of the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority about which so many people are appalled.  These are the reasons which led me to intervene in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The tone of this debate and the contributions to it have varied greatly since last Tuesday week when the Minister let it be known that he was writing to RTE objecting to a broadcast which had taken place on the previous Sunday.  It was inevitable that every Deputy who has spoken since would comment on the action taken by the Minister last week but there are many other very important things in this Department from which the Minister's action last week may tend to distract attention.  One of these is that the Department employ more people than anybody else in the country.  It is one of the most important Departments in the whole country.  It is responsible for the telephone and telegraph services, for the postal service and many other services involving tremendous amounts of money and which affect us all every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to the telephone service and to the long list of complaints which every Deputy gets about telephones, from people looking <Col N="193" /> for telephones all over the country, and this seems to be particularly true of areas in which it seemed to be possible to foresee that there would be a huge demand for telephones such as the suburbs of my own city and of Dublin and the big towns throughout the country.  The Minister says that the fact that there are waiting lists in other countries is no consolation and that is true, but neither is it a valid excuse for the Minister in a situation in which people have to wait in some cases up to two years for a telephone.  I remember being told a few years ago of a person who went to America.  Somebody had rented for him an apartment in New York before he arrived and within the first two hours of being in the apartment, three different people were calling to the door trying to sell him a telephone and insisting that one telephone was not enough, that every modern family has two telephones and he should have them as well.</P>
    <P>We are a long way from that here and I suppose that in Ireland, except for business purposes, two telephones would not be required, but a reorganisation of the telephone service here is overdue and I suggest to the Minister that he should divorce the telephone service from the Department and set it up as a separate body outside the Department, giving it all the powers necessary to raise money on international markets because what the service needs is a huge capital injection and this is not possible within the confines of a Government Department. The telephone service should be taken out of the Department and allowed, somewhat on the lines of what the ESB have done, to advertise, to seek loans from the general public, to go abroad and raise money to enable an efficient and up-to-date system to be provided.</P>
    <P>This is all the more necessary because the Minister will find if he consults the Department of Industry and Commerce that when an effort is made by the IDA or Gaeltarra Éireann to attract industry to the west of Ireland and to what are called designated areas, one of the first things the industrialist from abroad <Col N="194" /> wants is an efficient telephone service, a service which he can use to get in touch with the least possible delay with many parts of the world.  This sort of infrastructure is essential in the places where we want industrialists to go, the west and the more remote parts of the country.  Otherwise they will tend to be sucked into Dublin city which is top heavy with people. If we want to encourage industrialists to go out and provide jobs and livelihoods for people in other parts of the country, we must have there the necessary infrastructures for them to establish their business.  The most important of these is a telephone service. Any industrialist will want to have a telephone installed immediately so that he may phone New York, Bonn or London on the spot.  This is not possible at the moment and it is one of the most common complaints that one hears in talking to officials of the IDA, the regional development organisations, Gaeltarra Éireann and other people responsible for seeing industries brought to this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had many representations from the south of Ireland regarding multi-channel television. Over the weekend the difference between the east coast and the south coast was very obvious.  The fact that RTE were not on the air on Saturday and Sunday did not make any difference to people on the east coast; they could switch to another channel, whereas those on the south coast had no television or radio at all.  I can understand the Minister's point of view when he says this is not something he planned, that this is something that was available fortuitously to people on the east coast, and that to supply the people on the south coast with a similar service would create difficulty.  At the same time, this service is being provided for many areas in Dublin by RTE Relays, and if it is being done within the confines of a £7.50 television licence the Minister will have to consider giving the people in the south and west the same facility.  It is only a question of time until the BBC, ITV and the other stations will be broadcasting so powerfully that they will be picked up in the south and west.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> We do not want to see in other parts of the country the appalling spectacle to be seen in Dublin of massive aerials all over the city destroying the sky line.  The Minister should make arrangements to avoid this in the interests of the environment, although I realise another Department is involved here.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the prohibition against signing more than 500 relays to the one aerial.  Whether it is to make it more expensive and to discourage people from availing of the service, I do not know.  It is possible to provide as many as 2,000 relays from the one aerial, and the Minister should explain why he has limited the number to 500.  It has been suggested to me that the Minister is concerned to slow up the growth of multi-channel viewing&mdash;even though he realises it will come to the whole country eventually&mdash;as he seems to be doing in regard to colour television.  If colour television is to be adopted it will mean an increase in the licence, and this is something that would be resisted by the people.  At the same time, people are getting good value for the present licence fee.</P>
    <P>In regard to the events of last week, the only explanation we have got from the Minister was on a radio interview yesterday which ironically was to go out on Saturday but because the radio was off the air it was relayed yesterday. The Minister said in that interview that since he had issued the directive on 1st October, 1971, several programmes offended against the spirit, if not the letter, of the directive.  I agree with him.  Certainly the one last week offended against the spirit if not the letter of the directive.  However, I wonder did the Minister on these occasions bring to the notice of the RTE Authority the fact that he considered these programmes to have offended against the directive.  The directive issued on 1st October last year, which has been described as too vague by the authority was:</P>
    <P>To refrain from broadcasting any matter of the following class: any matter that could be calculated to <Col N="196" /> promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is sufficient for the Minister to say that it is obvious what he meant by that and that the authority knew what they should do.  One particular broadcast took place in July and if the Minister had at that stage brought to the notice of the authority that he considered this to have offended against his directive, then a process of trial and error could have been set in motion, which is the only way the authority could know what was in the Minister's mind.  The authority wrote to the Minister earlier on saying the directive was too vague and they needed clarification on it.  In the words of Mr. Ó Mórain they got a bland and less than helpful reply.</P>
    <P>I hold no brief for any member of the outgoing authority, and, indeed, I wish the incoming one appointed last Friday well.  However, I pity the new authority because the Minister said yesterday he does not intend to reword the directive in any way for the incoming authority and they will be in exactly the same position as the outgoing authority, in that they will not be able to know when they are offending against the directive.  The Minister also said the directive was as simple and as clear as it could be.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> the other day the radio correspondent, P. K. Downey, asked could the use of a hurley in a game of hurling be considered to be the attainment of a particular objective&mdash;which was the winning of the match&mdash;by violent means.  A directive from a Minister to an authority appointed by him on such a serious matter as who should have the use of television time which is paid for by the people needs to be far more specific than that, and while I hope the incoming authority will feel free to run RTE taking account of the views of the people and with as much freedom as possible, I hope they will not find themselves in three months' time in the position that they will get a letter from the Minister asking them to account for a certain <Col N="197" /> programme produced three days prior to that.  The Taoiseach said that a decision had been taken on the Tuesday of last week to ask the dismissed authority about a certain programme put out on radio three days previously, even though the decision to fire them had already been taken.  In <i>The Irish Press</i> last Saturday there was a leading article pointing out that, while the Government have the right to control RTE, the supremacy of Parliament must not be challenged. It was stated that it was highly debatable whether the Government had gone about the matter in a proper way.  This was in reference to the sacking of Mr. Ó Moráin and other members of the authority the previous day.</P>
    <P>The Minister described Mr. Ó Moráin as a very fine gentleman indeed. I hope that feeling is reciprocated by Mr. Ó Moráin.  The Minister said that he had to do his best to see that the taxpayers' money was not used to bring down the Government. I, and every Deputy, would say &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; to that.  Most people would agree with those sentiments. Was RTE using taxpayers' money to bring down the Government?  Mr. Ó Moráin in one of his letters said that they had decided that no questionable programme should be put out until he and as many of the authority as he could gather round him had given sanction for it.  That was a sensible line to take.  They admitted that the broadcast on the previous Sunday should not have gone out.  Their solution for dealing with the problem was very fair and would have met the Minister's wishes in every way.  Because of its vagueness the directive might not have been obeyed in the future, but the only way the authority could find out what was in the Minister's mind was by trial and error.  In this case they would have been able to control programmes which might give offence or could be held to be against the directive.  They would accept the right to put out any programme.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister said that nobody in the Government party had any wish to get at anybody in RTE. <Col N="198" /> On the 16th November, 1972, Deputy Flor Crowley spoke in this House.  He was sitting behind the Minister and consulted him about his speech before he made it.  Deputy Crowley's speech needs studying in the light of what happened afterwards.  Deputy Crowley said that RTE provides a good living for many of the leading dissidents in this country and for sympathisers with illegal organisations.  I suggest that Deputy Crowley, and perhaps the Minister, would like to get at some of these dissidents and sympathisers with illegal organisations.  Deputy Crowley said that many semi-State bodies have their share of pseudo-intellectuals.  That is one of his favourite phrases.  All through his speech he suggested that such people are in control of the RTE Authority.  If Deputy Crowley thinks that, there is not much point in the Minister sacking the authority because these people will still be able to run the station.  The Minister said they are not going to be fired and there is no intention of engaging in a witchhunt. If such people are in the station and are not to be fired there is no improvement in the situation.  If Deputy Crowley is right and these people are in the station, they should be fired.</P>
    <P>I do not know what a pseudo-intellectual is.  Deputy Crowley's use of the term suggests that it is a term of abuse. If RTE is being used by the sympathisers with illegal organisations to promote their aims, the Minister might have a better case for firing those people than for firing the authority. The Minister has said he is not going to sack anybody and that nobody in his party has any wish to get rid of anybody in RTE.</P>
    <P>The Minister should think again about the relationship between this House and himself.  It is this House and not the Government party that provides the funds for RTE.  There was a famous phrase of the late Deputy Seán Lemass to the effect that television was an instrument of government. They were not his exact words, but that is what he meant.  It is typical of Fianna Fáil to confuse Government with Parliament.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister introduced this Estimate, this debate has been overtaken by events.  For over a week we have heard one Deputy after another commenting on the sacking of the RTE Authority.  We have heard many words spoken inside and outside this House about this sacking.  There is an obligation on the Minister not to allow develop again a situation similar to that which he claims he found himself in when the broadcast went out on Sunday week on the radio.  I have not seen in the past week the Minister making it clear to the new authority where they stand. It is quite obvious that the sacked authority were in difficulty as to the interpretation of the directive.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the new authority, without further delay the Minister should see to it that they know exactly the interpretation to put on the directives. It is difficult to see how the new authority will operate if they are to have this cloud over them in the matter of interpreting how far they can go in certain types of broadcasts.  That is about all I wish to say on the sacking of the RTE Authority, and I think it will be surprising to most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other things I must deal with on this Estimate and I regard it as unfortunate that the sacking should have coincided with the debate on the Estimate.  I say this because I believe that of all the Government Departments that of Posts and Telegraphs seem to be giving Deputies, other public representatives and, indeed, the community generally most trouble.  As I move through my constituency, I receive complaints not <Col N="200" /> only of the postal service but also of the telephone service.  I think it was Deputy Clinton who earlier today said the telephone service is one which should pay its way.  I agree and so do many other people who have spoken to me about it.  Therefore, it would be no harm if the Minister were to consider letting this service to private interests as is the case in many other countries.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible thing for me to have to say here without fear of contradiction that we have the worst telephone service in Europe.  I have received complaints about it not only in my constituency but throughout Dublin, and earlier this year in mid-Cork during the by-election I heard much criticism of the telephone service. I had thought that the failure of the Department to give adequate service in the matter of telephones would be confined to areas where there is great development and I was consequently surprised to find in rural parts of Cork, where there had not been any development and even very few single houses built in recent years, that people have been awaiting telephones for long periods.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to give some attention to this service in areas where development is taking place. This, of course, takes me to my home town of Tallaght, not so long ago only a village but now being referred to as a town.  Indeed, I believe it will not be long until it will be referred to as a city.  Some of the older residents of Tallaght have been waiting for telephones for more than three years.  In this connection the Minister in his introductory speech made but one small reference to Tallaght, casually mentioning the building there of a telephone exchange.  It came last in a list of other places.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Minister can be happy with a service which is not a service at all particularly when one considers that in County Dublin we are building the first town since the State was founded.  As I have said, a few years ago Tallaght was a village of 3,500 souls and today more than 20,000 live there.  Yet it has one of the least number of telephones <Col N="201" /> per head of the population in any part of the country.  In this new town of Tallaght more than 20,000 people depend on four public telephones&mdash;indeed, up to a week ago there were only two.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the Department's unwillingness to provide public telephones, there are individuals in Tallaght who applied for telephones more than three years and they are still waiting for them.  A person came to me recently who moved into the area two years and ten months ago.  He was told at that time that he could have his telephone transferred from his previous address in a matter of a few months.  Almost three years later he is still waiting for it.</P>
    <P>The Department have not been keeping abreast of developments. They have been falling behind in the planning of new exchanges and the provision of new lines.  Four or five years ago when a new exchange was opened in Walkinstown&mdash;I was then not a Deputy but a councillor&mdash;I made representations to the Department regarding the provision of a telephone.  Six months after that exchange had been opened, the information I got was that when new equipment was put into the new exchange the matter could be considered.  That new equipment had not arrived in that exchange two years later.</P>
    <P>No private company which behaved in this way would last very long.  We have the new estate at Springfield, west of Tallaght, just about two miles outside the area of main development. There are 400 or 500 houses on that estate.  Many of the people have been living there for the last seven months. Not one telephone has been installed. The Department have refused even one public telephone.  Worse still, the local curate and the local doctor applied for telephones and they were told they would be given a temporary line on payment of £150 each.  Representations were made to the Department and it was agreed to provide both lines for £150 but, because one of the applicants has not yet paid his share, £75, the whole estate is still without a telephone.  The onus of providing a telephone service should not have been <Col N="202" /> placed on either the doctor or the curate.  This is a service that would be provided if the service were in the hands of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I would plead with the Minister to give more attention to the developing areas in County Dublin.  I do not know whether there is a shortage of staff or whether sufficient technicians are not available but, if one's telephone goes out of order, one has to wait an inordinate length of time before repairs are effected.  Again, there is difficulty in dialling.  On numerous occasions, especially on Mondays and Fridays, one will get at least four wrong numbers before one gets the number one is actually dialling.  Very often it takes an hour and a half before one gets through to the person one is phoning.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is looking into the telephone service in Tallaght it might be no harm if he had a glance at the postal service at the same time. I get my post any time between 12.30 and 1.30 p.m. in the day.  I live less than two miles from the new town of Tallaght and nine miles from the centre of the city.  This service is not good enough for 1972.  For too long we have been far too quiet in this area. This new satellite town houses over 20,000 people and they are entitled to know what the plans are for the provision of a better postal and telephone service.  There is no word about a sorting office.  This is something we should have.  We should also know the location because, as development takes place, essential services are not being provided and by the time the Department get around to deciding on a sorting office or an exchange the most suitable sites will have been built on.</P>
    <P>With regard to television, there are many very good programmes on television, programmes which do not get as wide a viewing as they would were they shown at a more suitable hour. Many people have spoken to me about the change in the news, both about the new timing and the extended programme. I think people preferred the old style news programme.  It is not that they are against change, but they do not think this change has been for the better.  The programme tries to cover too much.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> Again, the &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; programme should be shown at an earlier hour in the evening.  People enjoy this programme. but they do not think the time of showing is the best time.  The programme would command a wider audience if it were shown earlier in the evening and it might have widespread beneficial results.</P>
    <P>We have some excellent news readers but they should be trained to put a little more expression into their voices when giving news of tragedy.  Very little training would be required.  Most BBC announcers when recounting tragedy give the impression of tragedy.</P>
    <P>Again, in reference to Tallaght&mdash;this is something the Minister may think does not concern his Department&mdash;very often television reception does not get through to this area.  This may not be the fault of RTE but rather the fault of the ESB.  Even if it is the fault of the ESB, the Minister should be concerned about it.  I am sure his Department have received complaints to the effect that a picture cannot be got at certain times in the evening because the current is not strong enough.</P>
    <P>There is widespread dissatisfaction with RTE Relays.  In many areas where they have received the greatest co-operation from local organisations, RTE have let them down.  These complaints go back over a long time.  Little is done to effect any improvement as they move from area to area.  Many local organisations have complained to me that they have not received fair play from RTE Relays.  Once they get into an area and get a local organisation working for them, they leave it to them completely, instead of keeping in close touch with them and getting the job done as quickly as possible.  I should be glad if the Minister would have a look at this matter because it is causing a great deal of dissatisfaction. People are held on a string for far too long, not knowing how long it will be until they get the multi-channel service.</P>

      <P>It is fortuitous that this Estimate should be before the House when we are witnessing an attempt by the Government to stifle news.  views and comment on our <Col N="204" /> national broadcasting service.  It was a sad day when we gave these powers to the Government.  The Minister's dictatorial attitude on behalf of the Government is to be deplored.  This blatant interference with news coverage, and comment, and current affairs topics, is typical of the Government who are seeking Fascist powers in our State.</P>
      <P>This is an important medium, and when the Government try to manipulate it, it is a sad day for democracy. The broadcasting service should be taken out of the control of this Parliament. It should be reviewed by an independent body.  It should be an independent body, somewhat on the lines of the BBC in London.  We all remember when the Government in Britain tried to prevent the debate on Northern Ireland.  The BBC were able to withstand and resist the pressures by Mr. Maudling on behalf of the British Government.  It was a great tribute to the director of the BBC that they could do that with impunity, knowing that it was in the public interest, and knowing that there was no danger of any action being taken against them.  In the interests of this State we should have a broadcasting service on the same lines.</P>
      <P>I would hope that one of the priorities of an alternative Government would be to see to it that these powers were taken away from any Government. If we are to have balanced views on radio and television we must not have a Minister who can fire the authority at will.  This state of affairs must be changed rapidly.  Otherwise people will lose confidence in the medium and the journalists will be demoralised.  This would be deplorable. Therefore, we should have a review of this, as a matter of urgency. The new authority should immediately tell the Government that they are unwilling to act in that capacity.  This is the only way for them to show the Government that they deplore the action taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attempt by the Government&mdash; and this is very obvious&mdash;to stop people receiving the cross-Channel services is to be deplored.  This has been done surreptitiously by the Government through RTE Relays.  They <Col N="205" /> have made it a condition that a maximum of 500 aerials may be attached to a communal aerial.  This cannot be operated as a commercial proposition. People can only be properly aware of events if they hear two points of view. They will not get that with a State-controlled television service.  They must have an alternative, and the alternative is BBC or ITV.  We can avail of those services because we are so close to Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister denied that he was preventing RTE Relays from operating in various areas in Dublin city and he has not apologised for making what seems to me to be an untrue statement.  RTE Relays have admitted that they are hampered by the Minister's directive that a maximum of 500 may be attached to one communal aerial.  Various community associations in Dublin city have expressed considerable dissatisfaction.  RTE Relays have moved into areas which they decided were their concern.  They have some arrangement with the private company working in competition with them.  Even though RTE Relays decide to instal communal aerials in certain areas, they cannot do so due to the Minister's directive.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the news on radio and the news on television are not synchronised so that people who have not got a television set could hear the news on radio at the same time.  I do not think this would cause any big problem and it would involve an economy. We should have more current affairs programmes.  Too much canned material is not in the interests of the people.  The decision to close down television on Sunday afternoons when people want to relax and watch television is deplorable.</P>
    <P>The advertisements on television are out of proportion to the programmes. I was in the United States and I saw there communities of 63,000 people with their own television station.  They can provide a proper service, with local programmes, without anything like the same proportion of advertisements. That makes me wonder whether RTE are top-heavy, and are the expenses unjustified, and are they <Col N="206" /> giving good value for the amount of money poured into the service.</P>
    <P>I resent, as do many people, the advertisement aimed at TV spongers. It is a reflection on the citizens.  The advertisement is taken as meaning that the majority do not pay the licence fee.  I should like to know how this advertisement was selected and how the term &ldquo;spongers&rdquo; was decided on. Why should a fleet of cars be employed for the purpose of discovering the few defaulters?</P>
    <P>There are many people who do not pay the licence fee because of the fact that they are destitute and do not come within the category of old age pensioners. There are crippled, bed-ridden people who are destitute and whose only means of retaining their sanity is to watch television.  These people cannot afford to pay the licence fee.  This is a fact that should be borne in mind. This advertisement is irritating and offensive and should be withdrawn. There is an obligation on the Minister to tell us who pays for the fleet of cars depicted in this advertisement which gives the impression that the vast majority of people do not pay the licence fee.  Everyone interviewed by the &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; shakes his head to indicate &ldquo;no&rdquo;, when asked if he has a television licence.  This may encourage people not to pay the licence fee. It may have the reverse effect of what is desired.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible affliction on persons to be confined to the RTE channel but those who are so restricted should be provided with proper reception.  There is no provision whereby motor cyclists must use suppressors in order to prevent distortion of reception.  The Minister should consider this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister boasts of our telephone service and compares it with the services in Spain and Portugal, countries which are not the most advanced in western Europe.  The telephone service is deplorable.  Even the service provided in this House is deplorable.  I have made repeated complaints about it, to no avail.</P>
    <P>Companies are hampered in their business because of the bad telephone <Col N="207" /> service.  In view of the increased competition consequent on our entry to the EEC it is absolutely essential that companies should have an adequate telephone service.  Urgent attention should be given to this matter.  Too often phones are out of order for days.  There is no rebate for a period during which the phone is out of order.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the Minister's speech to increases in charges but these increases will come about by ministerial order when the House will not have a chance to discuss them.  The existing phone charges are exorbitant and people receive bills which cannot be justified.  Despite complaint, there is no redress.  People should get value for money and satisfactory service.</P>
    <P>There is a long waiting list for telephones. There are people who are unable to continue in business because they have moved to new premises where they cannot get a phone.  I know of one person who has to maintain a house as well as an office because the phone is in the house and otherwise he would not have one. This is not an isolated case.  There are over 25,000 people in Dublin city awaiting telephones.  This does not indicate vision or forward planning on the part of the Department.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of the inability of the Department to provide internal phones, which could be a lucrative source of revenue.  I was told that it would take eight months to order the phones.  This is a reflection on the Department.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is responsible for the inordinate delay in providing a PABX system for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The postal charges are higher than they are in Britain.  The Minister may decide to increase them by ministerial order, thus throwing a tremendous burden on companies who are already bearing the burden of taxation and other expenses.  The Minister envisages increasing the charges but will not give us details.  It is deplorable that the Minister can do this without reference to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> The services are bad and there has been no proper study as to how they could be improved and provided at proper cost.  I cannot get a proper postal service to my house.  Lately, because I have complained directly and have tabled a question on the matter, I find the post coming in time. I could never receive the Dáil Order Paper until the day following its issue. It arrived too late in the morning. This is bad having regard to the fact that there is a sorting office less than half a mile away.  This cause of complaint has persisted over four or five years.  All sorts of pretexts are used.</P>
    <P>The people in the industrial estate at Jamestown Road, Inchicore have been complaining consistently about the postal delivery service.  I have tabled a question on this matter.  It is something that the Minister must take account of because business people cannot begin work in the morning until they have their mail.  We are living in a highly competitive age when it is of vital importance to have efficient services generally.  It is not good enough to be given the excuse that because of an unusually heavy load or because of shortage of men, it is not possible to get mail out on time.  Since there are no deliveries on Saturdays, efforts should be made to put extra men on the job on Mondays.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of complaints regarding franking machines.  These machines are used by business houses in the interests of speed and efficiency but the conditions and regulations applying to the machines impose a great burden on business people in sorting the mail so as to ensure that it is delivered to particular post offices. There should be some relaxation of the regulations in this respect.</P>
    <P>A matter that I have raised here before but which I have been asked to raise again concerns the post office facilities at Ballyfermot.  During the years this question has been used as a political football.  When complaints were made regarding the non-availability of a telegraph service from the post office at Ballyfermot the excuse given by the various Ministers of the day was that there was a telephone kiosk outside from which <Col N="209" /> anyone could send a telegram.  We all know the difficulties that can arise in this respect and there is also the fact that telegrams very often are sent at abnormal hours.  Telegrams should not have to be sent by way of a public telephone kiosk and I fail to see why a proper post office cannot be provided in what we might call a township because Ballyfermot has a population of more than 40,000 people.  Its population is greater than that of either Galway or Waterford. It is not good enough that the only services provided are in a huckster's shop where people must queue for the various services.  There is another post office three miles away at the other end of Ballyfermot but it, too, is inadequate.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, too often Fianna Fáil Ministers refuse to take action in respect of certain matters simply because they are raised by Opposition members.  This is a pity because when we bring up various matters we are not seeking any political kudos.  We raise these matters because the people whom we represent ask us to do so.  Fianna Fáil representatives have the same right.  At any rate, I ask the Minister to ensure that adequate post office facilities are made available in Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>Now that we are approaching the end of the year I would ask the Minister to consider changing the format of the telephone directory.  Much difficulty is experienced in trying to follow the instructions in the green pages.  In the past I thought I was unusually dense in this regard because the Minister seemed to think that the instructions were very simple.  However, I have compared our directory with the British directories and have found that in our case the directory leaves much to be desired.  The instructions are not explicit. One must wade through them in order to find the code for a particular area.  They are categorised by code number and not by area.  For instance, if I wish to ascertain what is the code number for Wexford, I must look through the code numbers instead of being able to look down an alphabetical list.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> On page 1 of these green explanatory pages emergency services should be listed in very bold type.  I still do not know which page to look at for telegram or telephone inquiries and this is the sort of information people usually need in a hurry.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the directory inquiries line should be engaged almost constantly.  The same goes for most of the inquiry lines.  It should not require any great effort on the part of officials to devise more simplified explanatory pages.</P>
    <P>In regard to directory inquiries, I wonder what kind of system operates in the relevant office.  If I am in London and wish to phone, I ask for a number and get it almost immediately but if I phone directory inquiries in Dublin I get the impression that the official finds it necessary to go through books before finding the number in the phone book.  It should be possible to subdivide the book into sections so that the number can be found at a glance.  There must be much more emphasis on efficiency.  Any recommendations that we make here are based on complaints that we receive from our constituents.  I ask the Minister to take note of these particular points.</P>
    <P>Regarding the savings section of the Post Office I would not think that any great effort has been made since I raised this matter last.  There is a need for fresh ideas in that section. For instance, it would be a worthwhile innovation to allow the use of special cheques by people who have deposits with the Post Office.  If some effort is not made in this direction, building societies and other organisations will succeed in attracting the bulk of savings.  The Post Office Savings Branch can be a very lucrative source of revenue to the Government but it must be able to complete with other organisations.  Instead of postal orders it would be very useful to issue cheques to depositors.  A greater effort should be made to encourage small savers to invest in the Post Office. Perhaps the Department would consider the provision of lectures, even weekly, to school children on the advantages of saving.  This would <Col N="211" /> greatly encourage saving.  The Minister should ask his Department to consider this possibility.</P>
    <P>One will find very few public telephones in working order.  I know there is considerable vandalism.  I saw a bus conductor being viciously attacked and when I rushed to a telephone box to call the Garda I found there was no telephone in it.  A few weeks ago I saw a scene which should have been photographed.  I saw a man from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs assiduously polishing the little brass handle on a telephone box which had no telephone inside.  I do not know why the Department cannot have its own small force of inspectors to go around the city.  The savings to the Department could be enormous.  I know vandalism cannot be eliminated completely but it could be reduced.</P>
    <P>A circular should be sent to schools emphasising the importance of public telephones and how they can save a life at night.  A circular like this read out by teachers would make children respect telephones and understand how they can be used in emergencies and why they must be operating satisfactorily. I was successful in explaining this in a particular case.  The son of a patient of mine was caught damaging a telephone.  I talked to him about it.  I told him that if I had not got the call about his mother, if the telephone had been broken by him or by his colleagues, his mother could have died.  He said: &ldquo;I never realised this&rdquo;. This sort of thing should be explained to children at school.  Vandalism accounts for a tremendous loss to the Department and the only way we can help to curb it is by trying to educate children in schools.  A circular would be well worthwhile, coupled with a force of inspectors who would be specially on the alert for high risk areas.  These areas should be kept under surveillance.  This matter should also be explained to community associations and it might be a good idea to recruit their help.</P>
    <P>What I have said has been intended as constructive criticism.  I hope the <Col N="212" /> Minister will take my suggestion into consideration.</P>

      <P>This has been a fairly extensive debate.  It has been prolonged by the panic reaction of the Government in recent weeks.  I am not a great supporter of RTE programmes or RTE feature programmes as a whole.  With some I agree and with some I do not.  It is extremely regrettable that one of our best commentators&mdash;to my knowledge a very honourable man&mdash;should find himself in the position in which he is at present.  I refer to Mr. Kevin O'Kelly.  He was simply doing his job as a journalist.  I presume he was detailed to interview Seán Mac Stiofáin by some overhead authority.  He did not go out to do so himself.  The treatment that has been meted out to him is nothing short of outrageous.  I am a professional man in another sphere and I know that in all professions you must be loyal and true to the principles which motivate you.  I am not a journalist but I know that it is a code of honour with journalists never to transmit to the public where they get their information.  If that code were broken, it is only natural that journalists would not get information they seek.  I have been in public life in Ireland for a good many years and I can truthfully say that I have never found an Irish journalist who has betrayed his trust, as far as I was concerned, in anything.  The treatment meted out to Mr. Kevin O'Kelly is outrageous and nothing else.  I am informed that the courts were in the position that they had to, when he refused to give information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Government are responsible for taking panic action and, as this took place in RTE, I think I am entitled to refer to it.  However, with respect to you, Sir, I will say no more about it.  I have made my protest and I think many other Deputies have made it here before me.</P>
      <P>May I say that I am not entirely enamoured of the programmes on Telefís Éireann.  They have devoted far too much time to violence.  If somebody starts throwing stones or breaking windows the television cameras are on the spot.  If there is a youth riot the television cameras are on the spot. There are many decent people in this country doing decent acts, doing acts of charity such as charity walks.  The television cameras never take them, only the acts of violence, because they are supposed to be &ldquo;hot&rdquo; news.  They have been largely responsible, in my opinion, for keeping too much before the public eye, possibly with the intention of showing the political injustice in this country, what has been going on over the Border in Northern Ireland all the time.  They probably did so with the idea of creating a sympathetic outlook towards Ireland and our national aspirations, whatever they may be, and they have had the contrary effect.  Anyone who goes abroad knows that there is a growing opinion abroad that Ireland as a whole is in a state of chaos and disruption.  We may well be heading in that direction, I do not know, but I do know that one of the functions of RTE is to create a good image of Ireland abroad and I say without hesitation that they have not done so.</P>
      <P>I shall leave television and all dangerous subjects in which we find ourselves mixed up with the Department of Justice and the courts.  I am not supposed to say anything about those things, particularly in this debate, so I shall leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt the telephone service is a disaster and is becoming a greater disaster day by day because successive <Col N="214" /> Governments&mdash;the Minister smiles; if he spent as much time trying to get a call through as I do he would not smile&mdash;have failed to plan ahead.  The trunk lines have been overloaded because insufficient money has been provided to install an adequate service. The Minister for Lands, who is here now, was in Strasbourg at the same time as I was there.  He knows that if you take up a phone in Strasbourg you can get on to Paris straight away. If I phone London from Ireland I can get through; if I phone a neighbouring town or village in my constituency I have to share the line with a continuous jazz band sound all the time.  That results from overloading trunk lines.  If the necessary capital had been provided, this would not arise.  Our spokesmen very ably pointed out the other day how the service is endeavouring to exist on day-to-day income.  Until some Minister for Posts and Telegraphs ceases to allow this Department to be the cinderella of Departments and gets sufficient money from the Government to provide a proper telephone service, the same situation will persist.</P>
    <P>Thousands of people are waiting for telephones.  I appreciate that we may not have the techniques, the materials or the trained personnel to install telephones but I think the real reason is that the Department are going slow in the matter because they know that, if they add extra telephones to the existing system, it will mean disaster for existing subscribers.</P>
    <P>For the past five or six years anybody who gets a telephone has to pay down a huge sum.  One is told that is the capital expenditure or outlay and that they will ultimately get the money back provided they do not give up the telephones.  The fact is that this is a means of borrowing revenue for the Department.  People are paying seven years in advance.  This system exists for at least seven years and it means that all the money that should belong to, say 1972 has already been spent beforehand; it was borrowed seven years ahead.  I know of people who have been asked to pay outrageous sums for a telephone.  They are told that if they put down something like £200 they can have a telephone <Col N="215" /> straight away and that this is for technical costs.  It is nothing of the sort; it is borrowed revenue.  The Department is living on borrowed revenue.</P>
    <P>The appointment of sub-postmasters is one of the most controversial matters in the country and is also one of the most unsatisfactory.  Some years ago there was a tremendous fracas over what happened in Baltinglass and the inter-Party Government of the day were hounded to death for what they did.  The result was that the sea-green incorruptibles, the Fianna Fáil Party, the fountain of all the corruption that ever was in the political arena, came into power and appointed a commission. A commission is a cloak for every sort of political subterfuge ever conceived from the days of Machiavelli to the present day.  This commission was supposed to see fair play for postmasters.  Quite a few years ago in my constituency there was a sub post office installed.  There was a lady who had worked for years in the business and she was able to get premises and she was able to work the telephone.  This meant there need be no extra cost in removing the telephone. This was one of the earlier efforts of the commission set up by the Fianna Fáil Government but they slipped up rather badly.  They gave the sub post office to a public licensed premises which, I think, is against the regulations.  Then the disaster happened. They discovered it was against the law for this leading Fianna Fáil gentleman to get the office.  Actually, they had to knock a hole in the wall and provide a second door so that there would be a separate entrance for people going into the post office so that they would not infringe the regulations by walking through public house premises to utilise the postal services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I am right.  I am simply explaining the situation to stress my point that this sea-green incorruptible commission is only another disaster.  I submit that some other form of selection of sub-postmasters should be devised.  I understand sub-postmasters are pensionable&mdash;I hope they are; I know they have an organisation now to look after their affairs&mdash;and I do not see why they should not rank as ordinary civil servants.  When a postal vacancy arises and when people in the existing service who, to my mind are civil servants, sometimes apply for the post, they do not succeed.  A sub-post-mastership is not an ordinary promotion on merit or anything like that. I have known quite a number of cases where very efficient people, who have been ruled out by the sea-green incorruptible commission which appoints the local hack, whoever he may be, the fellow who has served his party loyally and well but possibly to the detriment of the public as a whole. I am sure he can read and write but that is probably the only knowledge he has of post office work, so far as I know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is the cinderella service of the Government.  It has always been assigned to a junior Minister who is left to carry the baby.  If ever a Minister carried a baby it is the the present Minister.  He has probably got the hardest knock of any Minister in that, apparently, he got orders from the head of the Government, with the consent of the Government, to perform this great act of democracy&mdash;I think those were the words used by the head of the present Government&mdash;in throwing out the entire authority.  I think, politically speaking, the authority were a fair bag, belonging to all political parties with some not belonging to any political party.  Some of them I knew, some I did not know, but they <Col N="217" /> seemed to be people of high erudition, perfectly capable of deciding whether the general policy was right or not.</P>
    <P>I do not think they could honestly be held responsible for what happened with regard to interviews and so on.  To take the parallel situation in relation to journalism, the directors of a newspaper cannot be responsible for what appears in that newspaper unless they read it from cover to cover before it is published about 3 a.m.  Therefore, I feel that the directors of the authority could not be responsible for everything that happened and it seems to me to be rather summary justice that the whole lot should be kicked out overnight.</P>
    <P>As to the people, the sort of mixum-gatherum group, who have been put in there now, is there any one who knows the first thing about broadcasting?  Is there any one member who would have a high standard of culture or erudition?  If they have, I am not aware of it.  In fact it was a great surprise to all of them when they were appointed, which shows that this Government are panicking. These people seem to have been appointed, so far as I hear, on a telephone call and some of them were appointed as a matter of hearsay from outside&mdash;they did not even know they were going to get the job&mdash;so that it seems that there must have been some very rapid, muddled and panicky thinking on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>Appointment to the RTE Authority is an important appointment and, although in many spheres of life people are appointed to directorships who may not have a specialised knowledge, generally speaking people are chosen who have something to do with the arts and sciences, possibly with education and even with a political background.  It is true that there is one ex-politician on it but I do not think he has a very strong political background.  He may have for all I know, but it seems to me that this was a hasty choice, that the Minister went on the phone&mdash;provided he was able to get the number and he was lucky if he was, but he probably told them he was the Minister <Col N="218" /> and it was easier for him to get through than for anybody else&mdash;and told these people.  Some of them acknowledged that they were not even told, that they first heard it from hearsay outside.</P>
    <P>I do not know for what term these people have been appointed, whether they are a temporary expedient to get the Government over the difficulties in which they now find themselves. We seem to run from one political crisis to another in this country, and I am afraid that we will have continuing political crises so long as the Minister and his colleagues sit on those benches.  This Dáil came into existence in 1969 and I do not think we have ever been free of a crisis since.  We now seem to have a television crisis which is slightly different from the others but is ultimately leading us into a major crisis which started under the aegis of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Having said all these hard things about the Department, I want to thank the officials for the courtesy they have shown me.  They always answer my letters with civility and in most cases do what they can for me. The Minister, I feel, has done his best to be courteous to Opposition Deputies and probably to all Deputies but he is in an impossible situation because he has been used as a guinea pig by the Government just the same as Mr. Kevin O'Kelly has been used as a guinea pig by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Esmonde that we are in a critical situation at present and that recent events have focussed attention on television, the authority and indeed the media, as they are called generally, in a very particular way.  Later on this afternoon, further attention will be directed to the use or abuse of means of communication.  In general, I must say that, like Deputy Esmonde, I have found the Department and its officials extremely efficient and I think the House should realise that in a situation where the capital expenditure in the country as a whole has risen dramatically in recent years and where the demands, particularly in <Col N="219" /> fields like education, have become so enormous, there is very considerable competition among the Departments for what each Minister would regard as his fair share of the common pool.</P>
      <P>The capital costs involved in providing an efficient service in the Post Office are enormously high and this should be appreciated by the House. There is also the fact that continual and quite considerable shifts in population from the rural to the urban areas and internally within the urban areas cause a considerable strain on the resources of a Department which requires such heavy capitalisation.  All in all, against this background, I think the Department and the Minister in particular have kept up with the solution of the problems as well as could be expected, for these problems are continually changing, becoming more complex and more expensive to resolve.</P>
      <P>I must say that it is a considerable irritant to find two or three people talking continuously on the telephone and eventually jamming the lines, and that you get a situation where you cannot make a call for anything up to two hours while you can hear conversations going on among people who are being told by the exchange that if they will be kind enough to leave the telephone down, the line will be cleared and normal use of the system by customers can be resumed.  I have had this experience in my house on a number of occasions in recent times.  I am not sure whether Clontarf is a particularly bad area from that point of view, but it does give the lie to the Dublinman who said that nothing very much happened in Clontarf since the famous battle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where overseas telephone communication is concerned, there has been a very considerable improvement in recent times and the facility of being able to dial London, Manchester and other cities direct and very cheaply is one which is greatly appreciated by business people in particular but also by all who for one reason or another wish to get in touch with people overseas. In this country the vast preponderance of overseas calls are made to cities in <Col N="220" /> Britain.  There is a vast preponderance of commercial, industrial and other contacts which people in this country wish to maintain.  I have found this facility of considerable use and appreciate the fact that it is being continually expanded.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remarks made by Deputy Esmonde about the decision of the Government to remove the RTE Authority, I shall leave this matter to be dealt with by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  In anticipation of anything he might say I feel that I should not refer to it at all, beyond saying that I do not accept that the Government panicked, as Deputy Esmonde says.  The Government were not in a panic situation.  They were in a situation where they had given several days' notice to the authority, and they and the members of the Government had plenty of time for reflection. It is not at all true to say that there was any element of panic at the time when the ultimate decision to remove the authority was taken.</P>
    <P>It is obviously true that the members of the new authority were appointed in unusual circumstances. The circumstances were unusual inasmuch as the Government did not desire to have a hiatus situation when there would not be any statutory authority at all.  Therefore, having made the decision to remove the existing authority they desired to have them replaced.  This obviously necessitated a different procedure from that which would normally obtain.  Normally the date of expiry of appointment of any particular member of the authority, or of all the members, would be well-known in advance and the normal courtesies would be observed with regard to reappointment, adequate notice having been given to each person of the intention to reappoint, if this was the case, and involving a request that he or she should serve a further term.  Obviously in the circumstances on this occasion and because of the desire not to have a hiatus situation, these normal procedures could not be adopted.  Instead, each of the potential members of the authority had to be contacted by the speediest method, namely, the telephone, <Col N="221" /> and asked if he was willing to serve.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that the news that they were being asked to serve on the new RTE Authority could have come as a surprise to some of the appointees.  This was an unavoidable situation and when the new members had accepted it was necessary to announce that fact with a minimum of delay so as to keep the RTE Authority functioning on a continuous basis.  The Government believed that this was obviously desirable and certainly better than leaving the service without any authority at all, even for a short period.  Incidentally, as regards the personnel of the new authority, I can only say that so far as I am concerned I regard them as being thoroughly competent and fair-minded people.  I am sure that the Minister himself will echo my sentiments in this regard.  I am confident that they will discharge their functions with credit to themselves and to the authority.</P>
    <P>There was no evidence of panic or haste on behalf of the Government but, on the contrary, there was a fully considered and fully-deliberated decision.  Some people have reacted very violently to it.  Some of the reactions of Deputies in the course of this extraordinarily protracted debate have been rather violent.  In my opinion they are unjustified.</P>

      <P>As one who has criticised RTE on numerous occasions I would now like to take part in this debate.  I do not believe in the heavy-handed action of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The Minister for Lands has spoken and said that the Government did not panic and that the action taken was not taken in haste.  In this particular instance I believe that the Government have panicked and their action certainly bears all the signs of something done in haste.  Even the leading article in <i>The Irish Press,</i> Fianna Fáil's own paper, on the 25th November condemned the Government for their heavy-handed action in sacking those particular people.  A Member of this House, Deputy de Valera, son of our <Col N="222" /> distinguished President, is managing director of this paper and he in his leading article on Saturday, 25th November, condemned the Government for their heavy-handed action in sacking the authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The British Government's proposal to hold a plebiscite in Northern Ireland and my views on the matter have been very widely publicised.  Interested Governments and international organisations are well aware of the position.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government keep the effectiveness of our information services under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is peculiar behaviour, to say the least of it, for one sovereign Government to propose within what they claim as their domain a question affecting the responsibility of another sovereign Government without consulting with that other sovereign Government on the matter?  I take it the Taoiseach agrees with that expression of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a very interesting and, I would consider, a very good point in the second part of his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach give an indication of the time at which he first learned of the particular question proposed?  I am not concerned with the statement made last March, but I am concerned with when the British Government gave any subsequent clear indication of their intention to carry through the generalised promise of last March into a legislative form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very hard at this remove to remember exactly when.  I know that within a day or so of the announcement of the terms of reference our Ambassador received an intimation of their content. When I say &ldquo;terms of reference&rdquo;, I mean the questions to be put.  Our Ambassador received information of their content as a matter of courtesy and almost at once he passed that on here.  I got a draft <Col N="224" /> some hours before their announcement. I think the first clear indication of the British Government's intent to go through with the plebiscite was the introduction of the Bill in Parliament recently.  I had been given no specific indication before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that what began four years ago as a campaign to obtain civil rights in Northern Ireland has, particularly as a direct consequence of British Government action, now been converted into what seems to be an international controversy between Britain and Ireland?  This being so, would the Taoiseach consider making direct and immediate representations to the organisations I mentioned, the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the European Economic Community, but particularly the Council of Europe and the United Nations, both of which exist for the purpose, amongst other things, of bringing about a friendly settlement between member nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if the subject matter of the questions put in the plebiscite would come within that definition&mdash;in other words, that a conflict of the nature that one or other of these organisations could resolve existed.  Again, as I said already, I think the Deputy has raised a very good point but, candidly, I do not believe it would be productive to bring the matter before any of these organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to deal with this question on the mathematical basis proposed by the Deputy.  I replied to a question by the Deputy on the 15th November in the course of which I indicated that the development of services at consultant out-patient level could be of great significance in reducing the demands on hospitals for acute in-patient care. Judged in relation to achieving this potential the services now provided and the way in which they are operated would fall short of the optimum in a great many cases.  This is not only a question of the physical facilities which seem to be uppermost in the Deputy's mind; he may be thinking mainly of the Dublin hospital situation in this regard.  Here the full solution of the accommodation problem is tied up with the reorganisation and concentration of hospital facilities into a smaller number of more appropriately sized units.  For example, the new St. Vincent's Hospital has an adequately sized series of out-patient consultation suites.  The interim problem of improving the physical conditions <Col N="228" /> and working arrangements in the hospital out-patient departments is one which I intend to ask the regional hospital boards to tackle as a high priority.</P>

The council's total grant from the Hospitals' Trust Fund in the current year is £147,800.  It is a matter for the Medical Research Council to decide how the total grant should be allocated but I am informed that in the current year the Council made grants totalling over £44,000 for cancer research from the moneys made available from the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  In addition, the Council made grants totalling over £17,000 this year for cancer research from funds made available to them from other sources. The Irish Cancer Society make grants for cancer research and in the year ended 30th September, 1972, these grants totalled almost £22,000, including, £4,000 to the Medical Research Council, which is part of the sum of £17,000 odd already mentioned.

      <P>Only one EEC directive on pharmaceuticals has been <Col N="230" /> adopted&mdash;that is, the directive of January, 1965, on the approximation of legislative and administrative provisions concerning proprietary medicines. This document requires the licensing for marketing of such medicines and sets out certain procedures in relation to the granting of licences. My Department has had discussions on two occasions with the EEC Commission on the implementation of the directive.  Acceding countries will have a period of 18 months from the date of accession within which to conform with the directive.</P>
      <P>The other EEC directives dealing with pharmaceuticals are at draft stage. Generally, they expand and supplement the 1965 directive and also relate to such matters as rights of establishment for manufacturers, wholesalers and retail chemists, the control of advertising and channels of retail sale. The directives do not deal specifically with prescribing.</P>
      <P>My Department has been examining these draft directives in consultation with the trade and professional interests with a view to the preparation of a request to the EEC Commission for consultation which it is expected will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>The practice is that texts of Bills as passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas are available immediately afterwards in the Government Publications Sale Office.  Evidence of the signing of Bills, is, of course, available from <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  In any case where the Minister concerned considers that an Act should be made available with special urgency, an English only version is printed and put on sale before the bilingual version.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the availability of the bilingual version of Acts.  Since, subsequent to signature by the President, each Act must be translated into Irish, some time inevitably elapses before publication of the bilingual version.  However, I am not aware that this gives rise to any general difficulty.  As regards the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971, I refer the Deputy to the reply which the Minister for Justice gave to Question No. 46 on 22nd June, 1972.</P>

The functions of planning, finance, organisation and personnel are being reorganised and strengthened in the public service generally.

      <P>I must emphasise that the Land Commission were asked to approve of the sale by the owner to a specific purchaser, who happened to be, in the opinion of the Land Commission, the most deserving of the local congests and who would in any event have been the most likely to benefit from a division of the lands in the event of their acquisition by the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 48 to 52 together.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to this institute is that the planning board in matters such as those referred to in the Deputy's Questions Nos. 48, 49, 50 and 51 is given the same degree of autonomy as is given to the authorities of a university.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate that I should seek from the planning board the type of detailed information referred to in Questions No. 48 and 50.  No doubt the board will be pleased to supply the Deputy with information in regard to entry and other requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the acceptance of Montessori-trained teachers for recognition on the teaching staffs of national schools has been considered by my Department on a number of occasions.  It was found that the nature and type of their training is not such as to equip them suitably to teach in ordinary national schools. They may be recognised, however, as teachers in national schools in which special education is provided for children who are mildly mentally handicapped or who are emotionally disturbed; and a number of them are, in fact, serving in such schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want first to say that there were a number of typographical errors in my opening statement which had already been printed which had to be corrected.  The corrected version has not yet reached the House but I understand it will be here in five to ten minutes and will then be circulated to Deputies.</P>
      <P>In the two days since this Bill was published it has attracted a good deal of comment.  Against the background of what has been and is being alleged, I will begin by saying the following:</P>
      <P>First: The Bill does not&mdash;I repeat not&mdash;transfer to a defendant the onus of proving that he is innocent, or the onus of proving anything at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly: It does not provide, or mean, that just because a senior Garda officer testifies to his belief that a person is a member of an illegal organisation, the courts must convict unless the defendant proves him wrong.  The court need not convict <Col N="263" /> even if the defendant adduces no evidence at all, let alone convincing evidence to counter the Garda officer's testimony.  What the Bill provides is that the officer's testimony will be admissible evidence and, as with any evidence tendered to the court, it will be for the court to determine what weight is to be attached to it in the light of all the circumstances of the particular case.</P>
    <P>Thirdly: It does not impose any prohibitions on newspapers, radio or television reporting, or any other reporting, that are not in the law already; and what it provides, in relation to statements likely or intended to interfere with the course of justice, is no more than a statutory restatement of part of the existing law governing contempt of court.</P>
    <P>Fourthly: It does not provide, or mean, that a casual bystander or innocent onlooker at a meeting that is intended to interfere with the judicial process will be committing an offence, and this is so, and emphatically so, for the simple reason that, as part of the criminal law, the relevant provision is subject to the ordinary&mdash;and in this instance, I should say, elementary and fundamental&mdash;rule that a necessary ingredient in a criminal offence, and an ingredient that must be proved by the prosecution, is guilty intent or <i>mens rea</i> as it is called, unless the particular statute otherwise provides. And this is so fundamental that it is neither necessary nor possible to keep on restating it in Bills and to restate it in particular cases would only imply that it was not applicable in others, which in fact it is.</P>
    <P>It is a strange commentary on the times in which we live, and on the abdication of responsibility by a number of people who should know better, that little more than 48 hours after a Government Bill designed to deal with a grave situation has been published, it should be necessary for me, as promoter of the Bill, to come into this House and to begin by trying to catch up with some of the erroneous, not to say irresponsible, statements that have gained currency.</P>
    <P>We have heard quite a good deal in <Col N="264" /> recent days about free speech.  I would invite the House to consider what free speech is supposed to mean in the eyes of some of its defenders.  In an editorial criticising this Bill in <i>The Irish Times</i> of yesterday 28th November the following appeared:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Mr. O'Malley will have a good start as far as the Dublin newspapers are concerned. The National Union of Journalists has decided on a 24-hour stoppage commencing at 8 a.m. today.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  The Bill was published on Monday, without comment from me.  The evening papers had it on Monday and the dailies yesterday&mdash;several editorials were written on it.  Today, Wednesday, is my first opportunity to speak on the Bill and the daily papers will be back tomorrow and so will be able to comment on what I have said, if they so wish.  What then, precisely, is meant by my being given a good start?  I suggest that this House has an interest in noting the only meaning it can possibly have, and that is that the 24-hour stoppage by the union has meant that there has been that much less time for certain gentlemen to misrepresent the facts and to try to whip up hysteria before I, today, get the chance to come into this House and speak on the Bill. It is time that people, and especially Members of this House, take note of what is happening, as disclosed by this clearly-revealed wish that the public should be brainwashed before they are to be allowed to hear the facts.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend and strengthen the law dealing with unlawful organisations so as to enable more effective action to be taken in respect of membership and activities of such organisations.  Experience has shown that there are serious defects in the existing law on this subject, particularly in so far as concerns proof of membership.  Deputies will recall that I dealt with this matter at some length in this House on 16th December last on the motion for the Adjournment.  I referred on that occasion to the allegations then being made, and frequently repeated since, that not enough is being done to deal with people who hold themselves out <Col N="265" /> to be members of unlawful organisations. I spelled out in detail the very real difficulties under the law as it stands and I regret to have to recall that on that occasion I was shouted down by some Deputies opposite&mdash; so much so in fact that Deputy Desmond interjected more than once to say that I should be allowed to continue what I had to say.  I returned to the subject again on the occasion of the debate on the Estimates for my Department on 12th April, 1972.</P>
    <P>The problem is that we have people who are self-confessed leaders and members of unlawful organisations but who, under the existing rules of evidence, cannot, save in exceptional circumstances, be convicted.  I want at this point to make it clear that when I talk of unlawful organisations, I am not confining my remarks simply to the IRA in its different variations but I am including also organisations based in the Six Counties which are clearly unlawful under section 18 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939.  These people have been able to broadcast their activities and propagate their beliefs and objectives in a way which has caused grave concern to our own people and to peoples in other countries whose attention has been increasingly focussed on Irish affairs in recent years.  The duty of the Government in this situation is clear and beyond question.  If the existing law is inadequate to enable the community to protect itself against those who are dedicated to the overthrow of the democratic institutions of the State, including this Parliament, then the Government must seek to have the law amended in such a way as to make it adequate.</P>
    <P>Nobody should be under any illusion about the true nature of the problem with which this Bill is designed to deal.  The men of violence at whom the Bill is aimed are the enemies of society.  These people like to represent themselves in glowing terms as the heroes and martyrs of a holy war waged in the name of what they call patriotism.  The reality is very different, very ugly and very sordid.  The gospel of these people is a gospel of hatred and malice, and their only language is the language of <Col N="266" /> physical force.  The citizens of Dublin saw in no uncertain way last weekend how that brand of &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; finds expression in the maiming of the innocent and the wreaking of indiscriminate destruction on property.</P>
    <P>The issue raised by the existence and activities of these unlawful organisations is stark and fundamental.  The issue is whether we are to be ruled by the democratically elected Government and Parliament of this country or by a small unrepresentative and self-appointed group who, without any semblance of a mandate from the electorate, have arrogated to themselves the right to carry on a campaign of violence and bloodshed, and to dictate the policies to be pursued, in the name of the Irish people.  What we as a community now have to decide&mdash;and specifically what the Members of this House have to decide&mdash;is whether our affairs are to be conducted according to policies decided on by the elected Government and Parliament or whether we are to succumb to conditions of anarchy and mob rule in which a minority that has organised itself into private armies can terrorise and impose its will on the law-abiding majority.</P>
    <P>The policies and methods of the men of violence are rejected by the overwhelming majority of the people of this country as well as, I believe, by the overwhelming majority of the Members of this House.  I think I am correctly interpreting the mood of our people when I say that they have more than enough both of the threats and of the actions of the members of these subversive groups.  Unfortunately the Government's efforts to put an end to the activities of these elements have been increasingly frustrated by the defects in the existing law to which I have already referred.  That is why this Bill is necessary and that is the background against which I now ask the Members of this House to examine calmly and rationally the changes in the law which the Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the detailed provisions. The purpose of section 2 is to strengthen the hands of the Garda in their investigation of certain serious <Col N="267" /> criminal offences which are, for the time being, scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the Offences against the State Act, 1939.  These include offences relating to malicious damage, explosives, firearms, <i>et cetera.</i> The section deals with the situation where a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence which is a scheduled offence is being or was committed at a particular place.  At the time of the offence or soon afterwards, he finds a person at or near the place of the offence.  The member has reasonable grounds for believing that that person knows that the offence is being committed or knew at that time that it was being committed. The section enables the member, after informing the person of his belief, to demand of the person his name and address and an account of his recent movements.  If the person concerned fails or refuses to give the information, or gives information which is false or misleading, he will be guilty of an offence punishable as mentioned in the section.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable that a person found in such circumstances should be under a legal duty to help the Garda by giving his name and address and an account of his recent movements.  The situation to which this section relates is, as the terms of the section make clear, a serious one and one in which, in my view, every law-abiding citizen would not only be willing but anxious to assist the Garda Síochána in their duty to apprehend persons responsible for serious crime.  The section involves a minimal interference with personal liberty, an interference which, I suggest, is not only justified but necessary if the Garda Síochána are to discharge the duties which the community expect them to discharge.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is designed to facilitate the proof of a charge of being a member of an unlawful organisation contrary to section 21 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  It is not necessary to argue again the harm done to this country by the existence and activities of these organisations or the importance of bringing their members to justice.  But difficulties <Col N="268" /> have consistently arisen in that persons who are in fact members&mdash;and, indeed, important members&mdash;of an organisation cannot be convicted of the offence because not enough admissible evidence is available to prove their membership beyond reasonable doubt.  This may be the situation even though the fact that they are members is well-known to their associates, to the police and even to the general public.  Most of these people are, of course, content, and even proud, that their membership should be widely known, but at the same time they and their advisers take care to avoid&mdash; and have for the most part been successful in avoiding&mdash;going so far as to provide what they recognise would be admissible evidence to convict them of the offence.</P>
    <P>The section seeks to remedy this situation by means of two provisions for the admissibility of evidence of membership.  The first&mdash;in subsection (1) (a)&mdash;provides that any statement or conduct of the accused implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was a member of an unlawful organisation at a material time shall be evidence that he was a member at that time.  So far, the subsection is in accordance with the ordinary common law rules of evidence.  A person's conduct speaks for itself and may be proved in evidence both in civil and in criminal cases and inferences may be drawn from it.  As far as statements are concerned, an admission by an accused person&mdash;like that of a party to civil proceedings&mdash;is evidence against him, the reason being the obvious one that what a person has said against himself is likely to be true.  What is new is the provision in paragraph (b), which defines &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; for the purpose of the subsection as including an omission by the accused to deny published reports that he was a member.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to note that this definition is applicable only in the context and for the purposes of paragraph (a) and it follows that an omission to deny such reports is to be evidence only if the omission was such as to imply or lead to a reasonable inference that the accused was, in fact, a member.  If the accused has not seen <Col N="269" /> or heard of the reports, obviously his failure to deny them will have no significance. Again, he may think it best to ignore a false report in order to avoid drawing further attention to himself or simply because he is unwilling to take the trouble to deny it.  But a moment's thought will show that there are some reports which any reasonable person would naturally deny if they were false, as when a respectable person is reported to be acting dishonestly or in any other manner which he himself would regard as reprehensible.  In such a case his omission to deny the report will ordinarily, as a matter of common sense, imply or lead people to infer that the report is true.  This principle applies with particular force to the offences under consideration, for there are some people who have been so often referred to in published reports as being prominent members, or holders of important offices, in unlawful organisations that they must be regarded, by reason of their failure to deny the reports, as holding themselves out as being members.</P>
    <P>This is the principle which underlies the provision in paragraph (b) and, in the Government's view, amply justifies it.  If anybody to whom the paragraph would apply should fear that he might suffer injustice because of a false report, his remedy is to deny the report, though the paragraph takes care to add that a denial shall not by itself be conclusive, since the denial may be purely formal and such that nobody could give it any credence.</P>
    <P>If, for instance, a person is regularly invited to give in detail the views of an illegal organisation on some statement issued by the Government five minutes previously, a formal denial that he speaks for those for whom he is obviously speaking is hardly likely to carry any weight.</P>
    <P>The second provision to which I have referred is in subsection (2) of section 3.  The effect is that if a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of chief superintendent, in giving evidence in proceedings for the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation, states that he believes that the accused was at a <Col N="270" /> material time a member of such an organisation, the statement will be admitted as evidence of membership. This subsection extends the common law rules of evidence, under which a witness's opinion as to a fact is admissible evidence to prove the fact only in certain circumstances&mdash;in particular, in the case of an expert witness. But in the view of the Government the provision is justified because of the evil against which the law as to membership of an unlawful organisation is directed and because there will be no possible danger that an innocent person will suffer injustice as a result of the provision.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the realities of the situation, the fact that a senior officer has formed the opinion that the accused was a member of the organisation, and the fact moreover that the officer is prepared to swear to his belief in court, make it virtually certain that the accused was indeed a member.  His opinion may be wrong but there are complete safeguards. First, the defence will be able to cross-examine the officer as to the grounds for his belief; and if the cross-examination shows that the officer has inadequate grounds for his belief, or if his credibility as a witness is shaken, then obviously his evidence will lose most or all of its value, and the judge would, in the exercise of his general power, direct the jury to ignore the evidence or, if there is no jury, himself ignore it.</P>
    <P>I emphasise this fundamental point because it has been suggested, wrongly, that the chief superintendent's evidence is conclusive if the defence calls no evidence and&mdash;so it is alleged&mdash; some defendants call no evidence as a matter of principle.  It is a fact that some defendants call no evidence&mdash;it is a situation where principle and expediency happen very often to coincide&mdash;but refusal to call evidence does not mean refusal to cross-examine witnesses and not only in theory but in practice the chief superintendent will be subject to cross-examination and, I have no doubt, severe cross-examination. That is how it should be. Additionally, of course, where he wishes to do so, the accused will be able to give and call evidence&mdash;if he <Col N="271" /> has any&mdash;denying his membership and it will be only if the court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was a member that it will be possible for him to be convicted.  In view of certain criticisms that have been made of the section I must emphasise that it does not&mdash;and I repeat not&mdash;alter or affect the principle that an accused person is innocent until he is proved guilty.  Moreover, the section in no way changes the rule that the prosecution has the burden of proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is a precedent for such a provision in section 26 of the 1939 Act, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Where in any criminal proceedings the question whether a particular treasonable document, seditious document, or incriminating document was or was not published by the accused (whether by himself or in concert with other persons or by arrangement between himself and other persons) is in issue and an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Chief Superintendent states on oath that he believes that such document was published (as the case may be) by the accused or by the accused in concert with other persons or by arrangement between the accused and other persons, such statement shall be evidence (until the accused denies on oath that he published such document either himself or in concert or by arrangement as aforesaid) that the accused published such document as alleged in the said statement on oath of such officer.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the argument for section 3 (1) of the Bill is that a person who deliberately remains silent in the face of false reports about his membership of an unlawful organisation is not in a position to complain of an injustice when he has the power&mdash; and some would say the duty&mdash;to avoid by denying the reports, and the argument for section 3 (2) is that it does no more than take account of the facts of the situation and could cause no injustice.  It is important to remember that a senior officer of the <Col N="272" /> Garda Síochána who gives evidence of his belief will, in the nature of things, be a man of considerable experience whose opinion will not be stated lightly.  He will be a man whose duties over a long number of years will have made him an expert on that on which he speaks.  In addition, he will by experience have had a unique training in sifting and evaluating information given to him by his colleagues or subordinates or obtained by him from other sources.  Finally, as I have already pointed out, his expertise may be tested and his credibility attacked in the cold light of cross-examination.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill makes statutory provision for the punishment of conduct constituting an interference with the course of justice.  The safeguarding of the course of justice is, as every Member of this House is well aware, vital for the survival of democracy and civilised life generally. Yet it is a remarkable fact that in recent years some people have claimed a right to interfere with the proper course of justice by statements, protest meetings and even demonstrations outside courts in order to enforce on the courts, and on the officers of the law, their own opinions as to whether particular legal proceedings are rightly instituted or as to what should be the result of the proceedings. The section declares, in sub-section (1) (a), that:</P>
    <P>Any public statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any meeting, procession or demonstration in public, that constitutes an interference with the course of justice shall be unlawful.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) (b) contains a definition of an &ldquo;interference with the course of justice&rdquo;, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A statement, meeting, procession or demonstration shall be deemed to constitute an interference with the course of justice if it is intended, or is of such a character as to be likely, directly or indirectly to influence any court, person or authority concerned with the institution, conduct or defence of any civil or criminal proceedings (including a party or <Col N="273" /> witness) as to whether or how the proceedings should be instituted, conducted, continued or defended, or as to what should be their outcome.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 4 makes it a specific offence to make any statement, or to organise, hold or take part in a meeting, procession or demonstration, which is unlawful under the section and it goes on to provide for the penalty.</P>
    <P>While the section largely speaks for itself, there are a few aspects which should be mentioned.  Firstly, a &ldquo;statement&rdquo; will be within the prohibition imposed by the section only if it is a &ldquo;public&rdquo; one, and, similarly, a &ldquo;meeting, procession or demonstration&rdquo; will be within the prohibition only if it takes place &ldquo;in public&rdquo;. Thus the section will not apply to things said in private conversation or to private gatherings.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the essence of the test laid down in paragraph (b) is that the conduct in question is intended or likely to interfere with the proper consideration, by the person or authority concerned with the proceedings, of whether or how he should institute, defend or conduct them.  The person or authority may be the Attorney General or the Garda Síochána when considering whether to institute a prosecution or civil proceedings, the judge, the jury, the officers of the courts, the parties, their legal advisers or the witnesses.  Any conduct intended or likely to prevent or discourage any of these persons from properly carrying out his duties, from putting forward or defending his interest in any way that is proper, or from telling the truth in his evidence will constitute an interference with the course of justice.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the section reenact as accurately as possible that branch of the law of contempt of court which relates to comments on a case that is <i>sub judice.</i>  Such conduct is ordinarily dealt with summarily by the court in relation to which the offence of contempt is committed.  It might therefore be asked why it is necessary to create a specific statutory offence to deal with this kind of conduct. <Col N="274" /> The answer is that the extent to which these activities have been carried on in recent years, their increasing seriousness and the fact that they are frequently planned and organised for the clear purpose of subverting justice in relation to members of unlawful organisations make it right, in the Government's view, to prevent the activities by making them the subject of a statutory offence that can be prosecuted in the ordinary way and that is punishable with suitably severe penalties.</P>
    <P>It is, moreover, right as a matter of principle that persons charged with this kind of conduct should not be left to be dealt with summarily by and on the initiative of the court concerned, which indeed may be, and often is, totally unaware of such activities, but by means of ordinary criminal proceedings.  This will mean, on the one hand, that the ordinary processes of law enforcement will apply, with the initiative being taken by the Garda Síochána where the circumstances so warrant and it will mean, on the other hand, that the prosecution will have to prove their case in the usual way and prove it beyond reasonable doubt.  However, subsection (3) provides that &ldquo;Nothing in the section shall affect the law as to contempt of court&rdquo;, because it is obviously right that it should still be possible for cases to be dealt with summarily under the present procedures, if that appears to the courts to be proper.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill is technical.  It extends the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo; in section 2 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, so as to cover some kinds of documents which are not, or may not be, within the definition in that section&mdash;which simply provides that the word &ldquo;document&rdquo; includes a book and also a newspaper, magazine or other periodical publication, and also a pamphlet, leaflet, circular, or advertisement. Section 5 of the Bill extends the definition to certain articles which in effect are of the nature of documents but which may not be regarded as such in ordinary language.  In particular, the new definition takes account <Col N="275" /> of recent inventions for the purpose of recording sounds, such as discs and tapes, or of embodying visual images, such as films and microfilms.  The definition relates to various provisions of the 1939 Act, in particular the provisions of sections 10 and 12 concerning documents emanating from unlawful organisations and treasonable or seditious documents.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, there has already been considerable speculation and comment in the news media concerning the provisions of this Bill. Much of the comment has been ill-informed. Some of it, indeed, has been palpably misleading.  I want to say that there is no threat to individual rights and freedoms in this Bill.  The proposals for amendment of the law which are contained in the Bill are essential for the protection of society and the institutions of the State.  Nobody need feel any apprehension about the provisions of the Bill except those organisations and their members who are committed to the attainment of political objectives by violent means and who want to be free to engage in activities that are dedicated to the destruction of the Parliament, Government and institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>I do not relish the task of preparing and introducing this kind of legislation at a time when there is so much other important work waiting to be done in my Department, work that would be of direct benefit to the ordinary people of the country.  I introduce this Bill, not because I want to, but because circumstances demand it, and are clearly seen to demand it, and so I ask the House to support it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing this Bill, divided his speech, if I may say so, into two parts: his justification for the <Col N="276" /> Bill, and his description of the sections in some detail.  His justification for the Bill was based on two things: first, that the present law is inadequate; and secondly, that the state of this nation at this moment requires this measure.  I agree that the state of this nation at the moment requires something to be done about it, but I disagree that it is such as to require the offensive provisions contained in this piece of legislation.  At this point in my remarks I do not want to go into the reasons why the country is in the state it is in at the moment.  I will make reference to that afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Minister complains that the present law is inadequate.  He fastens on one particular aspect of the present law to justify this sweeping measure. He makes the case that it is difficult to prove membership of an unlawful organisation.  If he were making this case a fortnight ago one might have some sympathy with him, but events have caught up with the Minister's predicament, or alleged predicament and, over the weekend, we saw that the security forces of the State had captured what I might call a very big fish indeed.  We saw that that person was convicted of membership of an unlawful organisation.  I ask the Minister how can he now come into this Parliament and suggest that the law is defective, or that the law is in some way lacking?  How can he come into this Parliament and ask it to support a Bill the like of which can only be found on the statute books of South Africa?  What has been wrong so far has not been any defect in the law; what has been wrong has been a defect in the will of the Executive charged with the enforcement of that law.</P>

      <P>The object of the criminal law is to ensure that persons who break that law are apprehended and punished.  This branch of criminal law is political in its personality. <Col N="277" /> Those who break it are guilty of what are called political crimes.  In the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as amended by the 1940 Act, a great number of offences are provided.  Does it matter whether these so-called political criminals are apprehended for breaking one section or for breaking another section?  Surely what should concern the Government is that they be apprehended and punished.</P>
      <P>What I want to suggest to this House is that the Government have failed, and failed miserably, to implement and enforce the existing law.  It behoved the Minister to spell out for us in greater detail than he did the ways in which the present law is defective, because he is asking this Parliament, which is the first guardian of democracy and of the rights of the individual, to pass a piece of legislation described rightly in our amendments as repugnant to the basic principles of justice and liberty.  The Minister has not done that.  He has not shown in the detail required by the exigencies of the situation, how the existing law is ineffective. It is not defective and I propose to give this House numerous instances of breaches of that law which have gone ignored by the Government.  I am quite certain they have not gone ignored by the police force of the State.  I am certain that the police have been inhibited in their enforcement of the law and in attacking the breaches they themselves observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 of the Offences against the State Act makes it an offence to set up a body of persons purporting to be a legislature.  Is the Minister blind, or has he not read the newspaper accounts where a certain organisation has purported to set up mini Dála up and down the country, and where the propagators of these mini parliaments have gone on record publicly and frequently indicating that these parliaments will become, if they can make them so, the parliaments of the people?  These statements are clearly in breach of section 6 of the Offences against the State Act.  If the Minister suspects that any of those persons making those statements might perhaps be members of an unlawful <Col N="278" /> organisation, but he cannot prove membership of an unlawful organisation, why does he not prosecute them and put them in jail under section 6?</P>

      <P>Section 7 of the Offences against the State Act makes it an offence to obstruct an employee of the State in the carrying out of his duties.  Section 9 states that every person who shall with intent to undermine public order commit any act of violence against any member of a lawfully established military or police force shall be guilty of an offence. Were any of those people who demonstrated outside the Curragh Camp a short time ago, and who incited others to hatred against members of our Army, who physically assaulted members of our Army, prosecuted and convicted for those offences?  If any of them happen to be members of an unlawful organisation, does it matter much whether they are prosecuted under this section or under the section dealing with membership of an unlawful organisation?  They were in clear breach of the criminal law of the country and yet they went scot free.</P>
      <P>We have had cases of incitement to disaffection by some of these people towards members of the Garda.  I recall particularly an incident at the residence of the British Ambassador when a token game of football was played by way of protest against the occupation of Casement Park by the British Army.  In the course of that protest, the gardaí on duty were invited to leave their dutiful posts and join in that activity.  That is only one instance.  Gardaí on duty where demonstrations and picketings were taking place have been subjected to abuse, calls of &ldquo;traitor&rdquo;, &ldquo;shoneen&rdquo;, &ldquo;felon setters&rdquo; and all the other cant and jargon of these elements.  Does the Minister suggest to me that those people should not have been prosecuted, and prosecuted to a conviction for those serious offences?  Again, does it matter whether they are prosecuted under this section or the section dealing with membership of an unlawful organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister does not want to <Col N="279" /> use the Offences Against the State Act for that offence, he may use section 14 of The Garda Síochána Act, 1924, which provides that if any person causes, or attempts to cause, or does any act calculated to cause, disaffection amongst the members of the Garda Síochána, or induces any member of the Garda Síochána to withhold his services or to commit a breach of discipline, he shall be guilty of an offence.  We have seen no prosecutions under that section in spite of many offences, and many public offences, committed under it.</P>
    <P>Again I would refer the Minister to section 15 of the Offences against the State Act.  This is the section which prohibits drilling or the carrying out of military manoeuvres or evolutions. Every Easter the Minister has only to look at the daily newspapers to see photographs of men of military rank in para-military uniform strutting the streets of this city, the city of Cork and many towns up and down the country carrying out activities prohibited specifically by section 15 and very often leading these parades are gentlemen known to the guards as being members of unlawful organisations but who, perhaps, cannot be proved as such.  What does it matter? If they commit an offence under section 15, cannot they be imprisoned under that section?  No. We have seen no action by the Executive in that regard either.</P>
    <P>I witnessed such parades at Tyrells-pass on the occasion of the funeral of the Connaught Ranger Daly.  I saw the president of one of the branches of Sinn Féin, the Provisional Sinn Féin, with a squad of men drawn up in military lines.  I saw and heard him issuing orders to them, military commands. He was observed by members of the security forces and the Offences Against the State Act was in force but nothing happened.  If the Minister suspects that a person is a member of an unlawful organisation, why wait until he has corrected, as he says, inadequacies in the law in regard to another section when he has clear power under that section to convict?</P>
    <P>Again, at Bodenstown every year <Col N="280" /> we have not one but many parades and we are, perhaps, getting to the nub of the matter because the Minister dare not interfere with Bodenstown or he would be exposing some of the cant of his own party.</P>
    <P>Again, we look at section 19 of the Offences Against the State Act.  This is the section which gives power to the Government to declare certain organisations to be unlawful.  At the moment there is only one organisation unlawful, the organisation known as the IRA, otherwise the Irish Republican Army, otherwise Oglaigh na hÉireann and there is some doubt as to whether the divisions of that organisation variously calling themselves and calling each other Provisional, Official, National Liberation Front, Provisional Alliance, Saor Éire&mdash;there is some legal doubt as to whether the suppression order in existence covers these.  A judge recently in the course of a judgment&mdash;but, perhaps, he was only speaking <i>obiter</i>&mdash;indicated that the order as it stands is adequate. Why should there be any doubt about this?  If the Minister is in earnest in tackling all these nefarious elements which he rightly condemned in his speech, why does he not make them stand up, why does he not clarify their position in the eyes of the law and their position in relation to the Offences Against the State Act?</P>
    <P>Again, I wonder how difficult it is to prove membership of an unlawful organisation.  We do not know because these things are necessarily hidden, necessarily within the knowledge, the understandably secret knowledge, of the members of the security forces but occasionally we see a straw in the wind which indicates to us that it might be possible, if the Executive had the will.</P>
    <P>In recent proceedings in the High Court when an order was sought to quash a closing order in relation to premises at Blessington Street, Dublin, a detective gave evidence that a certain person whom he had cautioned some time previously in connection with a traffic offence admitted, apparently gratuitously, on the occasion of that caution that he was a member of the IRA.  He was giving <Col N="281" /> this evidence in the context that he knew these premises were being used by members of an unlawful organisation. In cross-examination he was asked why was this person not prosecuted. His answer was: &ldquo;That is a procedural matter.  I reported to my superior officer&rdquo; and he named the superior officer.  But, no prosecution was taken and there, on an admission by that particular person that he was a member of the IRA, the State failed to prosecute for membership of an unlawful organisation and, with the chief of them already convicted, when here is an example from the guards themselves, unwitting perhaps, the Minister tells us that the law is inadequate.</P>
    <P>Again, too, there is section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, a section which was used widely and with great effect when similar troubles plagued this land some years ago. Under this section there is power to question persons in custody and require them to account for their movements and should they fail to do so they are liable to be prosecuted.  I am not aware of one prosecution having been taken since this campaign started under that section.  The person has to be in custody to be questioned but he can be taken into custody under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act which gives any member of the Garda, in uniform or out of uniform, power to arrest on suspicion that a scheduled offence has been committed or is about to be committed. There is no difficulty in getting those people, who, the Minister says, are well known, into custody and then the power is there to question them.</P>
    <P>These are wide and drastic powers, not powers we are happy to have on the Statute Book of a democracy but when a democracy is faced with the dilemma of preserving itself and in order to do so impinging on individual freedom, it sometimes has to adopt harsh and seemingly Draconian measures but there is a limit to the measures a democracy is entitled to adopt in order to protect itself.  I am suggesting to this Parliament, that has the duty of protecting freedom, that that limit is exceeded in this Bill and <Col N="282" /> I feel I have demonstrated amply to this House that the existing legislation is adequate if the will to enforce it were present.</P>
    <P>The Minister attempted to justify the Bill in his speech.  He attempted to blunt the unusual and the unjust and repressive points in it.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill gives power to a member of the Garda to demand the name and address of a defendant and also to demand from him an account of his recent movements.  I think I have made it very clear that that power is already contained in sections 30 and 52 of the 1939 Act.  If the penalties provided by the 1939 Act are thought to be too lenient it would have been a simple matter and entirely unobjectionable to ask the House to increase these penalties.  Instead, we get an entirely new and much altered section.</P>
    <P>We progress deeper when we reach section 3 of the Bill.  It is an underlying principle of our legal code that a person is innocent until proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt.  This section turns that basic tenet upside down.  It devises a situation where a reasonable inference can cause a person to be found guilty.  It goes even further and provides for a situation that a person can be found guilty of an inference made from an implication.  It is an extraordinary piece of legislation to ask a democratic Parliament to put on its Statute Book.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (b) of subsection (1) it allows an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation.  In itself that would appear to be in ease of a person accused but the tail of that paragraph goes on to read:</P>
    <P>The fact of such denial shall not of itself be conclusive.</P>
    <P>What is a defendant to do?  If it is put to him that a statement has been made that he is a member, he denies it but that is not conclusive.  What more can he do?  How does one sustain a negative beyond issuing a denial?</P>
    <P>Subsection (2), however, is the real nub of this Bill.  Subsection (2) is what makes this Bill so totally and completely obnoxious.  It gives power to an officer of the Garda not below the <Col N="283" /> rank of chief superintendent to state that he believes that an accused man was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation and that statement shall be evidence that he was then such a member.  That is a very positive statement of law.  The Minister seeks to justify it on a number of extraordinary grounds but that statement of law brings into our legal system hearsay evidence to allow a person to be convicted of a criminal offence and hearsay evidence has been rejected consistently by our courts for many serious reasons. Hearsay evidence is what it means.  A person is giving in evidence something he has heard from a third party.  In this case have we any protection that what a chief superintendent hears may not be third, fourth or even sixth-hand reports?  The Minister says these are men of integrity and repute and would not give evidence knowing it to be wrong.  It is not their own evidence they are giving but evidence they have been given at, perhaps, sixth degree.  How can they check back as to whether that evidence is accurate, misleading or plainly fraudulent? It is a notorious fact that if a statement is passed between people via two or three other people that by the time it reaches its intended destination, invariably it arrives garbled. Yet, we are to send people to prison on a piece of law permitting that to happen.</P>
    <P>Hearsay evidence is excluded also, and rightly so, by our courts on the grounds that it leads to the possibility of fraud or mistakes.  Again, I do not impugn the integrity of the senior officers of our Garda but they will be giving evidence that they have heard at secondhand and evidence which they may not necessarily get from colleagues in the Garda.  They may be getting the evidence from informers. What protection has an accused against the ill-will of any informer who might be prepared to give fraudulent stories dressed with an appearance of truth concerning him to a chief superintendent?</P>
    <P>Hearsay evidence is liable also to mistakes.  One can imagine a situation where a detective could say to a chief <Col N="284" /> superintendent: &ldquo;Mr. AB is a member of the IRA&rdquo; and the superintendent relying perhaps on that experienced officer's hearsay goes into court and tenders evidence on the basis of which Mr. AB is convicted of the offence.</P>
    <P>Again, in the case concerning the closing of the Blessington Street premises, there was an example which highlights the dangers of which I am speaking.  In that case a detective giving evidence identified several callers to the premises as being members of the IRA.  He did this, not on his own knowledge, but on information given to him by members of the Special Detective Unit.  He said then that he recognised James McMahon of Belleek from the time that he, the detective, was on Border duty and from informations he had received. Defending counsel then produced a person whom they asked the detective to identify.  The detective said: &ldquo;Yes, that is James McMahon.&rdquo;  It transpired that the person in question was Michael McMahon who went into the witness box to say he was not a member of the IRA and never had been. Yet, under this section as introduced and which the Minister is asking us to pass, that mistake could have resulted in Michael McMahon being sent to Mountjoy Jail.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that there is a protection in the fact that the chief superintendent will be liable to cross-examination and that his evidence will be on oath.  I do not suggest for one moment that a chief superintendent would not have the highest regard for an oath but I venture to say that it is silly of the Minister to suggest that cross-examination of a superintendent could take place in which he was asked for the sources of his information. The idea of cross-examination is to test the credibility and strength of a witness and in a situation where all that the Act requires is a belief, not even a reasonable belief but presumably <i>prima facie</i> belief on the part of the superintendent, how can there be cross-examination to test the strength of evidence being given?  In any event, so far as I am aware, all that a chief superintendent has to do <Col N="285" /> when he is being asked questions regarding the sources of his information, is to plead privilege and he will be protected from answering further. Therefore, despite what the Minister says cross-examination is no protection for a person faced with the consequences of this section.</P>
    <P>Other than a simple belief on the part of the superintendent all that the section requires is a subjective assessment by him.  He does not have to be able to show that his belief is reasonable. All he need say is that he believes and if a trusted and loyal colleague of his tells him that in his opinion such a person is a member of an illegal organisation, there is nothing to prevent the superintendent believing that to be the position and, with a clear conscience, going into court and saying that that person is a member of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>There is a further point to which the Minister did not advert in his remarks on this section although whether this was deliberate or accidental on his part, I do not know.  The Minister made play on the status of the person who would be giving evidence, that is, a chief superintendent but under the Offences against the State Act all the powers of a chief superintendent can be exercised by a superintendent.  Therefore, this section is much wider than it appears on its face.  It does not take a great exercise in imagination or projection to envisage a situation where the Minister might come back here in six months' time and say that since there are only 23 chief superintendents in the State, their time is very precious and that they are not available to go to court to give evidence as conveniently or as often as required and that, therefore, he is asking us to make an amendment to the section to delete the words &ldquo;Chief Superintendent&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;sergeant&rdquo;. The argument that would support the section in terms of the chief superintendent would lie equally to support the insertion of the word &ldquo;sergeant&rdquo;. That might bring it home to the House how unfair, unjust and essentially obnoxious is this particular section. It turns our legal system upside <Col N="286" /> down and it provides no protection for an accused person.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that a chief superintendent's evidence will not be conclusive.  If it is not denied, a court is coerced into accepting it and in his statement the Minister admits that there may be persons who will not be prepared to issue a denial.  In that case it is futile of the Minister to deny that a chief superintendent's evidence will not be accepted.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that an accused can go into a witness box and rebut what the chief superintendent says.  That person is then open to cross-examination.  He is then in a position of what lawyers call &ldquo;jeopardy&rdquo; and he is being forced into that position because of this section.  He is being forced into a position that is not envisaged by our legal courts for a defendant.  A defendant is not a compellable witness but in effect if he wishes to escape from the clutches of this section he becomes a compellable witness contrary to the basic principle of our legal system.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to make a declaration here that its first duty in this instance in regard to this particular subsection is, at the very least to the individual because this section is not necessary to preserve the security of the State.</P>
    <P>Let us now consider section 4.  The Minister's justification for this section, the constitutionality of which must be in serious doubt, is that persons in the recent past have sought to interfere with the courts.  I suggest to the Minister that it is an offence already to watch or beset any place in the State and that prosecution could have been taken under existing legislation without the need to bring in this section.  It is understandable to want to prevent any interference with the course of justice.  That is not a principle with which anyone would quibble but the definition of interference in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) is so wide as to render the entire section objectionable.  The word &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; is used.  It reads:</P>
    <P>A statement, meeting, procession <Col N="287" /> or demonstration shall be deemed to constitute an interference with the course of justice if it is intended, or is of such a character as to be likely, directly or indirectly to influence any court, person or authority concerned with the institution, conduct or defence of any civil or criminal proceedings...</P>
    <P>For a moment let us consider that section in action.  If, for example, a newspaper journalist in sympathy with the victims of thalidomide poisoning urged in this country that civil action should be taken for damages against the purveyors of that poison that person would be not in contempt of court because proceedings would not have commenced but that person would be guilty of a criminal offence under section 4 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Again, if lawyers or journalists issued statements, spoke at debates, wrote articles about some way in which the law was not being enforced they would be liable for prosecution under this Bill by reason of interfering directly or indirectly with the institution of proceedings.  Any criticism of the Attorney General could be an offence under this Bill.  Any section that is as widely drawn as that cannot be acceptable to a democratic parliament.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is stated to be merely a bringing up-to-date section to take account of technical advances and to provide for recordings of sound and visual images to be classified as documents. The Minister did not tell us&mdash; I wonder does he realise&mdash;that that particular section, having regard to the other provisions of the Offences against the State Act, would permit evidence to be given in court of tape recordings made electronically of conversations unknown to the persons having those conversations.  It would permit electronic eavesdropping to be admissible evidence in our courts.  It would also permit recordings of private telephone conversations to be admissible in our courts.  Is the Minister aware that that consequence seems to flow from section 5?</P>
    <P>As I said, every democracy is faced with the dilemma of having to protect itself and protect its freedoms and, at <Col N="288" /> the same time, not allow those freedoms to be abused by persons who might be inimical to democracy.  Democracy must arm itself with weapons to ensure that those freedoms are protected. This democracy did so.  It armed itself with the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and I submit to the House that I have demonstrated amply that the powers contained in that Act are entirely adequate, if enforced, to answer that democracy comes to no harm from the people abroad today who would harm it.</P>
    <P>This party are not prepared to give to the Minister any more powers than he already has because this party for the last three years have been urging the Minister to exercise the powers which he already has.  It would be inconsistent on our part to admit now that the powers were inadequate.  We do not do so and any suggestion that we might do so or that we might be failing in our duty is not a valid objection. We have consistently pointed out that the power was there.  We have consistently pointed out that all that was necessary was for the Executive to show a determined will to exercise these powers.  The Minister has sought greater powers.  He has sought these powers on a case which he has failed to sustain that the existing powers are inadequate.  The new powers that he seeks are powers of such drastic novelty that they must be refused to him.</P>
    <P>If he had come into this House with his hands clean in regard to his activities up to now, then one might have to look at his request or if he was a member of an Executive who had shown themselves to be sensitive to the rights of the individual then again we might have a different aspect on this case but unfortunately this particular Government have shown themselves to be insensitive to many of the things which are basic to democracy. They put through this House the Prohibition of Forcible Entry Bill.  The clear undertaking was given that that Bill was aimed at and would only be used against subversive agitators indulging in squatting. We have seen it used against tenants in contention with landlords. We have seen it used to prevent a <Col N="289" /> person gaining admission to a meeting of a local authority.  I have not the slightest doubt that if these powers are given to the Minister the temptation will arise, and the temptation will be succumbed to, use these vast Draconian powers against people for whom they were never intended.</P>
    <P>It is pertinent to recall that the Offences Against the State Act was invoked against the farmers of this country when they sought to hold demonstrations within half a mile of this House.  Yet subversives of every hue can come to the very gates of this Parliament and can obstruct members from entering, they can preach sedition and revolution at the gates and yet our Executive ignore them but when the farmers looked for their rights the Offences Against the State Act was invoked against them.  I suggest to this House that an Executive who are insensitive to that degree cannot be trusted with the measures contained in this Bill, measures which go deep in infringing the very basic freedom which should be enjoyed and enjoyable in any democratic State.</P>
    <P>It is pertinent too, to consider why the Government have failed over the past three years to take the actions they should have taken when, as I have clearly shown, they had the power to take those actions.  The Government did not move because they were prisoners of their own origins. They were inhibited by their own history.  It is only a couple of short years ago since half the Government were put out of office by the Taoiseach for reasons going to the security of the State, for reasons that we all know now, with hindsight, indicated that there was collusion between those members and some of the organisations which the Minister now says he wants to clamp down on.  If that was the position within the Government, is it unrealistic to ask was it not also the position within the party as a whole and that the Taoiseach was aware that if he moved too fast and too soon he would provoke a rebellion within his own back benches?  On many occasions when they could have spoken there was nothing but an ominous silence behind the Taoiseach. A party that is tainted in that regard <Col N="290" /> have no right to come into this Parliament and ask for the powers sought in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There was a time in this country before when powers like this formed part of our statute law.  I was waiting for the Minister to quote those powers as a precedent for this Bill.  The Minister was wise enough not to quote that earlier legislation because that legislation was passed at a time when instead of a loyal Opposition debating the issue in Parliament the Opposition was abroad on the streets and fields of the country in overt attack on this very Parliament.  The seeds which were then sown have from time to time continued to flourish in this country and that noxious growth is again evident today and I see, in the failure of the Executive to cut down those weeds effectively and early, their own history from which they cannot escape.</P>

      <P>It is window-dressing on the part of the Government to ask us to give them a power that turns the rights of the citizens, the very freedom we are here to protect into a nullity and I would ask this House, when it comes to decide how it votes on this particular matter, to decide in conscience if the Minister has demonstrated that the present laws are inadequate to justify this awful interference with individual freedom.  It is a matter of conscience for every Member of this Parliament on which he must make up his own mind.  If he feels that the rights of the individual are now threatened beyond a tolerable limit consonant with the necessity to protect democracy, then he must in conscience vote against this Bill.  No case has been made, in my submission, for voting for this Bill and I ask this House to reject it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the reasoned amendment proposed by Deputy Cooney.  In considering this measure I think it is an indication of the times and circumstances in which we live that public interest and attention are focussed on events and, indeed, often magnified and blown up out of all proportion, by comment and references in one medium or another.  This piece of <Col N="291" /> legislation comes before the House at a very serious time in the history of this State.  Because of that and because of the gravity of the situation I think it is important&mdash;although it is hardly necessary for one who has spoken so often and I think quite clearly on the subject of respect for the institutions of State and on my own as well as my party's attitude to matters of law and order, because, as the Minister remarked in introducing the Bill there is so much misrepresentation about it&mdash;for me to re-emphasise and restate the attitude of this party on this matter.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I think it is essential that in present circumstances it should be both restated and re-emphasised.  We are resolutely opposed to irregular and illegal organisations; we reject completely any idea of assisting or even tolerating them and we support any proposals necessary for the preservation and defence of the institutions of State.  It is important, therefore, to make it quite clear so far as we are concerned that we reject totally the approach of all illegal organisations.  In considering this measure it is important that we should examine it calmly and without the emotionalism focussed on it both in the media and by some commentators who have already adverted to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I know, and I think Deputy Cooney has put this point clearly, we are not certain where the existing laws have been found inadequate to deal with the situation. It may be that they are not adequate and it may be that the legal advisers and draftsmen who are qualified to advise the Minister in this regard have found defects that have not been obvious to the general public or to Deputies other than those who are possibly practising in the courts.  Because of the whole history of irregular and illegal activities in this country it is necessary to cover a certain amount of old ground.  The most recent previous period in which action had to be taken against illegal organisations was in the 1950s.  At that time with the 1939 Offences Against the State Act on the Statute Book, as it is now, the Government <Col N="292" /> of which I was a member prosecuted a number of persons and secured a great many convictions in the courts and sentences were imposed.  These convictions took place in 1956 and in the early part of 1957.</P>
    <P>These persons were prosecuted, as I understand it, under the appropriate sections of the 1939 Act.  In March, 1957, there was a change of Government and later that year the Fianna Fáil Government which replaced our Government introduced internment and internment operated then as far as I remember for a period of a couple of years.  A number of persons some of whom had already been prosecuted and whose sentences had expired and others were interned by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  Some Deputies and some Deputies who are no longer Ministers will remember that: they were members of the Government at the time.  Others who are members of this Government are, of course, also aware of it.</P>
    <P>There are obviously two views about the method of dealing with this problem.  One is that the courts should be used and people who have respect for the legal system prefer the ordinary courts, but experience here, in the main, I think, has shown that the ordinary courts find it difficult&mdash;I shall put it no stronger&mdash;to convict in these cases, and because of that two systems of special courts have been operated, in the early years and again in the war years, military courts; in between and at intervals, the civil courts and now, for the last eight or nine months the special criminal courts.  I think it is true that since the Special Criminal Court has been established the rate of convictions has considerably improved, and I use that word advisedly.  I have no sympathy, good, bad or indifferent, with those who try to subvert the institutions of State and then whinge about civil and other liberties when brought before the courts.  My record on that is dead clear and quite simple and unambiguous.</P>
    <P>The dilemma the Minister is in, and I think this goes to the very root of the dilemma which has characterised, certainly up to recently, this Government and that characterises&mdash;we must face <Col N="293" /> it&mdash;the attitude of many people in this country in respect of other matters to which I will refer in a moment is a dilemma arising out of our history.  It is unnecessary for me in this debate to recount the circumstances of the last three to four years.  I believe that what has been said here about the failure of the Executive to enforce the law is a fact.  I think that what has happened &mdash;this is why I say &ldquo;up to recently&rdquo;&mdash; is that due to the speed of events and the extraordinary and tragic happenings, it is inevitable that in the rapidly changing scene, with the speed with which changes occur, the public may forget relatively recent past events because they are obliterated by some of the present day horrors.</P>
    <P>Less than three years ago, as was mentioned here, there was a dramatic change in the Government.  A number of Ministers were dismissed and others resigned.  For months there was an investigation by the Public Accounts Committee and I think it is a sign of the circumstances and the whole atmosphere that surround the `Government that despite the recommendations of that committee, up to now no specific action has been taken, and this lack of resolution in ensuring that the law is being forced was symptomatic of possibly an honestly held divided view of events and the attitude that should be adopted in respect of the North of Ireland.  I think the same is true of the attitudes of very many otherwise responsible and reasonable law-abiding people, that so far as events in the Six Counties or in the North of Ireland are concerned, people have a confused approach to what is legitimate so far as resisting authority, resisting the legitimate legal authority, is concerned and this is because of the intolerable way in which in the North of Ireland the Stormont regime operated for 50 years.</P>
    <P>This has meant that people have a divided view and a divided attitude in relation to the legitimate authority where it operates in relation to other matters and, in particular, to illegal organisations.  There is no doubt that the public are concerned and people are rightly worried, not only by the tragic and continuing loss of life in the <Col N="294" /> North of Ireland but by the fact that there has been in some cases evidence of a spill-over down here and it is because of that that it is our duty as a Parliament to ensure that the laws are adequate and the organs of State are supplied with the necessary power to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>We have tabled this reasoned amendment for the purpose of securing what we consider are certain changes, specifically or in particular, the amendment of section 3 (2) of the Bill.  I believe it is important that the law should be strong enough to deal with the guilty but should not take away or abridge the rights of the innocent and as this section is drafted it goes beyond what was contained and what up to now has been effective in the 1939 Act.  I know that some people disagree with the view I am going to express in respect of one organ.  Everybody who respects the law recognises the authority of Parliament, of the Government, of the Army and the Garda. Some people have the belief that the news media and particularly RTE &mdash;I am not talking of the news section but of RTE as an authority &mdash;can almost do or say what they like.  I reject that view.  I reject the idea that people have the right to do or say what they like where the security of the State or the institutions of State are concerned. Freedom is undoubtedly a valuable thing but a general assumed unwarranted licence to say anything in any circumstances is quite another thing.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, said that because people show zeal and enthusiasm one should not curb them.  I do not think anybody wants to curb freedom of expression or the free relaying of news, but here again&mdash;this is not the time to discuss it but it is part of this whole situation and we cannot ignore the build-up that has occurred &mdash;the directive given in respect of certain matters was not specific enough. The authority should have sought clarification&mdash;they did&mdash;but they did not pursue their request for clarification for the simple reason&mdash;and here again is a conflict, if not of interest, certainly of function&mdash;that the vast majority of the members of the outgoing <Col N="295" /> authority as well as the new authority are Fianna Fáil&mdash;they would not deny it&mdash;and they wanted to remain on the authority and at the same time not over-embarrass the Government.  In the end they embarrassed the Government and were shifted.  This is a conflict of function.</P>
    <P>The reason I mention this is that I think there is a danger that in the modern coverage of events through radio and television, in order to get first with the coverage and with the news, things can be over-dramatised. I reject the idea that there is a danger to freedom of speech in this country.  There was one threat at one period in the life of this State when freedom of speech was threatened and the allies in that threat were Fianna Fáil and the IRA in the 1930s.  It was resisted by this party and defended by the courage of the people. That was the only time it was really threatened, and it was saved.  Communists and their fellow-travellers and soft-headed liberals are always talking about repression.  Since the advent of television there was never such freedom of expression.  People can almost say and be seen to say anything they like in almost any circumstances.</P>
    <P>The events of recent years in the North of Ireland and their impact here imposes on all of us a duty to defend the institutions of State.  Certainly so far as this party are concerned, we have always been prepared not merely to defend the institutions of State but to give, where necessary, all the powers and machinery in the technical sense to the Government.  I have stressed for years the need to strengthen the Army and the Garda Force.  In the last analysis there is only one way to defeat the threat to the institution of this State and that is by the forces of the State used to the maximum extent when necessary. I have no apology to make for saying that.</P>
    <P>That has been the policy of this party since its foundation, and it will continue to be our policy in all circumstances. This is why we tabled this reasoned amendment.  Deputy Cooney has gone through the sections <Col N="296" /> and it is not necessary for me to do so. In particular I wish to refer to sub-section (2) of section 3.  Under the 1939 Act, as I understand it and, in fact, in an earlier portion of this section, at section 3 (1) it is stated:</P>
    <P>Any statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any conduct, by an accused person implying or leading to a reasonable inference...</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, in the sections of the 1939 Act the words are &ldquo;reasonable conclusion&rdquo;, or similar phraseology. The phraseology of subsection (2) of section 3 is:</P>
    <P>Where an officer of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of Chief Superintendent, in giving evidence in proceedings relating to an offence under the said section 21, states that he believes that the accused was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation, the statement shall be evidence that he was then such a member.</P>
    <P>This is not, of course, conclusive evidence.  It is rebuttable.  There is genuine concern that the phraseology of that particular subsection requires to be amended so as to ensure that there will be no danger of an innocent person being convicted.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of agitation about liberty and freedom.  There is this talk of repression.  I have said before, but it is necessary to say again, that those who attempt to arrogate to themselves rights that nobody but this Dáil and the organs responsible to it have authority to take cannot seek or expect the same treatment as the ordinary law-abiding citizen.  If people in these circumstances try to usurp the authority of this Dáil and this Parliament and the organs under it, that must be resisted with all the forces of the State mobilised to the maximum extent and used remorselessly to put them down.  That has been our policy and will remain our policy.  We want to pursue this remorselessly, no matter who uses it. We have never changed in that attitude.</P>
    <P>There is a danger in the present circumstances of putting into Acts either powers that are possibly unnecessary <Col N="297" /> in the sense that they are already in existing legislation and have not been used, or because they put an innocent person at risk.  I do not think that this particular power which I have mentioned here in its present phraseology is necessary.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Minister's speech which I think requires elaboration when the Minister comes to conclude, is the precise differences that have arisen in respect of framing charges under the existing legislation, under either section 52 of the 1939 Act or under the other section.  In the previous cases that were taken a number of organisations were described and named.  I understand that because some of these organisations were not in existence or described themselves differently in 1939, or whenever the original order was made, it would require a fresh order to deal with them.  There is another danger in this.  This is the dilemma.  It is the job of the prosecution to put the case against the accused.  It is the job of whoever defends to put the defence, and it is for the court to decide.  The alternative to prosecuting and arraigning people in the ordinary way before the courts is internment. I do not think there is any in-between arrangement.  There is a danger that, if the Act is not specific and if its terms are not abundantly clear, we may be involved in something between an ordinary prosecution and internment.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in this case is that the people have recoiled against internment because of the partial administration of internment in the North of Ireland, where it should have been impartial.  It is a notorious fact that internment as operated in Northern Ireland was partial.  It was prejudiced and biassed.  In a matter of this sort if internment is to be used it must be used impartially.  For these reasons, we want to make our case abundantly clear.  For that purpose we have tabled this reasoned amendment as a recognised Parliamentary procedure to deal with a matter of this sort.  It is possible to do it in the way in which this reasoned amendment has been brought forward. <Col N="298" /> I hope the Minister will reply to this point when concluding.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be opportunities on the later Stages of this Bill to deal in detail with each section.  Our concern, as I said, is no less than that of the Government or the Minister to ensure that the law will be upheld and that every power required to uphold the law will be available.  The way in which to get respect for the law is by ensuring that the law is enforced impartially. There is no doubt but that public unease has been due to the fact that up to relatively recently the Government have not shown the resolution they should have shown.  If there were difficulties in securing prosecutions because of defects, then it was the Minister's duty and the Government's duty to put these deficiencies clearly before this House and before the country and I believe that responsible opinion would, in such circumstances, grant any necessary amendment of existing law or the enactment of new law.</P>
    <P>This particular Bill is being considered at a time when people are anxious and concerned because of events, particularly of events in the North of Ireland and, more recently, events nearer home.  There is no measure this House will not give if that measure is desirable and if it is used impartially to defend and protect and assure the people's rights.  But the law must be used impartially and, above all, it must be seen to be absolutely necessary.  We believe that the existing legislation&mdash;the 1939 Act as amended in respect of Part VI by the 1940 Act &mdash;has up to now proved adequate.  It may be, as the Minister said, that there have been difficulties in getting convictions in certain cases.  It is, however, a mistake to employ a measure of this sort to deal with events which are not a threat to the security of the State.  It was a mistake, for instance, to employ the 1939 Act, as amended, against the farmers.</P>

      <P>I do not justify the breaking of the law by anyone.  I do not approve of it.  But it was a mistake in that particular instance to use a <Col N="299" /> sledgehammer to crack a relatively small nut.  The threat posed by illegal and irregular groups is an entirely different matter and extremism in the defence of the institutions of this State can in this case be justified, but it must be justified on the basis that existing measures are not adequate and additional powers are specifically required because of known defects in existing legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney has referred in detail to the amendments we think desirable. That which causes the greatest anxiety is section 3 (2).  There is no time limit on this particular section.  There is, of course, no time limit on the 1939 Act either.  It is a permanent piece of legislation. I do not think the provisions of the 1939 Act have been oppressive.  I do not think they have in any way restricted those who want to agitate legitimately.  No one wants to prevent people pursuing a legitimate cause.  I said before&mdash;it is worth repeating&mdash; that this party fought its way back from nothing because of our will and our determination, fought its way back against many of the groups prepared to use illegal weapons.  There are those who say that, if one agitates within the law, one cannot get places.  I believe there is ample opportunity within the law.  We have, however, seen movements which started out legitimately, like the anti-apartheid protest marches, which degenerated into a rabble and were a disgrace to all associated with them.</P>

I do not believe there has been any repression here and I do not believe there is any danger of it.  There is no real threat to freedom of speech except by the Government and illegal organisations which want to usurp authority.  So far as I and my party are concerned, we will use every legitimate means and every legitimate power to put them down.  We must, however, be assured that the changes requested are both necessary and justified and that the provisions will be <Col N="300" /> used impartially and with resolution to defeat any threat to the institutions of this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We, in the Labour Party, are totally opposed to this Bill. We realise, as we have realised in the past, that, having come to a decision after long and serious consideration, that decision will be used against us to the political advantage, if possible, of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We realise that what we are doing today will be misrepresented by Fianna Fáil and others.  We realise it will be presented as encouragement and support, tacit or open, for illegal organisations which attempt or advocate the achievement of political or other aims by the use of force.</P>
      <P>As I say, we are totally opposed to both sections of the IRA and totally opposed to any organisation that wishes to impose its will on the Irish people out of the barrel of a gun or by a bomb.  In the time ahead I hope that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly now when the vista of the chapel gates is fast approaching, will bear what I have said in mind.</P>
      <P>We are opposed to this Bill for a variety of reasons.  This Bill attempts to deprive Irish men and Irish women of their basic human right, the right in any democracy to a proper and correct interpretation and implementation of the law.  If we look at certain sections of this Bill&mdash;some of them are extremely serious&mdash;if the Bill itself were not so serious, we would say that they were quite comical with regard to what they mean literally.  Apart from the completely unacceptable nature of the Bill, whoever drafted it did no service to the Minister for Justice or the House. I will show that later.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (1) (a) and (b) provides:</P>
      <P>Any statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any conduct, by an accused person implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation shall, in proceedings under section 21 of the Act of 1939, be evidence that he was then such a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> In paragraph (a) of this subsection &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; includes omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation, but the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive.</P>
    <P>In effect, that means that, if any of our good friends in the Press Gallery report a meeting at which I spoke in the following manner: &ldquo;Frank Cluskey, member of the Provisional IRA, made a statement at such a meeting&rdquo;, if I am not to leave myself open to conviction, I am obliged to write immediately to that paper and deny that I am a member of the IRA.  The section also refers to a statement made orally.  If I give a radio or television interview and the introduction is not given in my presence&mdash;and our friends connected with radio and television will know that this is quite a common practice; I gave a radio interview today with Deputy Cooney and there was no introduction to it in our hearing; this is quite normal, to save time and for other expedients&mdash;and if the man introducing the programme describes me as &ldquo;Frank Cluskey, a member of the IRA&rdquo; the onus is on me to take immediate steps to contradict that statement although I did not know it had been made.  If I found myself before the courts under this section some four or five months later, it could be interpreted that because I did not deny it, I was acknowledging that I was a member of the IRA.  That is some justice!  Section 3 (2), which has already been referred to by previous speakers, provides that an officer of the Garda Síochána of the rank of chief superintendent, or over, may go into court and give evidence to the effect that in his opinion a person is a member of an illegal organisation and that will be accepted by the court as evidence&mdash;I accept what the Minister says, not as conclusive evidence, but as evidence.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is a strange commentary on the times in which we live, and on the abdication of responsibility by a number of people who should know better&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> If the Minister wants to talk about abdicating responsibility I should like to know what precisely that section of the Bill is, if it is not a total abdication of responsibility by the Government and the switching of it not only over to the courts but over to the Garda.  Under this Bill, which is introduced and advocated by the Minister, the courts are now to accept a responsibility which rightfully belongs to the Executive, and the Executive are now abdicating that responsibility.  They are also proposing to hand over to a member of the Garda a responsibility and duty of the judiciary.  The only people who have the right to form an opinion in the reaching of a verdict are the judge, or judges, or members of a jury.  Here we have not only the abdication of responsibility to govern, which the Government were elected to do, and its transfer to the courts, but also a responsibility and obligation of the judiciary being transferred to the shoulders of a chief superintendent or other garda officers of higher rank.</P>
    <P>In the section we have a complete departure from what has been accepted as a normal democratic right before any court in a democratic society: that the onus of proof is on the prosecution.  If I am arrested and charged with an offence I have not got the responsibility to prove that I am innocent.  The responsibility lies on the prosecution to prove that I am guilty.  That is a fundamental principle of justice in any democratic society.  There is another very important departure.  In a normal society which recognises the democratic rights of the citizens, if I am charged with a crime, irrespective of how grave that crime may be, up to a capital offence, I can reserve my right&mdash;and this right is solely mine&mdash;to go into the witness box, take an oath, and give evidence.</P>
    <P>That is my fundamental right.  If I avail of that right and opt to go into the witness box I am subject to cross-examination. This right is being denied under this section.  If a person does not chose to go into the witness box and deny that he is a <Col N="303" /> member of an illegal organisation&mdash; and for very many reasons people may not chose to do so, not necessarily because they are members of an illegal organisation&mdash;the court will accept the word of the member of the Garda Síochána who expresses his opinion which is accepted as evidence. I ask, what kind of court would it be?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney referred to hearsay evidence.  The Minister referred to the integrity and experience of members of the Garda, particularly of the high rank of chief superintendent. Like Deputy Cooney I am in no way suggesting or implying that a member of the Garda Síochána would deliberately mislead a court, would tell lies or would falsify but the fact remains that he is giving evidence of something that he has not witnessed.  He is depending, and it has been stated in cases that he is depending, on the word of his informant.  We have seen time and time again the man in charge of the Special Detective Unit, Superintendent Fleming, refusing to tell a court or anyone else the source of his information.  Is a man now to be brought before the court and, if the thing is tracked down to its original source, to be convicted on the word of an informer who will not even inform at first hand?</P>

In the last three lines of section 4 we find that anyone who interferes in the proceedings or interferes in how the proceedings shall be instituted, conducted, continued or defended or as to what should be their outcome will be guilty if this Bill is passed.  I do not want to bring this thing down to the farcical for it is far too serious a matter but if that section is passed the literal meaning of it is that if there is a programme such as &ldquo;Ask the Experts&rdquo;, where listeners phone or write in queries and if in his capacity as a legal man Deputy Cooney were on that programme and a listener wrote in and inquired what would be the best thing for her to do, that she was being prosecuted for non-payment of rates or for arrears of rent or for some outstanding bill and Deputy Cooney gave her advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy would have more knowledge of and interest in the lovelorn than in this Bill.  Deputy Cooney would then be subject to prosecution under this Bill.  If he advised her to consult a solicitor he would under this Bill be interfering in the defence or the outcome.  That is the literal meaning of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 extends the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo; in the original 1939 Act and states that &ldquo;document&rdquo; shall now include &ldquo;any map, plan, graph or drawing&rdquo;&ldquo;any photograph,&rdquo;&ldquo;any disc, tape sound track or other device in which sounds or other data (not being visual images) are embodied so as to be capable (with or without the aid of some other equipment) of being reproduced therefrom...&rdquo;  Under the original Act, if certain things were not complied with, a person would be subject to fairly severe penalties.  Under this Bill, if a person prints a document he is required to keep a copy of that document, to put the name and address of the person for whom he printed that document on the front or the back of that document and to retain it for a period of not less than six months and produce it at the request of a member of the Garda Síochána. <Col N="305" /> According to the wording of this Bill the situation will be that if I go to some part of rural Ireland on holidays and take a photograph of a tree or a lake or my child and bring and hand it into a chemist he must go through all that procedure.  He must keep a copy of the photograph and must produce it on request within a period of six months and if he does not he will be guilty of an offence under the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>I did not want to get down to the farcical because this is far too serious a matter but what I state is the literal truth.  If this Bill becomes law I can be charged under the Offences Against the State Act because I have ordinary commercial records in my home that can be interpreted under this Bill as a spurious document.  &ldquo;The Dubliners&rdquo; had better watch out.</P>

      <P>They appear to be the only ones the Government are not anxious to get at.  In this they are trying to get at everybody else.  This Bill could only be described as a pollution of justice.  We are treading on extremely dangerous ground when we try to interfere with the normal democratic procedures in this fashion. People are very worried at this particular time and there is a certain amount of justification for their anxiety but surely when there are forces in existence who are intent solely on undermining and destroying our form of democracy, this is the time when we should cling more than ever to that democracy.  It is a time when we should let it be seen that our democracy works. Instead of introducing legislation at this time we should be rallying to the defence of our democracy but this Bill goes a long way to undermining it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much unrest in this country during the past three years. Perhaps to use the word &ldquo;unrest&rdquo; is to understate the situation but in this part of the island during the past week there has been a series of events that have perturbed and frightened our people, the ordinary law-abiding citizens.  However, to exaggerate the seriousness of the situation would be almost as bad <Col N="306" /> as understating it.  A frightened people cannot be expected to think very clearly.  The number of work stoppages, of demonstrations and of meetings that have been witnessed during the past four or five days have given rise to much fear but we must be clear as to why these forms of protest took place. They did not take place because the leader of the Provisional IRA was arrested or because he was on hunger and thirst strike.  No, there were a number of other factors involved.  For instance, this Bill had been mooted by the Minister for Justice and there was the sacking of the RTE Authority which action caused a considerable amount of anxiety to law-abiding citizens.  There was also the sentencing of Mr. O'Kelly because he saw fit to defend the ethics of his profession. These incidents, occurring within a period of a few days, caused the unrest among the people.</P>
    <P>It would be a great mistake to overestimate the support for the men of violence or to think that all the people who have taken part in the various forms of protest were motivated by any support on their part for the gunmen. We know that we may be accused of supporting these elements but may I ask the Minister whether he regards the Association of Irish Priests as a subversive organisation or whether he regards the students in Maynooth seminary as being subversives?  I have here a telegram signed by the secretary of the Navan Chamber of Commerce asking Deputy Tully, on behalf of that body, to oppose this Bill.  Surely we do not regard these people as subversives.</P>
    <P>The people are frightened but they may not be as frightened of the gunmen as they are of the powers being sought by the Government under a further extension of the Offences Against the State Act.  It would be wrong to underestimate the dangers of the gunmen, not because of their numbers but because of their ruthlessness and because they have shown that human life is of very little value to them.  Any time they have been challenged to ascertain how much support they have in the ballot boxes, they have shied away from the test.  One of the happenings in the North should lead us <Col N="307" /> to be very wary in this part of the country. I happened to be in Northern Ireland in August, 1969, and when the British Army arrived they were welcomed by the Catholic community.  The IRA did not exist in Northern Ireland at that time and it was not until the harrassment and oppression by the British Army began that the IRA began to gain support.  Oppression breeds support for the IRA and if we are to continue with this type of legislation it will be the only possible way that I can see of the IRA gaining any support in this part of the country, not because people would agree with the methods of violence but because they would be opposed to a Government that would inflict this type of repressive legislation on them.  They may be working towards different ends but the methods can be stranded together and in that way can be used as a cover for the men of violence.  It is extremely dangerous to introduce repressive legislation.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that one is against violence or against the IRA and no doubt the Minister will wish to know what we intend doing about the IRA.  We are convinced that if the Government had faced up to their responsibilities during the past three years we would not be threatened today by people whose desire it is to overthrow our democracy and who are prepared to use violence to achieve their political ends.  Instead, we have had a policy of stop-go in so far as action against illegal organisations was concerned. There was a little harrassment or an odd prosecution here or there when it suited, not the country, but the interests of Fianna Fáil.  As a result of these cat-and-mouse efforts the IRA became more powerful, more arrogant and more successful.  Now we are faced with a threat that could have been avoided purely because the Government would not implement the law they had at their disposal because it did not suit their political ends to do so.  Now when it appears that it does suit their political ends to do so, this is what is produced.</P>
    <P>It is marvellous how some people in Fianna Fáil can identify the needs <Col N="308" /> of Fianna Fáil as the needs of Ireland. They consistently manage to do so.  There are people who are concerned and there are people who are frightened.  I have never indulged nor wished to indulge in civil war politics. Civil war was one of the greatest tragedies that ever happened in this country.  The Fianna Fáil Government found it politically impossible to deal with the IRA over the past three years.  It was possible to deal with them as far as our laws were concerned but the real stumbling block, the real barrier to dealing with the situation was the political advantage of Fianna Fáil over that period.  I speak about the civil war for two reasons.  I have never spoken about the civil war in my political life before but I am probably more qualified to speak about it than most people in this House for two reasons.  I have been a member of this party since my early youth and this party was not born out of the civil war and did not take part in the civil war as a party and none of my immediate family took part in the civil war.  We are now told by the Minister that this legislation is necessary to deal with illegal armies.  The first illegal army in this country was formed and led by men on those benches some of whom are still on those benches and if some of them are gone their sons or nephews are on those benches.  The mould in which the present day Provisional IRA was cast is the mould that Fianna Fáil made.  Again, Fianna Fáil first, Ireland second.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Government is incapable for those reasons of dealing with the IRA through any democratic means.  The only chance we have is to have a general election. Let us have a general election.  You cannot deal with what is, in fact, your political illegitimate son, the present day Provisionals.  Go to the people. Let us in.  We will deal with them democratically.</P>

      <P>It is an ugly phrase and one which I do not want to repeat and one which he should not have used on the floor of this House.  Civil war is only history to him.  He is only quoting from hearsay anyway.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced by the Minister in good faith.  Normally, he would have no wish to introduce such a Bill but we find ourselves in unusual circumstances.  It seems strange to hear the Fine Gael spokesman say that we have adequate laws to deal with illegal organisations at the moment. It seems strange from the point of view of practical politics at any rate to suggest that the common law or, indeed, the criminal law can deal with the activities of illegal groups, illegal groups which we know are well-organised, well-financed, better than ever before, illegal groups which procure arms from any country from which they can do so.  It seems strange to hear the argument trotted out by the leading spokesman for the Opposition that we are not enforcing the law that is there at present.  I have heard this <i>ad nauseam</i> after every dinner and every outing which those spokesmen attended.  But the public are listening in, too, and the public are becoming aware of the fact that those spokesmen do not ring true when they say this.  I can call up as evidence the fact that when we tried earlier to strengthen the code of criminal law in this part of the country we did not find the necessary support in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I would make in this connection is that it was stranger still to find the Minister having to come to the House to clear the air and make a statement, first of all, on the import of the Bill and try to kill some of the super-speculation engendered by a number of people who are disaffected anyway and who never profess <Col N="310" /> to see anything good in this House or in the institutions of this State.  One could agree with Deputy Cosgrave when he said that there are people here, unfortunately, who never recognised the institutions of this State under any Government.  We are far enough away in time from the differences of the past not to recognise this. It is less than good to begin to talk of the men who have gone before us. They have made their mistakes; they also had their great points.  We shall make mistakes and perhaps we have some good points also.  Therefore, when we come to judge a Bill like this we should judge it on its merits and in relation to the time in which it is presented to this House.</P>
    <P>I have heard a good deal of soft talk from jelly-bellied politicians in the media moryah representing certain interests of the Fourth Estate.  This was alleged to be an onslaught on newspapermen and on the media, but is it not strange that the media so recently committed the indiscretion of going to some lengths to bring into focus the opinions of the most desperate men in the community?  The Government are blamed for taking measures to deal with those in charge of the media.  At the present time, having regard to the fact that we are so near&mdash;if you like&mdash;and yet so far away from solving this internal problem of Partition, it was strange, in view of the fact that for the first time in 50 years a Taoiseach was visiting Downing Street with reasonable hope, there should be a low campaign of this description fomented at home behind his back.  The Government would not be a Government at all if they did not take action to curb those who knew what they were doing, knew the import of bringing violent men on the screen from North and South, men who for far too long have been dabbling in the affairs of government, so to speak, and who have for far too long thought that they represented the views of the people, not the Government.</P>
    <P>Is it not enough, for example, that last week here Deputy Thornley expressed the view that the media had a role in excess of the Government? This statement was made on the floor <Col N="311" /> of this House and it shows the extent of the knowledge of some of its Members in regard to the whole matter of government and governmental institutions.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Cosgrave when he says that the forces of the State should be behind the Minister at this point in time and should be seen to be fully armed not merely with weapons of defence but with law also.  I fully agree that it is the only way in which we Members of this House, if we are to survive or if the institutions of State are to survive, can bring an end to the eternal problem I have mentioned which has afflicted us for 50 years and is calculated to cause what some people like to call patriotism mixed with a good dash of gangsterism.  If people have split minds on this matter it is time they made up their minds finally and in such a way that they will see to it that when we are so near to solving the problem we shall not be broken at this stage.  I have no hesitation in saying that there are many people here who, for one reason or another, would like to break the effort of the Government to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>This is one of the amendments of the Offences Against the State Act.  In the 1940s when an amendment was made to this Act we had a state of emergency, with war surrounding us, but I submit that the present time is no less dangerous than then from many points of view because, to my mind, while we politicians are trying to solve the problem the violent men North and South might get the opportunity of shooting it out and seizing power on both sides of the line.  Therefore, it is time to bring home to the people the necessity for law, no matter how strict it may be.  No person, unless he is a lawbreaker, need fear anything in this Bill.  That is the message we should get home to the House and to the country. No person, unless he is a semi-criminal or a lawbreaker, need be afraid of the contents of this Bill.  We always have amongst us the jelly-bellied politician. Someone mentioned priests here.  You have jelly-bellied politicians amongst <Col N="312" /> the clergy, too, and do not forget it. It does not intimidate me for one moment that students from any part of the country would start walking and talking because that is all they will do anyway.  It may be a laughing matter to some Deputies but it is not a laughing matter.  It is an attempt to brainwash certain timid people in this community and we should reject it once and for all.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not designed, as the Minister clearly indicated and as is clearly indicated in the Bill itself, to infringe the liberty of any person, unless it be that this person sets out to infringe the liberty of the State and the fuss which was generated about the sentencing of the news editor and the attempt made to propagate the notion that the Government had some evil ambition to trample on the right of the Press to comment or the right of our miserable media to comment should be exposed for what they are worth.  We got along very well in this country in the past, even when the British were here, when we had not got friendly newspapers and when we had no media.  The people of the country were able to make up their minds as to what was right and what was wrong in relation to the country as it then stood and I assume that at this point in time it will not be so easy to brainwash them as the media may think.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, I am submitting that those who professed to see trouble in this Bill, who set out to point out that we were going to circumscribe the liberty of the person have not proved it.  They have not proved it on the floor of this House and have not been able to prove it outside up to now.  No doubt they have gone a long way to try to pull it to bits and to take sections of it out of line and out of context, but it has not happened so far, and I have a shrewd suspicion that people here who have the interest of this part of the country at heart, who want to see its institutions preserved, who work in it, whose future lies in it, do not want at this point to see it wrecked by bombs, by rockets or by subversive activity. Whatever may be said of the Government&mdash;it is not acting as the Fianna Fáil Party in the House, although one <Col N="313" /> would think it was; it is referred to as the Government&mdash;or its leader, we have all the parties supporting the Government in the main and we have shown no reluctance at any time to face up to our responsibilities and to implement any law which we think is calculated to contain subversive activity.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go over the Minister's script, although I could do so if I wanted to, and to point to some of the statements which were made against it.  We had a number of examples but we had one glaring example last Saturday night in the city of Dublin when we had imitators of their counterparts in the North laying a bomb and causing considerable damage not merely to the building but to life and limb which is more important.  I want to know if those who speak so loudly against this Bill want to see an extension of this activity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It may, perhaps, bring home to citizens of Dublin where the soft-bellied politicians would lead them in the end. We should find ourselves, as happened in many other countries, in the grasp of the strong fellows with the smoking guns.  We should not wait for that to happen because then we should be too late to talk because the other fellow would shoot first and talk after. Fortunately, I suppose, we get the name of talking a good deal&mdash;we are politicians&mdash;but no matter how the guns roar, at the end of it all the politicians or people akin to politicians have to get around the table to talk with whoever will talk at the time.</P>

      <P>In 1939 we brought forward the Offences against the State Bill.  It became law.  There were amendments before the Bill was enacted. There was an amendment to it in 1940. I remember reading at that time about the fears expressed by its opponents. They feared that we were going to have a police State with knocks in the middle of the night, the tramp of policemen coming to the door, the cold hand being laid on the back of the neck of some unfortunate and he, in turn, being frog-marched off to the nearest detention camp.  When I hear of this I go back to my younger years. My first reaction is to roll all this up in a ball and say it is a lot of bunk. One should not do this, because the apostles of this sort of propaganda often prevail on certain sections of the community that they are right and everyone else is wrong.  We heard at that time lamentations about the dreadful fate that was about to befall the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> Subsequently, in the course of my duties in the Army I guarded those people in the Curragh and I often said to my colleagues: &ldquo;I would love to be able to change places with them.&rdquo; I am speaking from practical experience and not fiction.  This does not come out of a storybook.  The opponents of this Bill, whatever benches they may be on, will want more than stories from storybooks to convince either this House or the people that this is a superfluous Bill.  It is far from it.  We are speaking to the men with the guns.  The guns bark first and the men talk afterwards.</P>
    <P>I can wind up this argument by stating that no person need have any fear of what is contained in this Bill when it becomes an Act except those engaged in illegal activities and those engaged in forcible entry or shooting down innocent people, laying bombs or such activities.  Is there any Deputy on any side of the House who wants to encourage such activity?</P>

      <P>I thought I had &ldquo;frozen off&rdquo; the Deputy but I have not, and if he wants to come again I may do so.  I do not want to.  I am asking is there any Deputy who wants to see illegal activity sprouting and growing further?  If there is, then he will vote against the Bill.  If there is not, he will vote for it because in my opinion it is the quickest way that I know of killing off illegal activity and killing it off without infringing on the rights of the people who are not engaged in this type of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were as convinced as Deputy Carter that this could deal with the illegal organisations and not interfere with the rights of the individual I would be very enthusiastic.  I am convinced that this Bill is rich fertiliser for anarchy and will stimulate illegal activity and further rioting in the streets, maiming people and damaging property.  I am against it. I propose to prove that in the course of my arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Carter is blind to what has happened in the North of Ireland over the past four years where the <Col N="316" /> price of excessive repression and abuse of the law has been death, anarchy, the destruction of society and the institutions which are meant to serve that society the rest of this country is not, nor is the rest of the world. One does not get people to respect the rule of law unless the lawmakers pass laws that can command the respect of the society they are intended to serve. There are two things necessary to get respect for the rule of law.  The first is the enforcement of the law and the second is the acceptance of the law. It is because the law of this land has not been enforced over the past four years that we now find ourselves in the pit of anarchy.  It is the Government's inactivity which has forced them into a situation of producing a Bill which, on the Minister's admission today, in some respects does no more than repeat existing law.  It is done to create a camouflage for their own inactivity over the past four years.  They say the law was unenforceable and inadequate.  They now pretend, by this piece of deceitful pretence, to suggest that given this they can put right all that is wrong.</P>
    <P>This Bill is bad.  It is evil.  It is oppressive, dangerous, excessive and open to abuse.  This Bill, and particularly section 3 (2), is tantamount to internment, using the courts as a camouflage to the Government's intention. In the much-abused Offences against the State Act, 1939, it was provided that internment could not be brought into operation until such time as the Government made a proclamation declaring that the power conferred by Part VI of the Act was necessary to secure the preservation of public peace and order.</P>
    <P>The power of internment is a dreadful power and one which should never be resorted to in any society until the process of law has entirely collapsed. Then it should only be used after the Government accept the collapse.  That is what the Act of 1939 says.</P>
    <P>The Minister today makes a similar declaration, but not as required by the Act and not as required by the European Convention of Human Rights which does not permit internment except when the security of the State and the very existence of the State are in <Col N="317" /> peril.  I say that this is internment without trial because the process suggested in this is not one which gives an accused or a suspected person a fair trial and, internment <i>simpliciter,</i> will at least have the merit of being identifiable for what it is, a cruel Act, and this particular proposal, which is deceitful, by being deceitful, is bringing the whole process of law and law enforcement into disrepute.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that the Government have some difficulty, mainly of their own making, and, like all governments that may have been in difficulties before in this country, the present Government has within it, may still have within it, supporters in this House, people described by the Taoiseach as people who were not above the taint of suspicion that they were involved in a conspiracy against the law to import arms into this State for the purpose of using those arms unlawfully.  This is why the Government have been reluctant to enforce the law, because they depended upon, and still depend upon, the support of their own subversives, of the people who have the taint of guilt on their hands.  We saw those hands today, those guilty hands, those hands with, in the Taoiseach's words, the taint of guilt upon them; they did not applaud the Minister for Justice when he sat down.  Deputy Haughey and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil back benches did not applaud the Minister because they did not believe in the Minister's intenation and they did not want to help the Minister in his alleged intention of crushing the forces in this land that would destroy our society and, with it, the people in it.</P>
    <P>It is simply not good enough to have to sit here and listen to the rubbish we had this evening from Deputy Carter, suggesting that it was only Left Wing Pinks who were opposed to this Bill. This party throughout their whole history&mdash;and this was acknowledged by a most unlikely admirer of this party recently on BBC television, Mr. Seán McEntee&mdash;are a party who have always stood for and fought for, even when it was unpopular to do it, the institutions of this State.  We do that still today, not because the institutions of <Col N="318" /> this State have any particular merit as institutions&mdash;what merit they have is the merit of protecting individuals&mdash; but because we have a twin obligation in this House, in this democracy of ours, an obligation we, in the Fine Gael Party, have never shirked, the obligation to protect the institutions of the State and the rights of individuals.</P>
    <P>The health of any State is the sum of individual rights.  Tamper with those rights, belittle them, as Deputy Carter did, and you belittle your own society. You damage your own society.  You interfere with its rights.  You do not hold them in the regard in which you should hold them and that means that the institutions do not hold them in regard either and everybody suffers as a consequence.  Damage done to one is damage done to all.  That is a principle that is unfortunately not respected in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Government are not faced, as Governments were in the past, with subversive opposition in Parliament. They are not faced with any parliamentary subversion so far as the present Opposition parties here are concerned. That is why we can uphold the rule of law and insist upon the rule of law being respected.  That requires that fundamental principles are not trampled upon and that, even if they have to be temporarily put to one side, the Government ensure that this is done so that people will know that there is an emergency and the people will watch the situation so that, when the emergency is over, they will see to it that these Draconian powers are taken back from the Government.</P>
    <P>In our amendment, as originally tabled, we expressed as a ground of opposition to the Bill the fact that the dangerous powers conferred by this Bill would have no duration in point of time.  There is no limit upon the right of any Government at any time, even at a time when no emergency exists, an emergency such as now exists, to use these powers.  The powers given under this Bill will be everlasting powers and will remain fully operative until they are removed from the statute book.  The powers of Part VI of the 1939 Act are operative only when there is a declared <Col N="319" /> emergency.  But that will not be the position in the future.  A person can be convicted on the belief of a police officer of the rank of superintendent upwards.  I notice in the Bill it is provided that this power to give evidence on the basis of belief alone is a power to be conferred on chief superintendents, but section 3 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, provides that any power which can be conferred on a chief superintendent may, by order of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, be conferred on a superintendent.  Therefore, where you see &ldquo;chief superintendent&rdquo; in this Bill you must read &ldquo;superintendent&rdquo;. I noticed that the Minister was at pains to explain that the evidence to be offered would be superintendent's evidence, not chief superintendent's evidence.  An omission, deliberate or accidental?  It does not matter very much.  It is just one of the true things in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister was at great pains to paint a picture of the responsibility and the integrity of officers of the Garda Síochána.  He was quite right to do that.  We have no wish, and no inclination, in our party to besmirch the character, reputation, skill, devotion to duty and courage of members of the Garda Síochána of all ranks.  We are very lucky to be served by such an independent, courageous, dedicated and hardworking police force.  But the very image any member of the Garda Síochána has in a court is a threat to an innocent person.  This is not to criticise the system; it is simply to draw attention to the reality, to the weight that most people, particularly courts accustomed to hearing evidence offered by gardaí, tend to attach to that evidence.  There is a particular weight and credibility attached to evidence offered by members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Now the most dangerous person in any society is probably the sincere, dedicated servant who is convinced of his own absolute rectitude, who has no degree of doubt about the probability of any error on his part.  There is great danger, judging by the picture so vividly depicted by the Minister <Col N="320" /> today, that evidence of members of the Garda Síochána will be accepted, no matter what rebutting evidence is offered by an accused person.  As Deputy Cosgrave said, we would have no occasion to weep if any guilty person was to be caught by this legislation, who could not be caught by any other legislation, but it is not necessary to have this threatening, intimidating, dangerous and excessive legislation to catch 99 per cent of those who are wreaking the harm and the damage and the evil in our midst at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter suggested, as I mentioned earlier, that it was only the dangerous Bolshies who did not approve of this.  Does he include amongst those the Social Democratic and Labour Party?  Does he include the Nationalist Party in the North of Ireland?  Does he include Mr. John Brooke of the Unionist Party who says the legislation is immoral?</P>

      <P>There are world-wide organisations which are concerned with ensuring universal respect for human rights.  Human rights are superior to national rights anywhere.  They are the rights of man and no Government, no society, no State has the right to trample upon human rights.  We are obliged by international conventions not to derogate from our obligations to give people a fair trial.  We are obliged by international conventions not to find people guilty before they are convicted.  This Bill is tantamount to saying that people are guilty and must prove their own innocence.</P>
      <P>We are also required not to deprive people of their liberty without due process of law, except in the case of an emergency which must be identified by the Government by a declaration notified to the European Court of Human Rights.  The Government have tried to steer as close to the wind as they could, but I believe they have gone over the precipice.  Therefore, this legislation is threatened with destruction first of all in our own courts as being unconstitutional, and in the European Courts and possibly elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Have we to wait until the Government get this vicious legislation before they will act?  One fears that is the position and that, until they have this open cheque, they will not face up to their responsibilities and will not use the multitudinous powers already available to them to deal with subversion in our community.  This Bill is a repetition, to some extent, of existing law and, where it is not a repetition, it makes the existing law more dangerous. The Fine Gael Party, as Government speakers have acknowledged, have called again and again for several years past, for the enforcement of the law. We are satisfied that the law is already adequate to bring about a state of peace and order in our midst, and throughout the whole island in so far as we have any control over what happens in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> Therefore, it would be inconsistent with what we have already argued over the past three years were we to give support to this Bill.  We say the law is already adequate and, therefore, we cannot lend our name or our votes to this piece of camouflage which is set up in order to justify the Government's misconduct when they had power to act in the past.  I will conclude by repeating my conviction that this legislation, if passed into law, will provoke more insecurity and more violence and more damage to our society than would be provoked if it were not.  The remedy is to use the existing law.</P>

It does not matter whether they are members of illegal organisations <Col N="323" /> or not.

Yet, last night although there was no change in the law, 70 people could be picked up all of a sudden and brought to court this afternoon, because the Government have decided to enforce the existing law.  Why have they not done that for weeks and months and years past? There have been innumerable occasions when people in public places have unlawfully carried and used guns in the presence of members of the Garda, recognised by members of the Garda, and they have not been prosecuted. Why?  That is for the Government to answer before they ask us to give them this measure which they will use, no doubt, in as selective a manner as they have used or not used the powers available to them before now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney reminded us today that contrary to the Offences against the State Act, legislatures have been making proclamations and issuing invitations to Members of this House and Members of the Government to attend.  Was there any prosecution? Was there any attempt to collect information which could lead to a prosecution in relation to these unlawful assemblies?  No, there was not.  Yet all these powers are on the Statute Book and freely available at any time.  It does not require the declaration of a state of emergency to bring those powers into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why have they not been brought into operation?  Because there are still subversives on the Government benches who are keeping the Government in office.  Now they are endeavouring to blackmail the country, having brought it into the pit of anarchy and mischief in which it now is through their inactivity. They are trying to blackmail <Col N="324" /> us into bringing in laws which would make this a totalitarian State.  They will not get them.  Even if it meant a general election instantly, and a wiping out of the Fine Gael Party we would go down in history&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because we stood up for the rule of law.  The cynics and the sneerers and those who do not give a damn about human rights professed every conceivable form of subversion when they were out of office, and in office they set themselves up as holier-than-thou people who never sullied their minds, their hands or their feet with any form of subversive activity. This is the price we have to pay for the history of Fianna Fáil from which they cannot escape.  That is why I was touched, as I believe many people must have been touched, when Mr. Seán MacEntee, on television recently, acknowledged that he and his colleagues were wrong in having civil war in this country because that helped to sow the seeds of the harvest that is still being reaped in this country in the mutilated bodies that still barely live, in the dead bodies that lie in graves, in the property that has been destroyed and, above all, in the twisted minds of young people still growing up through this twist and damage that has been done to their character which leads us, 50 years after we have achieved our freedom, to have to listen to a Government wanting to put on our statute book something that no other country in the world would dare introduce today, except perhaps South Africa, and in South Africa they have even said that if they had the powers of the Special Police Act in the North of Ireland they would be happy, that their powers are not really as grievous.  What must they feel today when they see the sovereign, so-called democratic, open free society in the Republic of Ireland bringing in a piece of legislation which the most extreme right wing of the Unionist Party have found to be immoral?  It is a shameful day for Dáil <Col N="325" /> Éireann that we should have to listen to the kind of excuses made for such bad legislation.  We do hope the Government will think wisely before proceeding further with this matter.</P>
      <P>There may be some areas requiring strengthening.  They can be strengthened without performing any more evil. But far far better would it be to postpone this Bill for three or six months and enforce the law in the meantime and, if that were done there would be no need for this legislation because the proof would be there that the law was already sufficient.  The process of introducing this began last week before a member of the IRA was convicted of being a member of that organisation. That was about three weeks after the Minister for Justice said it could not be done.  It is about eight months since he sent me a letter saying it could not be done and expressing the view that the Provisional IRA in 1972 and the Official IRA in 1972 were possibly not the same organisation as had been proscribed in 1939. If that be so, why did the Minister not use the power available to him in the Act of 1939 to proscribe the Provisional IRA, 1972 edition and the Official IRA, 1972 edition, or any other organisation of 1972 vintage or any other vintage which he regarded as being a subversive organisation? This will have to be done if these weaknesses are there.</P>
      <P>We have been told that the Minister and the Government were labouring over the summer to produce a very difficult and comprehensive Bill to deal with this emergency.  Methinks the mountain has laboured and has brought forth, not a mouse but a rat, a very dangerous, cornered rat, which is ready to jump upon the liberties of our people.  That is a shameful and disgraceful situation.  Perhaps the picture appeals to the sense of humour, twisted or otherwise, of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a fraud.  It is not needed for the purposes it purports to be needed for. Deputy Cooney, in the very fine, remarkable speech with which he opened for the Fine Gael Party, has demonstrated that and Deputy Cluskey in a very fine statement from these benches also.  I do not propose to cover the same ground as they have done.  I do not believe that is necessary. But, I do want to get one thing on the record, that is, Deputy Cooney in his statement gave a number of examples, and they were impressive examples, of cases which the Government had the power to cope with and have the power to cope with clearly under the existing law.  He gave details of such cases.  I want the Minister to deal in detail with those cases and explain to the Dáil why he did not see that the law was enforced in relation to these cases. He has a duty to do this when he comes before this House and demands new, exceptional, drastic, extraordinary legislation.  He needs to account to us for what he has done with the legislation he actually has which includes the very wide, drastic powers available to him under the Offences against the State Act, powers far wider than most governments in western Europe or in North America <Col N="327" /> possess and which he has not been using.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have discovered the IRA menace in 1972 and Deputy Carter is now pounding the table about it.  There was precious little pounding of the table or anything else last year.  I will come back to that.</P>
      <P>The Government do not need these extraordinary powers for the purposes for which they purport to need them. What do they need them for then, because we must assume they do not act without a purpose?  Their purpose is not always, or even often, their avowed purpose but they do not act without a purpose.  They are&mdash;we concede that to them&mdash;a rational Government though the ends they pursue are not the ends they claim to pursue.</P>
      <P>Why, then, this Bill?  What are its real objects as distinct from its ostensible objects?  I would list them as three.  The real objects of this Bill are (1) to refurbish the Government's law and order image.  This is all connected with images.  It is a cosmetic. The objects are (1) to refurbish the Government's law and order image; (2) to provide a retrospective alibi for the Government's inaction to date and (3) to try to put the Opposition in a position where their responsible concern for the rule of law can be misrepresented as covert sympathy with law breakers.  These are the three real purposes behind this Bill.  This is why it has been introduced and I want to discuss them.  I do not intend to take up much of the time of the House.  We are not making any effort to protract the debate although we could do so.  We are simply making the points we want to make and we will make them as concisely as we reasonably can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the first objective, to refurbish the Government's law and and order image, there really is a big need for that.  In his opening statement the Minister said that the Government's duty is clear&mdash;to bring in this law.  When did it become clear that it was the Government's duty to do something about the IRA?  Was it clear in 1969 or in 1970 or 1971? Was it clear to them in the first six months of this year?  In all these <Col N="328" /> periods and particularly from the onset of the Provisional IRA's ghastly offences, beginning early in 1971&mdash;18 months ago&mdash;the threat of these organisations has been very clear and the powers in the Government's hands have been very clear also.  Their curious reluctance to use those powers has been noted by every observer both in this country and outside. Suddenly the Government's duty becomes clear.  It is very clear that the people are extremely fed up with and revolted by the IRA and in particular the Provisional IRA and their continuing campaign.  The Government are aware of that and wish us to refurbish their law-and-order image.  That image needs some refurbishing.</P>
    <P>A Government party Deputy has implied that the Opposition over here are sympathisers with bombers and he inquired whether there was any Deputy in the House who would justify, approve or in any way condone or support the activities of these organisations.  There is a Deputy in this House who was a Minister for Finance during the period 1969 to 1970, during which time large sums of public money appropriated by the Dáil for the relief of the distress in the North were applied to the creation of distress in the North by the supply of weapons and ammunition to people there whom we believe to have been the Provisional IRA.  The Provisional IRA were put in business by members of that party, including some who are still members of the party and including some who will probably vote for this Bill thereby indicating and stigmatising its hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>I will illustrate that this sympathy still continues.  Last summer in one of the few interventions that he has made in this House since 1970, Deputy Haughey interrupted a speech of mine.  In passing I had quoted some words of Yeats about living where motley is worn.  Deputy Haughey interrupted me repeatedly, calling on me to complete the quotation. I did not choose to complete it at that time but I will complete it for him now and illustrate its implications now that the Government and the <Col N="329" /> party to which he belongs and of which he is vice-president are on their law and order jag.  The completion of the quotation were those words of Yeats referring to the 1916 deaths: &ldquo;All, all are changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty is born.&rdquo;  What is the relevance of that terrible beauty to the events of our own time? Where is this terrible beauty being born?  What can that be but a reverence in a romantic and exalted sense to the IRA campaign?  Of course it is that.  The sympathy with those organisations is still among some people over there and, of course, in refurbishing the Government's law and order image, that is also a function inside their party.  Mr. Haughey is to be obliged to humiliate his republican principles by voting for this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in restoring him to that.  There were all these long months and the years of first actual collusion with the Provisional IRA, helping to set them up, providing them with a propaganda machine, encouraging that split in the Old IRA which produced this new, most virulent and destructive strain among them under the guise that it was a good, clean, Catholic non-Marxist form of IRA and which would be active only in the North. There are a lot of people over there who sympathise with that point of view.  Some of them will probably be honest and vote against this Bill while others probably will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That period of collusion, of helping to set up the institution in respect of which they now pound the table and say it is a terrible menace to the State, was followed by a long period from May, 1970, until now of turning the blind eye to the activities of the IRA. What IRA?  There was no menacing crisis then.  There was no clear duty on the part of the Government in respect of the IRA.  The Government's duty became clear only when it began to look as if the Provisional IRA were being beaten and that is part of the reason behind this.  Suddenly <Col N="330" /> the Provisionals have become a terrible menace, justifying the most extraordinary legislation but when they looked to be in pretty good shape as they did for a long time, and when the Government Press was suggesting that they were winning, there was no move against them.  The Government's law-and-order image needs refurbishing indeed and this Bill is an effective means of doing that.  We do not underestimate the Government's ability.  We would be foolish to do so. There are purposes behind this Bill and these purposes are astute.</P>
    <P>The second reason for the Bill about which I wish to say something is to provide a retrospective alibi for the Government's inaction today.  That is important.  It is central to the purposes of the Bill.  The Government have been telling the public and telling the British Government, when they get a nudge from that quarter&mdash; they have been getting some strenuous nudges recently&mdash;that they have been doing their best to get the IRA but that under the existing law, although it includes the drastic Offences against the State Act, they cannot get any evidence against them. They are saying that our Special Branch comprise some of the most astute minds in Europe but that they cannot find any evidence connecting Mr. Seán Mac Stiofáin with the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word about that.  Are we to believe that before the Kevin O'Kelly interview there was no comparable evidence concerning that gentleman's connection with that organisation?  I do not believe that and neither do I think that anybody else in the country believes it.  The Government moved against Mac Stiofáin when they judged the time to be ripe politically to move against him.  The charges were prepared, the evidence was there and he was convicted.  We are not against the Government's decision to move against the IRA. The point we are making is that the Government can make such moves under the existing law, that they do not need these extraordinary new laws which are capable of indefinite extension to do what they could have <Col N="331" /> done at any time under the existing powers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney has provided plenty of evidence for that.  The purpose of this is for the Government to say in answer to the British that we are moving against the IRA now but that we could not have done so until we had this new legislation.  In other words they are saying that this new legislation sets free their hands.  This is what I refer to as a cosmetic operation in favour of the Government's image.  They are telling their critics, including the British critics, that they have been doing all they could under the existing law but now when they are about to look for real results they need to justify their past stand by bringing in this legislation.  That is a large part of the purpose of it.</P>
    <P>The third purpose of this legislation is to place the Opposition in a position where their responsible concern for the rule of law can be misrepresented as covert sympathy with lawbreakers.  We have heard that as we had expected.  In this Chamber within the past 30 minutes Deputy Carter presented the classical black and white Fianna Fáil picture: &ldquo;We stand for law and order.  You, if you oppose this Bill, are against law and order.  You are the friends of the bombers.  You favour people who planted that bomb in O'Connell Street.&rdquo;  We are going to get that. That is the full treatment we are going to get.  We have already got it in this debate.  If the Government have to go to the country, as they may over this, we will get it at the hustings but each and every one of us, including the many Deputies on this side were criticising and denouncing the IRA when those gentlemen over there were either entirely silent or covertly encouraging those bodies. We are now going to be painted into the corner: &ldquo;You are the friends of the IRA&rdquo;.  They are going to be pushing that around.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carter's attempt to taint us with sympathy or support for the people who planted the bomb in O'Connell Street or the people we think planted it, whoever did it, is an absolutely despicable charge.  It will, of course, be passed over silently by the smoother men on the front benches over there who affect not to have heard those black-guardly charges when they are pushed out from over there.  We will get this.</P>
      <P>Nothing could be more removed from the truth than the idea that we favour the IRA.  Deputy Cluskey got that on the record at the beginning of this debate.  I voted for the Prisons Bill.  I voted for the transfer of certain prisoners into military custody.  We did not attack the setting-up of the special courts.  I myself publicly argued that in circumstances where there is or can be intimidation of witnesses and jurymen there is justification for courts sitting without a jury.  We said that and some of us incurred considerable unpopularity for saying it.  It was not a position that could have been adopted by people who sympathised with the IRA, who supported the IRA, who were in collusion with the IRA.  The IRA themselves have handsomely acknowledged that by their references to some of us and what we have said.  We are not going to be tarred with that brush now.  Nobody will believe the attempt to depict us in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the whole Opposition was prepared to concede any necessary strengthening, virtually the whole Opposition, of the Government's <Col N="333" /> hand and if what the Government wanted was a real strengthening of their hand&mdash;I do not think they do need it; they have all the power they want&mdash;the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, could have called on Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish and said: &ldquo;We need this&rdquo; and if what he proposed was reasonable, and he could discuss the matter confidentially with them to show that he did need it and just exactly why he needed it, I believe we could have had the Government's hand strengthened to the necessary and reasonable degree by consensus and that that would be immensely better in relation to law and order, the security of the State and the future of our institutions, the safety and security of our people, than what the Government now propose to do, to rush this Bill through, whatever its defects, by their naked majority if on this issue they have a naked majority and we do not know who is going to vote with them.</P>
    <P>They have been playing, as they have done before in different ways, Fianna Fáil politics with the security of the State and the lives of the citizens.  They did that in the past in one way.  They did it by collusion in the period 1969 to 1970 when the Taoiseach is supposed to have not known what certain Ministers of his Government were doing, what they were up to, and they were supposed not to have known what happened to that £40,000 of public money that was misappropriated.  They played Fianna Fáil politics in that way in those days.  For a long time after that, in fact, up to this autumn, they played Fianna Fáil politics with the security of the State and the lives of the citizens in another way, by turning a blind eye to the IRA saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What IRA?&rdquo;  and: &ldquo;The menace is greatly exaggerated&rdquo; implying that it was only happening in the North, it would not spread down here so what about it?  It was a period when several Deputies over there, including at least one Parliamentary Secretary, were expressing, in the corridors of this House, sympathy with and admiration for the actions of the Provisional IRA in Northern Ireland. <Col N="334" /> That is a fact and I do not think anybody will contradict me on it.</P>
    <P>Those two ways of playing Fianna Fáil politics with the security of the State&mdash;first collusion and then turning a blind eye&mdash;are used up.  Law and order is the thing now.  Why? Because the Government know that the popular mood is strongly for law and order and when that mood is there the Government will move into that area and, if possible, try to discredit the Opposition within that area, become the party of law and order, forget the Republic.  The Republic is no longer where it is at.  We will hear very few republican speeches from over there for some little time to come.  It is now law and order.</P>
    <P>Speaking of law and order, we do not believe that this Bill is a way of supporting or asserting law and order. It may support a kind of order in the sense that internment did.  It does not support law but, in fact, brings it into disrepute because it obliges the court to convict people without what is regarded as evidence in common law.  It is no way of asserting law and order to try to assert order without law or by serious encroachment on the legal tradition within which we live, and this is a tremendous encroachment, particularly sections 3 and 4 of this Bill, on what we regard as law, as the long legal tradition of this country.</P>
    <P>I want to be very clear about this. I believe the State in defending itself, in defending the security of its citizens and of democratic institutions, has a right to curtail certain freedoms.  It has a right to curtail them only to the extent that is absolutely necessitated by the extent of the threat in question. I agree we have here a very serious threat, a continuing threat, to security and to life but the Government, we contend, have always had the powers, including drastic emergency powers, to deal with that situation and that they have not done so is not due to any lack of this legislation which they suddenly discovered very near the end of 1972 is the key to the situation, the only way of dealing with the IRA.  No. They had the powers and they are now making a quite unnecessary encroachment <Col N="335" /> on the ordinary laws.  I think they have made the Bill deliberately as drastic and repellent and repulsive to anyone concerned with civil liberties as they could have made it in order to force the Opposition into the position where they had to oppose it.  We had to oppose it.  When I received the text of that Bill, I did not have my mind made up in advance that anything coming from over there intended to deal with the IRA must be opposed automatically. I did not.  I read the Bill with care.  I read it in the beginning with hope that it would be a serious Bill, that it would seek for the Government such powers as I thought I could reasonably support their having because I realise fully the extent of the threat to the security of the State and I do want to help the Government to have such powers as they actually need to deal with that.  I showed that by my vote on the Prisons Bill and by many, many public statements.  But I read sections 3 and 4 of that Bill and I said: &ldquo;I cannot possibly, without utterly discrediting myself, do anything save support a stand by our party, which was a unanimous stand by that party, against this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the Government had that in mind, a combined operation: refurbish our own law-and-order image and throw the odium on the Opposition of supporting legislation which we will then maintain to be absolutely necessary for the security of the State and the protection of the lives of its citizens.  The motive that is behind this Bill is a low, party-political motive and not the high motive of defending the security of the State which the Taoiseach will assert at the hustings throughout the nation with all the bland plausibility of which he is such a master.</P>
    <P>We also have this in mind: this Bill gives extraordinarily wide powers, powers possessed by no police force in western Europe or in North America or in any of the countries with institutions similar to our own. This is intolerable.  It is not good enough to tell us that our gardaí are a fine body of men and, of course, they will not abuse these powers.  In <Col N="336" /> common with almost every other Deputy I have a great regard for the gardaí: I think they are one of the best police forces in Europe.  They have a decent regard for people, with the odd exception that you will find in any police force or body of men.  I would have as much confidence in them to wield such power as in any other body but I would not give powers capable of that degree of abuse to any body of men for two reasons, first, because the possession of drastic, arbitrary power is in itself a corrupting thing.  Acton says: &ldquo;All power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&rdquo; This is not absolute power but it is a very big shot of power suddenly to give to a chief superintendent.</P>
    <P>We may say that the Garda as they are now would not abuse this power. I believe that; I do not think they would abuse it.  I do not think our chief superintendents would abuse these powers now but this Bill, if we make it an Act, will be law for a very long time.  Unless a new Government comes in to repeal it, it could be law for a very long time and we do not know what further drastic changes may come in the whole context in which we live, a context where democracy, the rule of law, our traditional freedoms are threatened from two sides.  They are threatened by the illegal organisations, by the IRA and most notably by the Provisional IRA which this Government and the governing party have done so much to set up and which is, as Deputy Cluskey so well said, the illegitimate son of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>That is one set of threats, from out there, from the illegal organisations, their threat to our institutions, to our liberty.  But there is a second threat and we must never lose sight of both threats.  The other threat is the overreaction of this Government in this most recent phase of their activity when they suddenly become converted to law and order and particularly order&mdash;their own kind of order; their erosion, their intrusion and destruction of the degree of autonomy legitimately and rightly possessed by RTE <Col N="337" /> and now these drastic powers reverting the onus of proof in certain criminal cases.  In these ways our democracy and our freedom are being eroded and curtailed, cramped, constricted and distorted so that we do not know, if this process goes on, in five or ten years' time just what kind of police force we may have.  We do not know either what the relation of the Government party to the police force may be; powers that would not be abused this year or next year may well, in future circumstances, be abused and the abuse might come pretty quickly.</P>
    <P>When this House voted for the Broadcasting Act, 1960, for example, did anybody imagine that section 31 would be applied in the way it has been applied?  Did anyone think that a Minister in a Government could set a trap for a whole authority, in the form of an ambiguous directive, could refuse clarification of that directive, and could then sack the whole authority when in his opinion that directive had been contravened?  I do not believe anybody thought that power could be so used under section 31, but legally the power existed and the Government shrugged off the convention which had hither to been supposed to regulate this relationship with the authority.</P>
    <P>That is part of the reason why we cannot support this Bill, why we must oppose it and try to get over to the public the reason why we are opposing it&mdash;not because we have the slightest sympathy for the IRA, either wing of it, not because we deny the threat to the security of the State which they represent but because we regard the Government as having failed in their duty in this matter and we regard them as now compensating for their worse than failure&mdash;their collusion&mdash; by invading our democratic freedoms by weakening the law and order of this State under procedures which purport to defend it.</P>

      <P>My intervention will be short and is made mainly for two reasons: first, to endorse in every word and every sentence the introductory speech made by the Minister for <Col N="338" /> Justice here this afternoon.  Secondly, it is made to indicate so far as my coming into the House at this stage can do so, that every member of the Government and every member of our party is fully in support of the measures in this Bill, no matter how much those who oppose it with bitterness, even almost with threats, will say, that it is an O'Malley law, it is a Fianna Fáil Government law.  I want to say categorically and emphatically that I shall not permit any individual member of my Government to be pilloried by those who have taken to the streets under banners of different guises, with different trade union and other labels on them.</P>
      <P>We have been asked why we introduced this measure.  Deputy Cooney indicated that he thought it was not necessary.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, whom we have just heard, said that it was because we wanted to wrong-foot or embarrass the Opposition Parties in some way in relation to the possibility of a general election.  I suggest they have already wrong-footed themselves, Fine Gael by their shilly-shallying support or non-support of the measures in the Bill and the Labour Party by identifying themselves directly with the Provisional IRA organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We do not care how we embarrass the Opposition or in what way the Opposition suggest to us that we are trying to wrong-foot them.  We have introduced this legislation only because we believe it is necessary in present circumstances.  Deputy Cooney, to give him his due, did try to give a reasoned statement as to why it was not necessary.  It was, in my opinion, a well-prepared and what I might call theoretic legal speech suggesting that because section so-and-so said one thing and another section said another thing, what is your problem?  Our problem is this, that we are the people who have to implement the law on the ground, so to speak, not the Opposition. We have to stand up and be counted; we have to stand over whatever we do; and we have had to try to implement the law in the interest of the country over the past three years and in certain particular instances it has been found that it was not sufficient as it stands to do what the people want us to do in relation to illegal and subversive organisations.</P>

      <P>This is one of the flaws in Deputy Cooney's argument.  He referred to section 52 of the Offences against the State Act, which is the section that enables a member of the Garda Síochána to ask a person as to his movements in certain circumstances and if that person refuses to give an account of his movements then &ldquo;he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment&rdquo; for a certain term.  This Act was passed in 1939 before we became members of the Council of Europe and before we ratified the European Convention on Human Rights.  We are advised now <Col N="341" /> that this section is contrary to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights and that if we acted on it, any person who was convicted under it and sent to prison or in any way disadvantaged would have a right of action before the Court of Human Rights against us.</P>

I was in the House for some hours today and he was not in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming now to section 52.  Deputy Cooney says that we could operate as effectively against members of illegal organisations on the basis of that section, in conjunction with section 30, and therefore this measure is not necessary.  I have given an indication why it was not possible for us to operate section 52 and we have been operating section 30, whereby persons suspected and not <Col N="342" /> even having been suspected, could be arrested and detained for 24 hours and if necessary, on the certificate of a high Garda officer, the period to be extended for another 24 hours.  We have used that section continuously in the recent past.  Within the time limit available it was necessary to bring a charge against a person in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>In many cases we had to let off those who were arrested under section 30 and it was not possible to bring a charge because of lack of evidence or because the evidence available would not stand up in court and therefore we were, as I might even say, humiliated by having arrested people known to be members of the IRA, people who had given Press conferences and who had paraded themselves as members of the IRA.  As the House is aware, known leaders of the IRA were, because of the deficiency in the present legislation, acquitted by the courts and that as recently as last week.</P>
      <P>May I come to the point which Deputy O'Higgins has made?  A prosecution was successful against Mr. Mac Stiofáin last week.  It was successful, but only on evidence of the contents of an interview recorded on a tape that was played to the court for 45 minutes.  Most people heard and everybody knows by now the contents of the limited broadcast of what was contained on that tape.  There was evidence far above what would normally be available to a court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to it in a minute and I hope you will be proud of your activities.  There was evidence there for the court, a fair court of trial&mdash;far more evidence than would normally be available in similar cases&mdash;so that there is no point in making the case that because one conviction was got as recently as last week, this Bill is now unnecessary. It is necessary and that kind of evidence would not be available and normally is not available in prosecutions against those people who are well-known to be members and leaders of the different branches of the IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> Deputy Cooney also said that we had other means of enforcing the law against those people who hold themselves out as setting up opposition parliaments.  Deputy Cooney did not go far enough because it is only when these people purport to legislate, I am advised, that they come in conflict with the law.  At the moment Dáil Uladh and Dáil Chonnacht are just talking-shops.  They do not presume or purport to legislate for anything. They have not, to that extent, infringed the law.  That is my advice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney suggested that we have not taken action against demonstrators. There were demonstrations in different parts of the country, and particularly one outside the Curragh in the middle of the summer, when people attacked physically members of the Defence Forces.  As Deputy Cooney knows, prosecutions have been brought against those people. Convictions have been got and sentences and other penalties have been imposed.  At this very time there are many more of these cases standing adjourned in District Courts in different parts of the country because it was not possible to bring them further before now, for one reason or another. There have been convictions.  Is it not obvious that when 500 or 1,000 people come armed with sticks and other weapons to an area like the Curragh, and outside police stations, that it is impossible for the Garda or the Army to arrest or apprehend every one of them?  The leaders of those people are not those up in front.  They are not the people who carry the sticks or stones.  They are carefully behind and when it comes to getting up on the platform they are seen, but without sticks or bars in their hands.  I suggest to Deputy Cooney that it is not possible to arrest all those people and, in so far as it is, it is the &ldquo;small fry&rdquo; who are arrested, leaving the &ldquo;big shots&rdquo; behind.</P>
    <P>The main argument against this Bill, as it stands, is that the contents of subsection (2) of section 3 gives these extraordinary powers to members of the Garda Síochána.  I am not going to go into the legalities of this <Col N="344" /> to any extent.  It is a long time since I practised law and it has become considerably rusty as a result, but I remember that when evidence is given by anybody in any case, civil or criminal, it is evidence that may be accepted or rejected by the court. That is exactly what is happening here.  The chief superintendent, if he goes into the box and says that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, AB is a member of an illegal organisation, that may or may not be accepted. It can be just as readily rejected as accepted by the courts.  It is not conclusive and certainly does not have this Draconian content which is being suggested.  I do not want to say more about the details of the Bill. The Minister for Justice will deal with it in summing up, in so far as it has been attacked in any great detail.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this, I took a note while a Deputy was speaking earlier today in reference to the Mac Stiofáin case where it was suggested that this legislation was not necessary now in the light of the result of that case. Even since then, another well-known IRA person&mdash;or, perhaps, I should say another well-known person who is believed to be a member of the IRA, a lady, has been charged with incitement and membership.  She was acquitted on the membership charge notwithstanding her fame in these activities.  She was convicted on the incitement charge and got a sentence which dated back from the date of her arrest and terminated on the date of judgment of the court.  That is a fact and is an indication that a person of that calibre and of that fame in the organisation got off scot-free on that particular charge.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that it was the lack of will on the part of the Government which has caused the ineffectiveness of the law and if this Government had the will to invoke the law as it stands, then it would not be necessary to introduce this piece of legislation.  I suppose we can interpret that as meaning &ldquo;if they have not got the guts&rdquo;.  We have the guts to introduce this Bill.  How does one square that with the suggestion that we had not the will to <Col N="345" /> do these things before when we have the will to do this now?  Would it not be far easier for a person who had not the will to rely on the law as it was and continue to put the Garda and others in the position of seeing case after case being brought and acquittal after acquittal being given in the courts?  We have the will and will continue to have it.  The people opposite cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>There is two-way traffic in Fine Gael.  The members of the Fine Gael Party in particular have been saying from time to time that in so far as we want help from them we will get it.  On the 13th April, 1972. Volume 260, No. 2, column 174, of the Official Report Deputy Cooney, referring in particular to Mr. Mac Stiofáin, says:</P>
      <P>He is described as Chief of Staff of what I would call the woman beaters, the Provisional IRA.  Again, the fact that our Government will tolerate this is indicative of their philosophy and indicative of the approach, the softly, softly approach, which they have towards these people.  They seem to be always looking over their shoulder in some fear that, if they take action against these groups which are subversive and which have threatened this democracy they are not being true to themselves and they are in some way being anti-national.</P>
      <P>This is what we are doing today.  Is it not being true to ourselves?  Can it be suggested that we are anti-national because we are bringing in legislation of this nature?  Deputy Cooney also said:</P>
      <P>I would hope that, in the course of this debate, many more Deputies from the Minister's party will rise here and encourage him to take firm and positive action in dealing with these subversive organisations.</P>
      <P>What else are we doing on this occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 5th August, 1971, Volume 25, No. 19, column 3450, of the Official <Col N="346" /> Report Deputy Garret FitzGerald said:</P>
    <P>... if this Government can come to this House at some stage and say &ldquo;we went through trial by jury; witnesses were intimidated, juries were intimidated, and we had to introduce special Criminal Courts. We did that; we charged people, but the scale of the problem is such that we are now threatened with civil war and the only solution is internment&rdquo;, the Government will get from this party support in that action&mdash;then and only then; but it will get that support when necessary because this party has always stood by any Government no matter how much it is opposed to it, which acting properly and with due process, seeks to protect the liberties and lives of our people and the society in which we live.</P>
    <P>There is a serious situation in this country.  We do not want to impose internment.  We are not intending to impose internment in this Bill, but we want to do something far less and we want the help from the Fine Gael Party that they promised through so many of their speakers.  Deputy Cosgrave on many occasions&mdash;and I have several quotations from his speeches&mdash; has said as Leader of the party that he will give us whatever support, by way of new legislation, if necessary, is needed to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>We are now looking for that support and it is, apparently, going to be denied us.  We have indicated and, indeed, we have proved the difficulties we have, difficulties Deputy Garret FitzGerald spelled out so eloquently. We went through everything. Our courts have not been effective. Juries have been intimidated.  Witnesses have been intimidated.  The Special Court itself has not been successful because, as I indicated, the rules of evidence prevented that court from bringing in convictions against known leaders of the IRA.  Therefore, having proved our difficulty&mdash;I can assure Deputies opposite that it has been a serious difficulty indeed&mdash;we had no alternative but to take steps to cope with the difficulty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> As I said at the outset, we are the people who are operating this legislation on the ground.  It is we who have to stand over everything we do and, not being able to do what we should do in the manner we would like for the protection of our people, we are asking Dáil Éireann to help us to ensure that we will have the necessary means of protecting our community. The people against whom this legislation is directed have been active in many parts of the country, but particularly in the North.  They have turned their guns now on the security forces of this State.  Everybody knows they have.  We have had a close experience of their bombs.  Not in Belfast and not in Derry but in Dublin people have been maimed.  But that is not the only reason why we should introduce this legislation.  The lives of the people in Derry and Belfast should be, and are, as dear to us as are the lives of innocent people in Dublin.</P>
    <P>These people, as I say, have detonated their bombs within a few hundred yards of this House.  Will they next turn their rockets on targets in this part of the country?  The fact that they have done it in another part of the country, a part over which we do not, unfortunately, exercise jurisdiction, should be sufficient reason for us to take effective action to curb now these activities to the best of our ability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien very rightly said that freedom was not unlimited. Liberty is not unlimited, but the safety of citizens must be unlimited. If what has been happening is allowed to go on, how can we, without adequate powers for dealing with the situation, guarantee in so far as we can the safety of any citizen?  In my statement yesterday I referred to what we regarded as a threat presented by the situation generally, apart from the incident to which Deputy Thornley referred.  I said that the issue in the present case&mdash;I can expand that by saying &ldquo;the issue at the present time&rdquo;&mdash;is nothing less than whether Parliament, Government, the courts and the law have all <Col N="348" /> to surrender to an unlawful organisation. The challenge to the institutions of the State is direct, deliberate and unmistakable.  The Government have no choice but to meet it.  We propose to meet it and we want to be helped in meeting it by passing this legislation.</P>

      <P>There is no justification for the continued operation of the Offences against the State Act.  There is no justification for the special courts.  There is no justification for muzzling RTE.  There is no justification for the Prisons Act.  Certainly there is no justification for this Bill. Recently the Minister for Justice, on television and other media, referred to the difficulties in achieving convictions in our courts.  When he was asked what he would do about it, the general tone of his reply was that he was finding it very difficult to produce legislation which would help him, but that he was working on it, and hoped he would be able to introduce this legislation within a month.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this Bill does not give the powers which the great majority of the people who are protesting and will continue to protest against it believe it does.  He said the only innovation is the provision in relation to the evidence of the chief superintendent. After all, we are talking only about a particular chief superintendent. His evidence is to be admissible. If the difficulties the Minister was talking about to the British television audience, and other audiences, are to be surmounted by this legislation, surely we must accept that the inclusion of the admissible evidence provision is very significant?  It is not just an extra little piece of evidence that can be brought in because all other matters must be related to it, and related to the judge's decision.  In framing this legislation the Minister wants to select which individuals in our society are to be put behind bars and locked away.  The Government are setting about doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> The Government may have to interrupt the housing programme to house the number of people who object to this Bill, and to house the people the superintendent and the Department may wish to remove from our society. I charge that the Government have been engaged in a deliberate campaign of trying to provoke a situation in which the people of Ireland will accept that this legislation and the continued use of the Offences against the State Act are justified.  Since the Taoiseach visited Chequers a little over a year ago, this type of provocation has developed to the point at which it is today.</P>
    <P>These people in Derry felt three years ago that they had a second guarantor ready to back them in a doomsday situation.  The Taoiseach said that we have no jurisdiction, unfortunately, over the people within the Six County area, but I wonder does he mean it?  They are now looking at what we are doing in this Parliament. They remember the Taoiseach said on television that he would not stand by and allow what was happening then to continue.  These are citizens under our Constitution.  What are they to think when they see us proposing legislation which goes beyond the Special Powers Act in the Six County area?  There are two differences.  Within the Six County area Her Majesty's Government operate, and within the Twenty-Six County area a native Irish Government operate. That is a hell of a difference, but unfortunately we have reached the stage where it makes no difference.  I daresay that my voice will not be heard too strongly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get this on the record.  I am still a junior in the political field and if matters were expounded by people who are older than I, and longer in politics, perhaps their voice would carry more weight, but I will leave it to my constituents in Dublin South-West, and to the rest of the people, to decide who will be listened to now.  I consider it is a lie and a lie that is being promoted by <Col N="353" /> the Government, being promoted by the so-called Opposition in this House and a lie being promoted by every journalist that refers to the IRA as being a threat to the security of this State.  I do not accept that the IRA have proved themselves to be a threat to the security of the State.  What I would say is that they are certainly a threat to the security of the Six County area, which has no parliament at the present time because the people saw to that, which is, in fact, in a warlike situation declared by Mr. Maudling.</P>
      <P>I remember incidents like the incidents in the Ballyshannon area where the Government ordered members of the Garda to force themselves into a situation where they might antaganise a protest meeting, a public meeting, in order to get the justification necessary to be able to introduced legislation similar to that introduced today.  The Government have failed to do it.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was preparing to go to speak at the Oxford Union debate he knew he was going to speak to the British Premier the next day. He knew very well he could not face the British Premier, especially after the Munich talks, without doing something in relation to what instructions he certainly was given on that occasion.</P>
      <P>Let us understand very clearly that Seán Mac Stiofáin, unfortunately not now, was up to his arrest the No. 1 British enemy within the Six County area and the Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, was, indeed, told this by Mr. Heath, although Mr. Heath did not seem to so regard him when he had Seán Mac Stiofáin and other members of the IRA movement within the Six Counties and operating within the Six County area over in England with him not too long ago.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach surely must have agreed that if he were to strike a blow, in the collaboration that is obviously going on with this Government and the British forces in the Six Counties, he must go to the top and he must arrest the man who, as I say, has been regarded by the British as the No. 1 enemy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me digress here slightly and <Col N="354" /> say that a couple of weeks ago there was the 50th commemoration of the death of Erskine Childers.  I am not quoting from the <i>Sunday Press</i> but on that day the <i>Sunday Press</i> had an article giving details of how it came about that Erskine Childers was arrested, how it came about that he was convicted.  That article referred to the fact that this man was an Englishman.  It talked of the British propaganda at the time that this man was a British spy and it also made mention of the dubious nature of his involvement at the time.  All the propaganda was geared to convict Erskine Childers and to execute him. Without meaning to imply any remarkable parallel between Erskine Childers and Seán Mac Stiofáin, let me say that recently and over the past 12 months, the calculated attempt to influence the people of Ireland, North and South, that Seán Mac Stiofáin was a British spy, that Seán Mac Stiofáin was an Englishman and therefore how could he be on the Irish side, shows great similarity with what was said of Erskine Childers.  I do not think people could say anything about Erskine Childers or his patriotism towards this country.</P>
    <P>It is not unfair for me to say that Government Ministers and, indeed, Fianna Fáil Deputies, have been going around the country over the past 12 months whispering of civil strife, whispering of what would happen if the IRA took over the country.  This is all part of a deliberate attempt to foment trouble in this country.  As I have said, in my opinion the IRA, in spite of all the provocation, did not in fact show themselves to be a threat to the security of this State. Indeed, when Deputy Cooney mentions mini-Dáils, <i>et cetera,</i> he is making the same mistake as other people have made in confusing what Sinn Féin is and what the IRA is.</P>
    <P>I should like to clarify a matter, that the IRA would cease to operate, would cease in fact to see their existence to be necessary, in the event of a 32-county election and whatever government the voters would elect would be the government that any citizen of the 32-County State would support.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> Let us not try to fly the kite that when the IRA have succeeded in their operations within the Six County area, in a war that Mr. Maudling has declared against the Irish people, that after that is demolished they will turn on the 26 County State because let us understand clearly that, whether we like it or not, in the event of the Six County situation being complete, we will be in the situation that an entire new Ireland can be produced and can be developed and can be in a position to elect its own entire Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's actions in stabbing the Citizens Defence Committee in the back in May, 1970, initiated the violence within the Six County area because, let us take our minds back to the situation that existed at that time.  The British Army had just arrived within the Six County area and the British Army were clearly in the position of trying to keep both sides of that community at peace.  The British Army up to that point in time had not taken sides.  But, facts are facts and the fact is that when John Kelly was arrested by this Government, this native Government, the violence of the British Army showed itself very clearly.  I do not know the reasons for the Taoiseach's actions and his Government's actions in attempting to spread this violence over the whole country. When I asked the Taoiseach yesterday, by way of supplementary question as to the threat to the security of the people of this country if Seán Mac Stiofáin should die&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Taoiseach certainly did not answer my question but he referred to the 600 and 700 dead in this country.  He did not say the 600 or 700 dead within the Six County area, over which we have no jurisdiction.  He did not call it, as he usually calls it, Northern Ireland.  He did not separate or try to separate the deaths for which the British Army the SAS and British spies and forces within <Col N="356" /> the Six County area were responsible. Indeed, we have them in this community of ours as well.  He did not separate the deaths publicly proclaimed as the responsibility of the UDA and other extreme Protestant forces within that Six County area. He clearly gave the impression, or tried to give it, that the whole 600 or 700 deaths in this country were at the behest and willingness of the IRA.  That is a very dishonest and a very wrong attempt for the Taoiseach to make in this House.</P>

Let your minds go back to the statements of the Catholic minority within the Six County area who endorsed that defence.  They did not have at their disposal the Saracen tanks and the other equipment and ammunition that was available to the British.  They were forced to resort to other forms of warfare to fight the war that Maudling had declared.  In the face of the offensive operations of the British forces they had to be offensive also.</P>

      <P>If this Bill is enacted it will not be necessary to prove charges in order to obtain a conviction. This proposal is more sinister than internment which at least is honest in so far as it is a declaration that the authorities wish to have certain persons removed from society and placed without trial in an internment camp.  This Bill purports to give a fair trial but the Government know that it will give them the power, on the evidence of a chief superintendent to say that a man is a member of <Col N="357" /> an illegal organisation and to imprison him on that account.  In other words, the Bill provides a dishonest means of introducing internment.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether any members of the Fianna Fáil backbench who, since 1969 and indeed, in a couple of instances prior to then, boasted of the help they gave to the Catholic nationalist majority of the Six Counties, could prove before a court that they were not members of an illegal organisation if a chief superintendent were to say that by virtue of their handing over shotguns or rifles they could be described as having been members of the IRA at that material time.  How can any one of us prove that he is not a member of an illegal organisation?</P>

      <P>It appears that with the assistance of, perhaps, a free vote on the part of Fine Gael and others, this Bill will go through.  Maybe some Fine Gael Deputies will be lost and, consequently, will not be here to vote. This is a clear opportunity for the two main Opposition parties to do what they threatened to do at other times and that is to remove this Government from office.  I am sure that Fine Gael in particular will endeavour to avoid this opportunity of forcing the Government to resign because they do not want an election.  I challenge them now to do what they ought to do as an Opposition.  There is very little opposition in this House to this proposed legislation.  The difference would appear to be merely a matter of timing.  The Fine Gael spokesman on Justice said that there were adequate measures within the Offences against the State Act for the bringing of convictions.  Therefore, there is no real difference in the approach of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  It is a disgrace to this House that the only real opposition to the Government and their acts is coming from those people who are now outside the gates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is typical of what has become an <Col N="358" /> outstanding characteristic of the Taoiseach's administration that the Government cannot introduce internment openly.  Up to the time of the arrest of Seán Mac Stiofáin their attitude was that if we do not do anything, we cannot do anything wrong but the Taoiseach had to meet Mr. Heath and had to report to him on what action he had taken since the Munich meeting.  He had to let Mr. Heath know what he was doing by way of collaboration with the British forces in the Six Counties.  The Government's attitude on these matters has been never to do anything in a straightforward way if there is a crooked way of doing it.  If it is the Government's purpose to endeavour to avoid the outcry that would follow the introduction of internment in the Twenty-six Counties, I wish to tell them that they are not succeeding because the people who are outside the gates this evening and all those people from factories in my constituency who walked to this House yesterday evening to ask me and other representatives from Dublin South-West to oppose the Bill are all aware that this legislation would provide the Government with the means of introducing internment.</P>
    <P>The Bill as proposed is an infringement of fundamental rights in that it dispenses with the need for proof in order to obtain a conviction.  The measures that are proposed under this Bill are more repressive and more dictatorial than is internment and this is a matter that should concern every one of our citizens.  Following the enacting of the Prisons' Bill, there was the setting-up of the special courts and this was followed by an announcement from the Minister for Justice, which has been put into effect since, that those who oppose the Government policy of full scale collaboration with the British are to be harassed by the police.  This Bill is a major step in that direction.  On that point I asked the Minister for Justice recently whether he would be prepared to make a statement about a search carried out recently in the house of a member of my party in Cork. Very arrogantly, the Minister's reply <Col N="359" /> was &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  That is the answer I got after waiting for two weeks and when I agreed to accept a written answer. The individual concerned is joint general Secretary of Aontacht Éireann. Can I interpret the search on that private citizen as implying that Aontacht Éireann is an illegal organisation?</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed we will have acquired the same status as Greece and communist countries.  The Garda, not I think that they are too happy about the situation, are being unashamedly converted into part of the political establishment.  I should like to raise here a recent debate in the House of Commons on the thoughts of a British Army officer by the name of Kitson on how Government and security forces should collaborate with one another.  The British House of Commons did not endorse what this man was saying.  They rejected this man's thoughts.  They were described by that Parliament as the elements of a police State.  We have gone beyond what even Mr. Kitson was suggesting. We are on the brink of a police State. Progress towards a full scale police State has been taking place for over two years and this is a giant step in that direction.</P>
    <P>It seems to me and, indeed, to the Leader of my Party, Mr. Kevin Boland, that this has been initiated by the Tánaiste who blatantly attempted to interfere with the course of justice in the arms conspiracy trial in 1970. At that time when five people, including two Members of this House, were awaiting trial on a charge of conspiracy, the Tánaiste, with complete disregard for the elementary principles of justice, went on television and attempted to prejudice the mind of every potential juror in the country by describing two former Ministers as conspirators.  Section 4 (1) (b) of this Bill reads:</P>
    <P>A statement, meeting, procession or demonstration shall be deemed to constitute an interference with the course of justice if it is intended, or is of such a character as to be likely, directly or indirectly to influence any court, person or authority concerned with the institution, conduct <Col N="360" /> or defence of any civil or criminal proceedings (including a party or witness) as to whether or how the proceedings should be instituted, conducted, continued or defended, or as to what should be their outcome.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind what the Tánaiste did in 1970, if this Bill becomes an Act I wonder would the Tánaiste now be regarded as blatantly interfering with the course of justice.  In fact, even without this Bill I think what he did was against the law.  He said these things when these men were awaiting trial and by implication three other persons awaiting trial were also classified as conspirators.  The law was, as is not unusual under the present Government, selectively applied.  The Tánaiste was guilty.  He was not charged, nothing happened and he got away with his stunt.  The course of justice was, in fact, proven and the jurors, in accepting the evidence presented to them in court, did come up with a decision which did not suit the Tánaiste, which did not suit the Government. These men were found not guilty of the charge of conspiracy despite the fact that prior to the case coming into court the Tánaiste had described them as conspirators.  This was no less than contempt of court.</P>
    <P>From that time on the Government, mainly through the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, have been complaining about the restrictions placed on them by the laws of evidence, the difficulty of proof, the system of trial by jury&mdash;we have got rid of that&mdash;and the independance of the judiciary.  We have had trial by jury done away with.  We now have the three judges in the Special Criminal Court.  Following that there is the problem of securing convictions because the Government want these people out of the way.  They cannot prove it in the normal way, so they have to bring extra provisions into the law to prove that these men are what they claim them to be.  This is what the Government are doing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It may be too late when the public realise what the Fianna Fáil Government are doing.  When these safeguards are gone it will be too late because <Col N="361" /> the very difficulties the Minister for Justice speaks about are the fundamental rights of the people.  Trial by jury for selected offences has been abolished because juries persisted in deciding cases in accordance with their oath in bringing in true verdicts based on the evidence rather than bringing in verdicts as demanded by the political powers that be.</P>
    <P>The rule of law within which even the Dublin Castle regime was able to operate in dealing with the forerunners of the present subversives is being set aside in 1972.  If this Bill had been enacted one week ago every journalist in this city would be in clear breach of section 4 by virtue of their action in going on strike in support of Mr. O'Kelly.  Mr. O'Kelly has been convicted and his case is on appeal.  I know the matter is <i>sub judice</i> but the point I want to get across is that if this Bill was in operation last week every journalist by virtue of this fact could be held to be guilty and could be locked up.  Presumably the striking journalists would be likely to have the minor penalty imposed&mdash;£200, or at the discretion of the court imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both such fine and such imprisonment but I wonder what about the members of the Executive of the NUJ.  Would they be liable for the heavier fine of £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both such fine and such imprisonment?  It is reasonable to assume that the NUJ took this action because they believed it to be called for by the circumstances and that their action would not have been affected by the fact that it would make them liable to these penalties.  The question is: would these men have had this law invoked against them?  I am sure not but the intention of the Government in enacting this repressive, politically-motivated legislation is to apply the law selectively.  The Government will decide who is amenable to it and who is to be immune from it.  It can safely be assumed for instance, that the Tánaiste will still be free to use the television service in his efforts to prejudice further trials.  It can also be assumed that his action against the law will not lead to the use of section 31 against him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> This repressive legislation may or may not be used against the ordinary citizen.  Why is it that the law which sufficed to suppress the United Irishmen and the Fenians is not sufficiently repressive and sufficiently capable of being loaded against the oppressed people in the Six Counties to satisfy the Fianna Fáil Government?  I think external forces are at work here, that external instructions are at work and that we must comply &ldquo;or else&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know what problems we shall have in the EEC but if we must do these things for money, for extra payments to keep the people of the west of Ireland happy, it is not worth while.  It is not worth it to have that type of commitment to Her Majesty's Government for support in a European Parliament for subsidies to help the farmers of the west.  I am certain that the authorities in Europe care little about the farmers of the west and about Ireland's problems.  I appreciate that I am going on to another subject but I am merely indicating that we are bending our knees and continuing to bend our knees, not to the Irish people but to foreigners.</P>
    <P>In order that the Taoiseach should not be ticked off by Mr. Heath, Seán Mac Stiofáin is now in the Curragh in a very grave condition without the best that medical science can offer.  I should like to make a strong appeal on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, on any grounds, so long as it gets through to the Government, that they should see it as their duty to avoid any situation that will increase the dangers within the Twenty-six Counties of civil strife.  I am convinced that the arrest of this man was a provocation calculated to react on or produce a reaction from the IRA elements in this community.  I hope that despite this provocation, despite the unjustifiable actions of the Government, the IRA will continue to direct whatever operations they have within the occupied part of the Six Counties.  I make no apology for stating that in my opinion the IRA are the only force that the Irish, Catholic, nationalist population of the Six Counties&mdash;where we cannot do a damn thing to help&mdash; have standing between them and the <Col N="363" /> Thompson machine guns of the British Army and, as Deputy Blaney has reminded me, of the UDA and the other extreme Protestant armies in the Six County area.</P>
    <P>It is not unfair for me to suggest that Deputies were pretty much annoyed that they could not get this Bill prior to last Monday.  They got it on Monday but I question whether the British Ambassador received it on Monday or prior to that.  I should like to know if the details of this Bill which we are going through the motion&mdash;that is all it is&mdash;of discussing were discussed in London recently when the Taoiseach met Mr. Heath.</P>
    <P>I do not desire to extend my time in speaking on this Bill but if this legislation is not to be selectively applied where will all the criminals be housed?  Where will they be imprisoned? People are protesting now and will continue to protest massively against this unjust law after its enactment, if it is enacted, if the President secures the decision of the High Court before he signs it.  They will protest and demonstrate against the decisions that will be made in accordance with this law without evidence. This law will fail.  It sets out to make every citizen who respects freedom a criminal.  In such a case the lawbreakers, the Government, are in fact the real criminals.  If this law passes, every right-thinking person must have contempt not only for this Parliament, not only for this Government but for the law in its entirety.  This Bill is worthy of the Greek colonels' regime on which the present Fianna Fáil Government are modelling themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to begin my contribution by repeating what both Deputy Cooney, our spokesman on Justice, and the leader of our party, Deputy Cosgrave said at the beginning of their speeches.  Fine Gael do not need to say it but on such a serious occasion as this we must say each time we speak that we stand for law and order.  We are the party that do not need to say that; our record over the years proves this to have been the case.  I shall not bother <Col N="364" /> scoring petty points but perhaps it is not too petty a point to say that there were times when other parties who have been in Government many times have not always adhered to that idea.  But Fine Gael, whether it lost them votes or gained them votes, always stood for law and order.</P>
      <P>The 1939 Offences against the State Act has a list of provisions which were read out today by Deputy Cooney and other contributors to this debate and I do not intend to refer back to very many of these provisions. But it was the view of our party in deliberating this matter that there were sufficient powers within the provisions of that Act, as continued by the amending Act of 1940, to mean that if the Government wanted to act against unlawful bodies in this country from 1969 on or at any time because the Act was never repealed or never by order put aside, they could have used this legislation to keep order in the country.  It is just as if I did not pay the tax on my car.  I would arrive in court at a certain stage, having been caught, and would be duly dealt with.  The truth is that in the entire period before 1969 and the time of the riots in the Bogside in Derry and the troubles since then the Government disregarded all sorts of unlawful comings together, all sorts of unlawful meetings, all sorts of printing of unlawful documents because it suited them politically to do so, but they always had the power.  That power was always there and it was used by the inter-Party Government in 1956-57 when I was here as a Deputy and after we left office in that year, the succeeding Fianna Fáil Government again used the 1939 Act to introduce internment.  That is the fact of the case.  Nobody in the House of whatever view who stands up to make a contribution to the debate can refute that self-evident fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There the Government stand in this position, that they used this parent Act of which this Bill is merely an amendment and had the power, if they so wished, to act against all sorts of unlawful bodies and all sorts of unlawful acts perpetrated by people or <Col N="365" /> groups of people.  I do not want to get into an argument with Deputy Sherwin because he has a certain point of view which I do not think is very common in the House and as far as I am concerned, he is fully entitled to have that view but we cannot disregard the fact, that in the past 48 hours and certainly in the past 72 hours, we had a policeman killed by a rocket and a doctor's son, a boy of 14, being driven to school by his father, shot dead in presumably an attempt, as I would hope, to shoot his father because it is bad enough to turn a gun on an adult but to turn a gun on a 14 year old boy in the presence of his father seems to be the lowest thing anybody could do.  We have also had two people killed in the Bogside in an explosion which could have been an activity in the production of gelignite or some of these things which apparently can be made from fertiliser and such.  This has been happening since 1969.</P>
    <P>I was in the Bogside in that year with the late Deputy Sweetman, Lord rest him, and Deputy Clinton.  We went around that area and saw the havoc wrought there, accompanied by Mr. John Hume.  We met Mr. Ivan Cooper and various other people and then went to Belfast and saw what had happened in the Shankill and in the Falls Road.  The damage done at that time constituted quite clearly not only a danger to the people of the North of Ireland but grave danger to the people down here and it would immediately have brought to mind in the deliberations of any responsible Government whether or not sections of the 1939 Act should have been used forthwith. Again, there may be people who would say that at the time they should not have been used but certainly the matter should have been considered, and from that time on whoever occupied the seat now occupied by the Minister for Justice should at all times have been considering what way the 1939 Act should have been used and would properly have been used to stop bloodshed in this country, in whatever part of it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made great play with the fact that he could not get <Col N="366" /> convictions in the courts and in what I am going to say now I want to make it quite clear that I am making no charge, no suggestion of a charge, against any district justice or judge.  I say that if there is dissatisfaction with any of these gentlemen, the whole patern of whose behaviour is meant to be at a level which is above influence by anybody, there is machinery in each court of the land by which such a gentleman can be interviewed and steps taken.  In other words, if there were district justices who were not doing their duty from 1969 on and if there were cases in which convictions should have been got, there is the head of the district court before whom a district justice guilty of such behaviour could have been arraigned and a discussion held about it.  The same would hold for the circuit court and I understand it holds also for the High Court. This was not done.  The machinery was there but this was not done.  If there was anything wrong with the courts, anything wrong in relation even to juries, the meaning of the position of head of the district court, the President of the Circuit Court and the other heads of the court is that even on the question of a jury situation, there could be discussion between the judge in the case in which the jury acted in a rather extraordinary way and the head of the court and this could have meant that the Government could have entered into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  What I am saying is that there is provision by which the Minister for Justice at the time could quite easily even on such a questiton as whether a jury had or had not acted properly have had a discussion between the head of the district <Col N="367" /> court and the justice concerned.  I am not saying that there was anything wrong with the justice.  I am saying that the opinion of such a justice could have been got in relation to a decision of a jury.  No such decision was taken by the Minister at any time.</P>
      <P>We now have had the Special Criminal Courts for some months and I understand that there have been over 100 convictions out of 140 charges, so it has not been going so badly.  The sentences imposed by these courts have been pretty stiff and such as to bring to anybody's mind who would have an unlawful act in mind a little doubt as to whether or not he would take the risk.  I want to know why is it the Government want this amendment Bill now.  The Taoiseach came in here and I thought that at the start of his contribution he was extremely weak. He talked about the Fine Gael amendment to which I will come later and said it was a shilly-shally amendment. I think he attacked a member of the Labour Party&mdash;two of them but certainly one&mdash;in a manner which was not very much in keeping with the office he holds.  I go no further than that because I am quite sure the Labour Party and the Deputies concerned can defend themselves, but it is my considered opinion, and I feel I am entitled to say so in this House, that he is perpetrating an untruth when he says that section 30, backed by section 52, of the Offences against the State Act, 1939 is contrary to the Convention on Human Rights and that they have had to bring in this Bill in order to change the situation.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote section 52 which supports section 30.  Anybody who wishes can read section 30&mdash;it is a long section and it would be unfair of me to read it out&mdash;which gives a right to a garda to question a person as to his movements.  This is supported by section 52 and the Taoiseach said, and is recorded as having said, that section 52 is contrary to the Convention on Human Rights.  I must read out section 52 and then the section which supplants it, section 2.  Section 52 of the Act of 1939 sets out:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" />  (1)  Whenever a person is detained in custody under the provisions in that behalf contained in Part IV of this Act, any member of the Garda Síochána may demand of such person, at any time while he is so detained, a full account of such person's movements and actions during any specified period and all information in his possession in relation to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence under any section or sub-section of this Act or any scheduled offence.</P>
    <P>(2)  If any person of whom any such account or information as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section is demanded under that sub-section by a member of the Garda Síochána, fails or refuses to give to such member such account or any such information or gives to such member any account or information which is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months. </P>
    <P>Now listen to what supplants this and consider whether the Convention of Human Rights in Strasbourg would consider whether the Convention of the House as more repressive or more in contradiction of human rights than what I have just read out.  I contend that it is far more repressive.  Section 2 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence which is for the time being a scheduled offence for the purposes of Part V of the Act of 1939 is being or was committed at any place,</P>
    <P>(b)  has reasonable grounds for believing that any person whom he finds at or near the place at the time of the commission of the offence or soon afterwards knows, or knew at that time, of its commission, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> (c)  informs the person of his belief as aforesaid,</P>
    <P>the member may demand of the person his name and address and an account of his recent movements and, if the person fails or refuses to give the information or gives information that is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £200 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>How can the Taoiseach come in here and say that section 52 would be more in contravention of the Convention of Human Rights at Strasbourg and that section 2 of the Bill before the House would not be so?  I wonder if the reason for having section 2 of the Bill before the House to supplant section 52 was so serious, if in fact it was in contradiction of the Convention of Human Rights and the Government were so advised why was it not included in the speech of the Minister for Justice?  The Minister for Justice came in with the Bill knowing it had been subjected to criticism all around the country over the last few days and he knew that he was going to get a rough ride, as newspapers said, and if so respected a body as the Convention of Human Rights could prove his case in respect of section 2 why did he not say so?  Why was it that the Taoiseach could come in here and start his contribution, in the worst of form and in bad humour which improved as he went on, and state this?  Why was it left to the Taoiseach to do that?  Why did the Minister not show his cards to the Opposition in this regard?</P>
    <P>I come to the further part of the Taoiseach's speech, nearing its conclusion, when the Taoiseach made great play, having at the start of the speech referred to the Fine Gael amendment as shilly-shally, of the fact that Deputy Cosgrave in particular, Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Cooney of this party had given full guarantees on previous occasions that we would support any measure that would bring law and order to this country.  They did so, and the Taoiseach's quotations <Col N="370" /> were quite correct.  The Taoiseach did not give any of Deputy Cosgrave's quotations because he said he had many quotations from him.  He would have if the people who look after his filing did their jobs properly.  The Taoiseach would have many quotations from Deputy Cosgrave saying that anything which would give law and order a fillip would get support from the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>In the last few months Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish have had consultations with the Taoiseach in relation to the North of Ireland.  There is extant in this House an all-party committee on the North of Ireland and the implications of unity for the whole of Ireland.  There was the machinery, if the Taoiseach wanted the full backing of this House, without any of the trouble which he has today, whereby all he had to do was to ask Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish to come in and he could say to them &ldquo;here in private and in consultation with you two gentlemen are the reasons why I need certain things put through this House&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach did not ask for the co-operation and, therefore, there is not much point now in his criticising these people if he is not getting that co-operation.</P>
    <P>This is not a party political matter. It is probably the most serious matter which has come before the Dáil since its inception, or even before earlier Dála.  It was the duty of the Taoiseach not to introduce a Bill giving the minimum period before the Second Reading, particularly a Bill which might or might not be accepted in the present national circumstances, when 600 or 700 people have been shot.  I do not mind whether it is an unfortunate Protestant boy or girl or a member of the IRA who is shot.  I would feel more sympathy for a non-member of these bodies.  I do not mind which side the shot person is on.  The tragedy is that 600 or 700 people were shot.</P>
    <P>If there is a national emergency now there was a precedent for calling in Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish. This has been done many times over the past few years.  There is an all-party committee on the North of Ireland.  If the Taoiseach wanted this legislation <Col N="371" /> through and to get more power, all he had to do was to call in these two Deputies.  This is clear evidence that the Taoiseach is interested in the survival of Fianna Fáil, not in the nation.  I want to say that it is my considered opinion that he was never interested in the nation but he is like 99 per cent of the Fianna Fáil Party in being more interested in the continued survival of the Government of Fianna Fáil.  They remind me of people who put Fianna Fáil on top, God second and themselves third.  That is the way some of them act.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach acted in this matter, which is a matter of the gravest national emergency, in a party-political way.  He need not come in here with a white face and a whining voice during the first five or ten minutes before he warmed up, and complain because he did not get absolute agreement with everything he has put before this House.  The Taoiseach's talk about the Fine Gael amendment being a shilly-shally amendment requires me to remind the House what the amendment is.  It says:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the ground that it contains matter which is unnecessary and excessive and which is repugnant to basic principles of justice and liberty and the long established fundamental rights of citizens.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we, in 1956-57, could get convictions, if we could put people in jail then, which is not a nice thing to have to do, and if the predecessors of the Taoiseach could intern people in the succeeding Dáil what more power does he want?  Can he answer that?  We say there is much that is unnecessary and excessive in this Bill and which is repugnant to the basic principles of justice and liberty and the long-established fundamental rights of citizens.  It is clear there are such things in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would back the Taoiseach and his party with my own party and would be very nearly tempted even to ask the permission of my own party to <Col N="372" /> go across the floor of the House on the question of legislation which will bring about an end to hostilities and to the senseless killing of people.  I lost my seat in 1957 and one of the reasons why I lost it was as follows.</P>
    <P>Two unfortunate young boys called South and O'Hanlon went up to Rossleigh Barracks and got themselves shot in an IRA activity.  The following Monday there was a meeting of Louth County Council.  I was a member. I was not at that time as politically astute as I am now.  Standing Orders were suspended and a motion of sympathy was proposed with the relatives of the two men.  I dissented; I was the only dissenter out of 26 members of the council.  I argued that if two young boys had been killed by a motor car outside the county council offices that Monday morning there would have been no vote of sympathy and what we were doing was in fact providing an incentive and giving encouragement for more young boys to go up to the North and get themselves shot.  Naturally I was heavily criticised in my constituency.  There was a wave of sympathy.  There was an election and I lost my seat.  At the funerals of Mr. South and Mr. O'Hanlon there were no fewer than 13 Fianna Fáil Deputies.  They did not lose their seats and, mark you, responsibility is something they should accept now and not use this House for party political purposes, trying to make people think that they are the angels and the saints and the others as Deputy Cruise-O'Brien said, are the devils in all this. I would go to the ends of the earth to stop the IRA, the UDA and every other subversive group anywhere in the country.  I would back Jack Lynch in going to Chequers and making whatever bargains he wanted to make.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach.  I regard all this exercise here today as just so much window-dressing in preparation for an election.  Why did the Government not want this legislation two years ago?  Why did they not want it after the deaths of 13 people in Derry?  Why did they not <Col N="373" /> want it when 40,000 people marched in Newry?  I was there along with other Members of this House.  The Government did not want it then because an election was not nigh.  The time is nigh now.  It may be next May. It may be next week.</P>
      <P>The proper procedure for the Taoiseach would have been to call in Deputy Corish and Deputy Cosgrave and, I am perfectly certain, with 18 years behind me in this House, that full co-operation would have been forthcoming.  However, if the ambition is to put party first, then proposed legislation must be scrutinised in every line, and have every &ldquo;i&rdquo; dotted and every &ldquo;t&rdquo; crossed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to return to the Bill now. All the Government need do is take the existing legislation and implement and enforce it.  If they do that they will get results.  They would have had results years ago if they had done that when they should have done it.  We had Deputies saying in this House today that nobody's house had been picketed by an unlawful organisation.  My house was picketed for three hours.  It did not worry me. I knew most of the fellows on the picket.  None would, I believe, have hurt me or my family.  But it was not so pleasant when one was away from home and returned to find that these people had been there.  The squad car arrived and naturally I asked the men to come in and sit down by the fire.  But it is a little disconcerting when one's ten or eleven year old daughter asks: &ldquo;Why have you the guards in talking to you?&rdquo;  That was not so pleasant.  The same night the Minister for Education's house was picketed and last week Deputy Hilliard's house was picketed.  Not a thing has been done about it though <Col N="374" /> the 1939 Act gives the authorities full power and there is a penalty of six months imprisonment.  I do not want people behind bars.  I know at least half of them.  I asked them on the occasion I mentioned: &ldquo;For God's sake, go away&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Had the Government wanted to take action when there were 500 dead they could have taken it.  The legislation was there.  Why do they want special powers now because there are 600 dead?  As far as I am concerned, the deaths of one, or ten, or 13 are as important as 600.  Consider how this Government, who now try to convince us that this legislation is necessary, have behaved.  People have set up in various places institutions which they call &ldquo;Dala&rdquo;&mdash; Dáil Uladh, Dáil Connacht, Dáil Mumhan, Dáil Laighean.  They allege these are proper institutions and the writ of this Dáil no longer runs.  Quite clearly, that action is an offence under the 1939 Act.</P>
    <P>Again, how many are there who can raise their hands and say they have never been offered a paper that certainly preached, if not outright sedition, such criticism of the State and the Government that went far beyond the definition of normal criticism and, at the same time incited to violence?  Maybe I myself am guilty.  Out of curiosity I have bought such a paper dozens of times. I know a Deputy who had occasion to go to the North quite recently and on his way back he suddenly bethought himself that there were several copies of a certain publication in the back of his car.  If he had not stopped and removed them maybe he would have ended up in Crumlin Road jail.</P>
    <P>All these things proclaim that the Government had the power but did not use it.  They did not appoint the special criminal court until this year. Were they waiting until the concentration of headstones reached the stage at which something had to be done?</P>
    <P>I say, without fear of contradiction, that what is agitating the Government is the fact that they have to face, first of all, a presidential election and, <Col N="375" /> secondly, a general election quite soon.  My hope is that the latter will come as a result of the vote on this Bill.  The sooner the better because I believe we will be able to prove to the people how craven this Government are in their political operations.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party have always been synonymous with law and order. The origins of Fianna Fáil were different. For a period they did not come into this Dáil.  I do not say this in criticism of them.  I am not interested in the past.  They were involved in a civil war against the then legal Government, Cumann na nGaedheal. Inevitably that brings them closer to the IRA.  They are affiliated with and very much in favour of the Old IRA. I am in favour of the work of the Old IRA for Ireland but not of the new organisations.  Whether they like it or not, whether it be through brother, son, uncle, third cousin, fourth cousin or friend, the Fianna Fáil Party in this House tonight are the nearest party to the IRA.</P>
    <P>Because the Fine Gael Party were forced into the position of being the Cumann na nGaedheal Government repressively putting down the Irregulars, or what was virtually the founding situation of the Fianna Fáil Party, they are synonymous with law and order.  We cannot get away from that. The youngest Fine Gael county councillor who gets up to make a speech at his first county council meeting talks about law and order.  Maybe he does not gain votes but that is what he talks about.  Because the Labour Party are the Labour Party they are very interested in the rights of individuals and in civil rights.  All over the world Labour Parties, or parties that are more Socialist than other parties, are more solicitous for the rights of individuals and for civil rights, for the simple reason that they are needed by the downtrodden.</P>
    <P>These are the three ingredients of the Irish stew.  The Government Party are closer than any other party to the IRA.  I do not think they could deny that, even taking into account the events of 1969 and the Arms Trial. <Col N="376" /> Because of their beginnings the Fine Gael Party are very close to law and order.  The Labour Party, of necessity, must always be most solicitous for civil rights and the rights of the individual. There will probably be a shot at an inter-Party Government in the next couple of months.  Would not the most wonderful thing a Machiavellian Taoiseach could do tonight be to split the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, if he could?  Would that not be the greatest move that ever was made? And as well as splitting them to do it in the name of law and order.</P>
    <P>These are the people who were involved in the most difficult party political situation themselves with several of their Ministers sacked in 1969.  Since then they have not done their job on law and order, notwithstanding the fact that they had the legislation available in the shape of the Offences against the State Act, 1939.  Would it not be the greatest political move anybody ever made?</P>
    <P>Would it not have put&mdash;not to refer to him as he is now&mdash;Taoiseach de Valera in his most Machiavellian mood to shame?  It will not succeed. In our reasoned amendment Fine Gael are not against what is required by the Government, when they can prove on Committee, that for the immediate restoration of law and order and the end of the activities of the UDA, whether in coming across and blowing up a fertiliser store in Donegal, or the activities of the IRA in blowing up something else somewhere else, or any other unlawful organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am deliberately not saying <Col N="377" /> that any of these organisations shot anybody, because to kill somebody is a dreadful thing to do.  Anything that is required the Fine Gael Party will give, but we want to be shown why.  I know that in the heel of the hunt the Labour Party will have the same idea.  If the Government think that by a piece of window-dressing they can split the Opposition and, at the same time, whitewash their own failure to deal with the IRA and unlawful organisations over the past number of years, they have another think coming to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's initial remarks were quite predictable and were forecast by speakers from these benches.  He insisted that this was a Government Bill and not an &ldquo;O'Malley Bill&rdquo;.  It is about time we saw some evidence of Cabinet responsibility.  We remember a recent case where a senior Minister in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet did not disclose certain vital information to the Taoiseach, which was of great consequence at a certain time.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was predictable when he criticised members of the Labour Party and suggested they were in some sort of association with the Provisional IRA.  He was not even gracious enough to accept the statement by the Deputy from this side of the House that he had no association with and no support for the Provisional wing of the IRA.  The Taoiseach accused the Labour Party, by inference if not directly, of being pro-IRA.  We predicted this type of accusation when the Bill was introduced. It is a short time since the Taoiseach and members of the Fianna Fáil Party were saying the opposite about the Labour Party and were describing them as anti-national and as felon-setters.  We are entitled, therefore, to say that the Taoiseach's only interest in intervening tonight, when he spoke about the Labour Party, was to cause mischief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach should remember when he talks about members of a political party that, in a very critical situation about three years ago, Deputy Blaney, who sits in the back of these benches, was a Minister in the Fianna Fáil Government and he <Col N="378" /> was making sounds and speeches which were not in conformity with the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party. All he got from this now tough Taoiseach was a slight reprimand when he met him in the corridors of Leinster House.  We also remember that Deputy Blaney could be contained in that party as an ordinary member when, in accordance with what he believed was right, he was making speeches that were not in accord with the speeches being made by the Taoiseach.  No action was taken.  The only way this tough Taoiseach and his organisation could deal with Deputy Blaney was to catch him out on some technicality about a national collection for the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>People in the South are concerned about the activities of illegal organisations. Members of the House who said that they had been intimidated by pickets have cause for concern.  I had pickets on my house.  I had intimidating phone calls.  I am a public representative and I must expect these things, as long as the demonstrations are kept within the law, and as long as violence is not done to any person, whether it is somebody from my family, or Deputy Donegan's family, or Deputy Treacy's family, or anybody else's family.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Taoiseach tonight did a service to the country when he talked about the people being scared.  His was a scare speech in itself in order to try to stampede the people of the country into giving their support to this measure which we regard as being oppressive.</P>
    <P>I do not under-estimate the threat of the IRA either in the North or in the South.  The position of the Labour Party has been made abundantly clear over the last three years on the North and on the activities of the IRA and there is no other single party in the House who have made such efforts, particularly with the British Labour Party and the British Labour Government in order to ensure that peace would come to the North of Ireland.  No later than two weeks ago, because we are concerned and <Col N="379" /> because we do not play political tricks, we went to London and saw the members of the British Labour Party there and we saw Mr. Whitelaw in an effort to ensure that the plebiscite which he says is to be held early next year would not do the harm that we believe it would do.</P>
    <P>There are some people who have suggested, maybe unconsciously, that there was consultation between the Taoiseach and Deputy Cosgrave and myself on this Bill and on other matters in recent times.  I want to say categorically that I have had no consultation with the Taoiseach, nor did he ask to consult with me, on these matters.  The only consultation I had with the Taoiseach in recent times was on the format of the referendum in connection with the Constitution that is to be held next week.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as has been stated by two of our speakers, is a drastic departure from the rule of law.  I was appalled to hear the suggestion from the Minister for Justice today when he implied that the newspapers were whipping up opposition.  I know it is a very nice thing as a politician to say nice things about the Press but I do not think we could accuse the Irish newspapers or the Irish media of whipping up opposition against this particular Bill for some foul purpose. They acted in a very sane and logical way.  They had their protest for one day.  They came to Leinster House in an orderly fashion and with great courtesy and with logic in their arguments they presented to the three parties in the House what we consider to be a reasonable and a logical document.  If the Press wanted to make mischief in connection with this Bill they could well do it.</P>
    <P>I resent also the inference&mdash;he was not quite coherent when he talked about it&mdash;by the Taoiseach that certain trade unions were giving support to illegal organisations by resolutions they may have passed or by people demonstrating over the past 24 hours. I do not think anybody can accuse any union in this country of being in league with or giving support to the <Col N="380" /> Provisional IRA.  It is a shame that the Taoiseach should take this occasion to suggest that they marched or passed resolutions for some sinister purpose which might lead us to believe &mdash;and I hope it will never be the case&mdash;that some of these trade unions or the trade union movement on a particular occasion will be regarded as a subversive organisation and will be treated in accordance with the measures that are proposed in this Bill which we hope will not be passed either this week or next week.</P>
    <P>The newspapers are reflecting public opinion and the leader writers are reflecting public opinion.  We thought we were right on occasions and have been faulted by the Press.  We were probably wrong.  So have Fine Gael and so have individuals.  So have members of our party.  The Fianna Fáil Party will have to learn to take criticism from people whose job it is to reflect public opinion.</P>
    <P>The kernel of this measure is that it is, as I said, a drastic departure from the rule of law and one is deemed to be guilty until one proves oneself innocent. It has been suggested by the Fine Gael Party here that there may be some amendments.  These proposals are so direct and so naked I am afraid they cannot be amended and I do not think we would be able to consider any sort of amendments that would make it acceptable to us or acceptable to a majority of the Irish people.  As I said, it is a major departure from established practice, a very serious departure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to recently the Minister for Justice did not complain of inadequate powers.  He mumbled about it in some speech in August of this year.  What has changed the situation? If he wanted powers or thought he wanted powers to deal with a certain situation or with certain organisations, the time to do it was about two or three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let not the Minister, let not the Taoiseach, think that those who protest against this Bill are people who are necessarily supporters of the Provisionals or any wing of the IRA or <Col N="381" /> any other subversive organisation. There is widespread public alarm.  As was quoted today by Deputy Cluskey, there was a telegram received by Deputy Tully asking the Labour Party to vote against this measure.  This is the view of very many people in this country, people who seriously value civil liberties, as I say, not necessarily, as the Taoiseach tried to say in what I described as his predictable comments, from the people I have mentioned. That telegram came from the Navan Chamber of Commerce and I am sure there are other organisations who feel as we do about this measure.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with illegal organisations and, as far as the Minister is concerned, intimidation of courts of justice and the securing of evidence for conviction.  As far as the intimidation of courts of justice is concerned, the Minister has adequate powers.  The courts that have been established are adequate.  They are operating freely and I think they are operating fairly.  They are dangerous enough but there are no grounds for saying they are not getting the evidence. There are many examples of convictions being sought and secured.</P>
    <P>It is surely not being suggested in this day and age that the Garda are not capable of getting or not equipped to get normal evidence.  Of course, the Government, having failed to deal with the IRA for the past three years, now seek to excuse themselves for their past inactivity by saying they have not sufficient powers.  As I have said, the time to take action was the time when people were murmuring within the Fianna Fáil Party.  Again, let me emphasise that this party were consistent and always have been consistent in their opposition to those who would use violent means, either in the northern part of the country or down here in the Republic.</P>

      <P>That sort of excuse will not wash so far as we are concerned and, I hope, so far as this House it concerned.  Our claim is that the Government were not restricted by legal problems but by political problems and that is the reason for <Col N="382" /> the inactivity on the part of the Taoiseach who pretended here tonight to be so tough.  The difficulties were within their own party.  It is not for me to go over that matter.  The arms trial was more than an embarrassment to them.  In a comment which he made after returning from New York, the Taoiseach indicated that he still did not believe there had not been a conspiracy.  Despite that, he did not take action against those members of his party who continued to make their militant speeches as they had been doing during their time as members of Fianna Fáil.  At that time I suggested that if the Taoiseach was convinced that these men had been engaged in any sort of conspiracy, his duty as Leader of his party and as head of this State was to seek their removal from Dáil Éireann.  However, he pussy-footed with them and all the signs are that one member who was involved and who was dismissed may now be offered a post in a reshuffled Cabinet.  If that is so, shame on the Taoiseach.</P>

I do not know which page of the <i>Evening Press</i> he is reading but if he is relying on that source for his information, he is not with it so far as this discussion is concerned.  Up to recently there was the question also of the disposal of the money voted by this House for the relief of distress in the North.  I recall a boast the Taoiseach made when he said that this Bill was not an O'Malley Bill but that it was a Bill which has the full backing not only of the Government but of the entire party.</P>

However, the Taoiseach did not think of Cabinet responsibility when the report of the Committee of Public Accounts was published recently and which suggested very clearly that a member of the present Cabinet withheld information from <Col N="383" /> the Taoiseach which was vital at that critical time of the dismissal of the Ministers.</P>

The danger is in making it too easy to secure convictions and in giving the police powers that are much too wide, powers which I believe the Garda do not want.</P>
      <P>Our main objection is to section 3 (2). This subsection smacks of internment. I do not know what might have been in the minds of Fianna Fáil about two years ago when they threatened to introduce that section of the Offences against the State Act which provides for internment.  They tried to make a deal at that time with the Labour Party but when we insisted that there be a discussion on that particular Act we were outvoted by members of Fianna Fáil.

      <P>The procedures proposed go against all established practices. If the Bill is passed it will damage the integrity of the courts.  This is our big objection.  Under this Bill information would be accepted as evidence which would not otherwise be accepted because statements by a chief superintendent&mdash;and there are a limited number of them&mdash;or somebody of higher rank would be accepted as evidence.  That is a form of evidence that up to now would not be admitted. To say the least, it is somewhat thick to say that a mere belief by a chief superintendent or somebody of higher rank can be accepted as evidence that a person is a member of an illegal organisation.</P>
      <P>This Bill is lowering the standard of justice.  The democratic institutions should not be damaged in the name of the preservation of democracy.  The Taoiseach tonight in a very scrambled type speech during which, in my view, he lost his cool, tried to give the impression that the Bill is aimed at the preservation of democracy.</P>
      <P>The Bill has all the characteristics of Fianna Fáil legislation.  I remember the repressive legislation of 1941 or 1942 in relation to the wages standstill order and there has been other such legislation right up to the abortive Criminal Justice Bill.  It is to the credit of some Fianna Fáil members that they opposed that Bill.  We remember the unfortunate Minister for Justice at that time, Deputy Ó Móráin, trying to extricate himself from the provisions of that Bill at an Ard-Fheis some three or four years ago.  This Bill has all the characteristics of the Forcible Entry measure in respect of which we were promised amendments but which have not yet been brought forward.</P>
      <P>The implications of these proposals are very clear.  Representations have been made by the Press concerning it in respect of section 4.  Their chief worry is that under this section they could be involved unwittingly because of some report or statement.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="385" /> With all due respect to the Minister, to his advisers and to the Parliamentary draftsmen, having read the Minister's speech and having listened to him put forward various qualifications and describe all the safeguards in the Bill for the preservation of civil liberties, I prefer to take the advice of Deputy Cooney who analysed the Bill line for line in a far better manner than the Minister described it.

      <P>As far as illegal organisations are concerned, the Minister must admit our consistency in the face of attack, an attack from his own party. I had this note down before and I was justified in having it down and believing that it would be said, that we would be accused of favouring the IRA and being against law and order. The boot was on the other foot about two weeks ago when we were being described as being the opposite.</P>

      <P>We deplore violence from any side whether it be the IRA, the UDA, the UVF, Vanguard or anybody. Deputy Seán Sherwin may have spoken with sincerity today but if he thinks that the method which he seems to advocate will achieve the unity of this country he is very much mistaken. As far as that is concerned, I think the approach of my party is the best approach of any of the parties here. People have paid lip service to the expressions reconciliation, dialogue and all this sort of thing.  We are the only party in this House who have tried and tried hard to have dialogue with the ordinary people in the North in order to provide for reconciliation because we regard the activities of the IRA, the UDA, the UVF and Vanguard as activities that are tearing the northern part of the country apart. We also say that if the IRA or any of the other organisations I have mentioned, the UDA, UVF or Vanguard, extend their activities down here they will also be tearing this part of the country apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They laughed at Conor Cruise-O'Brien when he talked about a backlash but there is evidence of that backlash there.  The backlash has come because of the activities of those people in the Six Counties.  The backlash has come from the activities of these people who had the support of members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Whatever steps the Government take or any Government take, we will support what we consider to be the proper steps in accordance with the rule of law but we oppose laws which we believe to be oppressive and this law which we believe to be oppressive.  We will continue and there are dangers, there are dangers within one's party, let me <Col N="390" /> freely admit it, and if you have no troubles in your party they are all fools or angels.  We will continue to walk the narrow path between attacks on democracy by the Government or by illegal organisations.  This we have done for the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>The Civil War was mentioned.  I do not want to talk about it but we are in the same tradition of the Labour Party that has been represented in this House over the past 50 years.  We have never been engaged in violence; we have never advocated violence; we have never been involved in violence.  The Government have got themselves into this crisis and they cannot involve all of us in trying to extricate themselves from that.  It is up to the Government themselves, therefore, to clean up their own house and not to be doing as the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, was doing tonight&mdash;trying to throw as much mud as he could at the Labour Party, as he did, regrettably successfully, in June, 1969.</P>

      <P>The time at my disposal is very short.  I hope I can come back in the morning.  I have known Deputy O'Malley for quite a long time.  I have had reason to visit him and to try to impress upon him the lawlessness that was going on in this State and also the activities of illegal organisations.  I know the frustration with which he met me.  He told me that owing to the inadequacy of the law he could not secure the convictions he would wish or, indeed, secure the arrests he would like.  The speeches from the Opposition this evening were of a very political nature.  If they think that the Minister is just having a verbal battle with them and that he is just doing this for fun&mdash;&mdash;</P>
