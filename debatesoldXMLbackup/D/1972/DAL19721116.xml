      <P>It seems to those of us who have been observing the activities of Radio Telefís Éireann that Telefís Éireann in particular are taking on the appearance of a station in serious financial difficulty and they seem to be doing things on the cheap.  This is particularly true in respect of the type of films which are used, many of which could be regarded as museum pieces. They show the old type horse operas, cowboy and Indian films and Charlie Chaplain films which they must surely be getting for a very small fee.  They are clearly designed to fill up viewing time.  This is causing unrest and anxiety to the staff of RTE and is having a most demoralising effect on the viewing public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We deplore the cut back of viewing time on Saturday and Sunday.  I am pleased to note in this morning's papers that the Minister is about to intervene in this regard.  He should have intervened long before this because this has <Col N="1788" /> been going on for a very long time. The plight of Telefís Éireann is again emphasised by the repetition of the film on &ldquo;TV spongers&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still very offensive to the people who pay their way.  The inability of Telefís Éireann to show colour films as advertised causes great anxiety especially to the people who have invested in costly colour sets.  It is time the Minister took things in hand and gave sufficient funds to RTE to obtain the personnel and equipment which they so badly need in order to give us decent television.  The Minister should tell us what he is going to do to improve the image of RTE, which has deteriorated rapidly in recent times. There have been many resignations of dedicated men who became disillusioned with RTE.  There is undue interference by the Minister and his Government and this is bound to have a demoralising effect on those independent-minded men who believe in doing things their way without undue political interference.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy like to elaborate on what he means by undue interference by the Minister in RTE?  He does not have to if he does not wish to, but I would be grateful to him for an elaboration so that I could answer these charges properly when replying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but those of us who have had occasion to be in Telefís Éireann sense there a fear of heavy handedness, not so much, perhaps, on the part of the Minister but on the part of the Government and Fianna Fáil as a whole in respect of what Telefís Éireann may do or may not do at any given time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to place on record that I reject absolutely these charges by Deputy Treacy as being untrue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the news, news should be seen to be fair, impartial and objective on every occasion but we observe a tendency to discriminate deliberately against the views, say, of the republican movement, perhaps the extreme republican movement in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy means the enemies of the State.  Let him cut out the sham republicanism and be honest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why discriminate against those who aspire to republican ideas in this part of the country if we are to continue to give coverage to the blood-thirsty maniacs, Bill Craig and his colleagues?  This is a continuing feature.  If we are to keep the men of violence off our screens let us be seen to do so impartially.  Let it be seen to be done to both sides in respect of Orangeism as much as extreme republicanism.  It is an insult to the intelligence of our viewing public that men like Craig and Faulkner should be featured on Irish television.  If we are to adopt a policy of treating with contempt those who are allegedly seeking to destroy the institutions of our State, let us ensure that these other people are treated likewise and treated with the contempt they deserve.</P>
      <P>In a democracy such as ours the voice of all the people should be heard and those of us who are concerned with the maintenance of democracy would be concerned that any section of our people would be denied access to the media or that their activities would be stifled.  It is not a good thing for democracy that this should be so because if, as alleged, there are illegal organisations, enemies of the State, it is better that their activities be seen in the open rather than that they be compelled to go underground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the presentation of the news programmes, many people have commented that there is a tendency on the part of news readers to speak too fast.  It has been said that they <Col N="1790" /> should not emulate the disc jockey with his rapid fire speech approach. The news should be delivered in a calm, clear and deliberate manner and the listening and viewing public should be afforded an opportunity to assimilate the news as it is delivered.  News readers should not be asked to fit in more than is convenient in the limited time available.</P>
    <P>By contrast the weather forecasters appear very natural and one might say almost casual in their approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But the weather is usually unnatural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the difference in attitude can be attributed to the weather men working close to nature while the news readers spend most of their time in the atmosphere of the city.</P>
      <P>Earlier I referred to advertising on Telefís Éireann and I wish to refer in particular to the advertisement aimed at TV &ldquo;spongers&rdquo;.  Many people regard this advertisement as being crude and offensive. Certainly, we are seeing it too frequently.  There can be overexposure in respect of any programme and in this case the overexposure has nullified the effect intended.  It has been pointed out to me on many occasions that if RTE possess all the expertise, the inspectors, the fleet of vans and all the technical apparatus that they are alleged to have, they should have caught all those TV &ldquo;spongers&rdquo; long ago.  I was disturbed to note from the Minister's brief that the most effective device we have for insuring payment of licence fees, that is, the arrangement with the trade, has not been entered into yet.  I wonder why this is so?  The relevant legislation was enacted some time ago and we are astonished to find that it has not been implemented yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding piped television I understand that about two years ago there was a meeting of the top engineering brains of RTE as well as technicians and some executives for the purpose of formulating a policy to bring piped television to as many homes as possible. The plan was to have been all-embracing and would have brought <Col N="1791" /> thousands of viewers within the range of BBC and ITV within a limited period of, perhaps, 12 months.  The plan would have provided piped television across the country to a large number of people who, unlike those living on the eastern seaboard and in the northern section of our country, have not this facility.</P>
    <P>I understand that this was a top-ranking conference of executives who believed it was feasible to implement such a programme.  There was no doubt but that the people wished to avail of this service and that some people regarded themselves as being discriminated against in so far as others could enjoy multi-channel TV. It is alleged that the Minister stepped in and sabotaged the activities of this top rank committee.  It was done by a variety of means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy again.  Just to get the record straight, the Deputy is talking through his hat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will get an opportunity to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The charge the Deputy is making is completely untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to elaborate on the charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They are completely untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister sabotaged this programme in a variety of ways.  The first was to insist that outlets connecting with each mast be confined to 500 units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the advice of RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow me to elaborate. This rendered the plan ridiculous because on the best engineering advice we have we know that the practical number of outlets for each mast is not 500 units but 10,000 units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>So, one can see immediately the impossible position in which the planners were placed.  There <Col N="1792" /> is, admittedly, some multi-channel TV available in Sligo, Navan and Drogheda. It is on a limited scale and defective at times.  The plan to which I have referred which was being evolved in Montrose had the remarkable feature that it would provide clearly in every home in the country piped TV within a very limited period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking utter nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will get the opportunity of replying in this House and of stating the reasons why this plan was scrapped, why the technicians concerned were not permitted to go ahead and why he continues in this dog-in-the-manger attitude, underestimating the needs and wishes of the vast majority of our people who believe that they are entitled to equal rights in respect of television reception. Why confine, by his action or inaction, a large section of our population to one channel whereas many others who are paying the same television licence fee enjoy multi-channel TV?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Four channels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the financial difficulties involved; I understand the possibility of loss of revenue to Telefís Éireann; I understand the need for additional capital resources to fund such a scheme, but I believe that the people are willing to meet the commitment in that regard and, obviously, ways and means can be found of securing the additional revenue required.</P>
      <P>As a result of dissatisfaction in respect of the plan to which I have referred, is it not a fact that one of Telefís Éireann's leading engineers resigned. a brilliant engineer who was in the main responsible for bringing piped television to this city and its environs?  So frustrated did he become with the inability of the Minister or the Government to provide the necessary staff, money and freedom of initiative that he resigned and has now formed his own private piped television company.  It is hoped that where the State failed private enterprise will do the job and will be seen to do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1793" /> I express the ardent hope that the Minister, in acknowledgment of his inability to provide the funds, equipment and staff and willingness to provide the services for our people, will facilitate private enterprise in every way in meeting the wishes of our people in this important matter.  This is a private enterprise society and the State will be watched and should be seen not to do anything to impede private enterprise in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the policy of the station has changed radically for the worse in recent times and now, as I said, regretfully, Telefís Éireann represents the appearance of all that is cheap and shoddy.  It needs to be rejuvenated.  It is not too late for the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>I afford the Minister the opportunity of replying to what I have said and of telling the House precisely what he is prepared to do to meet the wishes of the populace outside Dublin.  The people of the second largest city, Cork, want the same privilege as people in Dundalk or Dublin have to view multi-channel TV.  They are clamouring for it.  The same applies to the people of Waterford and the people in my own constituency, south Tipperary.  They want the same value for money in respect of the licence fee they pay to the State as their friends and neighbours in other parts of the country enjoy.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that as a result of the provision of a new transmitter in South Wales it would become much easier to provide piped television for the Cork area and that there is now a prospect of Cork and Waterford securing clear television within a period of some 12 months.  The Minister went to Cork on one occasion and told the people there that it would be well nigh impossible for persons in Cork city to secure piped television. The engineering experts now say that this is a realistic proposition and we hope the Minister will not stand in the way of progress in that regard.  In respect of the Cork venture the Minister said that it would require a special micro-wave link from Dublin and, on the basis of the cost involved, this proposition was out.  It would be less <Col N="1794" /> than fair on the part of the Minister to attempt to confine the people of Munster, of Cork, Tipperary, Limerick and so on, to one station, a station of such doubtful quality in recent times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be manifestly unfair while the rest of the country enjoyed other facilities.  I am not at all convinced about this alleged loss of revenue or about the challenge to our intelligent, cultured and Christian civilisation because of people viewing the BBC.  We are an adult responsible society, an intelligent and discerning society, and our people will not be brainwashed in matters of this kind.  Since the inception of radio we have had the BBC stations readily available in our homes and that has not had a demoralising effect.  We are very close to union with the people in Britain and in Northern Ireland and we desire to be even closer in the future in order to bring peace and concord to our country.  We have had the Anglo-Irish Free Trade area Agreement and we have joined with Britain in entering the Common Market. We have to be broadminded.  We will require to see not merely what is happening in Northern Ireland and in Britain but also what is happening in Europe.  We hope in time that European television stations will be available to us.</P>
      <P>I know that the biggest danger here is the loss of revenue to Telefís Éireann.  It has been stated that, if piped television were to be extended to the rest of the country, the viewing on RTE could be reduced by one-third. That may be so.  In any event there are ways and means of funding such a programme.  Already Telefís Éireann provides piped television here in this city and in other small areas in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be done in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>A charge of 35p per week is made for this facility.  There is a tendency to increase this charge and people feel a certain resentment about this because they think they are being exploited by Telefís Éireann. There is also a possibility of an increase in the licence fee.  The Minister can no longer blind his eyes or close his ears to the clamour, a clamour which is increasing in momentum, by the people for this facility. The needs of the people should be met.  It is true to say that some 350,000 people are confined to Radio Telefís Éireann and some 150,000 people are fortunate&mdash;they admit they are fortunate&mdash;in being able to enjoy multi-channel television.  This is a great facility and if it is possible and practicable to extend this facility to the rest of the country that should be done.  We must not set ourselves up as the arbiters of morality.  It is not for us to decide what is right and what is wrong.  No Minister has the right to take upon himself the duty of wrapping up a section of our people in a cocoon to protect them from outside influences.  Outside influences are part of normal everyday life.  Outside influences can be enlightening and educational and, from this point of view, they can also be highly artistic, especially when projected in colour.  I would ask the Minister to do the right thing, the popular thing, and extend multi-channel television to the rest of the country.  If he cannot do it then he should hand it over to private enterprise, giving private enterprise all the necessary facilities to do the job.</P>
      <P>I would be remiss if I failed to express the concern and the mystification that exists about the &ldquo;stop/go&rdquo; policy of Radio Telefís Éireann where colour transmission is concerned.  Colour is the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo;.  I know it is very costly, but more and more people are purchasing colour televisions. These have been disillusioned and misled by the people in Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misleading the House.  I think he is playing to the gallery.  It is not like the Deputy.  Normally he is very sincere and straightforward, but he is deliberately misleading the House this morning in the statements he is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister restrain himself for a moment and listen to what I have to say?  I understand Radio Telefís Éireann is equipped to broadcast some 70 per cent of its total output in colour.  Is it a fact that, in order to curtail the purchase of <Col N="1797" /> colour televisions&mdash;I know the Minister is as concerned about the balance of payments as I am&mdash;he directed Radio Telefís Éireann to project not more than 25 per cent of its total transmission in colour.  The Minister owes the public an apology in view of the fact that colour television films advertised by RTE have not been shown in colour and in many cases there was no apology for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not good enough.  If the Minister has been intervening directly in this matter, I believe, like myself, he would be honest enough to admit it in the House.  I know he is concerned about the balance of payments position but is it not true that the State derives substantial revenue from the importation of these sets?  There is also the probability, and I hope the day is not far off, that these sets will be manufactured or very largely assembled in this country thus eliminating our balance of payments problem. Colour is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing and those who have colour sets are entitled to colour programmes; they are certainly entitled to the colour programmes advertised.</P>

      <P>Those who have acquired colour television sets and especially those who are confined to <Col N="1798" /> Telefís Éireann are entitled, at least, to see as much colour as possible on their screens.  Let the single channel to which we are confined be in colour and have this service consistent as far as possible.</P>
      <P>Many references have been made to the telephone service about which we all have problems.  I was pleased to see the Minister on record as saying that political influence is of no consequence in securing priority for telephones but when an important person who provides an important service to the community, whether as an industrialist, a professional man or a farmer in an isolated area who requires to be in touch with the veterinary surgeon, the shopping centre, priest and doctor and so on, requires a telephone these are special cases which should get priority.  I am sure that when we produce to the Minister compelling reasons for the speedy installation of a telephone this will be done.  This is not seeking priority or using political influence but rather producing facts to show that serious disservice would be done or serious hardship caused in these circumstances if a telephone were not provided.</P>
      <P>The Minister has under his charge some 22,000 workers, men and women, a very large staff by any standards. I am pleased to note a continuing improvement in the relations between the staff and the Department and an improvement in conditions and wages and salary scales.  When I first came to this House I took every opportunity, especially on Estimates, to ventilate the grievances of auxiliary or unestablished postmen as they are known.  These unfortunate men who perform the same functions and duties and take the same responsibilities as established postmen got a very raw deal from the State for years. They were neither permanent nor pensionable; they got no opportunities for advancement in the service and only now are they granted some status and a pension scheme.  This is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the need for the Minister constantly to review his organisation and ensure that it is efficient in every way but there are practices which if carried too far can be most <Col N="1799" /> demoralising for staff.  I am referring to the use of time study on the job.  I have never been enamoured of time study because it involves the application of the clock and the timing of human effort and endeavour.  I have always held that the clock is more appropriately used on greyhounds and racehorses than on human beings.  It is particularly disgusting to see a man stand with a stop-watch over another observing and timing his every movement and effort and then to place a value on that effort and do so on the basis that the effort shall continue at that pace indefinitely.</P>
    <P>As one engaged in trade union activity over my lifetime I have found this to be a most disgusting and humiliating experience.  It is bad enough to see this happen in factories but it is particularly disgusting to see an agent of the Minister's Department, allegedly a time study expert, walking fairly rapidly with a stop-watch in his hand or pocket, timing a postman on the job.  One can well imagine the state of mind of the postman in such circumstances. I do not believe this can be regarded as a fair test.  There are special circumstances involved.  On that morning the postman might have more or less letters to deliver, he might have a longer or a shorter journey to make.  There should be a more humane and honourable approach to efficiency and progress than this kind of nefarious practice.</P>
    <P>Delivery vans have been introduced to replace the postman who delivered the letters on foot or who used a bicycle.  I appreciate that it is necessary to move with the times and I do not want to impede progress.  It is a good thing that mail should be delivered by van if only for the protection it gives the employees in bad weather.  However, where redundancies occur as a result of the application of time study methods and the introduction of delivery vans, I hope the men concerned will be absorbed into alternative employment.</P>
    <P>It is true that an attempt was made to do this but there have been instances where men who were taken on temporarily were ignominiously dismissed <Col N="1800" /> as a result of the introduction of delivery vans.  In one case the man concerned depended on this work to keep his wife and family.  I have had a letter from the Minister's Department giving the reasons for the introduction of a delivery van in this instance but no regard was had to the auxiliary postman. The fact that he was temporary was no justification for his ignominious dismissal.  He had family responsibilities and I deplore the offhand manner in which these men are discarded after giving good service to the Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the condition of many of our sub-post offices. Many of these buildings have not got the proper facilities for the public, there is a general air of dilapidation about them and there is a complete lack of privacy.  Frequently the premises in question are the local grocery and drapery shop, goods and services are provided in them and, as a result, the post office activity plays a very minor role.  When we designate a dwelling as a sub-post office we have an obligation to ensure that the premises are safe and that adequate facilities are available for the public.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent political preference is given with regard to recruitment in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is alleged that political contacts count and in this connection I refer in particular to the lower grade positions of postmen, telephonists and so on.  Rightly or wrongly many people believe that such contacts count.  If this is not the case the Minister has the opportunity to demolish this argument.  However, they are aspects of employment with which we are concerned and I do not know of any reason why these practices should continue.</P>
    <P>I am referring to people already gainfully employed in full-time employment who work as night telephonists. This is at a time when unemployed people, single and married, are available for these posts.  This practice of employing people already gainfully employed shows clear discrimination against the unemployed and it creates a very bad impression. Not many qualifications or much education is required for a position of <Col N="1801" /> night telephonist.  It is a matter of astonishment that the Department have to fall back on people who are already in good jobs to do this rather menial work when there are so many others, obviously qualified, available to do the job.  The Minister should issue a directive on this matter that first preference shall be given to the unemployed.  It is becoming something of a scandal in certain areas that this practice is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The staff in post offices are kindly and courteous but more facilities should be available for the aged and infirm.  Many application forms for pensions and other social welfare benefits are available in post offices.  I hope that, when an aged or disabled person applies for an old age pension form or a widow's pension form, if they so desire, they will be assisted in the completion of that form.  Every courtesy and assistance should be provided for those people.</P>
    <P>I submit that it would contribute largely to the drive for Post Office savings if more privacy for the individual were provided in post offices. Lack of privacy in post offices is a dissuading element in the savings programme, particularly in small villages where people do not want to have their neighbours knowing what they are doing.  Privacy in that respect should be guaranteed and respected.</P>
    <P>In Estimates of this kind Deputies are permitted to discuss local matters. One matter to which I wish to bring the Minister's attention may be regarded by others as small, simple and silly, but it is of the greatest importance to the community which I represent.  It is the need for a telephone kiosk in Ardfinnan, outside Clonmel.  That village came into the news recently through the possible closure of its only business, the woollen mills, the loss of which will mean virtual economic annihilation of the whole community.</P>
    <P>If the Minister knows Ardfinnan he will understand how the village has grown to the neighbouring hills. The main street is fronting the green and in it stands the post office and the adjoining telephone kiosk.  However, the main housing programme in the past few years has been concentrated <Col N="1802" /> on a nearby hill overlooking the village, and half a mile from the village centre where, as I have said, stand the post office and the telephone kiosk.  Hundreds of people now live in St. Anne's Terrace, St. Finian's Avenue and Mount Carmel.  The community in those areas are mainly young married couples and families, people who are most concerned to have easy contact with priests and doctors.  The need for that contact is nearly constant in such a young community.</P>
    <P>There was a phone in the local grocer's shop but he was so inundated and pressed by people using his phone that he felt compelled to have it removed.  That left the community without any telephone service unless they walked the half mile to the village centre.  The housing estate to which I refer is reached by ascending a very steep hill.  Therefore, only in exceptional circumstances would one think of making the journey down that hill to the existing kiosk and back again.</P>
    <P>I have had parliamentary questions to the Minister as to why a telephone kiosk was not provided for those people and the reason he gave me was that the Department would not be justified in providing it because the existing kiosk in Ardfinnan was not being used fully and therefore that it was uneconomic.  It is not being used because in its neighbourhood there are many private telephones and it is not accessible to the large number of people living in the hill area to which I have referred.  The matter was brought to the attention of the local post-master without satisfaction.  I am now asking the Minister to hold a special impartial investigation into this need.  If he does so I can assure him he will find there is a compelling need for it to cater for the families in St. Anne's Terrace, St. Finian's Avenue and Mount Carmel.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also find that the existing kiosk is useless.  It can be regarded as a monument to the inefficiency or the ignorance of the person responsible for having placed it there.  Perhaps it was not anticipated at that time that the village would grow in the direction it did.  The point <Col N="1803" /> is that a service is needed there, particularly from the health point of view, and I hope the Minister will heed my comments.</P>
    <P>I will conclude my comments on the telephone service with some remarks on a matter which may not be the Minister's responsibility&mdash;perhaps the Department of Justice are more involved.  However, I think the House should get an assurance from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that when a telephone is installed the privacy of the individual will be respected&mdash;that it shall not be violated by interference of any kind such as listening in or &ldquo;bugging&rdquo;, as it is now commonly called.  To us on this side of the House &ldquo;bugging&rdquo; of telephones is a grave violation of the rights of the individual.  It is a despicable practice which should not be tolerated in a civilised democratic society.  If and when it is done it should only be approved of by the Minister for the gravest and most compelling reasons of serious crime or possible threat to the security of the State.</P>
    <P>We have to be constantly on our guard against this intrusion into the privacy of individual and family life. Under our Constitution the family is regarded as the primary and fundamental unit of society, possessing inalienable rights and antecedent to all positive law.  I would hate to think that our society is to be contaminated by the &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; philosophy coming in from the United States, of the all-seeing eye designed to pry and to probe.  Indeed, the society to which I refer has been disgraced in recent times by the extension of this &ldquo;bugging&rdquo; into the political life of that country.  This was exemplified by the &ldquo;bugging&rdquo; of the headquarters of the opponents of the President of the United States, and other incidents concerning political life in America.</P>
    <P>Those of us who seek the facility of telephones for constituents must do so in the knowledge and belief that that facility will be respected by the State, that it will not be interfered with, that there shall be no listening in, that the conversation held will be <Col N="1804" /> regarded as sacrosanct.  If there is to be interference, this House should know, this House has a right to know from the Minister the circumstances in which &ldquo;bugging&rdquo; can be justified by him, the extent to which it is carried out and the incidence of telephone tapping that is going on.  It is all right to say that this is done to prevent serious crime, but it could also be done for more ulterior motives. It could be done to destroy one's political opponents, as has happened in the United States and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Let us have a reassurance on this matter.  Let us make clear that this is a democracy in which the freedom and the rights of the individual are of paramount importance and the sanctity and privacy of the individual and family life shall be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically every Deputy who has spoken so far has devoted a considerable part of his speech to the activities of RTE.  It is only right and proper that we should be concerned that the most powerful propaganda medium in our State is properly managed and properly supervised. I must say that I certainly feel a lot of disquiet about the way RTE has been operating.</P>
      <P>First of all, the growth in the numbers of the RTE staff over the past ten years, in my opinion, has been absolutely phenomenal.  One is entitled to ask, I think, what are they all doing. Has this fantastic growth in staff contributed to the streamlining of RTE? Has it contributed to its efficiency or to its productivity or made it better organised?  I think we must come to the conclusion that this has not been the case.  On the contrary, it seems to many people that the organisation is top-heavy and over-run with administrators. One effect of all these executives is gross inefficiency.  Another effect is the dilution of responsibility leading to a situation where nobody seems to have control over any operation and everybody seems to be able to say that this was none of his business, that it was somebody else's business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the duplication, or indeed at times the triplication, of programme items be justified?  It seems to be a <Col N="1805" /> regular practice for people concerned with different programmes on radio and television to be chasing the same topics and very often the same people take part or are interviewed.  Surely this is totally wasteful and ought to be brought under some sort of control. The left hand never seems to know what the right hand is doing and the public are the sufferers.  We have seen this practice on an increasing scale over the past few years where news and current affairs programmes cover the same events, using different personnel. I brought the Chequers talks, for example, to the attention of the House last year and more recently there was the Paris Summit.  I would like to know how much money RTE laid out on sending all these staff to these places and how they propose to justify it.  Is it indeed the root of the problem that they have never been asked to justify it to anybody?  I do not think it is any good for successive Ministers to come in here and tell us that they cannot answer questions on the day-to-day running of semi-State companies like RTE.</P>

      <P>Public money is involved through the payment of licence fees and the public are entitled to get explanations as to how their <Col N="1806" /> money is spent, particularly as there now appears to be growing dissatisfaction among viewers with the standard of programme being offered.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I would like to see RTE justify what they have been doing on this matter of duplicating and triplicating programmes.  We hear Deputies talking about giving more money to RTE and that they are short of money.  We hear the authority regularly stating they are short of money.  Surely any commercial enterprise could not but be short of money if they continuously have this duplication of programmes.  The country cannot afford the luxury of the internal competition which in my opinion goes on in Montrose.  It might not be so bad if it was confined to Montrose alone but its first-cousin in Henry St. the radio section, seems to have had the same internal competition which obviously has spread from Montrose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends where it came from first.  Henry St. is older than Montrose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be older but it certainly has picked up a lot of its bad habits from Montrose.  It all adds up to gross inefficiency and bad management. It must be demoralising for many of the staff in RTE who genuinely want to improve the service, to come up against those stone walls.  I was astonished when I heard the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Burke, for whom I have great respect, talking about this medium as the Fifth Estate, about how it was the protector of democracy, about how it should not have any interference from politicians and that they were entitled to act without being answerable to anybody. The whole tone of his speech astounded me.  The only conclusion I came to was that the speech was written by one of the top management in RTE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy has read the speech or listened to it but certainly <Col N="1807" /> one could come to only one conclusion, that whoever was responsible for the information given to the Deputy had a vested interest in protecting some of the management and some of the &ldquo;odd bods&rdquo; in RTE from any kind of supervision whatsoever.</P>
      <P>The RTE Authority cannot escape their responsibilities.  The only conclusion that can be drawn from an objective examination of the set-up is that the authority members do not know what is going on or are unwilling to exercise proper control.  I would like to see that organisation run efficiently in its day-to-day management but the authority have an overall responsibility to ensure that the people's money is spent in the most efficient manner.  I believe they have failed to do this.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for duplication in RTE is lack of control by the authority.  It has become evident that material which has appeared from time to time on various programmes was the brain child of some person who had absolutely no interest in projecting the proper image of RTE.  The editorial control must be absolutely non-existent.  Does anybody at the top supervise the current affairs programmes? Does anybody know in advance what items are being done? Is interest only taken after the event when serious damage is done?  How else can one explain the build up given over the past few years to members of subversive organisations who have been treated as if they were the real leaders of the Irish people?</P>
      <P>The situation got so bad that the Minister was left no option but to issue a directive under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.  The greatest evidence available to us of the irresponsibility of RTE was that the Minister was forced to take this action. That situation should not have been allowed to continue so long without any heed being taken of public opinion or of the Taoiseach, who referred to it long before the directive was issued.  I find it hard to align myself with what Deputy Burke said.  I do not understand his attitude when he claims this immunisation from all supervision by the intellectuals in RTE.</P>

      <P>I think I do.  I admit there was a lot of it there but I paid very close attention because, as I said at the outset, I have the highest respect for the Deputy and I would weigh very carefully anything he would say.  I was surprised at the denigrating way he spoke about the role of politicians <i>vis-à-vis</i> RTE.  This is why I am specifically concerned about the way RTE is being run.  There was also the question of the appointments in RTE.  Most semi-state bodies have their share of pseudo-intellectuals but RTE have deliberately sought to employ more than their fair share.  We have been over that before, but it still seems to be going on.  It provides a good living for many of the leading dissidents in this country and sympathisers with illegal organisations.  Of course those people are entitled to earn their living as well as anybody else, but they are not entitled to use the national broadcasting service for their own purpose.  The propagation of a particular point of view and the use of a public service to do it is specifically prohibited by the Broadcasting Act.  In case anybody goes away with the feeling that I see no good in RTE I know there are very competent people in RTE and I would like to put that on the record.</P>

      <P>It is imperative that the person appointed by RTE to the post in Brussels would have the professional competence necessary to carry out his work and that he be not merely one of the chosen few who, because he subscribes to a particular line of political thought, might get the appointment. EEC affairs are very complex. Therefore, it is of vital importance that the best and most professional man be selected and also that he be a top-class journalist.  I hope that RTE intend to approach the appointment on that basis.  I wonder whether the Minister might have any plans in that regard because this is a case which should engage the Minister's attention.  Should some rooky journalist be appointed merely because he happens to be well in with somebody in RTE, the Irish people would suffer as a result.</P>
      <P>I do not know for how long more our people will tolerate what is going on in RTE.  When and how are RTE to be requested to operate efficiently? It is our wish that they be efficient and we, as the representatives of the people who are paying the bills, should be the ones to insist on the authority operating efficiently.

      <P>The most inappropriately named body in this country must be the RTE Authority because they do not seem to exercise any form of authority. At least it must be the most confused, ineffective and often contradictory authority ever exercised by a statutory body in this state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have said may have sounded tough but that is the position as I see it, and the sooner we begin pointing out to the authority that they are not operating as an authority the <Col N="1812" /> better it would be for television in this country.  A clear example of this lack of authority was the fact that the Minister was forced to come here and issue a directive under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, 1960.  This directive was hailed on all sides of the House and regarded as being necessary.  In effect, what the directive indicated was that the authority were not exercising the control required of them and that they were giving on over-generous platform to the advocates of violence.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there is a lack of control at the top in RTE.  I have been informed that one evening a self-confessed member of Sinn Féin was refused the opportunity to advance his views on a &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme, apparently as a matter of station policy.  I understand the decision was reached after a long meeting, but the following evening the same person was afforded the liberty of the air on a &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; programme.  On this contradiction of policy alone the question of who is running RTE is inescapable. Of course, an attempt will be made to sidetrack us on this question by way of appeals for freedom of expression and of comment, or by suggesting that the words of the directive were not clear.  What is clear is that the authority and the people responsible for programmes know very well what they should or should not be offering the public.  Either there was a blatant reversal of policy overnight by the authority or else the authority and their top executives have lost control of the station.  Whatever the explanation is, the Minister should remove the authority from office, not just one of them, not just two of them, but I say the whole lot of them.  I say that people should be appointed in their places who are prepared to exercise authority and give some credence to the meaning of the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We had the spectacle a few weeks ago of the arch-promoter of violence and prospective slaughter of thousands of Catholics in the North, William Craig, being given a platform for the expression of his views.  I do not think one needs to be a genius or to be <Col N="1813" /> a Bobby Fischer to come to the only conclusion that one can come to that this is deliberate policy to embarrass the Minister on his directive under section 31.  I think that if this was an RTE Authority decision it was a flagrant breach of section 31.  No matter how much you play around with it or waffle about the difficulties of interpreting the directive, any school child knows what the directive means and that the spirit of this directive is being ignored and being deliberately ignored in RTE.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the best control of the news media is through the sense of social responsibility felt by all newspaper commentators, with which we all agree.  I say they are fine words.  What is a news commentator? It is just anybody who decides to set himself up as one, just anybody who can worm his way into the affection of those who put out these programmes. That is what it amounts to in most cases.  I should like to put one thing clearly on the record, that the most difficult task of any news commentator is that of summarising the proceedings of this House.  Certainly, it is a very sensitive area.  It is an area where any inexperienced journalist could founder very quickly.  As well as that, there is commentating on the political activities of the political parties and I think all parties in this House are agreed that the job is being performed splendidly by the two men who are doing that, Joe Fahy and Arthur Noonan.  It is important that I say that when I am criticising on the other side.  I think they are genuinely doing an excellent job in what is a most sensitive area as far as we politicians are concerned.  Yet, I never hear anybody from any side of the House criticising them because they are experienced journalists, they are professional at their job and their interpretations and their sense of fair play are way above anything that we see in RTE.</P>
    <P>It does not follow that everybody who can manage to comment on the news, and get well paid for doing so, has the same lofty sense of responsibility as these two men have.  There are persons making a very good career of <Col N="1814" /> interpreting the news and, of course, again, we have the persons who interpret the news to suit their careers. There are people who have made careers for themselves as historians and there are people who label themselves historians to advance their careers.</P>
    <P>Where was the RTE Authority when a £1,000 contract was signed by their top executives with Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien to put out a series of fatuous and sometimes insulting programmes under the falsely-named &ldquo;We the Irish&rdquo;?  Does the nation not boast of a single other historian capable of dealing with Irish history?  Where was the RTE Authority, I should like to ask, when this vast presumption was foisted on the Irish people by the person who is first and last a political animal?  Where was the authority when this £50,000 worth of free publicity was handed out to a Deputy of this House whose fund-raising campaign in the United States prior to the last general election proclaimed in black and white that the sole purpose of securing his election to the Dáil was to enable him to play a proper role in world affairs?</P>

It was an admission of negligence by the authority that, as an afterthought and in an effort to cover up for their lack of control in the first instance, they hastily added an open forum to the series to pretend it was a balanced offering.</P>

      <P>Right.  We are indeed fortunate in the Houses of the Oireachtas that not only do we have Ireland's only qualified historian in this House in the person of Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien but we have Ireland's only qualified constitutional lawyer in the Seanad in the person of Senator John Kelly.  I suppose those who criticise our education system may be right.  After all, the greatest critic of our education system is Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.  After generations of education we can only produce one qualified historian and one qualified constitutional lawyer, assuming, of course, that the RTE programmes are as fair and as balanced as they claim them to be.  If RTE expect us to believe that we can produce only one historian and one constitutional lawyer, they have another one coming.  How ridiculous can they get?  How foolish or how stupid do they think the people they are dealing with are?</P>
      <P>I would go so far as to say that we can see a follow-up of the grooming for political stardom of Senator Kelly in the same way as Deputies Cruise-O'Brien, Keating and Thornley were groomed before the last election.  I think that is what this is all about &mdash; the building of political careers under the guise of current affairs programmes.  Anybody who examines the situation could not come to any conclusion except that one.</P>
      <P>Apart from the abuse of current affairs programmes to advance the political careers of some of the participants, I personally feel that far too much time is being devoted to comments and interpretations of present-day events. With so many current affairs programmes. We have so many self-appointed commentators and interpreters vying with one another to attract attention, trying to outbid one another to get the largest audience, trying to be more controversial than one another in order to make a name for themselves&mdash;all this regardless of the cost to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I am expressing what is a personal opinion because I have discussed this with quite a number of people and I think I am expressing the views of a great many <Col N="1816" /> people.  I know a great many people in my constituency.  RTE must be the only communications medium in the country with competition within itself. The different sections in a newspaper do not compete with each other for the attention of the public, at the expense of the paper.  The same cannot be said of RTE.  The current affairs programmes are in competition with each other at the expense of the public. There is constant duplication of topics and of personnel.  Above all, there is duplication of cost.  Yet, representatives of the authority have the audacity to tell us in west Cork that they have no money to erect a booster to give a better television reception in, for instance, the Roscarbery area.</P>
    <P>What do they think we are?  Do they think we are all bloody fools down in west Cork?  As far as we are concerned, we will not accept anything less than proper treatment.  We demand that RTE be made more efficient so that they will have money to spend in areas in which they should be spending it instead of fighting each other and trying to outbid each other on various programmes.  The whole thing is a disgrace.  Reading the report of the committee on the setting up of a television station here in 1959 gives one to think.  The contrast as between what was envisaged and what we have actually got is almost incredible. It is no wonder the people in the south are crying out for multi-channel television.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that Deputies on both sides of the House are demanding multi-channel television as a right. What we are served by RTE ranks as the greatest &ldquo;con&rdquo; story of all time.  We are not getting value for money.  Certainly we are not getting the programmes we would like.  We are not getting a true reflection of the Irish way of life.  Most certainly we are not getting fair, objective balanced programmes on the current affairs side.  I deliberately prepared very carefully what I wanted to say here today in regard to RTE.  I feel very strongly about what is happening and, if something is not done to remedy the present situation, the results will be disastrous. <Col N="1817" /> I come from an area in west Cork in which it is not even possible to get black and white television with any degree of satisfaction.  Yet, RTE blandly tell us they have not got the money for this kind of project.  We demand that money be spent immediately on these areas to ensure we are not discriminated against and are not classified as second-class citizens.  We demand that the Minister proceed with all haste to ensure that we get multi-channel television so that the people will have something to watch on their screens instead of the kind of balderdash continually served up by RTE.  I am not surprised that less than 20 per cent of the people in Dublin watch RTE.  They are quite right and, if I had a choice of television channel, it is not RTE I would tune into.</P>
    <P>The sooner we have multi-channel television the sooner will RTE start operating efficiently because they will have to operate efficiently.  Unless and until that happens this is not a medium to be taken seriously by anybody, except for the colossal cost involved to the ordinary taxpayer, and the taxpayer is certainly not getting value for money, not in my constituency anyway.  I would urge the Minister to take a serious look at the RTE Authority.  I said at the outset that the authority should resign because those on it are not exercising authority as they should.  Unless and until they do so we should not cease in this House to say so.  As a result of what has been said in the debate I hope we will have now a more responsible reaction from RTE.</P>
    <P>I hope the internal competition will be cut out.  Some years ago Senator Eugene McCarthy was here and no fewer than 11 different groups from RTE were queuing up outside a room in the Shelbourne to interview him.  They were all from the same authority, all from the same medium of communication.  They were competing with each other.  They all had their own equipment and their own staff.  This is a ridiculous state of affairs and it is even more ridiculous that we should tolerate it.  We have no option but to go on exposing this kind of wasteful operation until such <Col N="1818" /> time as it is corrected.  I know the Minister will give special attention to what has been said here this morning I know that he will ensure that the authority will exercise authority and that, if those who constitute it do not do so, they will have to get out.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to understand Deputy Crowley's contribution. He came in here to launch an attack on Telefís Éireann.  I think his comments on Deputy Burke's speech arose from a misreading or a misunderstanding of Deputy Burke's contribution.  Whether or not he misunderstood Deputy Burke's contribution, he certainly does not understand Deputy Burke because he said that he got the impression that this speech had been written by somebody for Deputy Burke, somebody with a vested interest; if Deputy Crowley even half knew Deputy Burke he would know that Deputy Burke is quite capable of making his own speech and would not tolerate anybody else making it for him.</P>
      <P>I also resented Deputy Crowley's attack on Senator John Kelly.  As well as attacking Senator John Kelly, he attacked Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.

The Department of Posts and Telegraphs until quite recently were a very minor Department and quite a number of people thought that Department could be capably looked after by a Parliamentary Secretary.

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that this was the position but I must admit that in recent years it has become quite an important Department.  In the early days the Department were looked upon as catering for a post office where people went to buy stamps and post letters and on very rare occasions to send a telegram or ask the postmaster to make a phone call for them.  All this has <Col N="1820" /> changed completely and it is now a very important Department.  There has been a tremendous increase in their activities as can be seen from the fact that, according to the Minister, about 22,000 people are employed in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This alone gives an idea of the Department's importance. Generally speaking, the postal service is quite good but there is room for improvement and everybody would like to see the minor shortcomings that may exist rectified.  There has been some, although not a great deal, of delay in deliveries, occasional delay.  The Minister states that the hours of business in post offices are from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. and to 6 p.m. on Friday or Saturday, that they generally close for lunch for an hour and that they have a half day. It might be a good thing if the lunch hour could vary between different post offices in the same district so that a service would always be available.  I also think that the half-day should be staggered and that there should always be a post office open within easy reach.  They should not all close on the same half-day&mdash;I do not know if they do.  It should be easy to arrange to have a post office open within reach particularly in the Dublin area on each day of the week.</P>
      <P>For some time now there is no mail delivery, as such, in the Dublin area on Saturday.  The Minister stated that there is a registered delivery on Saturdays. I nearly forgot about that although I did get a registered letter on a Saturday.  I would say the vast majority of people are not aware of this service.  I believe that, perhaps not very often but occasionally, people would avail of this service if they were aware of it and it should be more widely publicised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may be outside the scope of the Minister's function but I wonder if any arrangement could be made to have old age pensions and other social payments made through the post, particularly in the case of infirm people who are unable to get to post offices. <Col N="1821" /> If that could be arranged it would be a very good service.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that a vast improvement has been made in the treatment of temporary postmen because such men were temporary all their lives.  They remind me of a man of 60 who had been working in a firm practically all his life and said he was still only serving his time.  The temporary postmen were serving their time for many years but I believe the position has considerably improved and we are glad of this.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the demand for telephones has increased by 13 per cent.  In 1971-72 they made 21,000 connections but, nevertheless, he said that the waiting list grew by 7,000 and I understand it now stands around 22,000 or 23,000.  This is a very large waiting list.  I do not know how optimistic the Minister is of making any serious inroads into that list. Although we may not be in a worse position than several other countries, this is poor consolation for the people who are waiting for a telephone.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that there is a continuous telephone service for 99 per cent of the time.  On several occasions people have complained to me that their phones have been cut off&mdash;not for non-payment but due to cable-laying. I realise cables must be laid but where it is necessary to disconnect a number of phones in an area prior notice should be given to the people concerned. I have received many complaints from people about this matter and they have always told me that prior notice was not given to them.</P>
    <P>Automation of the telephone service seems to be progressing satisfactorily and I presume it improves the service, but sometimes it is not too successful. People are obliged to dial their exchange in order to make trunk calls and it cannot be said that the system is as perfect as it might be.  Perhaps the Minister might look into the matter.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister and his Department are doing their best to provide a telephone service but I must refer to the vandalism in the Dublin area with regard to telephone kiosks. One would be lucky to find one kiosck out of four where the telephone is in <Col N="1822" /> working order.  It is outrageous to see phones ripped out, the coin-box missing, the receiver broken.  I do not know what pleasure it gives people to wreak all this havoc.  Many people are dependent on phones in public kiosks and one can visualise how serious it could be if they were unable to contact a doctor or anybody else in case of an emergency.  I do not know what the Minister can do to prevent this destruction. Perhaps it is a reflection of our society that people engage in this kind of vandalism.</P>
    <P>Although in previous times the telephone was regarded as a luxury that cannot be said nowadays.  It is a necessity in 1972.  Last night Deputy John O'Leary said that the increasing numbers of telephones was due to the affluence of our society and the result of good Government.  I do not altogether share the Deputy's view on this.  However, the Deputy underlined the point that the telephone is a necessity rather than a luxury when he told us about the views of some of his constituents in the Black Valley area of Kerry.  He asked them what they most needed in the area and he was rather surprised when they did not ask for electricity but preferred a telephone service.  This shows how essential they regard a telephone service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Black Valley can be reached only through the Gap of Dunloe or through Moll's Gap. Part of the problem is that we would not be allowed to put up telephone poles in an area like this.  I think the cost of providing a telephone service would be in the region of £20,000.</P>

      <P>They do not interview people on the earlier programme. However, on the morning programme there is an excellent coverage on matters of interest in the newspapers although I am not sure how people connected with the Press regard it.  In the morning people may not have time to look at the newspaper before they go to work; the programme &ldquo;It Says in the Papers&rdquo; is of value because if any news has a special interest for them they can read it later in the papers.  The information regarding road traffic in the Dublin area is valuable because it enables people to avoid certain areas where there might be heavy traffic.  It is also useful in that it warns people about icy conditions on the roads.  I regard this as an excellent service on which RTE are to be complimented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy O'Donnell about the desirability of Radio Éireann catering for our exiles in Britain. He told us&mdash;he should know because he visits England regularly and is in constant touch with our exiles there that there are one million Irish exiles in Britain, most of them in the London area, and that there are three million people of Irish descent, whether they be sons and daughters or grandsons and granddaughers.  In <Col N="1824" /> other words, in Britain at the moment there are more than a million more Irish people than in this State.  The point I was about to make is whether the Minister thinks RTE are capable of improving reception in England, particularly in the London area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an expert on that.  It is not many years ago since when you went into a housing area in Dublin the first thing that caught your eye was the vast number of television aerials.  It was an eyesore.  With the advent of piped television much of that has disappeared.  But if in Brussels 80,000 houses are served by one mast and in Canada 170,000 houses and it is claimed here by a number of people <Col N="1827" /> that you could get as many as 5,000 or 10,000 connections from one mast, why start off erecting one mast for every 500 houses?  With progress we will only have a few masts to serve the whole country.  If this is to come and if we can eliminate the cost of erecting unnecessary masts, why go ahead erecting them and why insist on this 500 limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not know that Fianna Fáil are always creating employment and making things expensive and that this is what they like doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Added to that, there is the problem of securing sites for masts and getting planning permission to erect them.  It is not just a question of getting the ground area of the mast. There must be a clearance site right around it so that if it happens to fall it will be clear of everything.  There has been a lot of undue delay in granting planning permission and in granting permission for road crossings.  I have had complaints from some of the firms engaged in this work.  They have been held up for two to three months in getting permission for a road crossing. That would be understandable when piped television was first mooted, but now that it is common there should not be any great delay in deciding whether to allow or not to allow a road crossing.</P>
      <P>The standardisation of equipment may be as important as limiting the number to 500.  I understand that at present there is no standardisation between the different firms.  Piped television will come and the Department, realising that this is a &ldquo;must&rdquo;, should consider the most positive way of harnessing its potential.  They should at least relent on this limit of 500 seeing that the different firms agree that they could serve 5,000, some say, and others say 10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another difficulty which is experienced and which I have seen myself is that, where there are perhaps 1,000 or 1,500 houses in a housing estate and they are limited to 500 connections per mast, two or maybe three masts have to be erected.  There is the problem of erecting the masts, of getting planning permission, road crossings, <Col N="1828" /><i>et cetera</i>.  Added to that, the reception can vary and one side of the road may be served by one mast and the other side by another.  Reception may be better on one side and the people on the other side cannot understand why their reception is not as good.  If there was one mast, reception would at least be uniform.</P>
    <P>At present, there are three major firms engaged in this.  There is RTE Relays, Marlin and Ren-Tel.  Between the three it is estimated that in the near future they will have connected 60,000 homes in the Dublin area. According to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of November 7th there are 193,000 homes in Dublin city and county and of those it is estimated that about 170,000 odd have television; and of the people who have television at least two-thirds would be anxious to avail of piped television. Therefore, about 110,000 householders would be anxious to avail of piped television.  About 60,000 will be connected, which leaves 50,000.  I would urge the Minister as strongly as possible to raise this limit of 500 as high as he possibly can.</P>
    <P>It has also been pointed out by Marlin in the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the cost per house, including the cost of the site, the erection of the mast and connecting to each household, works out in the region of £9 per house when there are only 500 connections.  They claim that if the number of connections was increased to 5,000 the reception given would be much better than it is at the moment and the cost would work out at one-tenth the present cost, that is about 90p per house.  In the interests of helping to reduce the cost and of preventing the appearance of a large number of masts all over Dublin the Minister should immediately increase this quota of 500 to 5,000, if possible.  If he cannot increase it to that number he should certainly increase it generously. I hope, he will be able to tell me that this number will be increased in the near future.</P>

      <P>If the Minister does <Col N="1829" /> not allow this figure to be increased it will mean that we will have hundreds of those masts in Dublin.  Those people claim that Dublin could be served with piped television by two masts about 300 feet high.  One of those masts could possibly be situated at Killiney and the other at Howth. Those people have much greater knowledge of this matter than anybody in this House or even than the Minister has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I would like to say thanks to the Minister for his courtesy to me and to the number of people on whose behalf I have made representations. I would also like to thank his Department officials who at all times have been most courteous to me.  Because of the fact that we are Opposition and the Minister represents the Government nothing would give me greater pleasure than to criticise any and all actions of the Government but that does not mean we have to be personal about it.  A tendency has grown up in this House to attack personalities and, indeed, people and functions outside the House in an effort to try to have certain wrongs or alleged wrongs righted.  It is only fair that I should say I have never received anything <Col N="1830" /> but extreme courtesy from the Minister, and his officials, both senior and junior.</P>
      <P>It is well to mention that throughout the country the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are perhaps represented on a personal basis by a greater number of people than any other Department.  They treat the public with extreme courtesy in almost every case.  I know there are the odd exceptions. The Minister is aware of a particular case where I had an accident and was attempting to make a phone call late at night.  I found it extremely difficult to get through because I had not got the exact coins. There could have been a number of people dead at the time but that did not seem to worry the person who was carrying out regulations, who was most courteous but was not prepared to bend the regulations very much. These things happen and perhaps it is wrong to blame the person concerned.</P>
      <P>Those people are doing their job but I would like if the Minister could say whether or not it is possible in a case like that to have charges reversed. I attempted to do this on one occasion.  I found that somebody who wanted to ring me on an urgent matter had not got the necessary money for the long distance call and attempted to get the charges reversed to my line. Despite my assurance that I was in a position to pay the extra 5p the lady on the exchange would not accept this and would not allow the reverse charges.  When a request is made from the receiver an effort should be made to have the reverse charge arrangements carried out.</P>
      <P>We all complain that there are not enough telephones in the country.  I know it is extremely difficult to fill all the demands and that the waiting list is growing day by day.  Deputy O'Leary said it was because of the fact that we are developing.  It is because this is 1972 and in 1973 there will be more people looking for telephones and it does not matter what Government are here or whether the country is doing well or ill, because the tendency is for more telephones. There are certain priorities which have to receive attention and it is only right that they should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1831" /> People complain about the telephone service and say it is slow but that has not been my experience.  All of us tend to get annoyed from time to time when we dial a number and find somebody carrying on a conversation or worse still when somebody is making an important phone call and some irate lady or gentleman comes on the line and says: &ldquo;You are on my line&rdquo;, although the person has just dialled on to your line.  I suppose when this happens it is just a technical fault which will be eventually eradicated completely.</P>
    <P>We cannot say enough in condemnation of the vandals who destroy telephone kiosks.  This is a very great worry not alone in the city but also in the country areas.  You even find it in an area where it appears that a phone kiosk should be well protected when it is beside houses and out of view.  People still come along and not alone break the panes of glass in the kiosk but, in fact, pull the phone to pieces just out of pure devilment.  It is also very annoying to go into a phone kiosk and find the phone book has been ripped apart for no reason. If it was children who were doing this we could say it was the parents who were responsible but I understand in most cases that people who do this are somewhere between children and adults.  Apparently the one thing to make somebody go phone kiosk wrecking is for him to have a few drinks and then he will proceed to pull the phone out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Many kiosks are wrecked by people who have not been drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but so far as I am aware, most of the damage is done by people returning from late night functions and who have had some intoxicating liquor to drink. I have suggested to the Minister before that, perhaps, in outlying areas at least where kiosks are damaged so frequently, a type of almost indestructible unit might be erected.  I wonder whether there is any possibility of <Col N="1832" /> doing this.  It appears to be very easy to wreck the kiosks in use at present. There is no reason why, for instance, perspex could not be substituted for glass.  Perspex could not be broken very easily and its use would result in a large saving to the post office. Perhaps part of the kiosks could be made from concrete which would render them more difficult to wreck.</P>
      <P>For years I have been advocating that telephones be taken out of local post offices and put in kiosks outside. I am glad that these local post offices now have a half-day or a day off each week.  One can always find people to complain about the service not being available on a particular day but usually those who complain are the very people who ensure that they have a day off and become annoyed only because the post office does not remain open when they are free.</P>
      <P>I had an extraordinary experience in respect of a public telephone in one area.  It was pointed out to me that the post office in that area had been closed down but that the telephone remained inside.  I submitted a request to the Minister to have the telephone transferred from the building but the request was not granted on the grounds that there was no demand there for a telephone.  I do not know whether the Minister was suggesting housebreaking because nobody could have used the telephone without first breaking a door or a window of the building.  So far as I know that is still the position.  The area I refer to is Greenanstown, near Stamullen.  There is no other telephone within any reasonable distance of the post office building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time I am approached by elderly persons asking whether there is any chance of a telephone kiosk being erected in their areas.  I may have to point out to them that in their particular area there would be a danger of vandalism, but they remind me that it is not unknown for a kiosk to be erected in the garden or the yard of a private house.  This has been done to a large extent across the Border and has been done in certain areas in this part of the country too.  The people concerned offer to guard the kiosk.  The idea is a good one because it is important <Col N="1833" /> that elderly people have access to a telephone so that they can call a doctor if necessary, and nowadays doctors tend to live in close proximity to the area where the majority of their patients live.  It is not good enough to say that some of the neighbours have telephones because some of these neighbours may be hard of hearing if there is a knock on their door, although in my part of the country one can hardly blame people for not opening their doors at night when they do not know who is there.</P>
    <P>Many times I have asked the Minister to speed up the erection of buildings to be used as post offices and to improve facilities in the various post offices throughout the country.  I am glad that the work seems to be in progress. Perhaps, when the Minister is replying, he will be good enough to let me have a further list of what progress is likely to be made.  It is a matter in which many people are interested.</P>
    <P>Recently a number of people saw fit to prosecute the Minister because of inadequate facilities in post office buildings.  I have no wish to take sides either way except to say that if the State, by legislation, lays down minimum facilities, these minimum facilities at least should be available in any State-owned building.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Post Office letter service, postmen throughout the country are doing a very good job.  Last year I asked that some effort be made to persuade local authorities not to be repetitive when naming roads&mdash;for instance, that there would not be a Limerick Street, a Limerick Drive, a Limerick Hill and a Limerick Avenue.  This repetition makes it almost impossible for a postman to do his work, and it makes matters difficult also for those of us who try to find an address in any such area.  The Minister promised to make some recommendation to the local authorities in this matter and I wonder whether he has done so.</P>
    <P>Another matter in which there appears to be some neglect is in respect of newly built-up areas in rural districts.  For example, I live in the Laytown-Bettystown district and that area has grown tremendously <Col N="1834" /> during the past 20 years, and during the last four or five years in particular the population has increased greatly. Despite that there is almost the same system of postal delivery in operation now as there was 25 or 30 years ago. Only this morning, while I was in the local post office, I saw a postman preparing his deliveries which he intended taking out on a bicycle.  The delivery included about 20 large parcels together with much referendum literature and hundreds of letters. He had to deliver those over two fairly large built-up areas.  People at the lower end of the area complain to me that their postal delivery is late and ask why their mail should not be delivered as early as other people get theirs.  If they make inquiries at the post office, they may be told that it is not possible to cover the area with a van because of shortage of vehicles and, therefore, it is not possible to send out even the parcel delivery other than by the present means.</P>
    <P>If postmen were paid very well one might understand the difficulty of employing extra men.  In our area there have been at least six different postmen during the past couple of years.  The reason for this is that no one wishes to stay in a job that is both difficult and badly paid.  No doubt there are many other areas where the local post office officials seem to wish to forget that their areas have grown enormously and, therefore, require a greater service than in the past.  I hope the Minister will endeavour to have the services improved, in particular, the one in the area I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>For many years, too, I found it necessary to raise here the question of overtime payment for work done at Christmas time.  I am glad to see that much progress has been made in this regard and I hope that this year the position will be even better.  The solution arrived at is not the ideal one. There is a link between this and the matter to which I have been referring. There is a tendency towards the idea that, although an area grows in size and population, a postman should be able to cover it in the same number of hours as he covered it, say, ten years <Col N="1835" /> ago.  This is not a correct attitude. During my student days I worked as a temporary postman on one occasion in order to acquire some very necessary pocket money.  I found in the post office where I worked that a couple of weeks before Christmas a series of documents arrived setting out the arrangements for Christmas.  They were printed on five sheets of paper when they could have fitted on one sheet.  I do not know whether this practice is in operation today but it struck me as being extraordinary that it should have been carried on by the Post Office, of all people.</P>
    <P>Another matter which would be of interest to people in this House concerns letters posted to us at this address. Recently I received a letter from a gentleman who had not put a stamp on the envelope.  When this happens I always pay the fee, but I write to the person subsequently pointing out that letters to us should be stamped.  In the particular instance I refer to the gentleman very kindly refunded the 8p to me, which I subsequently returned to him; but he told me that, on inquiring at the counter at the GPO as to whether letters to Members of the Oireachtas should be stamped, he was told that letters addressed to us here are free of postage.  I queried this by telephone call and got the same reply. When I pointed out that this is not the position, I was told that heads of Departments are entitled to free postage and in some way they equated the head of a Department with a Member of this House.  Explicit instructions should be given that nobody in this House, other than Ministers, is entitled to receive a letter that has not been stamped without first paying the fee due.  If one is receiving a dozen or so of these letters in a period of a couple of days, the matter becomes more than a minor one.  We have free postage out and this tends to confuse people.  I make the point because it is a simple matter which can very easily be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I mentioned to the Minister last year, and he was kind enough to say he would do something about it, the type of letterbox local authorities are providing, particularly in the case of <Col N="1836" /> new houses.  It has been pointed out to me that a postman would run the risk of injury to his finger if he were to push a letter through one of these letterboxes.  Those who manufacture these letterboxes do not seem to care.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made and will continue to be made about the cost of the postal services.  One never hears a complaint about the Department of Finance costing too much.  The Department of Finance never seem to have to defend their existence.  The officials of the Department of Finance never have to blush by reason of an increased tax caused by some increase that they have got.  It is terribly unfair that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, which gives such good service, should be blamed when the cost of administration goes up.  Postmen are told that they have got a few shillings extra and that as a result the price of stamps has increased. This stupid nonsense was started by a predecessor of the Minister who defended his Department by claiming that because of wage increases it had been necessary to increase postage rates.  It is wrong that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is expected to pay its way.  The Department is a social service in a big way, apart from being a business requirement.</P>
    <P>Is there any hope of political freedom being given to the officials of the Department, at least up to a certain grade?  It is not sufficient to say that the matter is under consideration.  I have been listening to that reply for a long time.  Numerous discussions have taken place, to no avail.  The Minister would be advised to do something about it.  As was pointed out to him, the man who climbs the telegraph pole should have the same right as the man who climbs the ESB pole. It does not seem right that one should have liberty to join a political party while the other is debarred from doing so.  Many of them do join political parties.  It would be a sad day for Ireland if they did not.  In doing so, however, they run the risk of losing their jobs.  It is a fact of life that these people consider that they have a political right.  They are intelligent people and they are entitled to have <Col N="1837" /> a political view and should be entitled to work for it.  This right has been conceded in Britain.  I do not hold up everything British as being right, but this is an example which we should follow.  The Minister can find a way of dealing with at least some part of this problem and the situation could be improved in time.</P>
    <P>I heard some of my colleagues knocking the radio and television service in a big way and I heard Deputy Crowley knocking Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and Senator Kelly in a bigger way.  He is a big man.  The tendency has developed for those who do not appear on radio and television to be jealous of those who do.  I am sure that if Deputy Crowley were to write a book worth reading and discussing, he would get £1,000 worth of free advertising.  He should leave it at that. It is a characteristic of the Irish to knock someone who is getting on.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with those who say that if there were a choice of channels we would switch off Telefís Éireann and look at some other programme.  I have a choice of four or five stations and the remarkable thing is that for most of the time it is RTE that is switched on.  Let us be fair about this.  There are programmes on RTE which I do not look at because they are not my type of programme.  If RTE were to screen a programme to please everybody, what kind of programme would that be?  RTE have to cater for everybody and they do that to the best of their ability.  If there is a programme on television or radio with which one does not agree that does not mean that the station is a bad station.  We should be a little bigger in our attitude.  There are excellent programmes on the BBC, on ITV, UTV and BBC2 but they are no more excellent than one will get on RTE If a viewer selects a particularly good BBC programme he will tell everybody about the great station that it is.  People will say that RTE is no good because it has only one good programme.  I cannot follow that reasoning.  Some programmes that I have seen from any one of the stations make me see red.  In that event, I do not break the set, I just switch off. <Col N="1838" /> I would advise those who are so critical of RTE to do the same.</P>
    <P>It is unfair that in some parts of the country where there is no television reception the people have to pay the same licence fee as applies in areas where there is good reception.  We cater for undeveloped areas under various headings.  There is no reason why we should not cater especially for areas where there is no TV reception by providing that persons in these areas will get television completely free until an adequate service can be made available to them.  This would not apply in my constituency.  It is unfair to ask persons who do not get the service to pay the same licence fee as those who get reception not only from RTE but from other stations.</P>
    <P>The Minister let the cat out of the bag when Deputy Treacy was needling him this morning, when he said that he only did what RTE recommended. The RTE Authority are completely wrong if they try to stop, as they appear to be doing, the extension of piped television.  I hope to live to see the day when everybody will be able to get many stations and when an aerial of about three inches long will enable one to get all stations.  I fail to understand why this has not been done in the case of television.  There was a neighbour of mine who did not believe in paying a television licence fee and he had an aerial in what we call the cockloft.  He got the same reception as I did, or better, because weather conditions did not affect his reception.  He has gone to his reward and has quite good viewing where he is now without having to pay a licence fee.</P>
    <P>To suggest that only 500 can be connected to piped television is absolutely ludicrous.  There should be a very big extension given and, if the Minister wants to make some regulation whereby he can charge for connections and make something out of them, I do not think that would be resented too much.  What is resented is the fact that certain local authorities are making it a condition of tenancy that no aerials be erected. They say that piped television will come along eventually.  The position <Col N="1839" /> is that someone who has left a bad house in which there was television reception now finds himself in a new house, for which a high rent has to be paid, without any television.  This is altogether wrong.  Not only is it wrong but I think it would be very difficult for any local authority to sustain an action against a tenant because he committed the crime of attempting to deceive Telefís Éireann. This is a matter which the Department and local authorities will have to have out one of these days.  Under no circumstances may an aerial be erected anywhere in the precincts of the house.</P>
    <P>Some piped television companies promise to erect an aerial within a reasonable time and they then let the whole thing drag on for months. Eventually, when the aerial is erected, the agreement is so wide that, every time a payment is being made, the renter finds that the payment has increased. This is something which will have to be controlled.  It will have to be controlled by the Department.  The people find themselves paying through the nose to those who put up the aerial.  This is utterly wrong.  The Minister says that he believes there will be perfect reception at some stage, perhaps in ten years' time.  I wonder where, in ten years' time, the Minister and I and many other people will be.  I should like to see this happening in our time and I believe our time is much less than ten years.</P>
    <P>Everything possible should be done to improve reception.  The narrowminded view that allowing what was referred to here as a &ldquo;foreign influence&rdquo; in through television is a lot of damn nonsense.  Indeed, I think it is now recognised as such because some of the programmes, particularly those from Northern Ireland, show a far higher degree of Irish culture than anything put on by RTE.  If someone does not want to look at a programme he can turn it off.  To imagine that the people down in the south are not as intelligent as those more fortunately placed is a very grave mistake.</P>
    <P>Radio is vastly underrated.  It has a tremendous influence and a very large <Col N="1840" /> listening public.  I think radio does a very good job and it should be accepted as a very important medium of communication.  I have one particular comment to make with regard to the news.  At 9 o'clock one gets the news bulletins.  I do not agree with those who allege that the news readers read too quickly.  I think they do a pretty good job.  If the news in Irish is read a bit rapidly I have difficulty in following it, but that is probably my fault and not the fault of the news reader.</P>
    <P>With regard to the news generally, at 7.30 a.m. one gets the news headlines. At eight o'clock one gets the news again.  So it goes on right throughout the day; it is a rehash of the 7.30 a.m. news right through and it is no longer news.  An effort should be made to make the news as up to date as possible.  Surely it should be possible to vary the news.  Things change rapidly and surely we could have more up-to-date news.  I do not know who is responsible.  We had the recent highjacking in the USA <i>ad nauseum,</i> not alone on radio but also on television.  Even the next day, when everyone knew what had happened, we had all the travels of these poor people depicted, from America to Cuba, from Cuba back into America, and back into Cuba again.  This is absolutely wrong.  Someone does not seem to understand that we do not need a tedious repetition of all the gory details.  We want to hear about it, certainly, but let that be an end of it.</P>
    <P>Could we not get more Irish news, local news?  We want to hear what is happening in the world but we would also like a little more information about what is happening at home.  Possibly some members on the Press Gallery will say tomorrow morning that all we want to hear is about somebody's pig being knocked down by a car or a pump going out of action.  That is not the kind of thing I mean.  There are important things happening in the country.</P>
    <P>Again, must we get the chronic repetition of what is happening across the Border?  In a ten minute news bulletin seven minutes were devoted to what was happening across the <Col N="1841" /> Border.  It is not good news but, as the Minister for Health said on one occasion, good news does not seem to be news.  We all know that these things are happening.  We cannot pretend they are not happening.  The Ceann Comhairle and I, who live close to the Border, know that a great many things are happening which do not reach the news at all.  Why the incessant interviewing of people in Belfast and Derry?  That is not my idea of disseminating news.  Perhaps I am a little critical of a station which is, I believe, doing a good job, but these are practical points and these are points which should receive attention.</P>
    <P>Could an effort not be made to get Radio Éireann into London and other areas in Britain?  The only way one can get Radio Éireann in London is by going into a very quiet room and holding a radio up to one's ear, in the hope that something will leak through. This will cost money but there are a great many of our own people in Britain who would love to hear Radio Éireann.  Many of them contributed a great deal to this country before they went to Britain.  If we are really serious in all the talk about the Irish abroad we should at least give them the opportunity of hearing the home station.</P>
    <P>It is possible on occasions to get Telefís Éireann in Newry.  Beyond that one does not get it.  Surely we should make an effort to throw it across into Northern Ireland.  I meet a great many people in that area who tell me they cannot get Telefís Éireann.  An effort should be made to improve reception. I understand this is quite possible with radio and, while it may cost money, it would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke spoke at length, and very well indeed, in Gaelic on Radio na Gaeltachta.  I said at the beginning that I do not propose to speak in Irish because my Irish is not fluent enough to carry on the same type of discussion as Deputy Burke engaged in.  I do not believe the investment in Radio na Gaeltachta was a good one.  The transmission time is short and the range is very poor.  We have two Gaeltacht areas in County Meath and they have no hope of getting anything from <Col N="1842" /> Radio na Gaeltachta.  I believe the range is about 30 miles.  If that is so there has been bad planning.  The Gaeltacht people are entitled to a programme but there is no point in giving the impression that something is being given at high expense which in reality is not being given.  If we are going to do something let us do it properly; if not, let us not do it at all.  I consider it is wrong that we tend to put a gloss on things by pretending we are doing something which is not being done.</P>
    <P>I happen to be lucky enough to live in an area where we can get excellent colour television.  Colour adds a new dimension to television.  The higher costs of colour television are coming within reasonable limits.  Colour makes a tremendous difference.  Sports events on colour television are almost as real as if one were present.  I could not get a ticket for Croke Park recently and I watched the match on television and saw much more of it than if I had been sitting in the stand.  This is the experience of most people.  In shows from across the water the colours are really out of this world.  I know colour television will cost a great deal if RTE introduce it but, apparently, it is not known that they have been using a good deal of canned television.  I heard one of my colleagues commenting on &ldquo;canned&rdquo; television as if it were something not to be mentioned in polite company.  I do not agree.  We get some excellent &ldquo;canned&rdquo; television from abroad and the colour film particularly which Telefís Éireann is using is very good.  Some of the films which in black and white would be terrible really look something in colour.  There is no reason why every effort should not be made to use as much colour as possible on RTE.</P>
    <P>From time to time we have been putting politicians on the television screen and around election time the tendency is that no matter what happens a Minister must appear at least once in every news transmission.  That is not such a bad thing provided it is not overdone. There is another type of programme where the man seems to live in the studio.  Again, I suppose the powers-that-be are entitled to use whatever they can.  I shall leave this thought with <Col N="1843" /> the Minister: it might not be a bad idea to have more sensible discussions&mdash;and it has been proved that this can be done&mdash;on sensible subjects in RTE. The Minister should remember that even in this country Governments change and it is not a good thing for something could and must be done to a Government to give all the edge to its own side and it might be better if they would spread it around more.  I am certainly not blaming the cameramen or news staff or anybody sent along to record the smallest thing a Minister does but it is important to remember that everybody in the country is a politician&mdash;that is my personal experience&mdash;and all have their own political views.  It might be a good idea if they were given an opportunity of seeing some of the people in the Opposition as well as Ministers.</P>
    <P>Finally, it has been said by Deputy Crowley that RTE seem to select people who appear again and again. They select the people they think are important but perhaps we should try a system that has been adopted in other countries where the backbenchers, the people who never take much part in debates, are brought to the fore.  It might not do them much good and some of them might be better if this did not happen, but it would give them an opportunity and show them that we could be broadminded and that there is no privileged group from which people are being selected.  It might be wise to allow this to be done.  Very few people would then be able to criticise what happens in RTE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Department, one of the most important in the State.  It is often downgraded but there is hardly a person in the country who is not involved with this Department nearly every day in every week.  I know that the Minister is doing his best and that the Department are starved for money but I think the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is a misnomer; it should be called the Department of Posts and no telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody asked a question last week and it was tragic to find that in <Col N="1844" /> 1972 there are 22,000 applications for telephones that have not yet been attended to.  Whoever is responsible, this is a disgrace.  The telephone is now the most important item in the household. Almost every household that can afford it wants a telephone.  Surely something could and must be done to improve this situation.  Money is provided for many things which we could do without.  Could we have telephones installed, so that applicants who are daily making requests to their public representatives for telephones could be satisfied?  Is it because we are so far away from headquarters in my constituency that we have, I am sure, the greatest number of applicants on the waiting list?  My colleagues, Deputy Murphy and Deputy Crowley, have mentioned this and I also appeal to the Department that wherever they get the money they should provide telephones to applicants as soon as possible.  I know some who are waiting two or three years.  I am putting down a question next week to find the number of applications from South West Cork constituency, how long they are waiting and when can the Minister say these telephones will be installed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) (for the Minister for Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that the health boards apply inflexible standards in determining eligibility for medical cards. Income standards used by the boards for this purpose have regard to the number of dependants in the family, and allowances are made for certain fixed outgoings on a house, such as rent and rates.  In some areas, expenses involved in travelling to work are also <Col N="1845" /> taken into consideration.  Even where a person's income and allowances do not bring him within the standards, it is open to the chief executive officer to grant a medical card where, otherwise because of family circumstances, undue hardship would be involved.  I am satisfied that the chief executive officers of health boards in general are very reasonable in the manner in which they deal with applications for cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there is a national outcry so far as the determination of applications for medical cards is concerned? The income standards laid down in the case of a wage-earner is £17 per man and wife plus £1 for each additional child, but the gross income is taken into account in determining the application.  Irrespective of long standing illness of a member, or members of a family, the application is refused if the gross income is in excess of the amounts laid down.</P>
      <P>If I might make a second point so far as self-employed people are concerned, for instance, farmers, they are obliged to have reports from the creameries and shop keepers have to furnish business reports when they apply for medical cards.  Is the Minister not aware that health boards are rigid in the enforcement of regulations and do not take into account any illness suffered by one or more members of a family?  Formerly such illnesses were taken into account and this should continue to obtain under the Health Act, 1970.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that in the past ten years the level of industrial earnings has risen by 262 per cent and the level of agricultural earnings by 290 per cent.  In spite of that fact on average 30 per cent of the population &mdash;it is 50 per cent in certain of the more depressed areas&mdash;are in receipt of medical cards.  As was pointed out in the reply, there is discretion for the chief executive officer of any health board to use his own judgment where he considers undue hardship would be involved.  I should like to point out that it was the express desire of Members <Col N="1846" /> of this House during the years that some form of standardisation in regard to the issue of medical cards should be operated.  It seems odd to me that even though there is flexibility, the basis of the Deputy's complaints now is that the formulation of such standards is undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that it costs at least £1 for a person outside the choice of doctor scheme to visit a doctor to get advice from him?  This means that the person must visit the doctor again when he needs medicine or medical appliances because the prescription can be used only once.  Am I to assume that the provisions in relation to families whose members suffer illness over a long period are removed now?  Further, is the Minister aware that in relation to the standards laid down, the former health authority in Cork county &mdash;and I think it applied throughout the country&mdash;laid down as the qualifying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the regulations existing with regard to child-minding establishments in this country; and whether he will consider instituting legislation requiring all such establishments to be registered and subject to inspection by his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legislation which requires the registration of child-minding establishments.</P>
      <P>Voluntary agencies, particularly in the Eastern Health Board area, operate day nurseries in certain working-class districts to facilitate mothers who, by reason of economic necessity, have to go out to work and receive grants from the relevant health board to assist them. Such nurseries, because of the grant payable, are subject to inspection by officers of the health board.</P>
      <P>I am aware that, particularly in the Dublin area, a considerable number of small nurseries are operated by private individuals and mothers pay an economic charge for the care of their children in them.  The mothers concerned must be presumed to be responsible and of such a level of intelligence that they would not entrust their children to the persons running such nurseries unless they were satisfied with the conditions obtaining in them.  In these circumstances, I do not feel that action on my part or on the part of health boards is called for.  If, however, the Deputy or any organisation interested in the matter, can show that there is a need for inspection or registration I will be prepared to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is that, imports of potatoes are very seriously curtailed, and when they are imported they are imported for the propagation of seed.  The seed is imported in very small quantities indeed and is propagated in strict isolation.  There are two EEC directives in operation for the control of disease but neither one nor the other would be the cause of any great anxiety to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not anticipate any difficulty in our present disease-free situation which we would be entitled to preserve.  Just as in the case of cattle disease, and our disease-free status in that field, we are entitled to preserve our disease-free status in plant disease as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has asked enough supplementaries. May I ask one?  Did the Minister for Health, quite recently, not talk about the ill-effects on pregnant women of eating potatoes which are the subject of blight?  I think, of course, the Minister for Health was wrong; but is the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries aware of the statement on behalf of the Government that potatoes diseased from blight do cause pregnant women trouble?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevance of this question escapes me, but if the Deputy is implying that when I talk about the disease-free status of this country in relation to potatoes I mean all potato diseases, I do not mean any such thing.  Potato blight is common, as far as I know, to all temperate countries where potatoes are grown, but there are several other diseases of potatoes which we do not have here, fortunately, and we will endeavour, with great vigour, to ensure that we continue in that way.</P>

      <P>The question of co-operative acquisition of certain of the Dairy Disposal Company's creameries in County Kerry was the main subject of discussion with a deputation from the mid-Kerry groups of milk suppliers which I received last June and with the Listowel deputation which was received by officials of my Department in July.  My views on the general question of reorganisation of the creamery industry in County Kerry and transfer to co-operative ownership of the Dairy Disposal Company's interests there were indicated at a press conference on 10th October.  As I said then there is no bar to the purchase of the Dairy Disposal Company's creameries by co-operative groups of suppliers under a comprehensive rationalisation scheme and the most satisfactory ultimate solution in County Kerry would, in my view, be one co-operative society for the whole county.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that the best course of action now for the groups referred to by the Deputy would be to seek to formulate together a comprehensive scheme for take-over of the company's creamery interests in the county with a view to the ultimate formation of one co-operative society for the whole county.</P>
      <P>For the record, I should add that at the meeting in July with the deputation from Listowel, no assurance was given about arranging for a meeting with the Dairy Disposal Company.</P>

      <P>To correct the erroneous implication of the first question, I must emphasise that the incidence of bovine tuberculosis has decreased over the past three years.  I am not satisfied with the pace of this reduction and it was in that regard that the meeting of 26th October was arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that meeting, my Department were represented by nine senior administrative and professional officers. The bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication schemes and procedures were reviewed in detail and suggestions were sought as to how these might be improved.  To study these matters further a special committee were formed comprising two representatives each from the Irish Farmers' Association, <Col N="1864" /> the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the Irish Veterinary Association, two chief agricultural officers of county committees of agriculture and officers of the Department. The first meeting of this committee took place on 9th November.  They will meet again on 17th November and possibly may have one or two further meetings.  I look forward to their recommendations.</P>
    <P>The detailed report of the very wide ranging discussion of 26th October took some days to prepare.  It was circulated on 8th November but, unfortunately, had not reached me personally by the morning of 9th November.</P>

      <P>This is vital.  This is what Deputy Donegan and I are concerned about.  Will the proposals, in so far as they can be agreed, be agreed upon?  Will this agreement be sought by further circulation of the Parliamentary Secretary's views before he actually makes an order?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultations have been going on for some time and are continuing.  Before an order is finally made, we hope to have a certain amount of agreement.  We cannot get entire agreement, because when one sets out to prevent somebody from doing what he is engaged in at the present time he is certainly not going to agree.  Eventually, we will have to make an order but we hope to have a reasonable measure of agreement.  The final draft of the order will not be referred back to the fishermen for their approval.</P>

      <Col N="1870" /> Will that be done before the order is actually made?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

      <P>Consultation is vital, but will they all be able to say that they have all been met?  They have been met in the sense that they have been talked to without hope of any changes.  That is not consultation, but a subterfuge for consultation.  I am asking that there should be a clear assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that the fishermen and those who depend for their livelihood on net fishing will be given full information before the Parliamentary Secretary decides on the final shape of the regulations which he proposes to make.  In other words, the regulations should not be a rehash of what has leaked out by way of rumour and from deputations, and that is that no changes will be made anyhow.  There is no point in side-stepping the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of side-stepping.  The draft text of the order was circulated to the Boards of Conservators whose responsibility it will be to issue licences.  They had consultations with the fishermen. They were particularly asked to consult with the fishermen's co-operatives. I was asked to receive deputations.  I have received deputations and have listened to the fishermen telling me what their objections are to what is contained in the draft order.  Some changes have already been made in what we propose to put into the order so that the impact on those who make their livelihood from drift-net fishing, such as salmon fishing, will be as light as possible.  We are trying to protect the traditional fisherman.  We have altered the draft order from what was originally intended and are still <Col N="1871" /> making alterations in it, following discussions with the fishermen.  We hope to arrive eventually at something which will be in the interests of fishermen themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The agreement of the local fishermen to the scheme of works approved for execution at Moville was reached at a meeting held in Moville on 8th June, 1971, at which the fishermen and representatives of my Department, the Office of Public Works and the Donegal County Council attended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to put this to contradict that in order to get the question properly understood.  The fishermen themselves by concensus differ widely from what is now proposed to be done, but that is the manner in which their supposed agreement was got.  It is because of that that I am asking that it should be got secretly <Col N="1873" /> in order that there would be a true ascertainment of their wishes.  I am not casting reflections on the people who have chosen the siting at the moment but it differs, as the Parliamentary Secretary is probably aware, from the original proposition which was also chosen by the experts and with which the fishermen truly did agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time today that something has come up with regard to the fishermen and what they require to be done.  As Deputy Blaney has said, the scheme was approved early in 1970 for Moville.  I visited Moville in October, 1970, and the fishermen I met there, and their public representatives, were unanimous in asking for a change in that scheme.  They said to me quite clearly that there was not sufficient consultation with the fishermen when the original scheme was drawn up.  I found this to be so on my visits to other ports as well, so I said there should be sufficient consultation, that I would arrange a meeting between the representatives of my Department and the Office of Public Works, and that this meeting would be held in Moville where the requests of the fishermen could be listened to, and met, if at all possible.</P>
      <P>That meeting took place in June, 1971, and a much larger scheme than the original one was decided upon there costing £65,000 as against £45,000 for the original one.  It met with the unanimous approval of those present.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the employment situation in the area.  I understand from the Industrial Development Authority that, at present, there are under construction in Waterford city three projects, one of which is an expansion.  The estimated employment to be given by these projects at full production is about 200 persons, of whom 180 will be male.</P>
      <P>A further three projects are under consideration and would involve employment of about 620 persons, mainly male.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what steps are being taken with a view to having industries established in towns in County Mayo such as Ballycastle, Killala, Crossmolina, Ballina, Foxford, Swinford, Charlestown, Kiltimagh, Claremorris, Balla, Ballindine, Hollymount, Irishtown, Knock, Ballyhaunis, Kilkelly and other centres which are suitable for industrial development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority are aware of the need for the establishment of new industries in County Mayo and the authority's regional industrial plans propose the creation of 1,600 new jobs in manufacturing industry in the county during the five years 1973 to 1977, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the individual towns mentioned, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question by him in May last which indicated that the combined target for Ballina, Killala, Foxford and Crossmolina is 600 jobs; that Swinford, Charlestown and Kiltimagh are included in a group of towns with a corresponding target of 650 jobs; and that Claremorris and Ballyhaunis are included in a group with a target of 300 jobs.  The other towns mentioned by the Deputy are not specifically listed in the IDA's <Col N="1878" /> plans but these and other centres are eligible for the wide range of grants and financial incentives generally available for industrial development.</P>
    <P>Three advance factories are at present under construction at Ballina, Ballinrobe and Claremorris and a fourth is planned for Swinford.  In addition, the IDA have initiated a programme of purchasing land suitable for industrial development and sites have already been acquired in Ballina and Claremorris.</P>
    <P>Grants have been approved by the IDA for two industrial projects for County Mayo with an estimated employment of 390 at full production. There are also, six projects under consideration for small industry grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will declare Drogheda a designated area temporarly for the purpose of Industrial Development Authority grants in order to alleviate unemployment by the establishment of further factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The designation of a particular area inevitably leads to considerable pressure for extension of the concession to other areas, thus leading to the danger of erosion of the grant differential applied to areas already designated; therefore, designation is an instrument which must be very sparingly used.  The present grant levels should provide adequate incentive <Col N="1879" /> to attract industry to Drogheda and I am not satisfied that the designation of Drogheda even for a temporary period, would be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the construction of the new cement factory there were 2,000 temporary jobs, that that construction has now finished and that there are only a few hundred people employed on production in that factory?  This has created a very high unemployment figure.  Would the Minister not agree that my request, asking for a temporary designation, would take care of people's fears in this regard? I am not asking for permanent designation, only temporary designation, because of the shock which occurred and the high unemployment figure as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Any designations I have used are in relation to designations specifically for a temporary period where it is felt that there is great anxiety to endeavour to attract an alternative industry where an industry is seriously affected and a factory is being closed. The disclosures recently in connection with Drogheda and the difficulty about the creation of an estate for industrial development seem to have been the reason why there was not industrial development recently.  This has now been got over and I am satisfied, arising from the volume of industrial development that has taken place in Drogheda through the years, that there is not any necessity to designate Drogheda and to earmark additional grants in order to generate further industrial expansion in that town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that while we have now got an industrial estate and objections have been overcome that the effect of this will not be felt for a period of a year or 18 months?  Would he not further agree that in the case of Dundalk, where there was great unemployment recently because of the closing of some factories, that the designation of Dundalk, another developing town, had a very good effect in that it produced industries very quickly?  Would the Minister not agree that there is a <Col N="1880" /> case for such action in the case of Drogheda, say for a year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would appreciate the position if he was in my place and listening to the various deputations that call to me in the event of closures arising from the question of designation.  The immediate come-back is that designation may succeed in attracting alternative industry but what will happen in the interim, between now and the 18 months when the outcome of the designation and the industry attracted will have proved of benefit?  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that about 18 months must elapse in a case like this before employment can be generated into this area.  The whole problem as far as Drogheda is concerned is the availability of sites.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that the recommendations contained in the Atkins Report are of a startling nature with widespread consequences for a large sector of the textile industry?  Surely he has an obligation to place these facts before the House?  Can the Minister assure us that he is taking into account the <Col N="1882" /> social consequences which will arise from the implementation of this report, if it is adhered to by the Minister?  Is he not aware that it will virtually wipe out whole communities dependent on the textile industry?  Before implementing it will he satisfy himself that the Atkins Report is relevant to the situation, that it is a factual report and will he have regard to the latest information in respect of many of these mills which indicates their potential viability if assisted by the Minister and the various agencies under his control?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing extraordinarily startling in the findings of the Atkins Report because it was quite clear for some time, arising from CIO reports, that it was an industry which needed to look into itself with a view to rationalising and modernising itself. Everything possible is being done for this industry.  The object of this exercise is to make sure that instead of the redundancies we have we will avoid still greater redundancy issues. I should like to stress that the allegation here is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is closing mills. Where they close they do so due to the pressure of economic realities because they cannot pay their way.  For a considerable time a number of those mills have been operating uneconomically and would have closed down long ago if the Government had not intervened to support them.  The big difficulty now is to ensure the viability of the remainder of this industry and to achieve the maximum amount of continued employment within the woollen and worsted industry.  No action by the task force which I have created will be taken except with that one end product in mind.</P>

The receivers are moving in, too, in respect of the Irish Worsted Mills at Portlaoise and I am afraid that the third may come to the same fate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 40 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>On 18th September, 1972, I received the report which is concerned with the position of 20 firms engaged in spinning and machine weaving and whose business is for the most part based on the home market.  The report confirms that the sector is in a very weak position and that some firms are in imminent danger of closure.  Moreover, the report states that if the industry were to continue in its present form there is a grave danger that further firms would be forced out of business, thereby creating far greater redundancies than those now envisaged.  It is, accordingly, essential to set about restructuring the industry on the lines envisaged in the report.</P>
      <P>To secure restructuring of the industry in a way that would provide employment opportunities at the highest level consistent with viability, I have set up a &ldquo;task force&rdquo; to work in conjunction with the consultants and with both sides of industry.  As an exceptional measure, in the special circumstances of the industry, and having regard also to representations made to me by both sides of the industry, I have agreed that limited and short-term financial support should be provided where the &ldquo;task force&rdquo; consider it appropriate, or necessary, to those firms assessed as not viable and which would otherwise have to close immediately or in the very near future.  Such support will be limited to the amount needed in any particular case to maintain activity at not more than its present level and to discharge only those obligations which would arise during the period of support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated total net redundancies if the consultants proposals were implemented in full would be 1994.  It is envisaged that the unavoidable redundancies will occur gradually.  I have requested the IDA to take all <Col N="1888" /> possible steps to provide alternative employment opportunities in the areas where closures are seen to be inevitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this industry was, in fact, totally studied, first of all, in 1960, in the pilot study and, secondly, by the CIO some years later and that these reports identified problems and included confidential reports to the Minister, not published, on the position of individual firms and that the Minister and the Department had in their possession ten years ago and more the information required for any restructuring which is thought necessary? Would he not further agree that the failure to act on these reports, including the confidential reports, has contributed to the present situation and that firms now in danger could indeed, have been saved if action had been taken in accordance with the recommendations made and would he state why, in fact, no adequate action was taken on the basis of these reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the questions refers to the reports which may be ten years old.  I want to say in this regard that there is no doubt that the reports issuing on this subject over a period and some ten years ago did indicate that the woollen and worsted industry would need to make a close examination of itself and that there have been COIP reports since in this regard along similar lines.  This is why it surprises me when I am attacked for using a group like Atkins to examine this proposition and to make recommendations to me, especially in view of the fact that the appointment of those consultants was made with the agreement of both sides of the industry and that they were fully in agreement with the appointment of this group which they looked upon as experts in this field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any reason for me to say that it is possible to set up a task force to implement a report that will have the power to vary the report.  The report is a report of the situation as found by the experts in the earlier part of this year.  Having accepted that report, the task force are examining the situation from the point of view of trying to carry out the restructuring operation, not from the point of view of trying to change the experts' report.</P>

Will the Minister not also agree that in regard to the closure of particular factories, particularly the worsted mills in Portlaoise, who have orders on their books for £250,000, of which £75,000 worth are for export, and also a company who have assets valued at approximately £300,000&mdash;</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question relates to the position of firms in that sector of the wool textile industry which has recently <Col N="1895" /> been examined by consultants with a view to the formulation of proposals for its restructuring.  The industry's difficulties can be attributed to various adverse factors including the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;failure to rationalise resulting in overcapacity, too wide a range of production and high production costs;</P>
      <P>&mdash;increased competition arising from technological and fashion changes;</P>
      <P>&mdash;adverse market conditions worldwide in 1970 and 1971;</P>
      <P>&mdash;low productivity and rising costs;</P>
      <P>&mdash;weak selling;</P>
      <P>&mdash;management weaknesses.</P>
      <P>These factors have, of course, not affected all firms to the same degree.</P>

Would the Minister now say why, therefore, nothing has been done in the meantime and why he is now telling the IDA to look for alternative industries for these centres when the CIO specifically recommended that centres which were likely to be affected by free trade, and identified as such in the confidential report, should be given special assistance in order to provide an alternative industry 12 years ago?

      <P>The recently published supplement to the SFADCO five-year programme for the industrial development of the mid-west region contains a projection of 40 jobs for Miltown Malbay and Kilrush-Kilkee.  This figure, however, relates only to the employment to be created by SFADCO's direct action in providing advance factories at these locations.

No expert study has been carried out in relation to the matter mentioned in the second part of the Deputy's question, but in view of the extension to two months of the period for tax payments, there should be a considerable improvement in the liquidity situation of retailers.</P>

In the few cases where excessive prices were being charged, the traders concerned <Col N="1908" /> reduced their prices to the correct level at the request of the inspectors. All complaints received about unwarranted price increases will be investigated by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome an advance question from the Deputy on this matter.  There is no question of a manufacturer being allowed to charge any increase without getting prior sanction from the National Prices Commission.  If, as a consequence of an increase in the price of sugar a manufacturer of any commodity in which sugar is used puts up the price he is acting wrongly and would be dealt with.  However, I do not accept that this has happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The manufacturer should apply to the National Prices Commission.  For instance, if the price of sugar was increased at the <Col N="1911" /> end of last month there is no reason why the price of the commodity in which sugar was used&mdash;for example, sweets&mdash;should be increased as a result of the rise in the price of sugar.</P>

      <P>No, so far as I know the action had been taken previous to that by the National Prices Commission. I should like to point out it is not the Minister but the National Prices Commission who initiated this action.

      <P>Calculations from the latest official statistics show that in the three-months' period from mid-May to mid-August, 1972, food prices increased by 4.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>There are many factors which cause increases in food prices: increased prices received by home producers; increased import prices and increased costs of wages, materials and overheads incurred by firms processing foodstuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> I have no power to control prices paid to producers of primary agricultural and horticultural products, as they are excluded from the scope of the Prices Acts, nor can I control import prices.  Proposals for price increases by manufacturers and processors of foodstuffs are examined by the National Prices Commission who recommend increases only where they are justified by unavoidable increases in costs.</P>

The commission recommended price increases in 50 of these cases.  In a number of cases, the increases recommended were less than the increases proposed by the firms concerned.</P>

Particulars of all price increases recommended to me are available from the published monthly reports of the National Prices Commission, which are in the Oireachtas Library and which are also circulated to each Deputy.  On the day on which each monthly report of the commission was published, I indicated in a Press statement that I had accepted the commission's recommendations for price increases for the firms concerned and that I would raise no objection to the implementation of these increases.</P>
      <P>Each of the 313 price increases in question may involve many individual items.  An average figure for the amount of increase in the 313 cases is not readily available and in any event would not be a realistic one. The effort necessary to produce a figure would not be warranted.</P>
      <P>For the reasons given in their report for January, 1972, the commission have not made any calculation of the average of the price increases recommended by them.</P>

      <P>I have seen the press report referred to by the Deputy. I am aware of the extent to which consumer prices in Ireland have risen. I deplore this trend in our prices but, as I have said before, if costs, including in particular wages and salaries, rise faster than national output, the general level of prices will rise.  If the gap between the rise in incomes and the growth of output is greater than in other countries, prices will rise faster here than in those countries.</P>
      <P>The future position will therefore depend on our success in curbing excessive growth in money incomes and stimulating output.</P>

The Deputy is no doubt aware that there is a variety of proposals on company law emanating from the EEC, and I feel that the identification of parties involved in takeovers may well be relevant to some of these proposals.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>All companies are required by law to file an annual return with the Registrar of Companies.  This return contains particulars of the directors, secretary and members, details of share capital, of registered mortagages and debentures.  In additional public companies are required to attach a copy of their annual accounts to the return. These returns may be inspected by the public.  Other bodies such as industrial and provident societies, friendly societies, building societies and trade unions must file an annual return of their financial position with the Registrar of Friendly Societies and these too are open to inspection by the public. To this extent certain information is already available to employees.</P>
      <P>I have in mind for some time now the question of whether the requirements relating to the publishing of information by companies should be extended, but as it is likely that changes in this respect will in any event be necessitated by certain EEC directives which are as yet in draft form, it would be premature for me to take decisions until the EEC position becomes clearer.</P>

Would the Minister accept that it is urgently in the national interest that there should be maintained in his Department a separate register dealing particularly with the extent to which businesses are Irish-controlled and owned so that we will have some idea as to who owns which Irish company and whose rights are concerned?  There is an appalling lack of information on the subject of takeovers of which there are many going on at the moment.

      <P>It is not necessary to set up a review body to examine and report on all aspects of mergers and large take-overs of industrial concerns. Such a body already exists in the Restrictive Practices Commission which is obliged by section 12 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, to study and analyse the effect on the common good of those and other activities of an economic nature. Furthermore, I have already introduced a Bill in this House providing for investigation and control of mergers, take-overs and monopolies and I propose to take the Second Stage during the present Session.  I do not intend to delay the passage of this Bill to await reports from any review body as I am satisfied that the legislation is necessary.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the validity of a Minerals Acquisition Order in respect of certain minerals in this area made by me in accordance with powers conferred on me by the Minerals Development Act, 1940, has been challenged and the decision of the courts in the matter is awaited.  I would not regard it appropriate to consider at this stage the issue of a lease in respect of minerals not the subject of the litigation.

Is he further aware that the zinc market is being filled very rapidly, that the huge mining company of Cominco have made their arrangements with the Common Market; that there are two new mines &mdash;one in north Spain, Rubiales, and the other on Cornwallis Island; and that one of the things that could happen is that the provision here of a zinc smelter might be affected if we do not get into the zinc market quickly and get to the stage of supplying it?  Is he further aware that £4.3 million has been spent at Navan; that there is to be £2 million spent at Drogheda and at Mornington; and that 500,000 tons of ore are to go out per year until such time as the zinc smelter is available; that the timing of this is of the greatest <Col N="1924" /> importance and that there is no reason at all why everything on one side of the River Boyne, 85 per cent of the deposit of zinc and other minerals, which is not the subject of litigation, cannot be the subject by him of a mining licence?</P>

The President of the High Court on that occasion, which was early August, indicated that he hoped to give a decision before the end of that month. In that context I think I am justified in not indicating my position with regard to further discussions until that decision has come to hand.  There should not be any great delay in that.

He will be aware that in negotiating a lease, acting on behalf of the State I would be in a far stronger position if I could negotiate in respect of 100 per cent of the property as against negotiating in respect of 85 per cent of the field.</P>
      <P>One could in that case expect to get a better deal in royalties.  I am conscious of the fact that I have an inter-departmental committee studying the situation with a view to making recommendations to me in relation to my fiscal policy covering the negotiations of the lease.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 to 92 together.</P>
      <P>I granted a State mining lease on 2nd December, 1968, operative for 40 years from 1st January, 1969, to the company named in respect of dolomite, dolomitic limestone and other minerals in an area comprising 635 acres in part of the townland of Dunbell Big, County Kilkenny.  These particulars and the attaching financial terms are set out in my report under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 and 1960, laid before the House on 20th October, 1972.  The lease also contained standard covenants designed to ensure proper working of the minerals and maintenance of the leasehold in good order.</P>
      <P>I have no precise information about the acreage of the leasehold at present being mined but I am given to understand that the quarry extends over approximately ten acres, with plant and buildings occupying a further ten acres.</P>
      <P>I am informed that no loans were made to the company by the Industrial Development Authority or the Industrial Credit Company.  No State aid has been made available in connection with the company's mining operation at Dunbell Big, but grants were approved by the Industrial Development Authority for the company's factory at Dungarvan.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the dispute referred to by him has been brought to my notice.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he considers it equitable under present insurance and company law to allow an insurance company to withdraw from the motor market, keep its licence and continue to trade in general accident and fire business; and if such procedure is permitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 94 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>I consider that the insurance companies have within their capacity the ability to absorb business resulting from the withdrawal of the company concerned from motor insurance business. One company have, in fact, already expressed a willingness to take on policy holders affected by the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This does not necessarily mean that every single policy holder will be taken on by the interested company and I would have no power to compel them to do so.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Minister for Local Government has special machinery available for helping to secure cover for persons who have been refused cover or who have been quoted a premium that is tantamount to a <Col N="1931" /> refusal and any cases of difficulty should be referred to him.  The Deputy may have seen the advertisement, inserted by the Irish Insurance Association in the daily Press on 6th November, 1972, drawing attention to these arrangements.</P>
    <P>While I consider it regrettable that a company should decide to withdraw from the motor market when the report of the Insurance Industry Committee is expected shortly there is no legal barrier to their doing this. In due course, when all the company's liabilities to their motor policy holders have been discharged, my Department will request them to return the licence for deletion of motor insurance from their scope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not replied to Question No. 95.  Does he consider it fair and equitable that they should do this, withdraw from motor insurance and keep the more remunerative side of the business, fire, general and life insurance, on their books?  Does he not feel it is his duty to legislate to see that this does not happen, as people are in serious difficulty trying to get motor insurance at fair rates?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like it.  At the time of the establishment of the insurance committee, I asked all insurance companies to maintain the <i>status quo</i> until that report had been submitted to me.  I am also conscious of the fact&mdash;let me say, in fairness to the insurance companies&mdash;that the report is taking far longer than it was expected to take.  I do not mind who else criticises, but I do not want this to be taken as a criticism by me of the committee.  It is a pretty sizeable committee, and while I have heard derogatory things said about the committee. I do not believe there was ever a voluntary group of people of such numbers who have met so often.  I have <Col N="1932" /> been given to understand that the sessions are quite hot&mdash;not that I have any bugging arrangements but they do meet in my Department and the walls are not as thick as they might be. However, they meet regularly and constructively and I am hoping for a report shortly.  I have stood in this House and given information supplied to me by this committee on a number of occasions.  I hope to have the report at the end of next month.  I have been saying that since last December.  I am a little disappointed that I have not got it.  I have been told it is on its way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will (a) consider the repeal of section 3 of the Insurance Act, 1964, and (b) improve the opportunities for foreign insurance companies to quote in competition for motor insurance business here by easing the restrictions on insurance trading and premium quotation imposed by the 1936 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 96 and 97 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not consider that the operation of section 3 of the Insurance Act, 1964, is inhibiting insurers from issuing motor insurance policies.  The section provides for the payment, from a fund financed by insurance companies, of certain liabilities of insolvent <Col N="1933" /> insurers.  All licensed non-life insurers must contribute to the fund a percentage of their non-life premium income and there is no reason, therefore, why the section should inhibit companies from issuing motor policies any more than policies relating to other classes of non-life insurance.  I would not be prepared in any event to consider any amendment of existing legislation before receiving the report of the Insurance Industry Committee.</P>
    <P>In regard to difficulties experienced in obtaining motor insurance, the Deputy is, no doubt, aware of the special machinery operated by the Minister for Local Government for helping to secure cover for people who have been refused cover entirely or who have been quoted a rate that is tantamount to a refusal.  These arrangements were in fact the subject of an advertisement in the daily newspapers on 6th November.</P>
    <P>I presume that the other restrictions mentioned by the Deputy are those relating to the licensing requirements and the control of motor premium rates under the Insurance Act, 1936. Again in this case I could not consider amending legislation until I receive the committee's report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is in motor insurance that the greatest risk occurs for insurance companies?  There is also the risk of insolvency by insurance companies. If section 3 of the Insurance Act, 1964, insists, as it does, that those who have the greatest premium income pay the greatest compensation if there is a failure of a company doing motor insurance business, that is an inhibiting factor, if there is any danger at all, against anybody seeking to increase the amount of his motor insurance business and, therefore, leaving himself more liable for larger liability in the event of failure by a company.</P>

The experts within my Department are people who are examining these accounts through eyes of experience.  The situation is that the comparison of information over different years vouches for the reliability on the one hand, or shows up the non-reliability on the other hand, of figures over a period.  The people in my Department have gained experience in examining these accounts over the years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 103 together. I presume the first question relates to two draft directives on prepacked liquids and on bottles used as measuring instruments which were published in the Official Journal of the EEC on 19th May, 1972.  These drafts lay down prescribed volumes and methods of control for alcoholic and other drinks, milk, vinegar and edible oils, in bottles and other containers. The provisions are optional and would require only that importation and sale of such goods may not be prohibited for reasons relating to volumes or control methods provided the goods comply with the directives.  Firms and associations concerned with the manufacture and filling of bottles, cans and plastic containers of these products in this country have been consulted by my Department and, where appropriate, representations have been made to the European Commission in accordance with the EEC consultation procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's second question relates to a proposed resolution of the Council regarding removal of technical obstacles to trade.  This is complementary to an earlier resolution of May, 1969, establishing a programme to eliminate technical obstacles to the exchange of industrial products by harmonising the differing national requirements <Col N="1939" /> regarding standards, characteristics, and performance which exist in the member countries to protect the public or industrial consumer's safety, health and welfare.  The effect of the draft resolution which is the subject of the Deputy's question would merely be to add certain items to the list of products to receive attention in this way.  Naturally, one cannot discuss the implications for Irish industry until draft proposals for these products are published later, but I think it should be safe to say that there is no reason to suppose that in their final form they will present any particular problem.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the broad provisions and the implications for Ireland of the EEC Commission proposal C. 7, 28. 1. 1972 in regard to guarantees to protect the interests of shareholders and outsiders relative to companies; and the present status of the proposal; and the action taken by the Government in relation to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the proposals for fourth directive on the annual accounts of limited liability companies.  In general, the proposed draft directive deals with the format and content of annual accounts for companies.  If adopted in its present form, it would permit member states to authorise certain classes of companies below a specified size to publish their accounts in an abridged form only.  It would also permit member states to exempt certain classes of companies below a specified size from the obligation to have their accounts audited by qualified auditors.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that these proposals are in the form of a draft directive.  Pending discussions between the EEC Commission and the countries concerned and the emergence of a more final form of the directive, it is not possible to make a definitive statement about the implications for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> Some amendment of the provisions in the Companies Act, 1963, regarding the contents and form of annual accounts can be entailed and, it seems at this stage that some, if not all, private limited companies will be required to publish their annual accounts, in full or in an abridged form.</P>
    <P>The provision regarding exemption of certain companies from the requirement of having their accounts audited by qualified auditors is optional, and I do not envisage any relaxation of the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, which require the audit of company accounts by qualified auditors.</P>
    <P>I should add that, in dealing with these and similar proposals, my Department has the benefit of regular consultation with a number of organisations with special competence or experience in the field of company law.</P>

      <P>The State scheme of export credit insurance in operation in this country provides combined political and commercial credit risks cover and is broadly comparable with similar schemes in the member countries of the Community and in Britain and Denmark.</P>
      <P>The Community has adopted three directives.  Two of these provide for the adoption of a common credit insurance policy for medium and long term transaction involving public and private buyers.  The third directives provides for the harmonisation of certain provisions of the policies covering short term transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These directives have not yet come into force in the Community.  The effect of their implementation will be to bring the system of export credit insurance in the member countries more closely into line.  Implementation will involve the adoption of new forms of policies of export credit insurance for medium and long term transactions and some modifications in existing <Col N="1943" /> forms of policy used for short term transactions.  To give us time to effect the changeover to the new forms of policies, we obtained in the negotiations transactional periods of one year for the adoption of the Community directives on the harmonisation of specific cover for export contracts on long and medium terms of credit, and two years for the adoption of the directive on harmonisation of provisions of the short term policies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an increase in Irish exports to East European countries over the past two years as compared with previous years but because our imports from them have also risen there has been no improvement in the balance of trade.</P>
      <P>In the case of countries with which we have an adverse trade balance, including those in Eastern Europe, the general aim is to seek to improve the position by encouraging the expansion of exports.  It is expected that export promotion measures already undertaken and others which are planned will be of considerable assistance in securing a significant expansion of exports to those countries in future years.  The Deputy is probably aware that trade agreements have been concluded with both Bulgaria and Roumania.  The possibility of concluding trade agreements has also been the subject of discussions at official level with three other countries.</P>

Trade promotion activities by Córas Tráchtála in Eastern Europe in the current year include the organisation of Irish national stands at five trade fairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of a claim made by the UDA to the effect that they were responsible for recent cross-Border operations that might be deemed prejudicial to the security of the State; and what steps the Government are taking to prevent these incursions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of reports of UDA claims that they were responsible for a number of recent cross-Border operations.  The fact that it is reported that the UDA claim responsibility for a particular incident does not necessarily mean that this is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two of the reported claims call for particular comment.  One of these related to an alleged incursion in County Monaghan on 6th October, 1972, where what were described as <Col N="1951" /> IRA arms and explosives were said to have been &ldquo;captured&rdquo;.  The other one related to the blowing-up of a fertiliser store at Carrigans, County Donegal, on 16th October, 1972.</P>
    <P>As regards the alleged incursion in County Monaghan, the Garda Síochána say that no information is available which would indicate that any such incident ever occurred.</P>
    <P>The fertiliser store at Carrigans was damaged by an explosion on the night of 16th October.  According to newspaper reports, the UDA claimed responsibility for this incident, alleging that the target of their attack was a fertiliser factory which was a source of explosive material for the IRA.  This was wrong on two counts and I would like to take this opportunity to put the record right.  Firstly, the building which was attacked was a fertiliser store and not a fertiliser factory.  Secondly, the only materials kept in the store were fertilisers which were not only nonexplosive in themselves but were of such a composition that no explosive substance could be recovered from them.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated previously in this House on a number of occasions, the nature and extent of the security arrangements that are in operation along the Border must remain confidential.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 to 130, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset might I emphasise that the increase in the crime rate which has been the subject of comment recently relates to the year ended 30th September, 1971.  I am glad to be able to say that provisional returns for the year ended 30th September, 1972 indicate that, while a further increase in the total number of crimes occurred <Col N="1956" /> in that year, the rate of increase has abated considerably.</P>
    <P>In his foreword to his report on crime for the year ended 30th September, 1971, the Commissioner set out some of the factors which contributed to the increase in crime and also some of the measures that are being taken to deal with the situation.  In addition to those measures, a total net increase of 1,120 in the strength of the Garda Síochána over the two years 1971-72 and 1972-73 has been authorised. This figure of 1,120 is over and above recruitment to replace normal wastage.  To date, 850 of these additional gardaí have been recruited. A further 50 are being appointed this month and the remainder shortly afterwards. Substantial additional Garda transport has also been provided.  The Garda radio system has been extended and is now giving coverage in almost all areas.</P>
    <P>The present opening hours of Garda stations have been fixed to enable the station parties to carry out the maximum amount of the more important outdoor police duties, while providing an adequate office service.  The Commissioner is satisfied that the present arrangements make for a better service to the public than the suggested staffing of all Garda stations on a 24 hour basis.</P>

      <P>There is a general onus on banks, as indeed on all commercial firms, to take reasonable precautions to protect their property.  Naturally these precautions must be all the greater in places of special risk.  Banks do, in fact, take special precautions.  On the other hand, we have to recognise that there is a limit to what they can do by way of precaution against certain types of criminal.  As I have previously informed the House, the extent of any protection to be provided for banks by the Garda is a matter for determination by the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, from time to time, in the light of all the circumstances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is referring to was not a fire but a planned destruction of some old legal documents in the Land Registry, which took place in March, 1970.  This was a single operation which has not been repeated.</P>
      <P>These legal documents, which related to registration made during the years 1892 to 1904, were destroyed by direction of the Registrar of Titles because the accumulation of documents over the years was such that there was no longer sufficient storage space for them and the registrar decided that the documents in question were neither of legal nor of historical value and that accordingly they need not be retained.  This decision was made on the basis of the registrar's own experience and that of other officers of the Land Registry familiar with the content of such documents, supplemented by specific sample checking.</P>
      <P>Legal powers to destroy documents were expressly vested in the registrar by the Land Registration Rules, 1966, of which rule 181 (4) reads:</P>
      <P>The Registrar may also direct the destruction of any documents filed in the Registry when they have been superseded by entries in the Register or have ceased to be of any effect, or he may, if such documents appear to him to be of historical interest, transmit them to the Public Record Office for filing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it right to emphasise that the title of an owner of registered land is based on the register and that the title is guaranteed by the State.  In cerain exceptional cases, however, there is a possibility that some portion of certain old documents&mdash;I refer specifically <Col N="1967" /> to settlements&mdash;might still have been &ldquo;live&rdquo;.  I am informed that only one such case has come to notice and, while a delay was caused in that case, the difficulty was resolved through the co-operation of the solicitor concerned and another solicitor.  So that there may be no doubt as to the policy to be adopted, I have given specific instructions that if, at any time in the future, any similar difficulty arises from the fact that a pre-1904 settlement has been destroyed, the Land Registry will at all stages take and maintain the initiative with a view to ensuring that the difficulty is resolved satisfactorily, expeditiously and with the absolute minimum of inconvenience either for the client or any solicitor acting for him.  I do not for a moment suggest that this is a complete answer to anybody who may be affected but it will at least ensure that inconvenience will be minimised, and the probability is that the cases in question will be very few, if any.</P>
    <P>There remains the question of the possible value of some of these documents. I have already indicated that the registrar was satisfied that they were of no historical interest and I have no reason to doubt that assessment as far as concerns their being of any major or general historical interest. On the other hand, I think it reasonable to assume that some documents of that kind might have some local interest, at all events in the sense that any particular landowner, now or in the future, might like to have available as detailed an historical record as possible of his own farm or might like to have an old document such as a vesting order for its intrinsic interest for him; and for this reason, amongst others, the land registration rules were extended last September so as to authorise the registrar, on the completion of a registration, to release documents of this kind to the registered owner.</P>
    <P>Even with the practice now authorised under the new rules of handing over some documents to the registered owners, it is unlikely to be possible to store indefinitely, either in the Land Registry or in any other public office, <Col N="1968" /> all other documents, including correspondence, concerning land transactions, and a clearing-out may have to take place from time to time.  To put the matter in perspective I would mention that it is estimated that the Land Registry still have over 2½ million documents in their custody.  However, in order to guard against the possibility that any documents of historical interest, either general or local, might be unwittingly destroyed in this way, and in order also to provide an assurance to interested persons that adequate safeguards exist, explicit arrangements have now been made that, even where the rules allow destruction, no document will in fact be destroyed by the Registrar of Titles without its having first been evaluated by the Public Record Office.</P>

That has not been the practice in the last 20 years, or so, for obvious reasons of space and time but, at that time, the relevant details were transcribed on to the register and remain, of course, as part of the register.</P>

The majority of those Civil Service pensioners were not insured under the Social Welfare Acts and consequently their widows were not in receipt of any State pension prior to the granting of the <i>ex-gratia</i> pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of registration as electors of students who are residing away from home on the qualifying date is one for decision in the first instance by the registration authority concerned, in the light of the circumstances of each case.  There is provision for appeal to the county registrar and, if necessary, to the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the possibility of appeal and the general procedure adopted in regard to the compilation of registers, I take it that thought has been given to the likelihood of there being a grouping of students in any particular constituency if there is a school in the area at the time of an election?  If they are at school and a long distance from home, if an election takes place it is not likely that they can vote.  If they are registered at home and an election takes place, I cannot see all of them being allowed to go home to vote.  Has any procedure been devised whereby there would be a likelihood that they could exercise their votes?  It appears to me that if real effect is to be given to the provision of votes for these people in many cases the answer would appear to be a postal vote.  What thought has the Department given to this?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1987" /> I understand that the symbol referred to was adopted by Rehabilitation International, the international society for the rehabilitation of the disabled, at its World Congress in Dublin in September, 1969, and that, in so far as individual countries are concerned, there is no specified process for its adoption.  I should be glad to see the symbol displayed in appropriate buildings.</P>
    <P>There are no legal requirements at present to ensure ease of access to public buildings for handicapped persons but, in relation to new buildings generally, I propose to make appropriate provisions for the purpose in the comprehensive code of building regulations which is being drafted in my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be aware that I have asked local authorities by circular letter to make provision for access by people in wheelchairs to new public buildings provided by them and to consider measures to make their existing buildings more easily accessible to such people.  I have also pointed out that, as planning authorities, they are in a position to bring this question to the notice of developers and architects and, if necessary, to impose suitable conditions when granting permission.  The specification for swimming pools, which I have circulated to local authorities, includes provision to facilitate disabled persons. A special scheme of enhanced reconstruction grants for houses occupied by disabled persons was introduced by me early this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 and 210 together.</P>
      <P>Some days before the end of the last financial year that is, towards the end of March last, the associated banks notified local authorities of changes which they proposed to make in the arrangements for dealing with accounts with effect from the commencement of the current financial year.  The notice indicated that the banks had decided to impose charges on local authorities for the handling of their accounts.  Local authorities had up to that time been totally exempt from such bank charges.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the transaction charges notified at that time by the banks, local authorities made estimates of the total cost to them of the charges over a full year.  Details of the estimates of those local authorities for which I am the appropriate Minister are in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.  The aggregate cost to all local authorities, including health boards, vocational education committees, county committees of agriculture and other subsidiary bodies amounted to £250,000 approximately.</P>
      <P>In September last the banks notified further details of the transaction charges which they proposed to levy on local authorities.  The estimated cost to local authorities of the charges as notified in September is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned at the associated <Col N="1998" /> banks' proposals to depart from the long-standing arrangements which have obtained in regard to the accounts of local authorities and the burden that such a departure would place on the local authorities' financial resources.  My views on the matter were conveyed to the Irish Banks Standing Committee in letters of 8th May and 12th June, and through my Department's representatives on a deputation which met representatives of the banks on 6th July.  The deputation referred to comprised representatives of the County Councils' General Council, the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, the City and County Managers' Association and my Department.</P>
    <P>In a letter dated the 2nd October, 1972, I had the local authorities' case, as I see it, restated in detail to the banks.  Subsequently, as a result of approaches made by the Central Bank arrangements were made for representatives of both sides in the dispute to come together.  The first meeting between the parties took place yesterday and it is envisaged that further meetings will take place.</P>
