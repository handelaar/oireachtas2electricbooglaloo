      <NameTxt>1. Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any fresh consideration has been given since the Heath initiatives to increasing the present level of North-South co-operation in tourism, fisheries, energy policy, transport, general cross border trade and industrial development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any consideration has been given since the Heath initiatives to North-South co-operation on the economic problems of depressed Border areas with a view to action on both sides of the Border under the aegis of a joint authority which would channel aid and investment to areas whose economic life has been stunted by the political division.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement regarding discussions currently being held between Ministry officials in Dublin, London and Belfast on matters of common interest arising out of EEC entry; and if he will indicate the nature of these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>North-South co-operation in the matters referred to in Questions Nos.  I and 2 proceeds normally.  It is hoped that it will be possible to extend the area of co-operation in economic matters, particularly in the context of EEC <Col N="1486" /> membership.  I am glad to note from remarks made in the British House of Commons on Thursday last that the British Government are also of the view that North-South co-operation in economic matters is a desirable objective.</P>
    <P>In regard to the discussions referred to in Question No. 3, these are normal continuing contacts covering the wide range of problems which can arise in the context of the European Economic Communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Who would initiate these discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are mutually initiated, one might say, because there is continuous contact and if a particular matter arises which affects one side or the other then the side which it immediately affects would be the one to raise it initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach in his answer refer to continuing normally these joint discussions?  Could I ask him whether he would appreciate that since the Heath initiative we could give an impetus to these normal discussions, whether such impetus has been given, whether any fresh proposals have been discussed since the Heath initiative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have myself encouraged contacts at official level to continue and these contacts will necessarily and inevitably throw up new problems as they arise.  We will be very glad to tackle them and solve them mutually and in co-operation with the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the discussions take place with British Ministers or with Mr. Whitelaw at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 2 asks specifically about the depressed economic life of Border areas.  Could I ask the Taoiseach if any special study has been given to the unique problems of these areas and, especially since the <Col N="1487" /> Heath initiative, whether any proposals have come from our side about any kind of joint economic authority that would help on the economic life of towns and farmlands on both sides of the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I myself have put forward specific suggestions along the lines mentioned by the Deputy.  As soon as these suggestions can find any sound form for discussion and ultimate co-operation certainly we will be very glad to follow them up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if since direct rule there have been any further proposals on any aspect of the matter from the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there have been no specific further proposals but the contacts are continuing and out of these may emerge some further proposals.</P>

      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions No. 5 and No. 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there is a problem of overcrowding at the maternity unit in the County Hospital, Kilkenny.  My Department has requested the SouthEastern Health Board, who are primarily responsible for the provision of services in the area, to furnish, as a matter of urgency, a report on the situation together with an indication of the steps which it is proposed to take to ease this problem.  The position will be examined urgently in my Department <Col N="1488" /> in the light of any proposals which the health board may submit for my approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is satisfied with the present ratio of free-treatment patients per dentist in the country; and what action is proposed to increase the number of dentists to free-treatment patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the public dental service, at its present stage of development, is not adequate to provide comprehensive dental treatment for all eligible persons requiring such treatment. The operation of this service is dependent mainly on the employment of wholetime dental officers. As the Deputy is aware from my reply to his question yesterday, there has been a substantial increase in recent years in the number of such officers and health boards are continuing their efforts to recruit further staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give the House any information about a possible increase in the number of dentists in this public sector over the next year or two?  Are there any figures in the possession of the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have over 20 vacancies for full time dentists and local authority appointments are proceeding. If we were able to recruit all of those, that would be in addition to the 141 whole time dental officers we already have, giving a substantial increase in one year.  Sometimes it is difficult to get vacancies filled, although the salaries are very comparable with those paid in Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) that there is an outbreak of beri-beri among alcoholics in Ireland; if he will indicate what action he intends taking in regard to this complication of alcoholism; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the newspaper report mentioned <Col N="1489" /> in the question.  It would appear that the comment of the <i>Medical News Tribune</i> was based on articles published in the Journal of the Irish Medical Association on April 29th in which details of four cases of beri-beri heart disease were reported.  If this surmise is correct, it is grossly misleading to refer to &ldquo;an outbreak of beri-beri among alcoholics&rdquo;.  Incidentally one of the four cases reported upon was adamant that he did not drink alcohol.</P>
      <P>From inquiries I have made in the matter it would appear that very few cases of this disease have come to light in this country in the past few years. The disease is caused by a vitamin deficiency (thiamin) and, as a routine, alcoholics received into a psychiatric hospital are given a multi-vitamin preparation which includes thiamin.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  I am, however, aware that the number of inspections of food premises carried out annually in some areas is too low and I have drawn the attention of health boards to the matter and requested them to arrange, where at all possible, to have at least one inspection every quarter made of premises, stalls and vehicles engaged in food business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will take steps to ensure that the local advisory committees to the South West Regional Health Board in Cork and Kerry will meet at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The fixing of a date for the first meeting of a local committee is a matter for the health board. I understand that the dates of the first meetings of the local committees for Kerry and North Cork have been agreed, and the health board is <Col N="1490" /> endeavouring to get agreement on suitable dates for the first meetings of the two other committees in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Southern Committee of the Cork County Council have decided not to take part in the advisory health committees because the Minister saw fit to deprive 12 members of that committee of any representation on the advisory health committees, which means they have no say whatsoever in the administration of the health services in that part of the county, while at the same time the Minister has given full representation to the Northern and Western Committees? Could the Minister now, at this late stage, accede to a request from the Cork County Council to grant the 21 members of the Southern Committee of the Council full representation on the advisory health committees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered a question on that and made it perfectly clear that I do not propose to depart from the general arrangements made for these committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not a typical dictatorial attitude on the part of the Minister?  Is it not true that he has given representation to the Northern and Western Committees and that this is the thin end of the wedge towards uniting both Cork city and county, which will not be acceptable?  Would the Minister now, in the interests of the elected representatives in the southern area, give full representation to the 21 members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to make any change.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether any preparation towards the formulation of a comprehensive policy towards the enlarged Community to include the political, economic and cultural aspects is under way in anticipation of the need to declare this country's approval on such diverse <Col N="1491" /> matters as European security, development of political structures within the Community and development of a common monetary policy, at the October summit meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have under active consideration matters relating to future economic, social and political developments in the European Communities when they are enlarged with particular reference to the proposed Summit Meeting of the Ten next October when these matters will be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give any indication as to whether the Government are seriously concerned about the necessity of strengthening the political structures of the Community; whether we have any proposals for the strengthening of the European Parliament in the context of the Community; whether the Government have given any consideration to the idea of direct elections to that Parliament at this stage, and whether we will be suggesting such proposals at the October meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been giving consideration to this.  As the Deputy knows, the matters which will be on the agenda are economic and monetary union and social progress in the Community, and in this regard we have a very special interest in the development of a regional policy in the Community which would be a very essential part of the picture of economic and monetary union.  Another matter is the Community's relations and responsibility <i>vis-á-vis</i> the rest of the world in which, of course, we have an interest, too, in relation to the developing countries, in relation to Eastern Europe, and particularly in relation to the Third World.  The strengthening of the European institutions and progress in the political field in the third item.  Our attitude about the institutions as they exist is that we would like to have some experience of them as members before making proposals about change.  I think that is a wise attitude for an adhering country. It was decided at the Hague Summit <Col N="1492" /> Meeting to try to get some political progress by the setting up of a study group, and we have had meetings twice since then.  However, there will be varying enthusiasm in the different countries about the degree of progress made in the political field.  It is an economic Community basically.  The proposals about political progress will not be the only proposals, but there is a clear indication that one country anyway would put the stress rather on economic matters than on political progress.  As it comes nearer the time the Government will make it clear what their position is in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be making any contact himself with countries already in the Community prior to the October meeting which would help in formulating our own attitude?  Would the Minister agree that we must go to the October Summit meeting with certain clearly formed ideas of our own?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think the House should be aware that the power of decision-making is in the Council of Ministers, and with what is called the Luxembourg compromise or agreement Governments do not have any decisions taken against their national interest, and this gives every Government a strong position.  We would be in a strong position in the Council of Ministers with that arrangement, but at the same time it is desirable, and probably more desirable from the point of view of a small country like ours, to have the institutions of the Community developed.  It would, from our point of view, be desirable, I would say, that that arrangement in the Council of Ministers of not taking decisions against the national interest of any one member should continue, but at the same time that there should be progress in the development of the powers of the European Parliament.  I would be going a little ahead of our decisions if I went further than that at this time.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that carriers are experiencing a drop of around 10 per cent over last year in the number of advance bookings for scheduled flights from North America. Charter business is, however, expected to show some improvement on last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte's present forecast for total traffic from North America in 1972 is 216,900 visitors and £22.6 million revenue, exclusive of carrier receipts. These figures represent decreases <Col N="1494" /> of 10 per cent and 5 per cent respectively on the corresponding figures for 1971.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that the board is at present conducting joint advertising and promotional campaigns with Aer Lingus and British Rail this month and in September next to attract off-peak visitors.  In addition, the board is operating a joint campaign with the B &amp; I Line which is continuing throughout the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that one of the best means of promoting off-season traffic from Britain is by reducing air fares and travel charges?  Is it not a fact that high air charges between Britain and Ireland are the real inhibiting factor in the generation of off-season tourist traffic?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether there has been a reduction in Aer Lingus United Kingdom traffic during March, April and May this year compared with the corresponding period last year; and, if so, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Lingus passenger carryings on the cross-Channel routes showed a decrease of 8 ½ cent in March, April and May of this year as compared with the same period of last year.  The decrease was due primarily to the loss of tourist <Col N="1497" /> traffic as a result of the continuing disturbances in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Raising again the question of the decline in traffic from Britain, would the Minister not be honest and admit that the troubles in the North are not the only factor and that the major factor is the high air fares?  I make no apologies for referring to this again.  Is the Minister aware that five constituents of mine who were coming home to Shannon from London ten days ago, five members of one family, had to pay a total of £175 to Aer Lingus for a two-day trip to Ireland?  Is this not the real problem?  It is about time this problem was tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already given a full reply to the Deputy on this subject.  The Deputy may know that on 1st April Aer Lingus introduced a number of new tourist and promotional fares including a special youth fare, the fly-drive facility which combines an air fare with car hire, and gateway holidays which include air transport, connecting air transport to and from the hotel and accommodation at a hotel, for a price equal to the lowest air fare in the off-peak season and slightly in excess of it in the peak season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate what percentage of total traffic is made up by the ordinary person wanting to travel between Britain and Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But this is the essential ingredient of this issue, as to whether or not travel between Ireland and Britain is organised on a vast once-a-year tourist scale or between ordinary people wanting to move between Ireland and Britain, the ordinary Irish person in Ireland wanting to move to Britain or the ordinary Irish person in Britain wanting to move back to Ireland.  I would put it to the Minister that what Aer Lingus is not paying sufficient regard to is the ordinary traveller who wants to travel at modest rates and is inhibited from doing so because the rate for travel is twice that which operates between Britain and the Continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask an intelligent question and make an intelligent suggestion?  Would it not be wise and just for Aer Lingus to apply themselves to the &ldquo;great Aer Lingus robbery&rdquo; and bring the people over and put people in movement, as CIE rightly did?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be absolutely impossible.  The reason for Aer Lingus participation in IATA arrangements is that all such air fare structures are related to bilateral agreements and these, in turn, are related to multilateral agreements.  The ability of an airline to derive for itself special fares in relation to the whole of the pattern of fare structures depends on bilateral negotiation.  We would be in a position of absolute chaos if Aer Lingus did not, in the main, agree with the other members of IATA, even though there are breaches of the arrangements in some cases.  It would be quite impossible. If Aer Lingus were to start a fare structure of that kind there would immediately be difficulties with the British Government and the British civilian air authority over BEA and if both the companies reduced their fares markedly to the point that they were copying the CIE &ldquo;train robbery&rdquo; then they would be in trouble because of the multilateral arrangements by carriers all over Europe.</P>

Is it any wonder that it is suggested that we regard these people as second-class citizens when such a state of affairs could exist? Surely it was not beyond the capacity of the Department of Social Welfare to ensure that the cheque would have been issued in the normal way and if any further calculations had to be made as to the amount payable, to have sent on the normal amount, the balance outstanding being paid subsequently?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour (a) if he has taken note of the decision(s) of the Agricultural Wages Board and the decision(s) of the employers' side on that body in formulating the content of the Agricultural Wages Order, 1972, in a manner which appears to be in conflict with the National Agreement of 21st December, 1970; (b) if he is aware of the content of paragraph (a) of report No. 7 dated 2nd December, 1971, of the interpretation committee of the Employer-Labour Conference that the agreement would apply to all categories of employers and workers as from 21st December, 1970; and (c) if it is his intention to ask for a report from the Labour Court on the matter or, otherwise, offer an explanation as to the attitude of his Department to a Statutory Instrument laid before the Dáil which appears to be in conflict with the National Agreement.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Agricultural Wages Order, 1972, and also of the Report of the interpretation committee of the Employer/Labour Conference to which the Deputy refers.  It is not my intention to request the Labour Court for a report on the matter.</P>
      <P>As I understand that the level of agricultural wages is at present under consideration by the Agricultural Wages Board, I do not propose to comment further in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I would have to ask the Minister to comment further on the matter.  What the Minister is saying is that, while the agreement made on wages applies to all other workers, it does not apply to agricultural workers.  Is the Minister saying, as so many other Ministers have already said, that agricultural workers are only second-class citizens and do not come under the normal law of the land?  If not, why is the Labour Court not asked to report on the breach of the agreement by the Agricultural Wages Board?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I am not saying any such thing as is implied by the Deputy in regard to agricultural workers.  Secondly, the statement that he made that this constitutes a breach of the national agreement is an assertion by him but not necessarily an accurate statement of fact.  Thirdly, the Deputy will be aware that there is at least one case which has gone to the Labour Court which has held that in the particular circumstances of that case it was not obligatory that the amount specified in the national agreement should be paid.  The Deputy will also be aware, of course, that the figures settled by the Agricultural Wages Board are minima and that very many workers are paid a great deal more than the amounts laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that the amounts laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board are minima and apply in the main to unorganised workers throughout the country, but I can assure the Minister that organised workers have got very much better rates of wages.  Would the Minister not agree that, if he accepts the report of the 2nd December, 1971, of the interpretation committee, he must accept that there has been a breach?  With reference to his further comment about the case which did go before the Labour Court, is he suggesting that the farmers are unable to pay an extra 50p to underpaid workers despite the fact that they have been promised so much on going into the EEC?  If not, what is he saying?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that this was an assertion but not necessarily a statement of fact.  In this connection, I would refer the Deputy to clause 4 of the national agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> Changes in rates of pay shall be negotiated at industry or company level in accordance with the provisions of this agreement and both trade unions and employers shall have regard to the ability of particular industries or companies to absorb any increase in labour costs without impairing their competitive position or viability.</P>
    <P>I am referring the Deputy to that clause to indicate that his statement to the effect that the amounts fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board were a breach of the agreement is not necessarily correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister again inferring that the employers concerned, the farmers of this country, are unable to pay an extra 50p per week to their employees, to pay the same amount as is being paid to every other worker in the country?  Is that what the Minister is inferring?  Incidentally, is the Minister aware that farm workers are still working six hours per week more than anybody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that it is certainly conceivable that the Agricultural Wages Board in arriving at their conclusions took into account the fact that some farmers might not be able to pay the additional amount and that what they were fixing were minima and that, in the case of farmers who could pay, almost certainly they would have to pay.  I am saying it is conceivable.  I am not saying what they did take into account.  I do not know.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the number of interviews conducted by examiners on behalf of the Civil Service Commissioners last year to test the knowledge of Irish of applicants for posts and the cost thereof; the number of applicants examined and the number thereof who were deemed to have an adequate knowledge of Irish; and why it is still <Col N="1508" /> considered necessary to have separate interviews to test oral knowledge of Irish having regard to the fact that existing civil servants who sit on the principle interview boards are deemed to be competent to converse and work in Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of candidates tested in Irish in the year ended 31st March, 1972, was 5,538.  Fees and other expenses paid for carrying out these tests amounted to approximately £2,500.  The test was an obligatory one for 4,791 of these candidates and, of this number, 4,256 reached the qualifying standard.  The test was optional for the remaining 747 candidates and, of these, 568 were found to have either a good or a competent knowledge of Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy that this would delay the work of the main board and would add to the difficulties of constituting these boards.  I would remind the Deputy that in the main these interview boards are serviced by people who are giving their services free, and frequently interview boards have to meet for periods of several days, sometimes weeks.  In these circumstances, to get people to give their time free for these days is of course difficult but to add to the problem by doing what Deputy Ryan has suggested would simply make it more difficult and perhaps impossible to get suitable people to act on these boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While the taxation system in general is subject to continuing review, I would point out that, if the change in question were effected, the Road Fund would be deprived of its present revenue from motor taxation for road works; tax on petrol and diesel would go to the Exchequer and the amount to be voted for roads would depend on the overall level of Exchequer revenue and the urgency of calls on that revenue for services other than roads.  Moreover, because of the large increase in the price of petrol it would involve, the change could have many repercussions within the economy and could have serious implications for tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that this system has been adopted successfully in the US and surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility to make it applicable here. Will the Minister not agree that in a recent survey it was found in a certain area that 30 per cent to 35 per cent of the cars were not taxed?  My suggestion would constitute a scheme whereby there could be no evasion of tax.  The Minister said it would interfere with tourism.  Seeing that means can be devised to give special-rate diesel to farmers, surely it would not be beyond the bounds of possibility to arrange to have a special concession for tourists, or a special type of petrol?</P>

      <P>First of all the system we use is used in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, West Germany, Sweden and New Zealand.  There are arguments on both sides&mdash;I freely admit that&mdash;as to which is the more effective system.  However, one consequence of adopting the system suggested by the Deputy would certainly be a substantial increase in the price of petrol.  This could have considerable economic effects.  If I give just as an example the consequences for commercial vehicles, the increased cost which would be passed on to the consumer in the goods they sell.  There is also the increased risk of smuggling from across the Border.  In regard to a special rate for tourists, this presents very considerable difficulties and I am sure the Deputy will remember that there was such a scheme in operation for tourists some years ago in France but it is not in operation any more.</P>

It is hoped to introduce and proceed as far as possible with the following Bills: the Bill dealing with EEC legislation, the Drugs Bill, Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill and the Trade Unions Amalgamation Bill.  The Minister has undertaken to introduce the latter but it may not be ready for Second Reading. It is proposed also to introduce a Bill dealing with minimum notice and termination of employment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Estimate last night I commented that, while we may be critical of what the Government are doing, we are all in favour of trying to improve the health services.  This Estimate is for a substantial sum of money, more than £58 million.  While the Minister has been very courteous in carrying out his duties, he and the Government should have made an effort to level off our health services with those in operation in the Six Counties, that is, if we are serious about the re-unification of the country.  That is an aspect on which I would like the Minister to comment when he is replying.  If we do not make an effort in this respect what will happen is that, when unity is brought about eventually, we will have to try to bring our scale of services to the level of those in the North and if this is not done gradually a lot of extra money will be required at the one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the question of the impost of the health services on rates.  This year the Government gave a little extra towards payment of the health services in order to alleviate the rates to some extent but, unfortunately, the rates have been increasing each year and the health services have played a large part in these increases. Of course, those who are well never think of the day when they might be ill and, consequently, they complain when they are asked to contribute towards the health services.  The huge increases recently in hospital charges has made everybody realise that there must be found some other way of financing the health services.  Although, as the Minister pointed out, the State this year has subsidised the health services to a greater degree than before, the increase in the hospital charges has created a situation whereby there will be a very heavy deficit carried forward to next year.  This shows once again, if the evidence is needed that a wrong system of servicing <Col N="1527" /> the health charges is being used.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the new arrangement which the Government introduced last October for servicing portion of the health charges appears to be backfiring in certain areas.  I am referring to the extra 15p per week which is being paid by insured workers who are not in possession of a medical card, to people in the self-employed category who are paying £7 a year, and to old age pensioners who, for some extraordinary reason, have been ruled by the Government as not eligible for free service even though they are eligible for everything else which social welfare insurance buys.  When the new arrangement was made they thought they could go into a public ward in a hospital and would not be responsible for any payment.  Many of them are now finding that this is not so.  Many of them are finding that because of a misinterpretation or misapplication of the rules they are still required to pay for hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>We get letters from health boards, as I did no later than today.  The CEO writes and says: &ldquo;No arrangements have been made with this hospital&rdquo;.  I assume that means that the hospital to which the patient has gone is not within the area covered by the health board.  Surely something must be wrong.  I tried to explain this yesterday evening and I will try to make it a little clearer today because some people seem to have misunderstood what I said.</P>
    <P>If patients go to a hospital which is a normal hospital for the treatment of their ailment I can see no reason why the health board should refuse to pay their hospital bill if they are (a) in possession of a medical card, (b) paying 15p per week, or (c) paying £7 per year as self-employed persons.  Possibly the fault lies with the local health board but I should imagine that, in most cases, the fault lies with the instructions given by the Department of Health which do not make it clear enough to the officers in charge locally that in such cases they should pay for the hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> The position in regard to outpatients is similar.  Surely it is ludicrous that poor people who would normally be entitled to free medical treatment, and who go as outpatients to a hospital, should be asked to pay for some of the things which they require as outpatients. Surely it is wrong that after a number of months they should receive a substantial bill from the hospital, even though they are paying for that treatment under another heading.  This matter should be clarified by the Department.</P>
    <P>I believe that the improvement of the health services is the object of everybody, and particularly of the Minister and his Department.  If something which should be allowed is not being allowed this should receive priority over everything else.  Possibly in most cases the mix-up occurs because some people are being extra careful and during the teething troubles they do not want to make any mistake at local level.  The Minister's Department should ensure that they know explicitly what people are entitled to.  That should be explained, particularly when the hospital treatment given may be costing less in the hospital to which they go than in a hospital within their own area, or their own region.  This must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  There appears to be a tendency now to charge people for appliances and specialist services even though up to this they were entitled to get them free.  Something should be done to have these matters dealt with.</P>
    <P>Like a number of other speakers, I regret that the waiting list for places in schools or homes for mental defectives appears to be terribly long.  When Mr. MacEntee was Minister for Health some years ago he got the wonderful idea of acquiring a number of old buildings which would be suitable for use for this purpose.  He then found that there were no trained personnel. With a great flourish of trumpets the Department decided that they would set up schools to train people to look after mentally defective children.  Unfortunately, only about ten people were trained in the first year and the idea was conveniently forgotten, <Col N="1529" /> apparently, because the list has not been shortened very much.  All of us must know of mentally defective people who by the time they reached their place on the waiting list had outgrown the child they were when the application was first made.  This is rather a pity.</P>
    <P>Because of comments made by various people inside and outside the House it would be unfair if I did not pay tribute, from my own experience, to the way in which members of the religious orders have been dealing with those children.  They are doing a tremendous job and the thanks of the people of this country must go to them.  I say this particularly because there seems to be a tendency at present to knock some of the religious orders.  I do not think that is a good idea.  They are only human.  They are like ourselves.  They can make mistakes and they can be greedy and want things to which they are not entitled.  In general, members of religious orders in the hospital services and, indeed, all lay and religious in hospital services, are doing a tremendous job for which we cannot thank them enough. We should at least record that in this House.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of dental care.  I was always interested in the arguments made by successive Ministers for Health that, while it was important to look after the dental health of children, it was not so important to do the same for adults mainly because of the fact that (a) there was a shortage of money and (b) there was a shortage of dentists.  I believe that either the payments made to those engaged as dentists are not enough, or the system being used is not correct. I am told that in Britain where there is a fee for service payment it is possible for a dentist to attend to six, eight or ten patients in a session, whereas here, apparently, in most, if not all, cases the system is that a certain number of patients are rostered, say, six, over a two hour period, and if only three turn up three are attended to and that is it.</P>
    <P>An effort should be made to speed up dental treatment for adults.  I will refer to children in a moment.  Some <Col N="1530" /> arrangement should be made with dentists who are not in the employment of a local authority so that they could deal with the bad cases in particular.  I cannot agree with any Minister who claims that the father of a family who is out of work, perhaps, once or twice a month due to&mdash;I nearly said teething trouble&mdash;dental problems is not entitled to receive priority.  I do not agree with Ministers who say that this is not important. Dental care is very important for fathers and mothers of families whose general health deteriorates because they do not receive the dental care they need and who are unable to pay for the care they require.  An effort should be made to supply this service to them.</P>
    <P>With regard to school care, I think something has gone wrong in most counties.  Some years ago mobile units went around to the schools.  An effort was made at that time to give school children a medical examination once every two years or so.  It now appears that the most we can expect is that a child in a primary school will get a medical examination under the local authority once in his school life.  It appears to be extremely difficult to have dental care given to children who need it.  There are many children on the waiting list and these have to wait a long time indeed before they are called in for attention.  If they are really serious cases the doctor will use a little trick, as somebody said here last night, and have the children taken into hospital for something else so that they can get the requisite dental care.</P>
    <P>We are not treating this matter seriously. An effort should be made to resolve the present unsatisfactory situation. It all goes back to the number of dentists available.  I see no reason why a young dentist should have to go to England or anywhere else to work. If these young dentists were adequately remunerated here they would stay here. The key to the problem is the amount they can earn.  All of us like to earn as much as we can, within reason, and steps should be taken immediately to ensure that these young dentists can earn a reasonable income here.</P>
    <P>Drink has been in the news in the last few days.  There have been comments <Col N="1531" /> from different people about the excessive use of alcohol.  I am myself a pioneer but I know there are many people inside and outside this House who can drink in moderation.  There are also people who say that drink is bad.  These simply do not know the facts of life.  Unfortunately there are people who cannot drink in moderation and a better effort will have to be made in the future to deal with these. The Pioneer Association will accept only those who want to give up drink altogether.  They will allow a small number of lapses.  One cannot join this week and leave again next week.  That would be tantamount to the case of the man who said that he had no difficulty in giving up cigarettes; he had given them up twice a week for years.  Alcoholics Anonymous are prepared to accept people who lapse.</P>
    <P>Surely the State should be able to give more help in breaking people of this vice.  Excessive drinking is a vice. I was discussing this matter with a hotelier recently and he pointed out a rather interesting feature of the situation. In his hotel bar there was a number of ordinary people, middle aged and more than middle aged; they were sitting over a glass of stout, a glass of ale or, perhaps, a whiskey.  The youngsters were all drinking brandy just as quickly as they could.  I asked him why this was happening and he told me it was a status symbol: the others could not afford to pay for brandy and so the young people felt that drinking brandy made them superior to everybody else.  These should be educated and taught that, while drinking in moderation is all right, it is not all right to gulp down glass after glass of brandy and then attempt to drive a motor vehicle on the public road.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the State does appear to have done something about drugs. Two or three years ago scares about drugs being peddled were quite common. We do not hear so much about that now.  An effort has been made to prevent the theft of drugs from dispensaries. It was criminal to leave drugs so easily accessible that they could be taken by someone breaking <Col N="1532" /> a window or forcing the lock of a door. I mentioned last year a dispensary in which the doctor was not satisfied with the kind of door put in by the local authority and, because he was not satisfied, he did not lock the door; anyone could walk in and take away freely available drugs.</P>
    <P>The reason why a better effort is not being made by the State to curb cigarette smoking is because of the revenue collected on cigarettes.  That is also true in the case of drink.  This revenue is very important in the running of the State and we appear to be in a quandary as to whether or not we should allow the situation to continue in order that the revenue can be collected or whether we should make an effort to prevent smoking and curb excessive drinking and do without the revenue.  Great numbers of people are employed in the tobacco industry.  Is it not a pity that people have to be employed on that kind of thing in a country like this? Surely an effort should be made to find some cigarette which is not harmful to health.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have another look at his choice of doctor scheme.  This applies only to those who have medical cards.  Those paying the 15p per week thought they were entitled to a choice of doctor; they are, provided they pay him.  Those who have a choice of doctor should have a wider choice.  We predicted that when the dispensary system was done away with we would have areas in which there would be no doctor because no doctor will live in an area in which he cannot make a living.  The result is it is extremely difficult to get a choice of doctor because people are on the edge of two different regions and some doctors are unaware that they can apply, if they so wish, to be included in a neighbouring region.  People who had been getting a doctor living within half a mile of them now find he is no longer available because he is not on the list.  Would the Minister ensure that if a doctor comes along, who is not already included in the list but who is anxious to participate in the scheme, he will be given an opportunity of doing so?  If that is not done there are people who will have no <Col N="1533" /> choice of doctor.  Some may have no doctor available at all and they will be in a worse position than they were before the introduction of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for the courtesy they have accorded to me on numerous occasions and for their co-operation.  Will the Minister tell me when he comes to reply who owns the county infirmary in Navan and what will its future be?</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the wonderful work he has done since taking over responsibility for the health of our people.  He has left no stone unturned. If he were Minister for Finance as well as Minister for Health I have no doubt but that we would have the best health service in the world.  He has spent a great deal of time and energy in evolving a satisfactory scheme.  He has shown extraordinary dedication and he is doing all he can to improve on the work done by his predecessors.  In fact, he is trying to do better than his predecessors, all of whom did their very best.  His work during his term of office and that of the officials of his Department has been most helpful.</P>
      <P>I have been on a number of committees of regional hospitals and on the Dublin Health Authority, Eastern Region, since 1960.  The Eastern Regional Health Board came into operation only a year ago but we have found a big challenge to us in all these bodies.  As chairman of seven hospitals, plus St. James's Hospital, I have found there was a challenge to us in the transitional period and the Minister and his Department were most helpful in our work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the old days St. James's Hospital was known as St. Kevin's and was attached to the old South Dublin Union prior to that and it was felt that it was just for the poor.  As chairman of that hospital I can say we now have the most up-to-date treatment in <Col N="1534" /> Ireland.  I had the pleasure of inviting the Minister to open a maternity unit there some time ago and this is the most modern maternity hospital in Europe.  We now call the hospital St. James's Hospital.  If we meet St. Kevin on our way up above he will not have much regard for the members of the board because of changing the name but we shall have to put up with that.</P>
    <P>I have attended two meetings each week for a year and, as a member of the old Dublin Health Authority, I attended about once a fortnight and I have tried to raise this hospital above the prejudice that existed against it.  I am very pleased to recommend St. James's as one of the most modern in Europe with a staff that is second to none.  People should realise that things have changed since the days of the old St. Kevin's and the South Dublin Union.  Anybody who has occasion to go to St. James's is assured of the very best treatment.</P>

      <P>That is a matter I shall deal with but I thank the Deputy for reminding me.  We are anxious to change a number of things at St. James's.  Deputy Ryan was chairman of that board for a year and I am chairman now and, as he rightly says, we are anxious to close No. 3 Hospital and build a new hospital in its place, <i>Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis,</i> times change and we must change with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all perturbed about Hospital No. 3 but there is no use in closing it unless we have alternative accommodation.  The St. James's Board decided a few months ago to accept no more admissions but by doing that we found we were causing chaotic conditions and, as a result of our experience and the criticism the board received, we had to change that decision.  It is a good individual or a good board that will change a decision in the light of experience.  However, we are doing our best in that regard.  A <Col N="1535" /> number of our hospitals under the Eastern Regional Health Board deal with geriatric cases but we are not able to accommodate the 270 patients or so in Hospital No. 3.  Of the seven hospitals attached to us&mdash;and we have ten members from the federated hospitals on the board&mdash;none have as many patients as we have in No. 3.  This matter concerns us very deeply and we are most anxious to see the work done as soon as possible, but this is the position in which we found ourselves.  We must go slow until alternative accommodation is available.  A planning committee is considering how the patients there can be absorbed into other geriatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of accommodating patients operated on in the Meath Hospital if we do not put them into No. 3 Hospital.  The Meath Hospital is very closely associated with St. James's Hospital.  We found that there was no other place available for these patients.  This is one of the headaches we have and the only cure I can see is that some day the Minister for Health will strike oil and will be able to give us the money to do all these necessary things.  We cannot do the impossible but we are looking forward to an improvement in the position.</P>
      <P>One of the big problems of our time is the number of geriatric patients in our psychiatric and other institutions. In my young days nobody went to hospital unless he was dying or required an operation or something of that kind.  Times have changed since then.  Sons and daughters are not able to keep their parents at home and they have to go into hospital.  People are becoming much more conscious of hospitals nowadays and with more modern treatment they are living longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board we have a big list of geriatric patients trying to get into hospitals and homes.  The voluntary hospitals do not want to keep any old people at all.  They want to deal solely with acute patients.  Some of those hospitals have 250 beds, others have 200 beds and some have 160 <Col N="1536" /> beds but, despite this, none of them want old people.  We find in the Eastern Health Board that we have to take the backlash of all those hospitals and to try and look after geriatric patients.  I have many times asked the previous Minister for Health and the present Minister what we are to do with all those people.  We want to encourage children and other people to look after old people at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare introduced a scheme whereby people get an allowance to look after old people at home.  That has been great help but I would like more money to be given to those people.  When an old person is brought into a local authority hospital or a private hospital it costs a large sum of money to keep the person there.  If we could give an increased allowance to people to keep those geriatric patients at home we would take a lot of them out of hospitals and this would be of great benefit to the State.  While we have succeeded in doing much work in this section there is a lot more still to be done.</P>
    <P>The position of medical cards is a very big problem in all local authorities.  In the Eastern Health Board we have tried to be as liberal as possible in regard to medical cards.  We have tried to establish a yardstick with regard to issuing medical cards.  We have tried to find out who was entitled and who should be entitled to a medical card.  We have a discretionary clause and this is a great help to us.  I would like to see us being very liberal in regard to the issuing of medical cards.  We are a Christian, socialist State and we should do as much as possible for people who cannot pay for medical services.  The percentage of people who receive medical cards in Dublin city and county is very small in comparison with other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to our welfare section.  When I became a member of the old Dublin Health Authority in 1960 the amount of money we were given for welfare was very small.  I was chairman of that board and I felt that nobody should be in want or hungry.  I found we were adopting the old red ticket system <Col N="1537" /> which was adopted for years whereby the people who were hungry or in want were given only a pittance.  Our allowance in the Dublin Regional Health Board has been increased from £50,000 to over £600,000.  When I was chairman of the regional health board I had the pleasure of meeting all the officers dealing with those people and I told them that I did not want lán an mhála or anything else.  We wanted to be as fair as possible to those people. I felt there were a number of middle class people we never knew about and we found that they were much worse off than people in the lower income group who availed of free dinners. Some of those people in the middle income group, who were suffering great hardship, would not under any circumstances tell people they were hungry or in want.  I came across many people who were not able to pay their rent.</P>
    <P>As a result of our experience we had to be more generous.  We did not get any subvention from the Department of Health for this purpose, but I believe that in a Christian society where a young man dies leaving a widow with a family who are about to be evicted from their home it is incumbent on us to help them.  This upholds our dignity as a Christian society.  We hear what the communists and the extreme socialists do, but what we are doing is Christian socialism, looking after our fellowmen who are not able to look after themselves.  That is not squandering the ratepayers' or the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Regional Health Board we have an excellent staff who apply Christian principles and goodwill in looking after people who need help. I am glad to say that the Tánaiste gave his blessing to all this work when we brought it to his notice.  Some day he may be able to give us a subvention towards this work which is totally on the rates at the moment.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of people in our psychiatric hospitals in the city and county of Dublin.  Excellent work has been done during the last few years by our medical officers in attending outdoor clinics which were unheard of ten years ago, thus keeping people out <Col N="1538" /> of psychiatric hospitals.  Building more and more psychiatric hospitals is not the answer to this problem.  With modern treatment hospitalisation is not always necessary.</P>
    <P>Drugs is one of the big problems of our time.  In my young days the only people taking drugs were such people as doctors and nurses who would have ready access to them.  Today the ordinary citizens and particularly youngsters are taking drugs, and this is one of the reasons why a number of our people try to get psychiatric treatment. It is no use bringing people who are suffering from drugs into a hospital for a week.  They should be kept there until such time as, in the opinion of the psychiatrist, the treatment has been reasonably effective.  We are living in a permissive society and people may say we are interfering with the freedom of the individual, that the Tánaiste and members of the board and all the rest of us are harsh in our treatment.  I do not see that we are.  Times change and we have to change with them and we must deal with this matter in the best way possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to drink, I remember the time in Ireland, as I am sure do many others here on all sides of the House, when if a man was taking a drink he was considered a drunkard.  There was never anything charitable said about him.  People never realised that the person might be suffering from alcoholism which is now recognised as a disease. The Tánaiste made statements in regard to this problem.  Drinking excessively is a failing and does not spare anyone from a king to a beggar.  How many homes have we public men found broken up as a result of an unfortunate man or woman taking too much drink?  A great advance has been made in our time in understanding this problem. It is now seen as a disease that needs to be treated.  None of us knows what will happen to us or what cross is round the corner for us.  Again, as in the case of drug addicts, alcoholics should be kept in hospital until such time as the alcohol is cleared out of their systems and until they have been helped to stay away from drink.  Alcoholics Anonymous have done wonderful work in this direction.  Some of our <Col N="1539" /> best people are reformed alcoholics and their prayer is:</P>
    <P>Oh God, give us serenity to accept what cannot be changed, courage to change what should be changed, and wisdom to know the difference.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Tánaiste has accepted that we have this huge problem to deal with in the number of our people from all walks of life, from the king to the beggar, who suffer from this disease.</P>
    <P>With regard to cigarette smoking, I do not know what the Tánaiste can do. If the Tánaiste said tomorrow that nobody was to smoke cigarettes, there would be a black market in cigarettes the day after and people would smoke more cigarettes than they ever smoked in their lives.  We have people asking why the Tánaiste does not do this, that and the other in relation to cigarettes, but we have the example of what happened in the United States when they went dry.  Licences were withdrawn from pubs and a number of states went completely dry, but there was moonshine, corruption and everything else, and if the Tánaiste were to say in the morning that there was to be no more advertising of cigarettes, there would be more cigarettes under the counter and more people smoking them than ever.  The only thing the Tánaiste and his Department, together with the medical experts, can do is to advise people, to tell them that cigarette smoking is wrong and will have these effects. There is nothing else the Tánaiste can do.  If he were St. Peter himself, he could not do any more.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the people who say that he should cut out cigarette advertising and so on.  You cannot get away from the fact that you cannot do it in a democratic society because immediately the people are told they will not be allowed to smoke cigarettes, that is the time they will smoke more cigarettes than ever.  As I say, in America, when alcohol was cut out, there were judges on the bench, justices and the police force and all the other people who never offended against the law drinking moonshine and all this kind of thing.  I do not want to see <Col N="1540" /> things like that happening here and, thank God, the Tánaiste has a very intelligent view on this matter.  It would be all right if we were a communist society in which people found contravening the law could be sent to workers camps or even shot but we cannot do that in our democratic society and thanks be to God, we cannot because it would be wrong.  All that can be done is to tell the people of the dangers involved.  One cannot say to them: &ldquo;I will not allow any cigarettes for sale or allow anybody to advertise cigarettes&rdquo;, because straight off you have a black market, a black market which the Tánaiste or any other person cannot control.  The difficult position we are in can be seen.</P>
    <P>There is then the situation with regard to home help of which the Minister has spoken many times.  I was dealing with a case recently in my own district of a man with 12 children, the eldest of whom is 13&mdash;there are three sets of twins&mdash;whose wife is in hospital.  We were able to provide home help for that man.  I am not talking about geriatric patients with whom I have dealt already but about the ordinary individual who has to work and for whom we have to provide home help for looking after his children, who would otherwise be in some of our hospitals.  I should like to see this system extended for people of this type, and particularly for people situated as this man is.  I should like to see it extended and encouraged because we are doing a good job in the matter in the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>Choice of doctor was a great advance in our time.  I know that it is easier to have a choice in Dublin than it is in the dispensary areas in the country.  We know that a doctor setting up in practice will set up where the population is, such as in Limerick, Cork and the other bigger centres, but the choice of doctor scheme was a very good scheme which did away in great degree with the old dispensary system.  I should like to see the term &ldquo;health clinics&rdquo; adopted, as we have adopted it in the Eastern Health Board, in an effort to do away with the <Col N="1541" /> old dispensary system as far as possible. I should like to see more social welfare officers visiting the homes of these people.  These social welfare officers have done a very good job and I should like to see the system extended so that these officers can have a chat, as they have had, from time to time during their investigations.  The standard today of our social welfare officers has improved out of all recognition. They have become psychologists and psychiatrists and they feel that they are dealing with people.  I do not want to have them saying that such a person should not have this or that. I know they have a duty to perform, but I find also that there is a lot of charity and goodwill extended where you have well trained social workers who will deal with what should be done for a particular family and in that way we save the ratepayers and the taxpayers thousands of pounds.</P>

      <P>It is reasonably easy in the city and county of Dublin to have a choice of doctor but in the country or on the islands off the coast it is difficult to get doctors.  I am pleased that the old dispensary system is gone.  Deputy Tully mentioned the treatment children are getting today. Wonderful advances have been made. When I was going to school no doctor ever examined us except when we were sick.  When we got better we saw him <Col N="1543" /> no more.  Children today have a great advantage from the dental and medical point of view and these things are helping to keep people out of hospital. The Minister has taken a long and intelligent look at what should be done to keep people out of hospital.  We now have a very good maternity service. In my childhood days a handy woman acted as midwife.  Later a nurse came to the district.  Today a woman having a baby goes to hospital and is treated properly and it is very seldom that there are repercussions.  The public appreciate this advance.</P>
      <P>Hitherto parents of physically and mentally handicapped children in institutions were expected to pay a contribution. I knew a man who paid it for 20 years, a woman who paid it for 17 years and others who paid it for ten and 12 years.  The Minister decided that in the case of prolonged illness the State should pay.  This is a wonderful advance and the people appreciate it very much.  Since last October there is no obligation on the parents of retarded children to pay.  I knew an engineer who had to pay £10 a week. He had four other children and found it difficult.  In another case there were three such children and the father had to pay £30 per week.  The Minister made an intelligent advance here and I want to thank him.</P>
      <P>We have made many advances in the last few years in the case of the mentally retarded.  I remember some years ago making representations to the Office of Public Works to get a bus from O'Connell Bridge to a hospital at Knockmaroon.  They could not go up the Knockmaroon Hill.  It took me about 2½ years to get the bus to go through the park.  Now the bus leaves O'Connell Street every morning and takes about 50 or 60 children.  We have made a big advance in that field and children who would otherwise finish up in psychiatric hospitals are getting a chance of being trained to play a part in society.  We have succeeded in doing a great deal in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are rehabilitation officers in the prison service, one of whose duties is to place ex-prisoners in employment. <Col N="1544" /> As a result of the rehabilitation service for handicapped persons there are many handicapped persons in good employment.  It is unfair to ask a commercial firm to employ a person who is not competent.  Commercial firms are not philanthropic institutions. There are many charitable firms who employ handicapped persons and the Minister should give them encouragement by way of a small supplement and by giving them public recognition. There are very few families who have not a problem of mental or physical retardation.  All my life I have been appealing to various institutions that they should look after the handicapped. Many handicapped children are kept at home and receive no training whatever.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for having taken so long. I realise that Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde is anxious to get in.  I wanted to deal with the problems that I meet in public life.  I should like to say that the Minister for Health will have the support of all Deputies in improving the health services.  He has told us that the National Drugs Advisory Board has been in operation for a number of years.  There is a huge problem of drug abuse.  The Minister referred to the new hospital bodies.  I shall not deal with them.  My work on the boards of which I am a member gives me enough to do.  We are watching the progress made by the Minister.  He is doing a good job.</P>
    <P>People say that the Department of Health is costing more and more money.  This is due to the fact that more people are availing of hospital treatment.  The Deputies in the House will agree with me that we are constantly being asked by constituents to get sick persons into hospital.  At one time a person went into a hospital only for the purpose of an operation. People are living longer and this increases the demand for hospital accommodation. The Dublin Health Authority and the Department of Health are finding it increasingly difficult to provide sufficient hospital accommodation.  We are all doing our best to provide care for the aged and all the others who must be looked after.</P>
    <Col N="1545" />
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem we are faced with is to ensure that persons who need it will not be denied a health service and that the money expended is put to the best use.  There is nothing new in the Minister's speech.  There is an indication that the cost of the health services is rising. That is understandable.  The cost of everything is rising.  There is also an indication that the cost of the health services will increase.  The Minister has not offered us any suggestion by which the cost would be controlled or contained.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke, in his interesting discourse which took nearly an hour, indicated that more and more people are going into hospitals.  That is the reason for the rise in the cost of the health services.  In the past, when people were ill they went to the family doctor who provided the requisite treatment.  Now a person going to the family doctor must pay in full unless he has a health card.  A person in the middle income group is provided with hospital accommodation comparatively free of charge.  There in lies the fallacy of the health services.  I would ask the Minister to take a serious look at this matter.  I have known cases of conscientious general practitioners who, having carried out a thorough examination on the patient, have told them that there was nothing particular wrong with them, that after a week's rest they could resume their duties, while another doctor in the locality who has a patient who is in the middle income group and who could not perhaps continue to pay fees for an indefinite period, sends him to hospital. A consultant may say: &ldquo;I do not think there is anything wrong with you.  Take a little rest and then go back to work.&rdquo; But somebody else says: &ldquo;So-and-so down the street was sent to hospital.&rdquo; What can the doctor do?  The person goes to hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our hospitals are full today of people having exhaustive tests which are totally unnecessary.  It is there that the escalation of charges occurs.  Of course we should try to suggest to the Minister the remedy for that.  There is nothing in the statement of the Minister in his general outline of hospital <Col N="1546" /> services that could do anything to contain the upsurge in hospital charges.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we have for long advocated some form of a contributory health insurance scheme. We have contributory motor insurance and contributory social insurance schemes and contributory schemes in many other facets of our lives, but for some reason we are not allowed to have a contributory health service.  It is at the general practitioner level that all consultation commences.  There is a decision taken by the general practitioner who decides where the patient will go, which particular treatment he will get and what the charges will be to the State.  Outside a medical card &mdash;it is almost as easy to get a free trip to America as to get a medical card because of the financial struggle the health boards are engaged in&mdash;there is nothing to enable people to get free medical treatment.</P>
    <P>Surely the simple answer is to create some form of health contributory scheme.  I am not asking the Minister to accept everything we say on these benches although everyone says the two parties are all one.  Surely some form of contributory service must be introduced ultimately by somebody here unless the country is to reach a stage when it will be unable to pay for the services or to give the best services to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I find the Minister's introductory speech disappointing.  The Minister is a layman who has studied the case.  Of course, laymen have always been there to consider the health services.  I know the Minister has made the fullest study but it is fundamental to the success of the health services that he will introduce something like the contributory scheme we have suggested sooner or later.  He made a small move in that direction when he introduced a scheme whereby for the small contribution of £7 a year small farmers can benefit.  That, by itself, does not meet the problem.  It only reduces the health charges by £5 million.</P>
    <P>I found it hard to get out of the Minister's speech or the Book of Estimates what the cost of the health services <Col N="1547" /> is at the moment.  I think it is something in the neighbourhood of £83 million.  We have got so much in arrears in our work here that I am not clear which Health Estimate we are dealing with now.  We seem to be dealing with the Estimate for 1971-72 and possibly the Minister has embodied in it the extra £13 million he has said is needed to deal with the needs of the present financial year.  I do not think it will cover those needs. I think that, unless there is a change in the financial set-up, we will find that when the Minister for Health comes here next year he will be looking for £100 million, if the people are able to pay.  The tragedy is that nobody will get a better health service for that money than they have now. The hospitals will cost as much and the number of people cluttering up the hospitals, whether they should be there or not, will be the same.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister now to take a leap in the dark as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned and to formulate a contributory policy of some sort.  If he does he will be creating the type of christian socialism that the last speaker spoke about.  I am one of those who believe that when parents or individuals are able to pay for the health services they need they should pay, but the situation at the moment, with the abnormal cost of living, is that there are very few people who can pay, who can afford to go into hospital or to send their children there for two or three months, as may be necessary. Even in a public ward the charge now is £25 per week and even the upper income group cannot afford to do it.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme introduced in the period of the last inter-Party Government nearly 20 years ago, there has been no real attempt to meet our health problems through a national contribution scheme.  As I have said, if there are contribution schemes for motor insurance and social insurance, why not for health insurance?  I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <P>Last year on this Estimate I pointed to the Minister the need for speech therapy and I said we were totally <Col N="1548" /> behind other countries in this respect. I did not intend to denigrate us in any way because most countries are backward in this respect and the need for speech therapy is something that has been recognised only in recent years.  It is extremely important.  Anybody who has had as much to do with handicapped children as I have had, being chairman of an association for handicapped children in my constituency, must realise that speech therapy is important not only in connection with the mentally handicapped but also the physically handicapped.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the present Minister was responsible for setting up a speech therapy centre but that centre is capable of turning out only approximately 13 to 15 speech therapists per annum.  Apart altogether from the mentally handicapped, the demand for speech therapists is considerable.  Anybody who has to use the telephone as often as Deputies will realise that speech therapy is a national essential because there are so many people in this country whose elocution, whose speech, is defective in every way.</P>
    <P>Each county would need a speech therapist, but we are capable of turning out only 15 per year.  We have got Twenty-six counties to cover&mdash;perhaps at some not too distant date we will have Thirty-two.  I do not know what is the situation in the six Northern counties but they are under the British regime who in recent years have realised how important speech therapy is.  Each county would need a therapist and every mental institution would need one.</P>
    <P>Several counties have a few institutions for the mentally handicapped. We have three in Wexford and shortly we will have a fourth institution. From voluntary funds we are arranging to have a speech therapist but we cannot share the services of that therapist with the health area.  The South Eastern Health Board deals with four or five counties and would need at least four speech therapists.  In the next ten years we would need to qualify at least 20 speech therapists each year in order to cope with the problem.  It would be necessary to give university status to the speech therapy <Col N="1549" /> school so that it could qualify for university grants.  Perhaps the Minister would consult with the Minister for Education to see if this could be done.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister stated that the number of cases of cancer remained fairly static but that lung cancer was on the increase.  The reason for this increase is pollution.  Pollution in built-up areas is one of the greatest hazards we face.  I asked the Minister a question about this matter recently and referred to action taken in other countries, principally in the United States.  These countries have realised the tremendous danger that exists in this regard.  The Minister brushed it aside and said that the situation there was quite different from that obtaining here and that we need not have any fears about pollution.  One would only need to lean over one of the Liffey bridges and take a sniff; one would get enough pollution to last a lifetime. If one travels on the roads one can see the diesel lorries and the heavy merchandise being transported.  I suggest to the Minister that the increase in lung cancer is due to pollution, and largely to oil pollution.</P>
    <P>During the years there has been a tremendous outcry about cigarette smoking and it has been stated that it is responsible for lung cancer.  It may be a contributory cause but a contributory cause does not produce a disease, although it helps to produce it.  There has been a reduction in cigarette smoking.  I know people who smoked 60 cigarettes a day who have given up cigarette smoking&mdash;they have changed to pipes and, perhaps, an occasional cigar.  Despite the reduction in cigarette smoking the numbers suffering from lung cancer have increased and we must look for the cause.  I submit that it is due to the general pollution of the atmosphere&mdash; pollution of the air, water and earth. We should ensure that a commission is set up here consisting of the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Health and, possibly, the Minister for Industry and Commerce to see that there is some control over pollution.  Today, lung cancer is the captain of death in this country&mdash;a <Col N="1550" /> country which is less polluted than most other areas of the world.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's remarks with regard to coronary thrombosis. This disease has been halted but it is still a major problem.  The Minister mentioned several factors as being contributory causes but he omitted one important factor.  He referred to excessive cigarette smoking but I have pointed out that this has been reduced. The Minister also referred to lack of exercise.  This is one of the main contributory causes of this disease.  There are people in their 40s who cannot walk 50 yards without puffing like a grampus because they do not walk but always use their motor cars.  In former times people walked or used bicycles but these times are gone.  Nowadays people travel in cars to work, they stay in their offices during the day, return home in their cars and probably fall asleep in an armchair in the evening. These people do not take any exercise; they are asking for coronary thrombosis and many of them get it.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention the important factor of diet.  It is a recognised fact that the cause of coronary thrombosis is cholesterol.  Cholesterol in the blood is responsible for clotting. The main producer of cholesterol is fat meat.  In the United States coronary thrombosis was a national problem. They studied the matter fully and they discovered that cholesterol was one of the main predisposing causes of coronary thrombosis.  The Minister might keep in mind the points I have raised regarding pollution and the matter of diet with regard to coronary thrombosis. In my opinion meat fat is responsible for many of the cases of coronary thrombosis but any fats&mdash; even those found in butter&mdash;are also a factor.  The United States conducted extensive experiments and they have accepted that fats are an important factor with regard to coronary thrombosis.</P>
    <P>I had a sense of disquiet last week when I came into the House and someone was chivvying the Minister on a parliamentary question.  The Minister said he refused to interfere with the health boards; he said he had established <Col N="1551" /> the boards, that they could carry out their functions and that he refused to prevent them in any way from carrying out their duties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstood me.  What I meant was that in regard to minor matters I would sum up what appeared to me to be defects in matters requiring attention and would deal with them globally. I did not say I would not interfere with the boards&mdash;I am responsible for the boards.  What I meant was that in regard to minor matters, such as individual medical cards or something of that kind, I would wait until I had accumulated a series of matters which required attention, leaving the boards with the day to day operations.  That is a very different thing.  The Deputy misunderstood me or perhaps I was not accurately reported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not let me complete my sentence. Many years ago CIE were given autonomy.  Many things happen in CIE of which we do not approve, just as we do not approve of what happens in all facets of political life in this country.  However, when any Deputy asked questions about the situation in regard to CIE, he was told that the matter was one of day to day administration. I understand that this Estimate is being referred back for reconsideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it looks as if the Minister will get away with it.  My fear is that the regulations that are being introduced will leave the Minister in the position where he can say that various matters with which we might be concerned are ones of day to day administration.  That is the answer we will be given if we ask questions about, for example, the closing down of a hospital or about an increase in hospital services without there being any increase in the nursing or domestic staff of a hospital.  Health services are so important and the charges are so high that we ought to be in a position to come here and, if <Col N="1552" /> necessary, to assert our democratic rights.  That is the only way left to us because so far as I can see this country has sunk completely under bureaucratic control.  I am of the opinion now that my only function is to come here and harp at a Minister by way of supplementary questions in order to get to the root of matters.</P>
      <P>These new regional boards will have to be paid for by the local authorities, who must strike the necessary rate to cover health charges.  They have no redress.  Are we, as Dáil Deputies, to have any rights at all?  Are we to be told in the House that the Minister has no function in the day to day administration of the hospitals?  The point I am trying to make is that, although costs may escalate and efficiency may decrease, there will not be anything we can do.  I presume this Estimate will be carried, because as far as I know Fianna Fáil have a majority yet in the House although I do not know whether they are sure themselves of having a majority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I am not as up-to-date on matters as is Deputy Coughlan.  I want to make my protest now.  The Minister should not adopt the attitude that was adopted in relation to CIE.  Let us have the attitude that was adopted in regard to the ESB.  Let us have an attitude whereby we will be able to get answers regarding the health board.  Surely, as a Deputy, I am entitled to speak on these subjects.  I happen to be a doctor also although, perhaps, not a very good one because I have not practised for many years.  However, I ought to be in a position to be able to criticise what is happening and to find out from the Minister whether the situation is satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House unduly on these matters but from the Minister's speech I am not very clear as to what is the function of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  I take it that the hospital boards are being set up for the purpose of reaching decisions as to what operations or treatment can be carried out at individual hospitals.  I am thinking, for instance, of operations <Col N="1553" /> for the removal of lungs or of the opening of the brain in the case of brain tumour where surgery of a specialised type would be needed.  The hospital board would appear to have an overriding authority over the regional health boards, but where do we go from there?  Which board makes the decisions?  Which one decides what particular type of surgery is to be carried out or how many surgeons are to be engaged in operations?  I can see an unsatisfactory state of affairs developing where nobody knows exactly what is to happen in regard to the hospital services in this country.</P>
    <P>Will the regional health board go along to the hospital boards and say: &ldquo;You are making a mess of things.  We know all about these matters&rdquo;?  I have consulted with some of the organisations who have had discussions with the Minister and they tell me they are satisfied that the hospital boards being set up will have a full understanding of everything concerned with hospital administration.  Comhairle na nOspidéal will have 23 members of not less than 12 persons who are registered medical practitioners engaged in a consultant capacity in the provision of hospital services.  That means the majority on the board will consist of consulting physicians or surgeons who are resident in Dublin and who make decisions that affect Dublin but which do not bear a true relationship to the rest of the country.  As a medical student in this country I was taught that when in any doubt patients should be sent to hospital in Dublin.  When I studied medicine in other part of the world I found that teaching in this regard was very different.  Doctors were taught to depend more on their own resources.  I am going back 50 years but the same mentality persists today. A hospital board consisting of a majority of Dublin consultants does not impress me as being a suitable institution to advise the Minister and to make him aware of the proper set-up of surgery in this country.  However, I am not opposed totally to the hospital board.  They can do only a limited amount of harm.</P>
    <P>The regional hospital boards also will consist of consultants.  One of the <Col N="1554" /> functions of the regional hospital board which strikes me as being extremely dangerous is the discontinuance of a hospital.  For some time we had the FitzGerald Report before us.  This report was conceived and designed and produced entirely by a group of Dublin consultants aided by one or two other consultants from different hospitals in the country. It is significant that the surgeons in the hospitals for which closures have been suggested had no representation on this board.  It is suggested that the hospitals in Roscommon, Wexford, Mallow, Nenagh and several other places should be closed, unmindful of the fact that if they are closed severe hardship for the people concerned will arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister has evaded the FitzGerald Report and I do not blame him for that.  There is a general reaction against the closure of these hospitals in all the areas concerned.  These hospitals will be closed down willy-nilly.  Nobody will have any say in the matter.  When we ask parliamentary questions we will be told that the Minister has no function and that the matter has been decided by the regional hospital board in accordance with the statutory regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I explain it to the Deputy because I do not want anybody to have any illusions about it. First, no hospital or sanatorium can be closed without the consent of the Minister under section 38 (4) of the Health Act.  Secondly, if there is a change of user in a hospital there has to be a local inquiry if it is desired. Thirdly, in practice, it would be impossible for a regional hospital board or Comhairle na nOspidéal to take action in changing the function of a hospital if there were any financial matter involved.  As there will always be finance matters involved, in practice the Minister will make the ultimate decision.  I hope Deputies understand that.  You could not close X hospital without providing staff in Y hospital and, more often than not, beds, extra theatre facilities and things of that kind.  So, in actual practice the Minister will always have to give his consent because it inevitably involves <Col N="1555" /> budgeting.  The Deputy need not be under any illusion that in practice these hospital boards or Comhairle na nOspidéal will be working <i>in vacuo</i> and entirely independent of national health policy and entirely independent of the Minister's wishes in the matter. I hope I have made it clear to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I understand what the Minister says.  In effect, he is telling me that if they close down a hospital he as Minister and as the executive head will guarantee that there will not be fewer hospital beds. He is not giving me the guarantee I am looking for that the hospitals will be maintained in the areas where they have given service to the public over the years.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for decision by the Minister after an inquiry, and after listening to the county health advisory body, and after hearing the views of the regional hospital board and the regional board.  Ultimately it will be for the Minister to decide.  He could not allow either of these bodies to make the decision.  I give the Deputy and all Members of the House this assurance.  The Minister cannot divest himself of responsibility for major changes in hospital organisation.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the regional hospital board at the moment.  The Minister is appointing the chairman.  He is nominating 16 members.  The other four come from each of the regional health boards.  He is giving the regional hospital board he is appointing the function of deciding where hospitals are viable, where they should be maintained, and where they should not be maintained. If the board say to him that Wexford Hospital should be closed, even though everybody in Wexford is against that, surely the Minister will accept the advice of the board he appointed.  Up to the end of 1975 these boards are his appointees.  Will he say: &ldquo;That is absolute nonsense.  We will not close this hospital.  We will let it carry on as it was before.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I see the inherent danger in this.  I do not want to see my hospital closed. I do not want people coming to me and telling me that so-and-so died while being motored on a frosty night from somewhere in North Wexford to somewhere in Waterford or wherever the hospital is, which is as far away from where they live as Dublin is.  I understand that conditions are even worse in other places.  Apparently the argument in favour of closing the Mallow Hospital is that it is adjacent to Cork.  Anyone who has travelled, as I did the other day, on the road between Mallow and Cork will know that it is one of the slowest-moving roads in the world.  It is all twists and turns.  I believe that there is some gigantic scheme to spend millions of pounds to straighten that road.  These are matters that must be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision will be taken, not by the people who service the hospitals, and not by the people who work the hospitals, but by the appointees of the Minister.  If the Minister gives me a guarantee that he will appoint people who know something about the servicing and running of hospitals in rural Ireland, and know something about <Col N="1557" /> transport, and also know the difficulties with the telephone service in rural Ireland, which is probably the worst in the whole world, I will be satisfied.  I am dealing with the position as I see it. I see these boards being set up and taking complete control of everything and giving a decision to the Minister.  I ask the Minister a parliamentary question and he tells me he has no function in the matter or that he is taking the advice of the hospital boards which the Dáil approved.</P>
    <P>This is my last chance to state the case as I see it.  I believe that the FitzGerald Report is not in keeping with the thinking in rural Ireland.  It is 50 miles from Roscommon to Galway.  I believe that the Roscommon hospital is one of the best rural hospitals, if not the best, in the West of Ireland.  It is to be abolished for the sake of so-called economy.  It is false economy.  It is ridiculous thinking.  The Minister is getting advice from the wrong people. I may be criticising the Minister unjustly. We may find when he appoints the 16 people that they know something about the administration of hospitals. The people who understand hospitals, the administration of hospitals, the difficulties of hospitals, and the transport difficulties are the practitioners who work in them and the nurses and other staff who work in them.  They are the people who should be consulted.  If the Minister can assure me that he will consult these people fully, I am easy to please, and I will be satisfied.</P>
    <P>The Minister has lived in Dublin practically all his life.  He has lived in a built-up area and he has an urban mentality.  The majority of the people on this island live in the rural areas. The Minister will have a certain number of nominees on this board.  Now there does not seem to be any getting away from consultants; they have run the medical practice here over the years, not too successfully at times, but if the Minister chooses four consultants from hospitals in rural Ireland, I will settle for that.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health is one of the most important Departments in the whole Government system.  It is equally important for us <Col N="1558" /> to consider health in all its aspects. The first consideration at all times must be the welfare of the patient and the eradication of disease.  I have had experience as a member of a health board and, prior to that, I had experience as a member of a health authority for a good number of years.  Prior to that I was a member of the old mental hospital board.  Indeed, this is where boards originated.</P>
      <P>In bygone years health was generally accepted as a local government problem and it was administered by local government officials.  I agreed whole-heartedly with the dissolution of the old mental hospital board.  In it our activities were confined to the particular mental hospitals under our care. When the health authority was formed it comprised both Limerick city and Limerick county and the two local authorities were represented on that health authority.  We worked in harmony and in the interests of the patients at all times.  I believe we were far and away ahead of this newfangled idea of regionalism.</P>
      <P>Regionalisation has failed the world over, but now we have these regional boards thrown at us.  I believe we have gained nothing, except some sad experience, a damned expensive experience. Charges have gone up and services have not improved one iota.  But positions have been created.  The demand on the taxpayer has gone beyond imagination.  I do not mind paying for a satisfactory service, but we are not getting a satisfactory service. We are a damned sight worse off today than we were under the health authority.</P>
      <P>As a health authority we sent up proposals to the Department of Health. This Department is the most indolent and incompetent in the country and all our efforts to care for our patients are stymied by the bureaucrats in the Custom House.  I can prove every word I am saying.  We have sent up to the Department plans for extensions and renovations, schemes to help the handicapped, schemes providing treatment for alcoholics, schemes for the training of the deaf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not so long ago we were invited to <Col N="1559" /> a seminar in Killarney.  I went like a fool and wasted a day listening to utter piffle talked by officials of the Department of Health.  There were all sorts of grandiose schemes; this was to be done and that was to be done; this was the programme laid out.  I asked a simple question: &ldquo;In the name of God, what are we going to do with all the plans we have sent up to the Department for extensions to this and extensions to that and the building of this and the building of that?&rdquo;  I said this had been going on for years and I was told by that efficient official that all these plans and proposals had gone into the wastepaper basket; we were to start off again now and send up our priorities.  An official of the Department of Health had the audacity to say that to me at this seminar in Killarney. I could do nothing but stand up and walk out in disgust.  These are the people who make the speeches, pages and pages of them, of dreams that even Aesop in his heyday would not think up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slandering nobody.  If the truth is slander, I slander, but I am telling the truth and if the Minister knew his Department he would know this.  He can go back to them and ask them in the Custom House what have we been sending up to the Department?  What have we been <Col N="1560" /> saying to our CEOs in the health board at every monthly meeting? What questions have we been asking? We are hearing the same old rigmarole. Our CEO has to come to Dublin once a week; the personnel officer has to go another week and some other fellow has to go another week and officials are up and down between Limerick and Dublin.  As I said at the last health board meeting, they would be a damn sight better off if they spent their time in Limerick looking after our health board affairs instead of chasing up to the Custom House every other day looking for decisions.  Let the Minister be peeved because I tell the truth about his officials: I can prove it.  I do not come here to slander anybody because every man must live and do the best he can.  But you cannot put a donkey into a racecourse and that is what is happening with the Department.  They are trying to run a race for which they are not competent or fitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told by this great FitzGerald man that you must rationalise and regionalise, -ise it up or -ise it down but it must be done with the hospitals. We all know the trouble going on for years in Mallow and I congratulate the people of that area who are fighting justly for their rights.  There is a similar situation in our area at present where a downgrade move is on in regard to a hospital in Nenagh.  Were it not for the fight we are making and the public demonstrations, Nenagh hospital would be closed long ago. What is it all for?  Because Mr. FitzGerald gathered around him a body of consultants and consultants only and because it suited them to bring unfortunate people 20, 30 or even 60 miles for a particular service or operation they made this decision, forgetting the human aspect that the patient would be 50 or 60 miles away from home lying on his back all day, looking at a bare ceiling with nobody to talk to, no consolation, no human relationships.  If this is what the Minister and the Department think is right in regard to reports that have been issued.  I want to stress that as far as the Mid-Western Health Board is concerned, while I am on it, we shall fight it every inch of the way.  We shall see <Col N="1561" /> that the patient is the first consideration, not the consultant or the highly-qualified gentleman who comes from far away without any human or social interest in the unfortunate patient.</P>
    <P>There is more to it than that.  What is the good of dying in wealth in a mighty hospital when you have nobody to talk to and cannot have your own people around you?  Is it not better to have friends and relations about you and die with the comfort of their consolation? We come up against the frozen attitude and approach of the Department because of the FitzGerald report.  Reports are great when people do not know their jobs.  We can hide behind a report of some sort of commission and say: &ldquo;This is it.  This is what is dished up to us and we shall take our line from that.&rdquo;  This has been the attitude of Fianna Fáil since they came into power and it has been the attitude adopted, not alone by the Department of Health but by other Departments because of the inefficiency and ineptitude and lackadaisical approach of most members of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet.  They hide behind commissions and reports instead of taking the bull by the horns and saying: &ldquo;This is the job you must do.  Go and do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is what I want done&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;I&rdquo; I speak for the plain people of Ireland, not for the boys in the Custom House.  Whether the Minister and his Department know it or not, there is grave discontent in the nursing service because of the attitude adopted by the Department on one hand and the chief executive officers on the other.  I questioned the Minister here in regard to an incident that was a scandal and an indelible one which will never be wiped off the record of the health service of this country, allowing the psychiatric nurses go on strike.  This was a disgrace for the Department. When I asked the Minister to reconcile the differences before the matter came to a head&mdash;we all knew it was coming because nobody would move&mdash;nothing was done.  The nurses who went on strike did not do so lightheartedly; they were pushed into it by the bureaucratic approach of the Custom House and the CEOs who were alleged to <Col N="1562" /> administer health board services in the different areas.</P>
    <P>That problem is not yet solved.  Certain promises were made that certain things would be done.  They are still undone and when we ask questions, either here or at health board meetings every other day, we are told the matter is under consideration.  But nothing is being done.  How can we expect dedicated persons with a vocation which I regard with great esteem, that of a psychiatric nurse, to apply themselves humanely and whole-heartedly to the treatment of patients when they have these embarrassments and harassments, financial and otherwise, hanging over them all the time?</P>
    <P>To make matters worse, they see no hope of a settlement because of the attitude of the Department and the CEOs.  It is about time the Minister and his Department realised that a person who is sick needs attention and treatment.  There is nobody sick of his own volition.  Those people are sick because something unfortunate happened. How can we give the unfortunate people in hospital beds the sympathy and treatment they need when the people who look after them are not content?  The only way to make those people happy and contented is to improve their working conditions.  The present day trend is to get people in and out of hospital beds as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In Limerick we have sent up demands for extensions to our hospitals but we cannot get them.  It is over five years since I had a resolution passed by the Limerick Health Authority to have a canteen for nurses started in St. Camillus's Hospital in Limerick.  At long last it is under consideration.  We wanted to give nurses in that hospital a decent food service.  Up to this some of them have been bringing in flasks and sandwiches and others have tried to get a half hour off from work to go in a bus to Limerick to get something to eat. Those people are giving a day and night service in this hospital.</P>
    <P>This hospital was known as the workhouse long ago.  There are up to 700 geriatric patients there now who need constant attention.  I have often <Col N="1563" /> been told by the Minister that I slander the officials in his Department when I speak about them but I want to say now that we are waiting for over five years to have this service provided for the nurses in St. Camillus's Hospital, Limerick.</P>
    <P>Many of us were at a seminar in Killarney recently and an official of the Minister's Department had the audacity to tell us that we had to put in all our demands again, such as those for extensions and amenities.  Who do they think they are fooling?  Do they think we are a lot of morons?  I want to tell the Department that as far as we are concerned in the Western Health Board we have not started the battle yet, but please God, our day is coming. I believe in giving plenty of rope to people.  We do not want to give people in that area extravagant things.  We only want to give them a good medical service.</P>
    <P>Many people travel up to 40 miles to attend a clinic in one of those hospitals and they have to sit in a cold room for hours waiting for a doctor or a surgeon to attend them.  It was only last year that we got permission to install a tea-vending machine so that those people could have a cup of tea while they were waiting for treatment.  The officials in the Department should come down to us in the Limerick area and we will show them how to run a health service.  Preference is given to one area over another but no consideration is given to the unfortunate people who have to lie in hospital beds, waiting for examination or tests of any type.  We get pages of stuff from the Departments every day of the week but as far as I am concerned when I have read the first couple of pages I put them into the wastepaper basket.</P>
    <P>Ordinary people like myself should sit down and write a thesis on this matter and give the Minister a solution. It is easy for any person to come in here and be critical but we can also supply the answer.  I do not mind Deputy Burke because whatever a Fianna Fáil Minister says that is his bible.  I say to any Member of the House outside those in the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1564" /> Party, if he is a representative on any health board, let him come along and give his views and he will agree completely with what I have said.</P>
    <P>I do not speak lightly on this matter. I know what it is to have to spend some time in hospital and I have often sat by the bedside of a dying man. Many people in hospital are up to 50 miles away from their homes in Limerick and if they are in a Dublin hospital they are 120 miles away. When you visit them they will ask you: &ldquo;How are they all in Limerick?  How is my wife?  Why can my children not come to see me?&rdquo; Any people who wish to visit relatives in hospital cannot get a free travel voucher unless they have a certificate from the doctor treating the person concerned saying that the nearest relative is permitted to travel.  They can be in any hospital here in Dublin and see nobody belonging to them until they are at death's door and then the doctor concerned will advise the health board that a voucher should be issued and they can come and take away the corpse.  It is as simple and as brutal as that.  That is the tragic position and it gives me no pleasure to say it here today, but it is true and I would be a hypocrite if I did not say it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the issue of medical cards, we take every case on its merits irrespective of the income to the house, and there is a good reason for that.  There may be homes with an income four times as much as that of the next door neighbour, but they could have six times more demands medically. I do not believe you can have a straight line approach to the issue of medical cards.  We are treating people fairly well, but in the last six or eight months for some unknown reason, a test has been introduced because a man who had, say, £10 two years ago got an increase of £4 or £5 since.  If he did, it was negotiated through his union and he got it because of the cost of living and because of the extravagant manner in which Fianna Fáil are running the country.  People have to be demanding, and because they got this increase the Department have clamped down: &ldquo;There are too many medical cards issued in your area.  You must draw <Col N="1565" /> the line.&rdquo;  As a result there has been a general review of medical card holders. The Department want to cut down on expenditure.  They tell us we are spending too much money, but they forget one thing, that the patient is the sufferer all the time.</P>
    <P>Why will the Minister and the Department not tell us the truth instead of hiding behind McKinsey yesterday, FitzGerald today and goodness knows who it will be tomorrow? The Minister says: &ldquo;I do not interfere in day-to-day administration.&rdquo;  We heard that every hour and minute of the day when he was in Transport and Power.  Now he is at it again: &ldquo;I do not interfere.&rdquo;  When I questioned him here about the increase for the psychiatric nurses he told me it was a matter for the CEO or the board.  I challenged the CEO on this and produced the Dáil Debates and he said: &ldquo;No.  It is a national issue and it will not be debated until all the CEOs in the country come together and make an agreement.&rdquo;  The Minister said the very opposite to me.  Who am I to believe? What the Minister said is there on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is not very important but which still goes to show incompetence in the running of this Department.  I am a member of the VHI.  If I want a blood test, I go into hospital on Saturday, have the blood test on Sunday morning and I come out on Monday.  It costs me nothing; it is charged up to the VHI. If I do not want to go to hospital for Saturday, Sunday and Monday and I go to my doctor's surgery, I have to pay £5.20 for the blood test even though I am in the VHI.  Would anyone tell where is the sense in that?  By going to the surgery I am saving a bed in a hospital; I am saving nurses and I am saving attention of all kinds.  The Department should wake up and realise what people have to go through with all this bureaucracy in the Custom House.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal of talk here about what was being done for handicapped children.  I want to tell the Minister and his Department something about what it means to be associated with handicapped children.  I am <Col N="1566" /> on a fund-raising committee for the handicapped children of Limerick city and county.  It costs us £8,000 a year to run a day-school which we provided ourselves, which we furnished ourselves and for which we supply the transport ourselves&mdash;a minibus to bring these children in there every day. We did this by going around with our caps in our hands, running flag-days, dances, concerts, crazy football matches.  Everything we could do to raise money we did, and we got the money.  Because of the services we are giving it is costing us £8,000 a year to keep it going.  What do we get from the Department?  We get £3,000 and have to find £5,000 ourselves every year.  We are having a church gate collection next Sunday in Limerick city and instead of playing their golf next Sunday any of the boys in the Custom House can come and stand outside every church gate and they will see us there begging the people to support the handicapped children.</P>
    <P>Then the Department tell us they are giving us a service.  Service be damned.  They should be ashamed of themselves.  I hope the judgment on them will be much lighter the day they meet their Creator than it is from me.  It is very hard to be patient or charitable when you face a situation such as this.  I shall not give my charity to these &ldquo;buckos&rdquo; when I see the way they are treating unfortunate people all over the country.  The Minister is responsible and let him take it upon his shoulders to carry on a Department that is supposed to be doing something and is doing absolutely nothing.</P>
    <P>We have some documents here.  If you were to read all the documents you get from the Department of Health you would never get out of bed.  I see here: &ldquo;Major hospital building projects completed since May, 1971.&rdquo; As far as the board of which I am a member is concerned and which represents Clare, North Tipperary, Limerick city and county, what was completed for 1971 in the whole of the four counties was a home for the aged in Kilrush, with accommodation for 45 patients and three staff members.  That is a bit of an achievement and something <Col N="1567" /> to be proud of.  I visited the place and saw it and up to 1971 this is all that has been done in my board.</P>
    <P>We move on then and look at the projects under construction.  St. John's Hospital, electrical re-wiring&mdash;that is all under the general hospitals.  Then there are hospital boards, electrical rewiring in Croom&mdash;another major operation.  We had to bring in consultants for this.  Then mental hospitals &mdash;nothing at all; institutions for handicapped children&mdash;nothing at all; and under accommodation for the aged, the Hospital of the Assumption in Thurles, and a hospital reconstruction in Ennis. There is the contribution from the Department with regard to our hospitals. The demands made by us, both in the old Limerick Health Authority and the present health board, have been ignored and overlooked, have been treated with scorn, and we who are giving our services night and day in an effort to help unfortunate people have been treated by the Department as if we were merely playboys or toys when, in fact, we are the people who are trying to keep the nation together, and not the officials.</P>
    <P>On this question of the £7 health contribution, I put a question to the Minister some time ago about this payment. I asked him if retired workers and old age pensioners are obliged to make this contribution under the Health Act, 1971 and the answer he gave me was that persons who have not got full eligibility for health services and whose income from pensions or other sources is less than £1,600 per annum are obliged to pay this contribution&mdash;that is not so bad&mdash;and persons who are in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions are regarded as having full eligibility for services and are not, therefore, obliged to pay the health contribution.  But what about the contributory people and the people who are living on ordinary industrial pensions after their years of service?  They have to foot this £7 bill and who is to collect it?  It is the health boards&mdash;more expense and more work on these boards when it should have been paid through an insurance card and stamp, making things <Col N="1568" /> easy for everybody, but no, the Department say that this is what you have to do and you will do it.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter and it is that enough emphasis has not been placed or projected by the Department on mental rehabilitation.  When we were going to school, we learned that consumption has no pity on blue eyes or curly hair.  We got rid of the stigma of consumption and now most of us who have the physical and mental health of our people at heart are trying to bring this disease of mental illness into the open and trying to bring these people into the sheltered workshop to rehabilitate them as best we can, but we get little or no help, good, bad or indifferent, from the Minister and his Department.  It means that these people are locked up, thrown away like the coloured child that was or the consumptive that was, with no hope and nothing in the future for them.  I say that like every other disease, there is an answer to this disease.  There is a solution to the problem but nothing is forthcoming and no encouragement given to the lay people who are trying to do this work from the Department.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the rehabilitation of our handicapped children and the care of the deaf and the blind. There should be some means of rehabilitating these people, whether they come from the hospital for the deaf in Dublin or the hospital for the blind, whether they come out of any other mental institution and whether they are physically affected or not, and if the Department had the interests of these people at heart, they would devise the necessary scheme.  It is their job to do it, their job to organise these things and make the finances available. If they do we ordinary lay people will not be found wanting in putting them into operation.  Not alone do I suggest but I demand that the Department's officials apply themselves along these lines.  There is no use in having hundreds and hundreds of people in different mental homes all over the country.  We have over 900 in the one in Limerick from which most of them will never come out.  They are there for years and years and any of us who have had the experience of going <Col N="1569" /> into these places to visit them and on inspections or otherwise know that they are.  These problems will have to be tackled if we want to make a success of this Department.  I conclude by emphasising with whatever force is possible for me that so far as I am concerned, from my long number of years in public life, there is no more inept, no more harsh, ruthless Department than the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>I think it is true to say that the Department of Health has been lucky down the years in the various Ministers that have been in charge.  Each one has contributed his share in the improvements that have taken place in the health conditions of the people.  I should like to deal with what I consider to be one of the most striking figures in the Minister's speech. This is the figure for child mortality in respect of children under one year of age.  It is indicated that in the year 1970 the figure was 19 per 1,000, whereas the figures for the Six Counties and Britain were 23 and 18 and 20 for Scotland.  The provisional figure for 1971 is 18 which is a further fall.  This brings us on a par with the England and Wales figure of 1970.  This is one of the most important figures revealed because it is a barometer of the efficiency of the maternity, obstetrical and child services throughout the country.  We should congratulate ourselves on having achieved this figure. It reflects well on the Department of Health and its various Ministers who pioneered the mother and child welfare scheme and saw to it that it continued. It is a credit to the doctors who have the responsibility for seeing that people get the actual care.  It must be emphasised that this is a scheme that is based on a fee for service even though in many cases the doctors give many more services than those for which they are paid.  It also emphasises that the general practitioner or family doctor on the whole must be doing his job well and that he is capable of looking after the child in the pre-school years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said before that I think a mistake has been made by the Department <Col N="1570" /> in handing over the care of the child in the pre-school years to other than the family doctor in the urban areas.  In the past there may have been the feeling that the family doctor was not able to undertake this care but those figures confirm that the family doctor is well capable of looking after this problem.  For obvious reasons this scheme has not been extended to the rural areas.  In another part of the Minister's speech we were told that the doctors conducting those examinations in the urban areas have been abroad on courses and have attended courses organised by the county medical officers. It is a waste of manpower to have those people examining a multitude of children, the vast majority of whom would be normal.  There is so much information to be sought about infants and young children at the psychological and developmental level that I am certain their ability and education would be much better used in this specialised field.  At this late stage, this interpretation having been rightly put upon those figures, the Department should review the scheme which is now functioning. Everybody accepts that the care of the infant and the child is probably one of the most difficult things facing parents and doctors.  It is an area where the least information is available to doctors at present because it is a new speciality.  For this reason consultants and specialists who have responsibility for the final decision in dealing with those problems should organise an educational meeting once a year.  Some people would call it a seminar; I would call it a review.  At this meeting the specialist would review the cases that he had dealt with during the year.  He would point out to the family doctors those conditions which were commonest and he would point out the commonest conditions which were missing diagnosis at an early stage.  The doctors would be dealing with diseases of their own environment.  The information they would acquire they could use in future years and thereby increase the efficiency of the service to a very large extent.  Further, with the regionalisation of hospitals and treatment, whereby the family doctor would find himself 60 or 70 miles away from a specialist, probably never meet him <Col N="1571" /> over a number of years, it would give them a chance of meeting each other, exchanging views and having problems solved.  I have no doubt that the organisation of an activity such as this would yield much and would increase still further the efficiency of the child welfare service.</P>
    <P>Another figure which the Minister quoted is in respect of maternal mortality.  This is a remarkable figure. For 1970 the number of deaths is 20, indicating a percentage of .31 and the provisional figure for 1971 is 11 giving a percentage of .16.  This again puts us at the top of the league table.  It is another figure which indicates the efficiency of medical care at this level and it refutes completely much of what we heard a short time ago from a previous speaker who referred to the inefficiency of the Department and how little they thought about the welfare of the people.  It is accepted that a maternal death is the greatest disaster in a family and the fact that the figure has been reduced to this is certainly a matter for congratulation.  It is just a pity this figure has not been broken down to indicate the occupation and social standing of the people who died because, if my recollection is correct, some years ago when the figure was 27 or 28, 25 per cent to 30 per cent of those who died were itinerants.  It would be a matter of interest to know if this is the situation at present.  Again it is well to say, in view of a certain amount of criticism, that this maternity service is run on a fee for service basis and obviously it is well worth while.  I think it should go on the record of the House that the Irish Medical Association has a body made up of specialists, general practitioners and others who each year analyse each maternal death and try to establish the cause of death in as much detail as possible.  Having established this detail, they then try to decide if any of the contributory causes or the main cause were preventable.  This information is passed to the journals for the benefit of those of us who go to the trouble of reading them.  This is something that should be known to the public.  It demonstrates the interest of the profession in this tragedy and it <Col N="1572" /> also places some obligation on those working at field level to keep records and to keep them in reasonable condition in case they would be asked to produce them for investigation.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to refer to is probably a more local one and is again due to the specialisation and, to a certain extent, regionalisation of hospital services.  I refer to the transport of patients to the various hospitals throughout the country.  This matter must be studied seriously and in great detail.  As I see it operating at the moment, I see patients having to get up at 5 a.m., travel to a collecting point and then travel to Dublin to be at a clinic at 10 or 11 a.m.  Such an arrangement is probably acceptable at this early stage of the development of the medical services and of regionalisation. It cannot be allowed to continue.  It is difficult to see an answer to it.  The patient could be taken to the hospital on the previous night but in that case it would mean occupying a hospital bed which might be needed for another purpose.</P>
    <P>The answer I would suggest is that clinics and outpatient services should be held at a later time of the day to accommodate these patients.  Naturally, this will involve more staff because it will probably mean a double clinic in the hospitals concerned throughout the day, but the Department will have to face up to this problem.  I do not think it is right to tell a patient that specialist services are available in Dublin and then to place this difficulty on them of getting there.  Much the same applies in relation to taking patients to Galway, which is another of our centres.  In that case the position is not quite as bad but difficulties do arise.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of transport is cost, particularly for the middle income group patient.  The patient in the lower income group has free transport service.  The patient in the middle income group may or may not have it, depending on the health board in whose region he resides.  In some places he has to pay and in others the service is subsidised for him.  There is not much attraction in a free health service if a patient has to pay, say, <Col N="1573" /> £5 to £10 once a fortnight or every three weeks in order to get to Dublin or elsewhere for specialist service.</P>
    <P>The situation is not so bad as it may sound by virtue of the fact that the health board helps such patients but the matter is one to which attention must be given.  Probably one answer would be to increase the £7 a year contribution to £7.50, the 50p to cover transport.  This would not be an excessive charge and the person concerned would be only too glad to pay it.</P>
    <P>Some of the hospitals to which these patients are sent are excellent in communicating with the family doctor. Others are poor enough.  There is one hospital in this city from which one cannot get any report.  This is not efficient; it is frustrating and causes a great deal of hardship, difficulty and worry to patients and their doctors. The result of inquiries suggests that there is not sufficient clerical staff to deal with this matter.  It is difficult to accept this as the complete answer. That may be a situation that exists for a short time.  Certainly the problem does not seem to arise in the case of other hospitals.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to building programmes in constituencies.  Our constituency has done reasonably well. It has had a contribution at Carrick-on-Shannon, a contribution in Roscommon and, at last, the hospital in Boyle is on its way.  Literature distributed here indicates that it is at the tender stage but, in fact, the foundation has been laid.  After 40 or 50 years the people of Boyle are pleased to see that their hospital is at last on its way.  It is well to put on record that at local level the people are grateful to the Minister for seeing that this has been finalised and that this problem has been taken off the books of the health board.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I find the document dealing with hospital regulations rather confusing and difficult to follow. One thing that strikes me is the emphasis laid on the difference between selection and appointment.  It is suggested that eventually Comhairle na nOspidéal will do the selection for <Col N="1574" /> both the health board and the voluntary hospitals.  Then the question of appointment arises.  Reading through the document, I was wondering what would be the situation if the person selected by Comhairle na nOspidéal was not appointed by the health body or by the voluntary hospitals.  Would there be mandamus proceedings against the voluntary hospital or the health board in that case, just as at the present time?  It could be inferred that there could be mandamus proceedings against the health board.  Would it be used against the voluntary hospitals?</P>
    <P>Then there is some discussion in the document as to where the specialist should be appointed to, whether to the regional hospital board and have his contract with them, or to the health board.  I suppose it depends on the hospital that the doctor serves and on whether he serves one hospital board or two hospital boards.</P>
    <P>This brings up the question of making consultants more available to hospitals and out-patient departments.  If that were done, it would take some of the pressure off the hospitals at out-patient level.  We certainly have not enough consultants or specialists throughout the country.  We need them at dental, ophthalmic and ear, nose and throat level.  I know one situation where the ENT specialist had to take over as his own house surgeon and registrar for a period.  He had too much to do, of course, and could not get around to doing the things he should have been doing.</P>
    <P>The amount of money involved by comparison with the overall Estimate should not reach more than £250,000. This would supply about 40 extra specialists, depending on their standing, or five to each health board.  This would take a lot of the pressure from the present consultants and hospital beds.  The idea could be developed whereby even the local hospital consultants would come to examine patients and it could be decided at that level whether the patients should be sent on to specialist units, such as chest and brain, in Dublin.  In that way pressure would be taken off those units because the waiting list for those places are reasonably long.  As things <Col N="1575" /> are, no matter what you do you find it much more difficult to shorten the waiting list because people are becoming so health conscious.</P>
    <P>The document I have been referring to also brings us to the problem aired already by Deputy Esmonde&mdash;the closing of hospitals.  Roscommon Hospital is one of those earmarked for closing or downgrading.  It is pointed out that the function of regional hospital boards would be to examine proposals for the closing or the continuing of hospitals.  The Minister has pointed out there must be a local investigation.</P>

      <P>Who makes the proposal for the downgrading of the hospital?  Would there be a legal obligation on one of those people to do so?  If there is no proposal on this matter, nobody will be in a position to make a decision on it.  We do not have to tell the Minister or his Department that the proposal to close or to downgrade those hospitals is causing a certain amount of anger in the various areas concerned, reaction in many cases being pretty violent.  The more one looks at them the more convinced one becomes that they cannot be downgraded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>They give an essential service.  I read last week an article by a commentator on medical services outside this country and he pointed out that medical services at GP and local level were first-class based on a population of 45,000 on a first-class general hospital.  This is more or less the set-up in our county hospitals at the present time and I feel it would be retrograde to reduce them in status.  In two or three years time it will be interesting, if it is possible, to analyse the increased cost of transport as a result of transferring patients to regional hospitals and then to project the further increased cost for the closing of those hospitals.  As I see it at the moment, it is reasonable to infer that this increased cost would cover necessary <Col N="1576" /> extra staffing in our hospital to bring it up to the standard suggested by FitzGerald as a minimum for the Letterkenny hospital.  After three or four years, the increased cost of transport that would arise by downgrading the Roscommon hospital would easily cover this extra staff.</P>
      <P>In a service so essential, this should be the view.  It must be accepted that there are a number of activities in the surgical and in the medical lines that could not be carried on in such hospitals, but these could be transferred to the specialised units.  Those of us who are working in the rest of Ireland outside the area of the Eastern Health Board from 1st October next will be faced with the fee for service.  In the documents I have been quoting from it is mentioned that there has been over-prescribing.  Nevertheless, I think the figures on the maternity and the infant mortality side being so low for 1971 indicate that the service given at that level was excellent.  I feel that the fee for service at that level is one of the things that helped to bring this about and I feel confident that the fact that the Department and the doctors have offered fee for service will help to improve the services as a whole.</P>
      <P>It is well that I should say in conclusion that the criticism offered of the Minister and the Department must be rejected because it is not true that the services are worse than they were. They have improved immensely.  When I started in the dispensary service the emphasis was on saving money.  There was always a check that you did not overspend or do this, that or the other. It has been suggested that it is a question of finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

      <P>In my experience no patient has been refused medical treatment on financial grounds, no matter to which income group he belonged. People in the middle income group have not been refused treatment and even people in the higher income group are accommodated.  If other health authorities in the past or health boards at the moment have acted otherwise, they have a different outlook from <Col N="1577" /> that of the Roscommon County Council in the past and the health board at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Estimate.  I am afraid we have our priorities all wrong.  We hear very little nowadays about the patient, the attention being devoted to hospital boards and regionalisation.  The present health services are practically non-existent in rural areas.  I think they are designed mainly for cities and larger towns.</P>
      <P>It seems obvious that people with vested interests in the health services should not be on boards administering those services.  Experience all over the country has proved this.  The basic idea of reorganising the services was to improve them.  As the position at present stands, the services have worsened considerably.  Programme managers, health boards and so on are all very fine but what is the use when the needy person cannot get the services he or she is entitled to?  Is that not what the health services are all about?  Recently I met a woman, the holder of a medical card.  She was crippled with arthritis and unable to walk.  She had been examined in a clinic and was told she would have to wait for 18 months or two years before gaining admission to a hospital. Eventually, in desperation and on the advice of a neighbour she consulted a well-known specialist in Dublin.  The woman was admitted to hospital immediately after her consultation with the specialist; she received treatment and underwent an operation.  When I met her last week she looked 20 years younger and was able to walk with the aid of a stick.</P>
      <P>I could give several examples but this is one striking case.  If that woman had waited for two years I do not think she would have responded so well to treatment, quite apart from the agony she would have suffered in the meantime.  She had a medical card but it was of no use to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many patients from areas outside Dublin are obliged to attend at out-patient clinics in the city.  If they are delayed for some reason and are late <Col N="1578" /> for their appointments they are sent home.  Surely it should be possible for specialists to see these patients in the afternoons so that their long journeys would not be in vain.  Patients attending at local clinics are obliged to wait many hours before they can see the doctor or specialist, although I realise this may not be the fault of the medical staff.  When one makes inquiries one is told that the doctor is attending an accident case or is in the theatre engaged in an emergency operation. However, this is a serious deficiency in the day to day operation of our health services.</P>
    <P>There is a serious shortage of dentists. In Roscommon County Council there is only one permanent and one part-time dentist.  I have received many complaints from people who are waiting for dental treatment and dentures. Last week I was told by a man that he had applied for dentures in 1969 and when I made representations on his behalf I was assured he would be called to the next clinic in his area. Unfortunately I could not be told when that clinic would be held.  This is an appalling state of affairs in 1972.</P>
    <P>In Roscommon we have only 19 dispensary doctors and five of them are living outside their areas.  All of them are doing their best but they are grossly overworked.  It is very difficult to expect doctors to come to an area where the county hospital is threatened with downgrading.  It is unfair to expect a doctor to accept responsibility for a seriously ill patient when he has not adequate hospital facilities.  If fewer doctors and specialists were engaged in administration work, if more were available to attend to patients, we would have better and less expensive services.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Department of Health are so unaware of the contribution of women to the health services.  Nurses are the largest group of professional personnel employed in the health services; they should and must be represented on Comhairle na nOspidéal and on the regional boards. Without the nurses there would not be any health services whatever.  No one else has knowledge of the domestic arrangements within the hospitals and <Col N="1579" /> it is time the nurses were allowed to take their place in the administration of the hospitals.  The Minister has an opportunity now to appoint them to the boards and I hope he will avail of it.  I have no doubt that if the nurses and other para-medical groups were consulted on the report regarding health services in Ireland we would have had a much better report.</P>
    <P>In Roscommon County Hospital accommodation should be increased and better provision made for the existing services.  Maternity accommodation in the county hospital is not being used to maximum capacity because of the shortage of medical staff.  Before Roscommon County Council lost control of the health services, they agreed to the appointment of extra medical staff for the hospital but this has not been sanctioned by the Department.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of the new 200-bed unit in the county home in Roscommon.  It is long overdue.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to compliment the Mercy nuns, the staff and doctors for the wonderful work they have carried out so cheerfully in such dismal surroundings.  I should also like to compliment the Minister on the fact that Boyle is at last getting a long-promised geriatric home.  I hope the work will be completed in a short time.  It is only proper that we should congratulate the staff who worked in the old hospital.  It was an eyesore and the conditions were appalling.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to allow health authorities to pay a contribution towards the maintenance of geriatric patients in local private nursing homes which are not approved for this purpose at the moment.  These homes give an excellent service to the community and they should be considered for such grants.</P>
    <P>The Health Estimate for 1972-73 mentions that provision is made under section 61 of the Health Act to provide for home help services This is an admirable idea and is something that I have been advocating for some time. However, the money being provided <Col N="1580" /> for the implementation of the services is grossly inadequate.  Perhaps in his reply the Minister will let me have details and the amount of money being allocated in respect of Roscommon and that he will let me know also whether there are any prospects of increasing this amount.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the necessity for reciprocal arrangements with the health authorities in England and to the question of qualification for superannuation purposes.  Such arrangements would encourage two-way movement of health personnel at all levels.  This necessity is highlighted by our entry to the EEC.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to give some consideration to the conditions regarding the training of physiotherapists.  This course is very expensive and while being trained the people concerned render valuable service to patients in hospitals for which they get no reward whatsoever, not even a meal.  The Minister might let us know when the building of the college for nurses is to commence and where it is to be located.  Perhaps he will let us know, too, what plans there are for colleges for other para-medical groups such as physiotherapists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This very important Estimate is one in which Deputies in all parties are deeply interested. I believe I speak for everybody here when I say that every encouragement is given to the Minister in the execution of the very important work of his Department.  To this extent we are happy to vote the necessary moneys to ensure that there will be adequate health services for our people.  Perhaps there is no other field of activity in which so many people are interested, whether in a professional or amateur way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who are in public life find that more problems are brought to our notice in respect of health than in respect of any other area of activity. Those of us who are in the Eastern Health Board area have noticed that since the setting up of the board the administration of health has not been <Col N="1581" /> as good as it should be or as good as it has been in the past.  Perhaps the reason for this is that the board have not really got off the ground yet. Those people who depend most on their local health services have been expressing dissatisfaction with the service as it has operated during the past two years.</P>
    <P>This is particularly so in Wicklow, where there is no general hospital. Health problems, even those of a minor nature, are referred to hospitals in Dublin so that a person's first experience of the operation of the health board is his transfer by ambulance from Wicklow to Dublin.  This brings me to the question of the ambulance service.  This service is not what it should be.  There have been improvements recently in the ambulances used by the health board and by the county council but in respect of those vehicles that are contracted from private individuals or firms there is room for much improvement in the type of vehicles and in their general roadworthiness.  All too often on my journeys here I encounter ambulances which I would describe as glorified vans, painted white and with the word &ldquo;ambulance&rdquo; on the outside.  It could not help a patient very much to be taken, perhaps, 60 miles in such vehicles and that is the distance that some people would have to travel to Dublin from isolated parts of Wicklow.  The Minister should introduce minimum standards for ambulances.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is no general hospital in Wicklow means that most patients from there are transferred to Dublin.  In the north Wicklow area, we have been shocked to learn of the decision to discontinue the maternity section at St. Columcille's Hospital. During the past year 1,000 babies were delivered at that hospital and at least 600 of the mothers concerned were from the north Wicklow area.  Maternity patients will now be transferred to Dublin for the delivery of their babies and then returned to St. Columcille's Hospital for a period of recuperation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have much apprehension about any such plans and I would ask the Minister to have regard to the opinions of the people in that area.  Maternity patients would have no wish to have to travel to the city to have their babies delivered.  On the radio today we heard that there was a traffic jam of 1½ miles on the Black-rock Road.  That would be one hazard that an expectant mother would have to worry about on her way to Dublin. I appeal to the Minister to look at this problem.  On behalf of patients from my area I want to say to the Minister that this would not be a very satisfactory change.  If it is at all possible I would ask him to leave the arrangement as it stands at the moment.</P>
      <P>At least 30 per cent of the population of Wicklow are covered by medical cards.  During the past year or so it was felt that an attempt was being made to reduce that figure.  Therefore the decision of the health board to lay down income limits for people applying for medical cards is welcome.  Although the limits of £11 for a single person living with relatives, perhaps, and £16 for a married couple without children are reasonably low, at least they are limits and we now know when a person is eligible for a medical card.</P>
      <P>The limits are low.  For example, a married road worker or agricultural worker with no children would not be entitled to a medical card if he lived in a low-rent cottage.  Very many of these individuals and married couples had medical cards in the past.  They may now find that they will be deprived of them.  In other cases the limit taken in conjunction with the rent paid will mean that a number of people who have been deserving of medical cards for a long time, people living in highrent houses and flats, will be able at long last to claim medical cards.  We as public representatives will be able to explain to the many people who come to us asking about eligibility what the requirements are and what the limits are for medical cards in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" /> We now have wage round increases at yearly intervals.  These phased increases should be taken into account and the eligibility limits should be increased. Account should also be taken of the decrease in the value of money. We are aware that in the past three years the value of money has diminished by approximately 9 per cent annually.  I would hope that the health board would take this factor into account and that they would take note of the national wage agreements which are now a feature of wage increases and that the limit for medical card holders will be increased regularly by amounts approximating to the increases granted in phased agreements.</P>
    <P>Since he became Minister for Health the Minister has concerned himself with improving the standards of hospitals which care for the mentally handicapped. I welcome the fact that at long last it has been agreed to provide accommodation in the psychiatric hospital in Newcastle for a school for moderately mentally handicapped children. The lay people who strove so hard for so long to achieve this are to be complimented.  They picketed and they badgered the Minister to do this and they availed of every opportunity to bring the plight of the moderately mentally handicapped children in Wicklow to the notice of the Minister. Previously children living in the southern part of Wicklow were transferred to Kilkenny and those living in the eastern and northern parts of Wicklow were transferred to Dublin.  It is of advantage to the children themselves that this accommodation is now available in Newcastle.  It is now possible for the parents to bring the children home in the evenings so that they can live with the other children who are more mentally handicapped children to the mentally handicapped children that they are not far removed from family life.</P>
    <P>The local office of the Eastern Regional Health Board in Wicklow is understaffed.  In an area the size of Wicklow the senior officer is overworked, in my view.  I visit the office on many occasions and it is almost impossible to get the ear of that man. <Col N="1584" /> He always seems to have a desk full of problems.  He has to deal with the various hospitals in Wicklow and he has not got adequate staff available. People who were seconded from the local authority service to the health boards in areas like Wicklow, which are removed from the central offices, have been overlooked with regard to staffing and office space.  We see in the newspapers the number of tenders which are placed regularly by the health boards and it seems to me that the Wicklow area is being completely overlooked in this respect.  A separate office with adequate staff should be set up in Wicklow.  The present office is in a very dingy little room in the county council offices at Kilmantan Hill.</P>
    <P>The county home in Rathdrum in Wicklow for a long number of years has been totally inadequate in size and because of its age.  The staff of that home have worked under the most atrocious conditions for far too long. After a very long struggle I believe it has been decided to rebuild the county home.  I hope the Minister will see that this project is speeded up because another winter will expose not only the patients but the people who work in the county home to the most primitive conditions from the point of view of weather. Visiting the county home leaves a very dismal impression of the plight of the old people there.  This is particularly true of the male section.  The female section is relatively modern, dating back to the 1940s; the male section dates back well over 100 years to the old union.  I appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power to see that the new building is commenced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I would not be in order in discussing the effect of the health charges on the rates.  An urban council in Wicklow was liquidated for its refusal to strike the health rate.  I hope now the Minister will advise the Government to change the system of funding the health services.</P>
    <P>With regard to the contribution of the health board towards nursing homes which cater for post-operative patients, a recently opened home in my town <Col N="1585" /> has discovered that the maximum contribution sanctioned is £1 to £1.50 per day per patient.  This is a very small sum, indeed, when one remembers the high cost of running these institutions. Patients will not use these nursing homes if the contribution they have to pay is too high.  The charge to the patient is £3 per day.  They will opt to remain in hospital, occupying beds which could be used for more urgent cases.  A more generous contribution will solve this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister has endeavoured to bring to the notice of the public the dangers of smoking and his efforts in this regard are appreciated.  It is most important that young people should be warned of the dangers to their health if they smoke.  I am a non-smoker.  It is difficult to give up a habit, but there are smokers who give up smoking for Lent.  But even the strongest willed find difficulty in giving up smoking.  The best approach is to get at the children and to make smoking appear to them an unattractive habit.  Using sportsmen to drive home the lesson is a splendid idea because young people are interested in football, hurling, soccer, rugby and so on, and they will listen to what the leading exponents of these various sports tell them.  This is the best way to get at the young.  Unfortunately, young people seem to start smoking earlier now.  They begin in the primary school. That is the level at which they should be discouraged.  Parents should be exhorted not to smoke in the presence of their children.  I doubt if people are frightened into giving up smoking.  Encouragement not to start the habit is the best approach.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse is a serious problem.  It is difficult to detect drugs being brought into the country and all the evidence is that drug-taking is increasing.  I doubt if the problem will ever reach the proportions it has reached in Britain. Nevertheless, it is a problem that must be watched closely.  There is need for vigilance in the schools.  A team of specially qualified teachers travelling around the country to the different schools to help and advise both the children and the parents would be a very good idea because it is most important <Col N="1586" /> that parents should be educated and should understand the problem. We do not want a repetition of the attitudes people had towards tuberculosis many years ago when they endeavoured to hide the disease until it got out of hand and they were compelled to call for help; in the initial stages they were frightened of what the neighbours would say.  There is danger of the same situation developing with drugs and parents should be made aware of what they should do if they think their children are taking drugs. This problem is not confined to Dublin and that is why I say this team should travel around the country to advise parents.  Naturally, this would be done in confidence.</P>

      <P>Some of the criticisms I have heard of the Minister were completely unfounded and for that reason I am prompted to say a few words on this important Estimate. I was appalled to hear Deputy O'Connell producing unconfirmed figures in relation to the number of Irishwomen seeking abortions in Britain.</P>

      <P>I had just begun to say how appalled I was by some of the statements made by the Labour spokesman on health.  These bingo politicians put their hands into a bag, draw out a number and then give unconfirmed figures to the House.  The unconfirmed figure Deputy O'Connell gave of the number of Irishwomen proceeding to England to have abortions is a grave injustice to Irish womanhood.  As the Minister pointed out, there has been no factual survey to back up those figures.  If this type of thing is to develop the women of this country will be branded in the same way as Irishmen have been branded in relation to drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not so and, as the Minister rightly pointed out, statistics given should be backed up in a factual way. This has not happened.  It is pathetic. I wonder if it was not an advertising campaign by Deputy O'Connell and <Col N="1587" /> the Labour Party for those clinics. Who is sending those people out of the country?  Can they produce evidence that they went or where they went to, seeing they know so much about it?  Perhaps those people are somewhat responsible for some of the traffic.

Maybe this is a plank for the new coalition group, seeing that Deputy Begley was so anxious to call for a House when a Member of the Labour Party was under fire.  We know that unwanted pregnancies are a problem here as in other countries, but the advertising here of the type of legalised murder that operates in Britain is deplorable and it is a grave injustice to Irishwomen.  I do not believe it operates to the extent we are expected to believe.  It is only good cash customers who can be accommodated because the ordinary person here could not afford to send his wife or girlfriend over there.  This is an advertising campaign for some of those clinics in London and elsewhere.  If the Labour Party have figures let them back them up.  I hope that those political quacks who claim to have a cure for everything from bald heads to bunions, when they are in power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I referred to the scandalous insult to Irish womanhood which was made yesterday in relation to unconfirmed figures regarding the number of abortions in this country. Those bingo politicians who put their hands in a bag, draw out a number and use it at random in order to get the headlines disregard the effect on Irishwomen. The finger will be pointed at Irishwomen from now on because of this statement.  I do not think it is correct.  When people quote figures they should be in a position to confirm them.</P>
      <P>There might be various reasons for this because, naturally enough, the people who want to avail of the service must have the cash to pay for it.  Now, after having deplored this statement, I want to refer to other matters which I feel are important.  As has been stated, this could be a reflection on some doctors.  The Labour Party spokesman on health carried out another attack on the nuns in St. Vincent's and questioned how they would spend their money.  These nuns are doing and have done a good job over the years and it is their own business how they spend their money as long as they give a good service.  Nobody asks doctors or politicians how they spend their money but the religious groups in this country have to be attacked with regard to how they spend their money.  The Sisters in St. Vincent's Hospital and in other hospitals have worked without pay over the years and the reference which was made to them was despicable.</P>

      <P>It is necessary that more people would take an interest in the general health and welfare of the community.  More voluntary effort is required.  We have far too many people running away from their responsibilities in regard to the old.  Sons and daughters allow their parents to go into institutions and never visit them.  I visited many of them in the Deputy's area and this was the complaint of many of them in a particular institution in Rathdrum.  They were there for years and their families had not visited them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just pointing out that there are old people who have given good service to the country and to their families and they are now rejected and pushed into institutions. Their families have no interest whatsoever in them.  If it was not for the good sisters down there and many voluntary organisations, these people would be very lonely.  The voluntary organisations which visit those people are doing very good work.  It is a pity we have not more of them because if there were more people with this spirit we would have a much happier group of old people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The families of those old people should be ashamed of themselves for not visiting them.  I was a member of a hospital board in this city and a doctor told me of a case where a daughter put her mother into a hospital for a short period so that she could get treatment. That woman had to be brought to her home by ambulance because this daughter, after being asked to collect her mother several times, did not do so.  The hospital required the bed for a very ill person and this woman was cured.  When the ambulance arrived at the door the daughter said: &ldquo;This is not my mother.&rdquo;  The unfortunate <Col N="1591" /> woman said to her daughter &ldquo;Take me in, Mary.  Do not let me go back to the hospital&rdquo;.  That woman was turned away by her own daughter.  There is too much of this happening.  I want to deplore the fact that there are so many people in institutions who have families in good positions, who have plenty of cash but once they get them off their hands they are no longer concerned about the welfare of their aged parents. It is only voluntary organisations which are prepared to visit hospitals who can save those people many lonely hours.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister for Health has made efforts over the years to ensure that there are institutions to which those people can go.  We find in a report which the Minister gave us some time ago in relation to geriatrics that there were schemes in progress on the 1st of November, 1971, at Castlebar for two 58 bed units, Roscommon four 50 bed units, Sligo five bed units, Ennis 86 beds, Kilrush 45 beds, Tullamore 100 beds, Longford 69 beds, Listowel, Mountmellick, Thurles, central heating and additional facilities. On the last page we have quite a long list showing in Bray a 40 bed social home; Monaghan, a 40 bed social home, Nenagh, Roscrea, Midleton and Dungarvan, in Manorhamilton, Newcastle West, Westport, Birr and Dundalk 40 bed social units.  In Rathdrum there is accommodation for 100 chronic sick patients, in Baltinglass a 31 bed geriatric unit, Boyle 52 beds and an 11 staff bed unit, Dungarvan a 100 bed unit, Cavan a 100 bed unit, Waterford voluntary agencies 43 beds, St. Ita's Newcastle West, 100 beds. This gives an indication of the type of man the Minister is and of his concern for this section of the community who have been so long neglected and who have done so much for this country.</P>
    <P>Much money has been expended for this purpose and much money will be expended, and this is one aspect of policy on which nobody can disagree with the Minister.  His efforts in relation to home help services and the other services are very creditable.  As a result of the interest displayed by the Minister in relation to the aged, many people have turned their attention <Col N="1592" /> from other sections to the aged.  I hope that as a result of reading these reports, which will indicate that there are still lonely people to be assisted and visited many more people will, through these great voluntary organisations, spare suffering and misery to these unfortunate people.  The sisters of the various orders who are doing this important work deserve credit and not criticism.</P>
    <P>Apart from those in institutions, hospitals and social homes, there are many old people outside who are unaware of the services to which they are entitled.  I know the Minister has endeavoured in many ways to indicate to this particular section the many benefits that are available to them but has not succeeded in many cases.  Because of their age and in some cases because of loss of memory either in a mild or severe form, they are liable to forget and to be far removed from people who could impart information to them.  I would suggest that, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister should arrange that all the benefits that would be available to people over 70 would be included on a slip in the old age pension book.  This is a book they keep safe and I believe that, as in the case of the travel service, if this additional information could be provided in relation to other services or an indication given as to where they could get information in relation to the services, it would be preferable to having to run to public representatives and other people for this purpose.  The information provided on television and in the circulars sent out by the Minister would not appear to be enough.  An individual approach to people is necessary and, therefore, it would be desirable to have some type of document which could be inserted in an old age pension book or a widow's pension book.</P>
    <P>Once again I want to pay a special tribute to the voluntary organisations who participate in the meals on wheels service and the other services which look after old people.  No thanks of mine would do justice to the wonderful work of these voluntary organisations. In the area which I represent there is a very effective organisation controlling <Col N="1593" /> the meals on wheels service which ensures that old people can have a hot meal at home in the surroundings to which they are accustomed rather than in an institution.  The fact that these organisations are unpaid is all the more reason why we should pay tribute to them.</P>
    <P>The efforts made by the Minister in relation to the mentally handicapped are indicated in the progress report on the projects outlined in the documents which have been circulated to Deputies. This report is just as extensive as the one in relation to geriatrics.  When we see the full list here of the extensions and the major building projects under construction we realise the Minister has been criticised unfairly, and that the people who have criticised him know little about the problems involved.  In relation to major hospital building projects to cater for the mentally handicapped, there is one for a new 84-bed unit, staff hostel, workshop and recreation room at Peamount Hospital, Newcastle; at Stewart's Hospital, Palmerstown, a 24-bed unit for children to relieve overcrowding; St. Patrick's, Kilkenny, adaptations to existing buildings and new staff chalets; Monasterevan, a 60-bed unit and a 50-bed unit; Celbridge, a 60-bed unit; Roscrea, a scheme for adaptations; Sligo, a 60-bed unit.  This is an indication that the mentally handicapped are not forgotten.</P>
    <P>There is also a great deal of construction work being done in relation to mental hospitals, for instance, in Ballinasloe, Castlebar, Carlow, Clonmel, Cork, Ennis, Enniscorthy, Mullingar, Portrane and Sligo.  These all have works in progress or works which have been completed in the not too distant past.  At Usher's Island, there are adaptation works to provide a unit for disturbed adolescents and drug abusers.  I am very happy in the knowledge that so much is being done with the resources which are available.  I am glad to think that there is the prospect that, with our entry into the Common Market, the nation will prosper, that more services will be made available and that we can have better accommodation in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> In relation to the voluntary hospital schemes completed, apparently it is necessary to recite them because of the criticisms that have been made.  The major hospital projects completed since 1st April, 1970, are given in the first page of this document supplied to Deputies together with the schemes in progress from 1st November and the schemes under construction.  As we read down&mdash;to contradict those who argue that little or nothing is being done&mdash;we see the new St. Vincent's Hospital at Elm Park, extensions of the Mater Hospital, St. Michael's, Dún Laoghaire, Jervis Street Hospital, the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Sir Patrick Dun's, Ballyshannon, County Donegal, Temple Street, Dublin, the Rehabilitation Centre, Dún Laoghaire, the North Charitable Infirmary in Cork, the National Rehabilitation Board, Dublin, St. Mary's School for the Deaf at Stillorgan. This indicates forward thinking in relation to the problems and shows clearly that the Department are with it and have done a wonderful job with the resources available.</P>
    <P>There are one or two items on which I should like to comment, one of which is the National Rehabilitation Centre, Dún Laoghaire, therapeutic swimming pool.  I would like to know from the Minister if therapeutic swimming pools will be provided in other centres, because St. John of God's at Islandbridge have just completed a pool and are seeking financial assistance towards the outlay.  This pool has been designed for therapeutic purposes and should get some type of grant and I would ask the Minister specially to consider the situation in relation to this school.  I have seen the school.  Portion of it has been set aside for this purpose but at the same time it can be utilised for other purposes and I should ask the Minister to see if his Department could make a contribution towards this pool.  If he has not already information about it, I am quite certain that the information can be supplied and he will be welcome to visit this centre at any time to see for himself the wonderful work done there for the mentally retarded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> At this stage the therapeutic pool is only one factor but it is a very important factor from their point of view because if they got some financial assistance, they could proceed with other developments which are both necessary and desirable.  I would point out that this school caters not alone for children from Dublin city but children from Meath and areas outside Dublin city and county, and for that reason the Minister would be well advised to have a look at this very important development and see the efficiency and foresight shown in the development of the structures there to ensure that every pupil of that school will have an opportunity to participate freely, irrespective of his condition, in the services available.  The wonderful work done at the St. John of God's school is something which must be appreciated.</P>
    <P>In relation to medical cards, there would appear to be some confusion on the part of the public in relation to their issue.  I understand that there are certain substandard areas in this city where people have applied for a choice of doctor and have been refused. They feel it is because they live in substandard areas.  This is a matter which the Minister should investigate, if people in Mountpleasant Buildings or other substandard areas have been refused for a particular panel.  If this practice does exist, and I have no reason to believe that it does not because the person who told me stated that he had been refused, the Minister should take immediate action to ensure that no section of this community is deprived of services to which it is entitled.</P>
    <P>I close by congratulating the Minister on his foresight and his understanding of the problem and the manner in which he has dealt with health authorities and health boards and Deputies who approach him on health service matters.  That he is courteous and considerate and has full knowledge of the problems is undeniable.  I am happy to see the progress made and the prospect of continued progress in the programmes for the future which indicate a greater move forward than <Col N="1596" /> in the past.  I hope the Minister gets his fair share of finance to ensure that the services which are weak at the moment will be strengthened and that the Minister's desires in relation to development will be achieved.  I am certain that, with the Minister's thought and knowledge, we can have as good services, if not better services, as in most countries.</P>

      <P>Before I deal with the Estimate, there is one point which should be made straight away in relation to the refugees who came from Northern Ireland in the last week or so and who are housed by some authority, whether the Eastern Health Board or the Department in Griffith Barracks.  I happened to be asked to go down there last night to see the conditions into which these people were put and it was a matter of eternal shame to me that any institution in this country could put people in to live in such conditions.  On the top floor of an old building in the barracks, there were three housewives from Belfast who had formed a movement for peace and who through no fault of their own were pressurised out of Belfast.  They came to Dublin because the strain was too much, bullets having been put through their windows because of the peace initiative they started.  With 13 or 14 children, they were put into this den in Griffith Barracks and it was appalling to see the conditions in which they were asked to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This evening Deputy Cooney, Deputy Harte and I made other arrangements for these people so that they would be taken out straight away.  I would like to put on record that if we have any more of these people, if any more of them come South, at least proper arrangements will be made for them.  They should not be asked to live in the type of den they were put into, a stinking locality where there is a dump, with bedclothes soiled and dirty and with no water and no sanitary facilities. The whole thing was too disgraceful to mention and it was all to our eternal shame.  We were mortified when we met these people to see for ourselves the conditions they were <Col N="1597" /> asked to live in.  Some charitable organisation&mdash;I do not know the name of it but Deputy Cooney has it&mdash;have now offered to put these people into a caravan site at Bettystown where they will be kept for the next fortnight or so beside the sea and I hope they will have a happy time.  If it was the Eastern Health Board who were responsible, I hope that if any more people come here, this place will be closed up and we will never again see the likes of it.</P>
    <P>Speaking about health boards in general, it is true to say that these boards are causing very grave concern up and down the country.  What is causing most concern is that it seems a vested interest has taken control of these boards and the question now arises whether it was right and proper to put professional people along with elected representatives on them.  People are asking the question: are these vested interests watching themselves and protecting themselves?  I think it was a retrograde step that the ordinary council authorities who were the health authorities for the different counties were abolished.  The only time these councils are now consulted is on estimates day when they are presented with a bill, sometimes in the region of £2 million, and asked to provide that money straight away.  I think this is unethical.  If a local authority is to give £2 million to any board at least the CEO of that board should be present at the estimates meeting and explain to the elected representatives of the ratepayers how this money is going to be spent.</P>
    <P>On the health boards you have so many elected representatives and so many appointed by the Minister.  It is great for some of these people who are appointed by the Minister to come forward with grandiose schemes.  In fact, as far as the Southern Health Board are concerned they have got so grand now that they would not even sit in the chamber of the Kerry County Council to have their meeting.  They had to go to a room in the Brandon Hotel.  This is the type of expenditure which the ratepayers of Kerry and Cork detest.  The council chamber was good enough for county councillors to hold their meetings in it down through the <Col N="1598" /> years but doctors, the chemists and professional gentlemen did not see fit to sit in it and discuss the agenda of the Southern Health Board meeting.  When health boards reach that standard of extravagance it is about time the Minister stepped in and said to them: &ldquo;You have only so much money to spend.  Spend it in a proper and efficient way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the health board you have a chief executive officer, a finance officer, a personnel officer, a planning and evaluation officer.  Then there are programme managers&mdash;a programme manager for community care, for special hospital care and for general hospital care.  The programme manager for community care must have support staff.  Then there is the director of community care services and then the administrative staff of the director.  Then there are health inspectors, assistance officers and social workers.  There are the support staff of the programme manager.  There is the director of district mental services and the director of district geriatric services.  Then there are the support staff of the director of district mental health and so on.  It is no wonder that, in answer to a question, the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board said that 50 per cent of the total costs of that board were for administration purposes.  This is a disgrace. Every £1 that is given to a person for drugs or other assistance costs 10s to give.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will not, then he is not in any position to contradict me.  When a Minister comes into this House and says he is not prepared to do research, he is not prepared to believe, it shows the type of arrogance that is being handed out from the Department of Health to the ordinary people.  It is a well-known fact that a county manager now earns less than a chief executive officer and it is true to say that some of these chief executive officers were only secretaries to county managers.  We are reaching a stage at which health authorities will say: &ldquo;Stop.  We are not going to pay any more.&rdquo;  Possibly there will be other local authorities abolished as Dublin Corporation and Bray Council were.  Many more will follow if this continues.  To prove that point I will refer again to this new board refusing to sit in a room in the Kerry County Council chamber because it was not grand enough&mdash;a room where meetings of the council have been held for 50 years.</P>
      <P>With regard to the contribution of £7, people in different parts of the country are now complaining that their medical cards are being taken from them and that to qualify for a medical card now your application must go through a computer.  Formerly there was the personal touch: an assistance officer called to the house to examine the means, to see if there was any particular difficulty in a household, to see whether a father or mother was suffering from diabetes or heart disease, whether a child was retarded in some way or whether the family was having hard luck due to the death of a parent or something of that nature. All that has gone.  We have now reached the computer stage as far as the medical card is concerned.  You fill in your application form, say that you have seven cows, 25 sheep, a couple of in-calf heifers and a few lambs.  This is fed into the computer to decide whether you qualify or not. We are reaching the stage where we will have a mechanical man coming into this House to handle legislation if this type of thing is not halted in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that only the middle-income <Col N="1600" /> group must pay this £7, but we hear of people having their medical card taken away and having to pay the £7.  If they are ill they will not call a doctor because that will cost another two guineas.  This will mean that we will have people going into hospital who, if their illness was diagnosed in time, would not have to do so.  Therefore, we will have more illness than we had in the past.</P>
    <P>Those of us in this House who are not members of health boards have no way of getting information in regard to persons in need of a medical card or in need of hospitalisation or disability benefit because, as he said, earlier tonight, the Minister refuses to answer petty little problems.  They may be petty problems as far as the Minister and the staff of the Department of Health are concerned but they are very big problems to the individual concerned. It would appear that the Minister and his staff are moving further away from the man in the street.  The Minister would not even go to the trouble of writing to a health board giving the reason for the delay in issuing a disability benefit or medical card or in admitting a patient to hospital.  The Minister would not bother to do it.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy who puts down a question to the Minister in regard to a particular case does so because the information was not forthcoming from the health board in the first instance. The Minister is not interested in medical card holders or persons in receipt of disability benefit or home assistance.  The questions would not be put to the Minister but for the fact that persons had been treated by the board in a certain manner.  When a Deputy writes to a board he will get a letter back after 14 or 15 days to the effect that the matter is under consideration and, unless he writes another letter, he will hear nothing further about the matter.  These are things that the Minister does not want to hear about. The Minister should climb down off his high horse.  When a question is put to him by a Deputy about a case he should have the courtesy and the decency to have the necessary investigation carried out and a reply issued. <Col N="1601" /> Everybody knows that if an individual is deprived of the dole or the old age pension or other social welfare payment the Minister for Social Welfare always has the matter investigated and tells the House the reason and it is always accepted in good faith.  The Minister for Health should reply to questions put to him in the same way as other Ministers reply to questions affecting their Departments.</P>
    <P>There is the question of dispensary appointments.  There is a regulation in the book now which states that a doctor must be two years resident in Ireland before he qualifies for appointment. That is a disgraceful situation.  There are many young doctors who went to America, Canada and London, in order to educate themselves in various aspects of medicine and who are now deprived of the opportunity of applying for positions as dispensary doctor or temporary dispensary doctor under the various health boards.  The Minister should provide that any man who graduated from an Irish university, who has the necessary degrees and qualifications and who went abroad to improve his medical knowledge will not be victimised when a position becomes available here.  If there was ever a vested interest, this is certainly a vested interest of doctors in this country.  The sooner that clause is deleted the better it will be for all concerned.</P>

      <P>Since the new boards began to operate, the waiting list for admission to extern hospitals seems to have grown.  No one knows the reason for this.  I thought the Minister would give an explanation as to how the situation arose and why it is being allowed to continue.  I do not know why the waiting period can be as long as six months.  The Minister might do a bit of research on this and be able to remedy the position.  He has the power.  A comparison should be made of the waiting lists for extern hospitals now and in 1968 before the health boards were established.  There is great criticism throughout the country that operation cases should have to wait so long.  The Minister might let me know the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give a bigger grant to voluntary institutions caring for mentally handicapped children. In Beaufort, County Kerry, the nuns have given magnificent service. It is not right that these nuns should have to seek assistance from voluntary organisations who have to organise raffles, whist drives and so on, to raise money for this purpose.  That system is wrong.  These voluntary institutions give magnificent service and ease the burden on parents of retarded children. They should not have to beg in order to meet their financial requirements. It is a disgrace that this should be the case.  The Minister might empower the health board to help these <Col N="1603" /> institutions or give a special grant towards them from the Hospitals Trust Fund.  There are many institutions in the country who are in financial difficulty. The Minister should authorise the health boards to give grants to these institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister has been good enough to give that information, he should inform the Kerry County Council that they have the authority to give the grant to these institutions which have given such magnificent service.  Until this home was built in Kerry we were on the waiting list of other homes outside the county and I am sure some of these had their own children to look after.  I do not know whether Kerry County Council have the authority to give a grant to make ends meet for those people; perhaps the Minister could tell me?  It is not good enough to have them going around cap in hand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was mentioned here before and I think the Minister should tell the House whether the increase of 50 per cent by the <Col N="1604" /> voluntary hospitals is to be the only one this year.  I do not blame the Minister for this increase because the cost of living has gone up on ourselves as well as on voluntary hospitals but there should be special concessions for those in the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme.  These people budgeted for so much at the beginning of the year and some of them now find it very hard to keep up their contributions.  The Voluntary Health Insurance provides a service to a certain number of people, as the Minister pointed out.  Perhaps he could give them an assurance that this is the only increase that will be imposed by these institutions this year?  Such an assurance would be welcomed by everyone in the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme.</P>
      <P>There is one point I should like the Minister to clarify in regard to the hospitals health regulations.  It arises in Statutory Instrument No. 31 of 1972: Health, published by the Stationery Office.  On page 8 under the heading: Resignation of Membership it says:</P>
      <P>The Minister on the request of the health board may at any time terminate the appointment of a member of the committee who is appointed by the board.</P>
      <P>What does that mean?  Is it a veiled threat to a man on the board who asks awkward questions, who stands up to the doctors and the chemists and becomes such a nuisance that they decide by majority vote that he must go?  If that is so, it is a retrograde step that the Minister should have the power to get rid of any man because he was a thorn in the board's side.  If that is the case we are slipping into dictatorship.  It also states:</P>
      <P>A member of the committee may resign his membership by giving notice in writing signed by him to the committee but the resignation shall not become effective until the meeting of the committee held next after the receipt of the notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The membership of a committee of a person appointed or elected by virtue of his holding a particular <Col N="1605" /> appointment or having a particular qualification shall terminate if he ceases to hold that appointment or have that qualification.</P>
    <P>The Minister on the request of the health board may at any time terminate the appointment of a member of the committee who is appointed by the board.</P>
    <P>If that is not a threat to an individual who has the decency, honesty and integrity to stand up to the establishment, I do not know what it is.  It is a monstrous suggestion and it is monstrous to have it put in black and white that the Minister with a stroke of a pen may tell a man that he is no longer wanted even though it does not specify whether he has committed some crime or not.  This is not good enough: this House cannot pass such a regulation. The Minister and his advisers should be ashamed of themselves to allow such a thing to appear in print.  Perhaps we would reach the stage when, if a member was a member of a political party and disagreed with everybody on the board, the fact that he was a member of a political party might lead the others to say: &ldquo;We will vote him out.&rdquo;  A man in his heart might think certain things should be said publicly and, perhaps, because he had the guts to say what he believed, he would &ldquo;get the hammer&rdquo; for expressing his opinions.</P>
    <P>This threat is, I think, unconstitutional. The Minister, when replying, should allay fears that any man going on a health board and appointed by the board will not be pushed out because he might disagree with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very foolish to dismiss a man in these days for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>But it does not state the reason why his appointment may be terminated.  If the Minister would give specific reasons why that man should be dumped from the board and spell them out clearly, I would accept his word.  Perhaps the Minister would like to tell me now before I develop the point further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The elected members are in a majority on the health boards so that I do not think it would be <Col N="1606" /> possible for elected members to agree to the dismissal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that a man might have a fight with the doctors, and when some of the elected members of the boards meet the doctors, it is a case of &ldquo;Yes, doctor&rdquo; and &ldquo;No, doctor&rdquo;; &ldquo;We will have a jar together, doctor&rdquo; and this poor devil before he knows what is happening, because he does not fall in with the whole clique is voted out.  And there are cliques on some of these boards, no doubt about it; some of these boards are the biggest cliques that were ever formed in this country.  As far as some of them are concerned, we have reached the stage of going back to the days of good old Queen Bess when the governors of the workhouses visited the patients for the Christmas dinner, when the lords and ladies would walk up and down and then it would appear in the paper that the patients had turkey and ham for their dinner at Christmas and were visited by the governors of the board. We are reaching that stage again. I thought we had got beyond it and that the hospitals would be run by the ordinary people.</P>
      <P>I do not know the thinking behind this particular rule, that the Minister on the request of the health board may at any time terminate the appointment of a member of the committee who is appointed by the board.  If reasons were given why his appointment was being terminated I would be satisfied.  The Minister has not given me a reason but I think the ordinary people are entitled to know the reason.  Any member on the board should be told the reason for his disqualification.  Is it that he might disagree with him, that he might not drink with him, is it because he might have different politics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the reason should be given.  I thank the Deputy for bringing the matter to my attention. By itself it does not look right. When I looked through the regulations I was concerned so much with the character of the people to be appointed that, frankly, I did not notice this phrase.  It may be due to some old habit or custom in relation to other advisory boards.  I will look into the matter.  In most cases where these <Col N="1607" /> removals are indicated the reasons are specified, for misconduct or something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very surprised that this phrase got through.  I wish to thank the Minister for what he has said.  In his statement the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Some health boards questioned the timing for the establishment of these bodies and suggested that the proposed regulations be deferred for some years, until the new administration under the health boards had settled down.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have given more thought to this matter.  Maybe he had his reasons but he did not state them clearly.  If at times I seemed critical, I am sure the Minister will appreciate that there was nothing personal in my criticism.  I realise that the Minister is doing his best in this important work. I thank him for his assurance that he will get rid of the regulation regarding the appointment of members to the committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House unduly because I realise that other Members may wish to speak on this subject.  The Minister is doing very good work in his important Department and he has carried out a thorough study regarding the health services necessary for this country. He has studied the various systems operating in Europe and has tried to give us the best health service we can afford.</P>
      <P>Our country is not large and, with the exception of Dublin, our population is scattered.  The Minister is doing his best to ensure that people living in rural Ireland get as good a service as those living in built-up areas.  I do not agree with the last speaker when he stated we are going back to the workhouse days.  This is a dreadful slur on our medical staffs and all those engaged in health services.  We must be critical, but it is overcritical for a person to say that we are going back to the workhouse days where the unfortunate patients only got a good meal at Christmas.  It was an unfair comment and should not have been uttered here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> If one looks through the Minister's statement, one can see how vast has been the expenditure on our health services and that it is anticipated more will be required.  The people must pay for the services.  It is easy for a Member to say on the one hand that enough it not being done and, on the other hand, that the health services are costing too much.  I have been at many county council meetings and I know that for 364 days of the year some people are crying out for better services but they have not the courage to pass the rate in order to provide these services.  If many of these people got their way, the health services would be even more expensive.  It is the duty of the State to ensure that adequate health services are provided for all its citizens, to ensure that the lifespan of citizens is not shortened by one day because of lack of attention. Irish men and women are among some of the best doctors, nurses and social workers in the world.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about who should qualify for medical cards but this is a difficult problem to tackle.  Some people have the idea that certain information is fed into a computer and that a decision regarding qualifications for a medical card is made accordingly.  In each health board area there are superintendent home assistance officers and if an applicant for a medical card is not satisfied with the way his claim has been processed, he can meet the superintendent who will explain the position to him.  Applicants can get information regarding qualification for a medical card from public representatives or the superintendent home assistance officers.  A hardship clause can be applied in certain instances. People should not think that their applications are dealt with by computers; there is the human touch and this is essential.  If applications were dealt with by means of a computer, there would be nothing to stop the applicant from giving incorrect information. The home assistance officers can visit the people and check on the information.</P>
    <P>However, there is one instance I should like to bring to the Minister's <Col N="1609" /> notice.  Where wages have increased as a result of a wage round, sometimes the medical card is taken from the father of a household.  In many cases the man may have three or four schoolgoing children.  If the medical card is withdrawn, I do not think that the headmaster will give any allowance with regard to school books.  I think that in the assessment of qualification for medical cards account should be taken of the cost of school books and other similar expenses and the amount involved should be deducted from the applicant's income.</P>
    <P>Some farmers with small and medium-sized holdings find it difficult to complete medical card application forms.  In many cases they ask the manager of the local creamery to fill in the form stating their income from milk in the previous 12 months.  The amount that is given is the gross amount.  In my opinion such a form is not completed in the correct manner because they should have deducted expenses they have incurred for foodstuffs, fertilisers and so on.  Health authorities should notify farmers that they are entitled to claim for their farming expenses.  Only the amount that is left after expenses have been paid should appear on the statement.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the medical card system is working in a fair way. I expect that within a short time the limit for qualification for medical cards will be raised.  It is only after a decision has been made to grant a person a medical card that the details are computerised and the person is given a number.  That should be made clear.  I know it is not easy to find solutions to all the problems involved but I should like the Minister to bear those few points in mind.</P>
    <P>More money is needed for the extension of the home care service. Much is being done in this field now but there will have to be more liaison between the Departments of Health and Social Welfare in catering for the needs of the aged in their homes.  It is costing the State a lot of money to maintain in hospitals many old people whose families are not prepared to look after them.  Relatives should be encouraged to look after those members <Col N="1610" /> of the family who are no longer able to look after themselves.  I realise it is difficult to know what is the best means of dealing with such matters&mdash;whether to pay money to the old person and try to ensure that the person looking after him will get an allowance, or whether it should be paid to the relatives looking after him while ensuring that the necessary services will be provided for the aged.  I believe that a satisfactory scheme in this regard could be worked out in conjunction with the practice of visiting by local health nurses.  Such a scheme would not cost as much to the State as it is now costing to maintain the old in hospital.</P>
    <P>Some people have complained about having to contribute £7 per year towards social welfare.  This is a very small contribution to make to ensure that if one becomes ill one will have free hospitalisation and treatment.  It is only 15p per week and is, indeed, very good value for money.  Perhaps one day the scheme will be extended and the contribution increased to allow for the services of a doctor in the home but, as it is, the scheme is very good.</P>
    <P>The health services in the schools, too, are very good.  I suppose it is difficult to cater for every child who may be mildly retarded because of the problem involved in detecting the retardation in time and then of finding places for the children in special schools.  Those doctors and nurses who attend primary schools throughout the country have a very special duty to perform but very often they have a real problem in trying to make parents realise that their children are retarded and that they should be sent to special schools.  I have known of many cases where parents have been very reluctant to allow their children to go away for the special treatment that is necessary for them.  Sometimes parents take the view that the child will catch up within a year or two. It is a matter of educating parents to realise the importance of early detection and treatment of mental retardation in children.</P>
    <P>Regarding the choice of doctor scheme, there has been anxiety in some areas that it may not always be possible to avail of the services of a doctor <Col N="1611" /> because of the distance limit of seven miles.  However, it has been announced recently that in very remote areas this limit will not be adhered to strictly because very often there would not be a doctor available within a distance of seven miles.  There are people in such areas who are anxious to know whether they will be able to avail of a proper night service when, say, a doctor may be living nine or ten miles away.  I expect the medical profession are sorting that problem out now that doctors may not be living in the residence adjacent to dispensaries.</P>
    <P>It has always been my opinion that those in the medical profession have a vocation.  Anybody who has ever been in hospital will realise what I mean.  They work very long hours and, with few exceptions, they do excellent work.</P>
    <P>When hospitals are being discussed here, Deputies tend to score political points but we must remember that the whole emphasis in the field of health must be on the patient.  We are glad that the building of the regional hospital in Cork is going ahead.  This project was held up for nine years and I believe the reason for the delay was that in the past politicians in Cork engaged in a lot of juggling on the matter.  It is not to their credit that the building of this hospital was delayed, especially when one remembers that the money for it was being provided from central funds.  There would be no charge on the local rates to build it. It was a shame and a disgrace the way people fought and haggled over it and tried to make mean political points.  In the end they held it up for three or four years.  I am glad it is going ahead at long last.  It will be some years however before it will be built.  Considering the way the population of the county and city of Cork is growing, it is only right that they should have a proper hospital.</P>
    <P>Capital has been made out of Mallow hospital.  The Minister has guaranteed us that surgery will still be carried out in that hospital until the regional hospital is opened in Cork and the position will then be reviewed.  It is obvious to me that it will be six or <Col N="1612" /> eight years before the new regional hospital in Cork is opened.  By then there will be great changes.  I am convinced that surgery will still be performed in Mallow hospital after the opening of the regional hospital in Cork.  I am looking forward to the regional hospital as being an excellent hospital in which all major operations will be carried out expertly and without delay.  But the population of the city and county will have grown so much by that stage that there will be a greater necessity than ever for minor operations to be carried out in Mallow hospital.  At the moment it can cater for 80 to 85 per cent of the patients who go there no matter what their complaints are.  The 10 or 15 per cent are sent to the bigger hospitals in Cork.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect to have kidney units or heart units in every town throughout the country.  We will have to reconcile ourselves to that fact.  We are all agreed that a lot of minor surgery will be carried out in the hospital in Mallow.  It will be a god send working in conjunction with the new regional hospital in Cork.  The FitzGerald Report probably takes a different view but I am telling the Minister what I think will happen in future. The Southern Health Board have decided that Mount Alverna will be turned into a psychiatric hospital.  I have my doubts about that.  May be some of the patients who are not so ill will be sent there.  Mount Alverna is not well situated to be turned into a psychiatric hospital.  It is adjacent to a very busy local factory.  It is surrounded by busy roads.  These factors are not good for that type of patient. There is a railway on one side of it and the deep flowing Blackwater on the other.  This does not favour the establishment of a psychiatric unit at Mount Alverna.  It has been decided to give it a try.  I hope they will be very lucky but I have doubts about it. Once they have set their sights on it I hope they will be successful.</P>
    <P>Newmarket convent is being sold.  I believe it should be bought to house geriatric patients.  It is a fine building. It is not going for a very dear price.  Newmarket and the surrounding districts are a very rural area. <Col N="1613" /> Many of the patients are not very ill. I do not think it would cost very much to run that hospital.  It would be very nice if those geriatric patients could be brought nearer to home so that their relatives could visit them.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about the composition of the various health boards.  They are now working, whether they are criticised or otherwise.  The various local advisory committees are now being set up, consisting of all the elected members of the local authorities, the county councils and the corporation.  When a man is elected to a county council or a corporation he should automatically become a member of the local advisory health committee.  We have a pretty awkward case in Cork.  All the county councillors were on the northern committee and all the county councillors were on the western committee but this was not the case in the southern area.  Some of them will not be on the committee.  The Minister has formulated the rules and he is sticking to them but I think every elected member should be on these committees.  This would be good for the people he represents and it would be good for the man himself.  He would know what was happening.  If he is not on the health committee he is cut away from matters which affect him.  A public representative in his day-to-day activities has a lot to do with problems involving health: medical cards, hospital expenses and so on.  Since the rating authorities have to provide so much money for the health boards every councillor and every member of the corporation should be automatically a member of the local advisory health committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the infant mortality rate in 1971 was the lowest on record as also was the maternal mortality rate.  I have my own ideas about this.  I suppose the Minister and his Department have a graph somewhere and I should like to know how many births have been recorded in the various maternity hospitals and how many have been recorded at the local district hospitals.  Fifty years ago or so infants were born in their own homes.  The local maternity nurse and the local doctor attended.  Also many <Col N="1614" /> infants were born in the local district hospital.  Any hospital which has not got at least gynaecologists attached to it should not be permitted to deal with maternity cases.  No woman giving birth should be accepted at those hospitals unless there is a gynaecologist on duty at all times.  It is not right that the mother of a family should die because of the lack of extra facilities.  If any problems arise she has to go to the nearest maternity home and have specialist care.  I make a very strong plea to the Minister along those lines because very often people who are not in the upper income group have to go to the other hospitals and their local doctor has to travel 10 or 20 miles to attend at the birth.  This is still happening in the rural areas.  I met some of those doctors and they do not want those cases but when their patients insist they have very little choice.  If, when they are sent for they are at the other end of what was known as their dispensary area and cannot come for many hours, a problem arises.  We should look forward to the day when all our children are born in hospitals to which at least gynaecologists are attached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House.  I merely want to make a few points on certain aspects of the Minister's Estimate, which he has presented so comprehensively to the House, and on certain aspects of the health regulations which he is bringing in under section 41 of the 1970 Health Act.  I want to refer, first of all, to the composition of the health boards and the three regional hospital boards which will have to administer the eight health boards, and to Comhairle na nOspideál.  I have, I think, the backing of the Fine Gael Party when I say that we have certain reservations about the almost unavoidable amount of bureaucracy which has crept into the administration of the health services.  The Minister mentioned a figure of £3.5 million as being the sum necessary for the payment of the staff engaged in administering the health services.  We believe that the three regional hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspideál, set up to replace the Hospitals Commission, may further propagate bureaucratic <Col N="1615" /> control of the health services. The fact that it will cost approximately £3.5 million to administer is not in itself an excuse or a justification for extending this kind of bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>People like myself, who practise medicine in the front line, are aware of the very necessary co-operation that must exist between health boards, hospital boards and hospital authorities. In many hospitals the ancillary medical staff, the para-medical staff and the administrative staff outnumber the actual medical staff employed in the treatment of the sick.  I could quote figures.  One of the most informative documents, if I may say so, without fear of insulting the Minister or his officials, where our health services are concerned is the telephone directory. We find from a study of the directory that in the Dublin area there are close on 70 hospital institutions. I know of no other city anywhere in the world that has so many hospitals per head of the population in a particular region.  When one examines the section dealing with the other countries one finds there are approximately 225 hospitals and para-hospital institutions. If one refers to the FitzGerald Report one finds that many of these are outdated in structure and suitability for the treatment of the sick. Perhaps the Department is misguided and steering on a wrong course in attempting to tackle the health problem in the way in which it is attempting to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is today a regular systematic increase in the number of children born.  Correlated with that is the incidence of premature births, of children brought prematurely into this world and kept alive as a result of medical science.  Related to that is a high incidence of brain damage associated with premature birth.  The Minister stated recently that he intends to provide some 900 institutional beds for the care of the mentally handicapped from the age of one up to 18 or 19. He told us the waiting list for these beds is quite high.  I saw a report the other day indicating that the number of children born suffering from spina bifida per year was over the 100 mark. <Col N="1616" /> There is no definite register of the number of children suffering from this disease or of the number of children who, having been born with spina bifida, develop the complication of hydrocephaly.  When I was a houseman in St. Laurence's Hospital I was associated with research into this unfortunate disease.  Indeed, that hospital deserves great credit and I am pleased that the Minister has at last allocated certain funds towards improving the facilities in that hospital.</P>
    <P>The other important statistic is the decreasing number of deaths per 100,000 of the population per year. This gives rise to two problems which must be solved.  More institutional care must be provided for the mentally handicapped.  The statistics available are not absolutely accurate and I think Holles Street is one of the few hospitals which has a follow-up of all children born there to see how they develop.  People are definitely living longer and the statistics given to us by the Minister yesterday show that a male who reaches the age of 50 has a life expectancy of 22 years and a female 23 to 25 years life expectancy. The pattern is much the same all over Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister must tackle the problem of the aged.  It is not fair to ask people to give the best years of their lives working patriotically for the welfare of the country and then, in their twilight years, allow them to end up in institutions in which they lose their individuality and in which they are completely divorced from their natural environment.  Many of those in this age group are institutionalised simply because there is no social team to back up their care at home.  This, to my mind, and to the mind of many medical practitioners, para-medical workers and people like the Minister and his officials is one of the greatest injustices in our society.  Many of these end up in mental hospitals though they are not suffering from any mental disease. Indeed, if one wants to get a geriatric patient into St. Kevin's in an emergency and no bed is available, in order to facilitate one, they will slip out a patient to St. Bernard's or to St. <Col N="1617" /> Dympna's.  You may change the name from Grangegorman to St. Brendan's or St. Dympna's but it is still a mental institution.  It is sad to think that if we are unable to keep our fathers or grandfathers at home, a mental hospital is one of the few places where they can have hospital care.</P>
    <P>It is with regret that I see the genitalurinary section of Jervis St. Hospital taking over wards in St. Mary's hospital in the Phoenix Park because the majority of adults in Dublin city live on the north side of the city which is the catchment area of St. Mary's hospital and this is the only official geriatric hospital on the north side.  The latest available figure of people over 21, that is on the electoral register in the area, is 168,000.  I believe a figure of 60,000 people in the Dublin city and adjoining county area is a very accurate figure for the number of aged people requiring constant and systematic care.  I do not believe the Department of Health are attempting to provide this: I believe voluntary organisations, religious groups particularly, deserve great credit for the work they are doing in trying to cater for the aged in our community.  The Sisters of Charity, Donnybrook, are building a special complex where aged families may live together without suffering the stigma of institutionalisation or joining the long queue to nowhere.</P>
    <P>I want to mention a few points in the FitzGerald Report while at the same time pointing out that one of the greatest omissions of the report is the failure to concentrate on geriatrics.  It is quite obvious from the figures they worked on that there was a drift of population, an increase in the birth rate and a decrease in the death rate and the people were living longer.  One of the omissions in the FitzGerald report is in regard to the need for the provision of sufficient geriatric beds and they refer only very briefly to the provision of maternity beds.  When I was first elected in 1969 I raised the matter of the grave shortage of maternity beds on the north side of Dublin city.  The most recent figures we have&mdash;and I quote from a reply given to me by the Minister on 27th April, 1971&mdash;show that there were 134 maternity beds on <Col N="1618" /> the north side and 442 on the south side.  Apart from the change in the charter of the Rotunda Hospital to enable it to take over some 20 or 30 beds in the Drumcondra Hospital there has been no real attempt to provide sufficient maternity beds on the north side.</P>
    <P>There are provisional plans for a maternity unit in Blanchardstown.  I am a practising doctor and I do a certain amount of maternity work and I cannot see&mdash;I say this sincerely&mdash;a patient of mine travelling from Glasnevin with two or three children, getting a bus at Phibsboro', going to Blanchardstown and walking through the grounds there to an out-patients department where she can have an ante-natal examination.  I have discussed this with members of the board of the James Connolly Hospital and I have expressed concern at the fact that they are going to open a maternity unit which will provide ante-and post-natal service.  I believe the Minister is interested in providing services and I consider he should first envisage the building of a complete, independent, viable maternity unit on the north side of the city including in its catchment area the north-west side of Dublin. Can we get no co-operation or coordination between the Department of Local Government, Dublin Corporation and the Department of Health? Is the Minister not aware that 2,900 dwellings are going up in Finglas, that over 600 dwellings have gone up in West Cabra and that there are plans for further dwellings to accommodate young families who will continue to have children and that in that area there is need for adequate maternity care?</P>
    <P>I want to make a suggestion quietly to the Minister.  Under the 1943 St. Laurence's Hospital Act the Minister has power to acquire lands for the purpose of building a hospital.  That Act gives the Minister practically unlimited power over the disposal of lands attached to the Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke group of voluntary hospitals.  The Minister could build an adequate, independent maternity hospital on the land acquired for the purpose of building <Col N="1619" /> the new St. Laurence's Hospital at Cabra Cross.  He could use the plans drawn up for the new Coombe Hospital which is recognised as being one of the most efficient and best-designed maternity hospitals in Europe but, unfortunately, it has become overcrowded to the extent that a mother is lucky if she can stay two days in that hospital at present.  Indeed, she will be very fortunate if she can spend two days in a hospital bed because I know, and the Minister knows, and the Eastern Health Board know that many patients in the Coombe Hospital and in Holles Street Hospital are sleeping on mattresses in the hospital wards.</P>
    <P>If the Minister takes the plans of the new Coombe Hospital there will be no architects' fees; there will be no site fee because the land is already acquired by the Minister for the purpose of building a hospital and all the Minister has to do is to provide funds to build the hospital.  He should not make James Connolly Memorial Hospital a piecemeal hospital as has happened with far too many hospitals. The previous speaker from Fianna Fáil outlined the importance of proper professional attention at the birth of a child.  Many doctors here, Deputies Delap and Gibbons, Sir Anthony Esmonde and Surgeon Hogan will all support me when I say that the most important minutes of any infant's life are the initial minutes when he is brought into the world.  Maternity hospitalisation is increasing and the result of this can be seen from the statistics which the Minister gave to us yesterday. He said that maternity mortality has fallen to a reasonably respectable degree.  We cannot be too euphoric about the fall in infant mortality because we have seen this happen in the past and it can rise again.  We hope that this figure will continue to drop.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the World Health Organisation uses as one of its yardsticks for judging the standard of living of a country the maternity mortality rate.  For many years we have had the highest maternity mortality rate of North European countries.  In 1964 out of 44 women who died in childbirth or a year after <Col N="1620" /> childbirth from complications therefrom, 25 per cent of them were from the travelling people.  There has been a drive to provide adequate housing and adequate ante-natal and post-natal care for those people, but nevertheless there are many times when children of the itinerant families stand very little chance.  One seldom sees an elderly itinerant.  Their death rate is quite high.</P>
    <P>In emphasising the deficiency of maternity hospital beds on the north side of this city I want to state that the neo-natal beds on the north side of the city total 64 and on the south side they total 102.  We have here a completely lopsided development.  The minority of adults are on the south side but the majority of beds are provided there.  The majority of adults are on the north side of the Liffey yet the minority of beds are provided.  Only one-fifth of the total maternity beds in Dublin city are on the north side.  There are 695 children's beds on the north side of the city which are centred in St. Laurence's, Jervis Street, the Mater and Temple Street hospitals compared with 966 on the south side.</P>
    <P>No Minister for Health can come into this House and tell me that the increase to £85.5 million in health for the coming 12 months will result in a fantastic increase in the hospital services of this country because I know, the Minister knows, his officials, the Medical Union, the Medical Association and every person associated with hospital care in this country know that the majority of that increased money will go towards paying the wages of nurses, doctors, nurses assistants, cleaning staff, porters, the installation of things like telephones, boilerhouses <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>When one refers to the statistics which the Minister has circulated one can see the amount of work being carried out during the coming year.  For the increase in the amount of money which the Minister wants us to vote for his Department this year there is very little money being spent in providing extra facilities in hospitals.  Since the foundation of the State under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government there was a tremendous improvement <Col N="1621" /> in the hospital services in this country. Later on under Deputy Noel Browne, when he took over as Minister for Health, sanatoria were built all over the country and there was a tremendous injection of capital and provision of buildings to help the sick people of this country and this succeeded in the eradication of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed recently when it came to my attention that one of the main hospitals in the Eastern Health Board area, a hospital isolated from the FitzGerald Report, which has been accepted in principle by the Minister for Health, St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital in Cappagh, which specialises in bone surgery, wrote to the Minister in March, 1971, asking for financial assistance towards the erection of a sterile air-conditioned operating theatre of which none exists in this country&mdash;three exist in Great Britain and three exist in the rest of Europe&mdash; and they merely received an acknowledgement. In the statement of statistics provided we find that money can be granted for the extension of a central laundry fund, for electrical rewiring and the provision of boilers in hospitals but one of the most modern operating theatres, the cost of which comes to approximately £11,000, was just acknowledged by the Department of Health and no further investigation took place into it.  I doubt very much if the Irish Hospitals Trust Fund would have rebelled if the Minister had given an extra £11,000 subsidiary grant to make up the deficiency in that fund.</P>
    <P>The FitzGerald Report, on page 119, paragraph 10 states:</P>
    <P>In North Dublin the major hospital group on the Mater site should contain general beds and specialised units of the present Mater, Jervis Street and St. Laurence's Hospitals.</P>
    <P>The most specialised unit of St. Laurence's Hospital will become one of the most essential specialised units in the hospital make-up of this country.  During Whit week-end 11 people died on the roads and 169 were injured.  Many of these people suffered head injuries.  Some of them could <Col N="1622" /> perhaps have been saved had very skilled and specialised attention been available to them at St. Laurence's Hospital.  We find that St. Laurence's Hospital is a building which is over 300 years old.  It must be one of the oldest hospital buildings in this country.  We find it to be a complete misnomer.  We find the St. Laurence's Hospital Act of 1943 setting up a board called the St. Laurence's Hospital Board to look after St. Laurence's Hospital which was to be built at Cabra Cross but which for some reason or other never materialised. The board was placed in charge of the Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke consortium of hospitals, one of which has been a house of industry and which, to my mind and to the minds of many of the staff who work there, is not suitable any longer for the treatment of patients.  Under the St. Laurence's Hospital Act, 1943, the Minister has the responsibility for that hospital.  It is the only hospital in this country for which the Minister has total and utter responsibility. It reflects very badly on any Minister of State in this country&mdash;since 1943 onwards&mdash;I include everybody and I am not just referring to Deputy Childers&mdash;that a patient who has undergone an operation in a hospital can be wheeled across a thoroughfare, where there is no restriction on traffic or pedestrians, without any protection whatsoever from inclement weather.  I know because I have done it and have seen it done recently.  The only improvement, with due respect to the Minister, has been the provision of an umbrella to cover the patient when it is raining, or else the patient is retained for a while.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave me an assurance recently in reply to a Parliamentary question that the hospital board were taking steps to ensure that this would not continue.  Nowhere in my travels, which have been limited to some degree but which have taken me as far as the Continent of Africa and other continents, have I seen comparable conditions.</P>
    <P>It is only when one reads through the St. Laurence's Hospital Act that one sees why these conditions are there, <Col N="1623" /> because these appointees are political tools of whichever Minister might be in power: keep everything quiet at all costs; do not rock the boat.  It is not so long since an ex-chairman of that board said it was the responsibility of all medical staff employed in hospitals to disclose and to oppose work in hospital conditions which were adverse to the successful and rapid treatment of patients.  I shall not say any more about that except to urge the Minister not to plough £500,000 into an archaic building, 300 years old, when for another £1 million or £1,500,000 he could have a brand new hospital at Cabra Cross, and it would not be out of line with the contents of the FitzGerald Report.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows well that under the 1943 Act he has the authority to acquire lands for the <Col N="1624" /> purpose of building a hospital and the then Minister for Health, under the Compulsory Purchase Order Act, acquired lands in the Cabra area for the purpose of building a neurosurgical specialist hospital, that he created a lobby in that area whereby people gave in without a fight to retain their own private property.  What has happened? There has been nothing but weeds and bushes growing on that site ever since. This in itself is no justification for building a hospital, but there is plenty of justification if the Minister would just consult with the Minister for Local Government and see the massive building that has taken place in that area, or if he would just consult a map and see the tremendous advantages of that site at Cabra Cross, in proximity to the Phoenix Park, and the disadvantages of the existing site.</P>
      <P>I see here there is money allocated for the Regina Coeli Hostel for mothers and their children.  I should like to know when the people of Ireland and especially the people of Dublin are going to get a decent hospital service.  There are very few hospitals in this city where equipment and staff are not unnecessarily duplicated. I would call upon the Minister to set up a group to investigate unnecessary hospital costs.  There is no doubt that any accountant who goes through the accounts of a voluntary or local authority hospital sees gross wastage, wastage which would not be tolerated in any private business concern. A hospital is a non-profit making organisation but it does not have to be a loss or a burden to the rate-payers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not time that the Minister for Health took a look at the general financing of the health services?  Why should people have to pay, under the Health Contributions Act, 1971, voluntary health insurance?  Why should they have to pay income tax, part of which goes to the Exchequer and part of which goes to the Minister for Health?  Why should we have to pay wholesale and turnover tax, part of which goes to the Exchequer and part of which goes to the Minister for Health through this Estimate?  It also baffles me why a resident of a private <Col N="1625" /> house should be taxed on living, be taxed on sitting, eating and sleeping in that house?  Why should part of the money charged have to go towards the provision of health services? Surely it is completely outdated.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will arrange that on future postage stamps, particularly those which are issued to promote worthy causes, inscriptions are printed in both official languages as a contribution to better understanding between both Irish communities and of the purpose for which the stamps are issued; and, if not, why.</P>

      <P>Inscriptions on our postage stamps have generally been in Irish only except for the names of persons usually known by their English names.  While no change in this general practice is contemplated, there have been departures from it in the past and there may well be in the future where the theme and design of a particular stamp require it.  I will bear the point made by the Deputy in mind in relation to the type of stamp which he particularly mentions.</P>
