      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will indicate the percentage proportional rate of unemployment in this country at present as it relates to the rates of unemployment currently applicable in countries of the EEC; and if he will indicate whether or not there has been a decrease in the rate of unemployment in this country since 31st January, 1972.</P>

      <P>The systems under which employment statistics are complied and the definitions involved vary from country to country and it is not possible to quote current comparable unemployment rates for this country and for the different countries of the EEC.</P>
      <P>Between 28th January, 1972, and 10th March, 1972, the latest available date, the total live register figure has fallen by some 1,800.  This is somewhat more than the seasonal decline in this period in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what action the Eastern Health Board propose to take in the case of two children who have been abandoned in Dublin and whose parents are reported to have reclaimed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that, as the Deputy suggests, the children's parents have reclaimed them but I understand that the Eastern Health Board have instituted inquires and until these have been concluded it will not be possible to take a definite decision about the children's future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees that there is widespread anxiety in this case arising out of an earlier case in which triplets were reclaimed by the parents who abandoned them and subsequently one of those triplets died in tragic circumstances. Would the Minister state whether, if the parents who abandoned these children reclaim them, the parents <Col N="1870" /> have the right automatically to recover them irrespective of their fitness or otherwise?  Would he also state, if this is the case, whether he proposes to make any change in the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not answer the Deputy in detail with regard to that.  This whole matter is in the hands of the Eastern Health Board and I would not want to intervene unless there was some indication that the wrong action had been taken.  The Eastern Health Board are in touch with the welfare authorities in Britain and I think that some of the statements made in the papers about the intentions of the parents are not necessarily accurate. The matter is being examined by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the concern felt about this case arises precisely out of the uncertainty, which the Minister himself appears to share, as to what will be the position if the parents&mdash;who, <i>prima facie,</i> if the reports are correct, would be unfit to look after these children&mdash; reclaim the children?  Do they automatically get them back?  Is that the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so far as I am aware.  If the parents are regarded as unsuitable the children can be placed in the care of a health authority, as the Deputy knows.  If the parents are regarded as suitable and wish to have the children back then they can be given the children.  The matter is under examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>With your permission, <Col N="1878" /> a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19, 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>An air carrier requires the prior permission of my Department for the operation of inclusive tour charter flights between Ireland and the Continent. This permission is normally forthcoming where the conditions laid down for the operation of such flights are complied with.  These conditions have been promulgated in the official Aeronautical Information Publication and are well known to the air carriers; they have also been distributed widely in the travel trade.</P>
      <P>These regulations provide for minimum prices and for applications to be made in good time where exceptional price reductions are sought.  They are aimed at protecting scheduled operations and at orderly development of the tour business itself.  Recently a number of applications received from foreign carriers for the operation of inclusive tour charter flights series to the Continent, which did not comply with the conditions, particularly the minimum price requirement, and were not made in good time, were not authorised.  Some of the carriers have lodged appeals and I am considering these.</P>
      <P>The Deputies may have seen the recent press notice on inclusive tour charters.  This was inserted in the public interest as a warning to intending travellers that before booking on an inclusive tour flight, they should satisfy themselves that the flight has been duly authorised.</P>
      <P>The present difficulties apply to outgoing charters.  I am not aware of any irregularities in regard to incoming charters and do not think that they will be affected.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together. During the recent dispute with the Irish Dental Association, which I am pleased to say is now resolved, a majority of dentists withdrew from the dental benefit scheme administered by my Department.  Treatment under the scheme continued to be available, however, to qualified insured persons from a substantial number of dentists throughout the country who remained on the dental panel.  I am aware that some insured persons received treatment from dentists who had withdrawn from the scheme and they were required to pay for this treatment at rates determined by the dentists.  I regret that there is no statutory authority which would enable such persons to be reimbursed the cost of dental treatment received outside the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the number of new jobs expected to result from the recent injection of £20 million into the economy; and the number of jobs provided to date as a result of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The main object of the additional £20 million of expenditure on the 1971-72 public capital programme was to safeguard employment by preserving existing job opportunities and creating new ones in 1971-72 and 1972-73.  It it very difficult to quantify precisely the job content of this expenditure but it is certain that, if it had not been authorised by the Government, the employment situation both present and prospective would be much worse.  For example, the expenditure of £2 million extra by Taiscí Stáit had the direct result of avoiding about 1,000 redundancies.  Additional expenditure totalling £3 million by the ESB and on telephones directly saved or created about 500 jobs.  The additional expenditure of £1 million on <Col N="1887" /> housing enabled work with an employment content of about 1,100 to be undertaken.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to state that the balance of the £20 million has the same proportionate effects on employment because of the varied nature of the expenditure involved and of the delayed effects inevitably associated with capital investment in its initial stages.  It can, however, be said that the expenditure of the extra £20 million as a whole will have considerable direct effects on employment in the areas where the money is first spent and will, of course, generate indirectly a substantial volume of economic activity in associated areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister cannot quantify precisely, why did he pick on the figure of £20 million?  The whole purpose was to ease the unemployment situation.  That was the indication given in the Dáil as a result of the emergency debate.  We were told that the whole purpose was to create jobs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misquoting what I said.  I did not say that the main object was to preserve existing jobs.  What I said was that the main object was to preserve existing job opportunities and to create new ones in 1971-72 and 1972-73.  As regards the amount which is involved, this was related not only to the creation of jobs or preservation of existing jobs, but also to the financial aspects of the economy.  In particular it was related, as was stated at the time, to areas in which by direct productive investment results in the way of employment created or safeguarded could be achieved quickly.  Frequently in relation to capital investment this kind of effect cannot be seen for a number of years. The objects of this expenditure were <Col N="1888" /> picked out as those where results could be seen quickly and could be achieved quickly.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding lands in the possession of the Land Commission for distribution is subject to constant fluctuation, depending upon progress in intake and allotment.  This is particularly so at this time of year when Land Commission activities in the allotment of land reach their peak, so that a list of estates on hands at present would be quickly out-of-date and, therefore, largely irrelevant.  More realistic figures would be those in respect of lands on hands at 31st March. These should be likely to remain reasonably firm for a period after the <Col N="1890" /> completion, on that date, of the seasonal allotment programme.</P>
    <P>However, I am bound to say that the Deputy is looking for a great mass of detail concerning all the estates held by the Land Commission throughout the country.  At any one time the Land Commission have in or around 60,000 acres of arable lands in their possession, comprised in some 2,400 properties. To compile a list giving only the names of these properties would, in itself, be a formidable task.  A list giving all the particulars asked for would involve a quite disproportionate diversion of staff and would not be warranted.</P>
    <P>However, in an endeavour to assist the Deputy, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement showing those estates which were in the possession of the Land Commission in Counties Laois and Offaly at the beginning of this month.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is interested in any particular estate, perhaps he would put down a further question, or communicate with me, and I will furnish him with all available information.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>PARTICULARS of Estates&mdash;apart from turbary, insignificant residues of partly allotted properties and lands transferred in exchange&mdash;in the possession of the Land Commission for division.</P>
    <P Just="Center">County Laois</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I will take Questions Nos. 35 to 37 together.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme for the provision of free books for necessitous pupils the position in national schools is that a grant is paid annually to the principal teacher of each school based on the percentage of necessitous pupils on the rolls of the school as furnished by the principal teacher.  The administration of the scheme within a school is left to the discretion of the principal teacher.  I am satisfied that principal teachers are carrying out this duty in a satisfactory manner.</P>
      <P>In the case of post-primary schools the scheme is administered through the headmasters of the schools who, in relation to the overall amount of money made available to them, have discretion in the allocation of grants under the scheme.  I do not, therefore, have any information in regard to applications for grants in respect of individual pupils, nor do I feel that in relation to the amount of official time and expense that would be involved I would be warranted in seeking such information.</P>
      <P>I am having inquiries made into the specific case mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that it is totally unsatisfactory that a brother and sister in the same family should be treated differently&mdash;one given assistance and the other not given assistance?  Both children are in the same family and have the same degree of necessitousness.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the <Col N="1899" /> scheme is undesirable and should be changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the case the Deputy has mentioned is the matter I am inquiring about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from that, the Deputy will be aware that this is an example of the Department and the Minister allowing this area of responsibility to the principals concerned.  I should have thought the Deputy would be in favour of allowing the people on the spot to establish who are necessitous pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While that kind of devolution of authority is something we look for from the Department generally and rarely get in other matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when it comes to a scheme which is a social welfare scheme there should be some criteria laid down and some equity of administration, together with some tolerance and discretion in particular cases to deal with special problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria of which the Deputy speaks are available and are laid down.  I would remind the Deputy that there is devolution of authority&mdash;something he has recommended on many occasions&mdash;and this devolution applies in this case.  I hope the Deputy is not suggesting that we should go back and try to administer this scheme entirely from the Department of Education so as to ensure the uniformity he says should apply in every case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is desirable is that there should be a basic entitlement of people and there should be discretion at local level to deal with any problems that arise.  In this instance there is no basic entitlement by anyone to a book; it depends entirely on the amount of money given to the school, which depends on the Department's assessment of how many necessitous pupils there are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The position is that the Department send out circulars to principals or managers to indicate the number of necessitous pupils.  In advance they make a payment in respect of post-primary schools of half the estimated amount so that the scheme can be got under way immediately. They pay the balance according to the figures supplied by the principal or headmaster during the year.

      <P>Schemes for the provision of stock animals at reduced prices in the congested districts have been in operation since 1905. Schemes for the provision of bulls and rams to selected applicants in these areas, at about one-third cost price, are administered by my Department.  A scheme for the provision of &ldquo;extra&rdquo; premium boars in the congested districts, at approximately one-fifth of their cost, which was also administered by my Department, was superseded in 1970 by an improved premium scheme applicable to the whole country and administered by the county committees <Col N="1904" /> of agriculture.  The schemes are effective in improving the quality of livestock produced in the congested districts, by ensuring the use of high standard breeding stock.  It is not proposed to extend the schemes for bulls and rams outside the present areas of operation, which are the most needy.</P>
      <P>The following are the particulars requested of the number of stock animals provided and of expenditure in each of the past four years:</P>

      <P>The basic annual grant to the IAOS was increased in the financial year 1969-70 from £12,000 to £20,000.  I have informed the ICA that their grant will be increased from £9,500 to £11,500 a year for the three-year period 1972-73 to 1974-75 and Macra na Feirme that their grant will be increased from £8,000 to £12,000 a year for the same period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister's announcement and I should also like to ask him if he has considered the necessity for a further increase in the grant-in-aid to the IAOS in view of the fact that, now that we are entering the EEC, there is a most urgent need for co-operation particularly in the field of export marketing, creamery rationalisation and the development of group farms?  Is the Minister aware that the funds available to the IAOS, £20,000, are quite inadequate in the face of the wide need&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be quite well aware that these are not by any means the only funds available to the IAOS.  I think it is not unfair to the IAOS to say that until the fairly recent past their efforts in the matter of creamery rationalisation and the extension of farm co-operation in general were rather slow.  I do not seek in any sense to leave the blame completely at their doorstep, but the fact remains that creamery co-operation and farm co-operation generally did not advance at a fast enough rate.  The reason was not the absence of available funds.  So far as the immediate problems that confront the co-operative dairy industry are concerned, this is a matter primarily for themselves to work out in co-operation with the Department and the IAOS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second supplementary on this question.  Would the Minister agree that one of the major reasons for the delay in the introduction of creamery relationalisation was the failure of his Government to introduce legislation in relation to friendly societies?  Would he further agree that new co-operatives are not in a position initially to subscribe to the IAOS because they are short of funds?  It is only when they are established that they can subscribe.  If new co-operatives are formed it may be three or four years before they will be able to subscribe to the IAOS and, therefore, there is an urgent need for an injection of capital now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Dáil takes note of the <Col N="1914" /> White Paper&mdash;The Accession of Ireland to the European Communities&mdash;and the Supplement thereto.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the debate is to give the Dáil the opportunity to discuss in advance of the referendum the terms negotiated for this country's accession to the Communities and the Government's assessment of accession on these terms as set out in the White Paper and the supplement.  If the people approve in the referendum the amendment proposed in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1971, and I am confident that they will, a motion will be introduced by the Government in Dáil Éireann in accordance with the requirements of Article 29 of the Constitution seeking approval of the Treaty of Accession, the text of which has already been circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Government's intention is that the referendum should be held during the month of May.  This will be after the new register of electors comes into force on 15th April, as we wish to ensure that young persons who have not previously been eligible to vote and who now have reached the voting age should have the opportunity to vote in the referendum on this issue which is so vital to their future and the future of our country.  The form of the proposed constitutional amendment and the reasons therefor are explained in the White Paper and were fully debated during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil and Seanad.  It is, therefore, unnecessary for me to go over this ground again.  However, there is one point I feel I must stress once more, namely that the proposed amendment is specifically and deliberately confined to cover the acceptance by us of the obligations of membership of the three European Communities, the European Economic Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Coal and Steel Community, which were established by the Treaties of Rome and Paris.</P>
    <P>These obligations do not entail any military or defence commitments for there are no such commitments involved in Ireland's acceptance of the Treaties.  The reason why I am emphasising <Col N="1915" /> this point again is that some people are persisting in their attempts to make this an issue in our membership of the Communities despite the clear evidence to the contrary and the repeated unequivocal assurances given by the Government on the subject.  One can only assume that this is a diversionary tactic on their part, designed to distract attention from the real issues involved in membership to which they are opposed for other reasons.</P>
    <P>It is of the greatest importance that the people are given clear and precise information on what membership of the Communities will mean for the country for it is they, the people, who must decide this issue.  The White Paper is designed to present the facts which will form the basis of a mature and responsible decision.  The terms agreed in the negotiations for our accession to the Communities are described in detail in that document and they are set out against the background of Community policies and arrangements for various sectors.</P>
    <P>In this way a comprehensive and objective picture is given of the obligations which membership entails for this country both during the transitional period and afterwards.  I am confident that anyone who, fairly and without bias, considers the terms we have negotiated will conclude with us that they are satisfactory. There will be some who while agreeing with this assessment consider that perhaps something more favourable might have been obtainable in one or other sector.  Although I could not go along with this view, I accept that there is always scope for such argument after the conclusion of negotiations, however successful.  What I cannot accept is the claim made by some that we could have obtained a much more favourable deal and even that we could have negotiated changes in Community rules and policies to suit us.  These people choose to ignore the fact that these policies and rules were worked out by the present member states after years of arduous and prolonged bargaining.  The negotiations were conducted on the basis that the applicant countries accepted <Col N="1916" /> the provisions of the Treaties establishing the Communities and the action taken for the implementation of these Treaties.</P>
    <P>The Government entered into the negotiations because they were convinced after the fullest examination that, given satisfactory terms for accession, our national interests would best be served by membership.  The negotiations were essentially concerned with transitional arrangements necessary to enable the applicant countries to adapt to the obligations of membership.  It was obvious that the views of the applicant countries and the Community itself would differ as to the kind of transitional arrangements which would best serve their interests.  Ideally, we would have liked a longer period for the removal of industrial protection and a shorter period for participation in the benefits of the common agricultural policy. Britain would have preferred to have it the other way round, while Denmark's best interest would be in a short transitional period in both sectors.</P>
    <P>In view of this conflict of interests and to ensure a successful outcome of the negotiations it was agreed at the opening of the negotiations that in the trade sector the duration of the transitional period would be the same for all applicant countries and that an overall balance of reciprocal advantages would best be achieved by ensuring an adequate parallelism between progress in the free movement of industrial goods and participation in the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with the basis on which the negotiations were opened and co-ordinated because it is essential that we be clear on this point if we are to have a constructive and meaningful debate on the merits of the terms negotiated.  I do not propose in this speech opening the debate to go into the details of the terms negotiated nor their implications and those of membership as a whole for this country.  These are fully set out in the White Paper and the various Ministers will be dealing with them during the course of the debate.  Let me say here that the Government are fully satisfied <Col N="1917" /> with the terms of accession.  They will ensure that all sectors of the economy can adjust gradually to the conditions and obligations of membership.  Not only this, they will enable us to derive substantial benefits immediately from the date of accession and to avail ourselves, also from this date, of many of the opportunities that membership will offer.</P>
    <P>Many people had doubts about how accession would affect our industry and our policy of industrial development. The arrangements negotiated for this sector should remove these doubts. The timetable for the gradual removal of protection will give industry an adequate breathing space for making the necessary adjustments to conditions of free trade.  A greatly extended transitional period has been obtained for the motor assembly industry and there are special arrangements for the steel industry to carry through its programme of reorganisation.  Difficulties may still be encountered by some industries as a result of a lowering of protection but arrangements were agreed in the negotiations for a general safeguard provision which will enable us to take protective action for particular sectors.</P>
    <P>We will also, where appropriate, be able to use our own anti-dumping legislation in case of urgency during that period.  Protection against imports is only one aspect of the industrial picture.  Our exporters, who have already proved their ability to exploit available opportunities, will now have greatly enhanced opportunities open to them with the removal of tariffs and other restrictions against their products in one of the richest and most populous markets in the world.  These new export opportunities, together with the assurance obtained in the negotiations, reinforced by a special protocol, that we can continue to apply industrial aids and incentives, will provide a greater stimulus to industrial investment in this country.  The protocol has been widely and rightly acclaimed as the major achievement in our negotiations. As a result, we can both continue our existing policies of industrial and regional development and look forward <Col N="1918" /> to extending and improving them where necessary.</P>
    <P>There are no grounds for pessimism about the overall future of our industry in the Community.  As a result of the terms obtained for this sector, we can look forward to substantial increases in both employment and output at an even more rapid pace than was achieved during the 1960s when industry played a leading role in our economic expansion.  There is no need for me to recount the great advantages which accession will bring in the agricultural sector.  These are appreciated on all sides, except by those whose opposition to membership blinds them to incontrovertible fact.  I need hardly say that membership will give our farmers the greatest opportunity they have ever had to increase their production and income. Let me emphasise, too, that the higher prices which apply in the Community will be received by all farmers, large and small.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to point out that we will begin to benefit from these higher prices immediately and that substantial savings on agricultural subsidies will also be available to us from the outset of membership.  The prospects for industry and agriculture which I have outlined will mean increases in the incomes of these sectors.  These, in turn, will have a beneficial effect on other sectors of the economy.  It is estimated, taking these factors into account, that the total employment will show a net increase of 50,000 by 1978 and that the gross national product will rise by about 5 per cent in a year on average over this period.  Such a performance, especially in the case of employment, will represent a marked improvement on the record growth achieved in the 1960s and will be the first real prospect, since independence, of achieving full employment and ending involuntary emigration.</P>
    <P>One other aspect of the terms of accession on which I wish to comment is our participation in the institutions of the Community.  Although we will have transitional arrangements in a number of sectors prior to assuming the full obligations of membership, we <Col N="1919" /> will, right from the start, have a full voice in the decisions of the institutions and participate fully in their work.  It has been stated in some quarters that our influence in the institutions will be too small to have any real effect on Community policies and that our interests will be ignored by Community decisions.  This is not true. In the case of the Council of Ministers, which is the decision-making body of the Communities, we shall, from the very beginning, have a seat and a vote in the Council just as the present member states now have.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that the invariable practice in the Council is that decisions affecting the essential interests of any one of the member states are taken only on the basis of unanimous voting.  As regards the other Community institutions and bodies, we shall have, in many cases, equal representation with the other member states, and in others the size of our representation will be greater than would be warranted by reference to relative population or gross national product.</P>
    <P>Most of the criticism of the Government decision to seek membership of the European Economic Community has been directed not so much against the terms of accession as against the idea of membership itself.  The nature of this criticism spans a wide range of argument, but fundamentally the opponents of membership seek to base their arguments on either economic or political considerations.  The main plank in the economic argument put forward by these people is that we would be better, or at least as well, outside the Community by negotiating some form of link short of membership. Let us be clear on what this argument is all about.  It is primarily about the best means of achieving the aims of national economic policy on which we are all agreed.  These aims include the rapid raising of the general standard of living of our people to a level approximating to the Community average; the elimination of disparities of a structural or regional character which bear harshly on certain sections of our people; the provision of opportunity for our agricultural population <Col N="1920" /> to earn an income comparable with that obtainable in other occupations; the absorption into gainful employment of our surplus labour force, including those who, of their own volition, will continue to leave agriculture; the stemming of emigration by the provision of adequate training and job opportunities and the continuing improvement of our social services.</P>
    <P>The achievement of these aims represents a formidable task.  The question we must ask ourselves is whether we are more likely to succeed in this task within the Community than outside it.  The conditions of membership are clearly set out in the White Paper.  The Government are convinced that these conditions, together with the transitional arrangements obtained in the negotiations, afford the best and perhaps the only opportunity we are likely to have of achieving those national economic aims.  I am not seeking to play down the difficulties which will have to be overcome in some sectors.  The Government have never pretended that the structure of industry would remain unaffected by the transition from a highly-protected market to free trading conditions.  Over the years, they have spared no effort to facilitate this transition both by encouraging existing industry to adapt to a changing environment and by attracting new export-based industries on a large scale.  Notwithstanding all that has been done there are likely to be some losses.  These losses will be more than offset by the gains that can flow from membership of the Community, gains which will enable us to pursue our national economic aims with far greater prospect of success than would otherwise be possible.</P>
    <P>Basically, the issue is one of confidence in the capacity of our people to make a success of membership.  The Government have no doubts about the capacity of our people to do so and in this we are supported by the elected representatives of the great majority of the people.  The opponents of membership, on the other hand, do not believe, or profess not to believe, that we as a nation are capable of achieving our national aims as a member of the Community.  However, the extraordinary thing is that the most vocal <Col N="1921" /> opponents of membership have shown boundless confidence in our capacity to survive and prosper on the basis of an alternative relationship with the Community, the terms of which are not known.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into the possible content of such alternative relationship.  This question will be taken up by later speakers from the Government benches.  However, I would like to concentrate the attention of Deputies on the things that any such alternative relationship would not contain.  First, let us take agriculture. What we want to achieve for our farmers are guaranteed access to a large market for their products and an assurance of remunerative prices. Experience has clearly shown that these objectives are not attainable on the basis of bilateral arrangements with individual countries.  They are attainable within the framework of the Community's common agricultural policy.  Participation in the common agricultural policy with all the advantages that it would offer for our farmers is only open to members of the Community.  This is a verifiable fact.  There is not a single country outside the Community&mdash;I repeat, not a single country&mdash;which has succeeded in negotiating terms of access to the Community market for their agricultural products remotely approaching what our farmers need.  It is clear that such terms of access would not be available to us in any arrangement with the Community short of membership.</P>
    <P>This is not all.  If we are to remain outside the enlarged Community which will include Britain, the Community barriers which would be erected against our exports to the British market, which at present accounts for 80 per cent of our total agricultural exports, would have disastrous effects on Irish agriculture and the repercussions would damage the entire economy.  Then, there is the matter of access to the Community's funds.  The Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund in addition to providing market support for agricultural production has the function of assisting the structural improvement of <Col N="1922" /> agriculture in the Community.  The European Social Fund provides funds for the training of workers and is assuming an increasingly important role in this area.  The European Investment Bank is a major source of funds for development projects.  Additional means of Community assistance are also being devised with the special object of dealing with the problem of regional and structural disparities within the Community.  We could not expect that access to these various sources of Community assistance which would be of great benefit to our economic and regional development would be open to us if we were not a full member of the Community.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the protocol agreed in the negotiations, the Community has acknowledged that it has a responsibility to assist economic development in Ireland and has therefore agreed to recommend that all the means at the disposal of Community institutions be used for this purpose.  Can anyone honestly claim that this kind of general commitment on the part of the Community would be given to us outside the context of membership?  Certainly, it is not to be found in any agreement negotiated with the Community with a non-member country.  These are some of the advantages that would be lacking in any of the arrangements we might negotiate in place of membership.  It is amazing that anyone should claim that without these advantages our goal of a growing and prosperous economy would be more easily achieved.  It might be that with such an arrangement we could escape some of the losses which would occur if we remained totally aloof from the Community but it is certain that most of the gains which only membership can bring would be denied to us.  The result would be a long period of economic stagnation which could be overcome if at all only by a national effort far greater than that required to meet the challenge of membership.</P>
    <P>This highlights the kind of contradiction that lies at the heart of the economic arguments against membership. It seems clear that many of those opposed to membership, who advance the unfounded and illogical economic <Col N="1923" /> arguments I have discussed, really have objections of a political nature to membership.  These objections are concerned chiefly with sovereignty and the political future of the Community. The wilder flights of anti-Common Market oratory introduce emotive expressions such as &ldquo;rich man's club&rdquo;, &ldquo;neo-colonialism&rdquo;, &ldquo;capitalist plot&rdquo; and so on.  I hope&mdash;in fact I am confident&mdash;that this debate will not be conducted in these terms.  The issues raised are important ones and deserve to be discussed in a serious way.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I do not propose to deal with these political aspects in any detail since I have on many occasions inside and outside the House commented on these matters and later speakers on the Government side will also cover such points.  I must, however, say that the political objections advanced by opponents of membership exhibit the same illogicalities, the same contradictions as their economic arguments. I have already pointed to their mental somersault concerning the behaviour of the Irish people themselves. Inside the EEC, they allege that we will be unable to compete on level terms with the other member countries because of our many weaknesses and short-comings.  Outside EEC, however, we apparently would be able to call on boundless reserves of energy and enterprise in order successfully to overcome tariff barriers and other obstacles to economic expansion.</P>
    <P>The same sort of mental gymnastics characterise the political objections to EEC.  Inside EEC it is alleged we would be stripped of our sovereignty, our resources exploited by half-baked Europeans hungry for profits while we remain helpless in the face of decisions taken in the interests of the larger and more powerful member states.  Outside EEC, on the other hand, these same countries, it is alleged, would suddenly become filled with sweet reason and light willing to negotiate some form of agreement with Ireland which would take account of all our special circumstances. The fact that any such arrangement would mean almost total dependence on the Community without any say at all in its political or economic <Col N="1924" /> decisions would, apparently, be no cause for alarm because of the continued benevolence of the EEC towards us.</P>
    <P>The same sort of confused thinking is evident also in the argument put out by the anti-Common Market lobby that joining the Community would perpetuate the division of our country and this, despite the disappearance of economic frontiers within the EEC and the commitment of the Community to an ever-closer union of its peoples.  It passes comprehension how anybody could support that view.  Surely it is self-evident that if we were to remain outside the Community we would be conferring on the Border the status of a frontier, both economic and political, between ourselves and the rest of Europe.  Moreover, since Britain would continue to be the major market for agricultural products any agreement which we would make with the EEC as a non-member country would depend largely on the goodwill and favour of the British.  Not alone, therefore, would we be copper-fastening Partition but by remaining outside the EEC we would be also increasing our dependence on Britain.  Can any Irishman seriously want this?</P>
    <P>The logical conclusion is that the political, economic and other interests of our country and our people are best served by membership of the Community. In saying this, it is not my intention to hold out membership of the Community as a universal panacea to cure all our ills.  The Community has its defects as have all man-made institutions. Its most noteworthy feature however is the extraordinary progress it has achieved over the short period of its existence, a mere 13 years.  In so far as the Community has defects, it would be for us as a member to work with our fellow members in order to remedy these defects.</P>
    <P>It is a salutary exercise to reflect on the kind of Europe&mdash;even the kind of world&mdash;we would have today if the European statesmen in the seats of power at the beginning of this century had been endowed with the same vision, the same dedication to peace and the same sense of Community as were Schuman, Spaak, Adenauer and <Col N="1925" /> de Gaspari.  It is conceivable that Europe and the world would have been spared two devastating wars, that we would not have had the division of Europe into two blocs and that we would be nearer to a solution of the problems of the developing world.</P>
    <P>It is easy for us, with the benefit of hindsight, to pass judgment on the shortcomings of previous generations of political leaders.  Let us not, however, forget that we in turn will be judged by posterity.  Today we stand at a most important crossroads in our history.  The road we take will determine not only the future of our country for generations to come, but also the contribution we make to the creation of a Europe that will measure up to the high ideals of the founders of the Community.  I am confident that the decision we take will reflect our people's faith in their capacity to help fashion for themselves and for future generations of Irish men and women a better Ireland in a better Europe.</P>
    <P>I have kept my speech short in the hope of setting an example.  It is desirable that as many speakers as possible participate in the debate and perhaps before the debate develops much further there might be some agreement reached as to the length of speeches.  That is a matter for the Whips.  As I have indicated, those Ministers having special responsibility for any aspect of European Community will be dealing specifically with such aspects and I hope that it will be possible for the Ministers concerned to satisfy any Deputies regarding any questions that may be asked.  I recommend the motion for the approval of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Much as I disagree with many of the Taoiseach's conclusions, I must say at the outset that I welcome what seems to me to be a reasonable and moderate tone in his speech.  We can form this much common ground: the Taoiseach said that what we are arguing about primarily are the best means of achieving the national economic aims on which we are all agreed.  That is a reasonable representation of what this argument is about.  On both sides there has been the sort of exaggeration, almost of hysteria, that he castigated as coming only from the anti side.  I have heard what I regarded as ridiculous and outrageous statements from both sides, but it seems now that we are moving along towards discussing this matter seriously.  I hope we can continue to do so.  The central thought relates precisely to how best we develop this nation, whether full membership is the best way or whether an association agreement is best.  I am glad we have reached the stage of omitting to try to terrify the voters by telling them that if we do not go for full membership we will have to stay out completely.  That is a step forward. On the last occasion on which this matter was discussed I heard Deputy Cosgrave suggest that if we should not become full members enormous barriers <Col N="1927" /> would arise immediately in respect of our industrial products.  I am glad that that has been recognised as a non danger and that it is not being repeated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will talk about that. Despite the arguments that have been put forward if one wishes to formulate his arguments in that way he is of course at liberty to do so.  Association agreement is available to countries that do not opt to become full members. While I shall have some sharp comments to make on various chapters of the White Paper, I propose to give it the benefit of the doubt and try to treat it as a serious document, although I am not sure that it merits that.</P>
      <P>The White Paper says that association agreement is available to those countries which are not developed sufficiently to become full members and it contains comment on the alternatives to membership.  I quote from pages 62 and 63:</P>
      <P>As regards the possibility of negotiating an association agreement, the view of the Commission is that membership is the proper form of participation for a European State and such a State should not be granted associate status unless either its state of economic development or its international relations preclude membership of the Community.</P>
      <P>I will be arguing that the first of those applies to us &mdash; that our state of economic development renders full membership exceedingly dangerous.  My belief is that it would be nationally fatal for us.  I will be arguing also that associate membership is appropriate to our level of economic development, that it can give us many of the gains and avoid much of the drawbacks and that it is simply a mistake of the understanding of our economy to argue that we are comparable to the other applicants or to the six present members.  I will be making this case both on the basis of the development of our economy and on the control of our financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1928" /> It seems to me that the central error in the position of the Government is the belief that we are comparable in regard to our level of development to the other European states.  From that mistake flows the belief that our economy would be able to withstand full membership in regard to the prevention of the outflow of capital and in regard to the prevention of the destruction of our industry by the inflow of goods.  The White Paper is more interesting in what is left out of it than in what it contains.  It contains elegant economic calculations that are utterly meaningless but there is no effort made to sustain them.  I am glad that the Taoiseach has not referred to them because they do not merit discussion at all.  One can make any set of economic predictions that one wishes to make.  It is interesting that in the interval since these predictions were made, though we called repeatedly for detailed economic validation that would have enabled us to examine the parameters built on those detailed economic predictions, such validation has not been produced.  I do not think there is any reason to think they exist. This is an exercise in persuasion rather than in serious economics.  Chapter 6 of the White Paper is entitled &ldquo;Political Implications&rdquo; and runs into five pages.  Chapter 7 which is entitled &ldquo;Is There an Alternative to Membership?&rdquo; covers six pages and dismisses cavalierly the alternatives without any serious discussion of them, including the quotation I have given about association agreement, which is the serious one for us.</P>
    <P>Let me develop this thought that we are not comparable economically either to the Six or to the other three applicants.  There is available a vast number of facts on this issue but I do not propose to spend a great deal of time on it.  I take the Taoiseach's point about brevity and shall abbreviate documentation that I intended using. I am referring now to the Commission's own sources.  This is <i>The Enlarged Community in Figures,</i> produced in Brussels in January, 1972, reference X 43/72E.  On pages 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 27, 31, 44 and 45 of this document there are a whole series of economic indicators which set out the <Col N="1929" /> relative level of development of this country.  We see first that our index is by far the smallest of the ten countries. For example, one may think of Norway and Denmark of being comparable in size with this country, but if we compare the GNP of the countries for 1970 we find that while ours was 3.8 billion, in the American sense, the next smallest was Norway at 11.4 billion which is nearly three times as big.  There are many other measurements that can be used but the result of the comparisons is that in terms of wealth not only are we the smallest, the most peripheral and the slowest growing but we are also about half as rich, taking it on average as either the Six or the other three applicants.</P>
    <P>This by itself puts us into the category of countries like Spain, Greece and Israel which are not very different in GNP terms from ourselves, countries which have not taken the role of full membership but which have negotiated different sorts of agreement. However, that argument merely on the level of wealth, GNP, rate of investment and so on, is not conclusive.  The one that in my view is conclusive is that we are in fact economically a colony of the United Kingdom.  We do not have control of our own financial institutions; we never have had.  We do not have control of our own currency.  In this sense not alone are we economically weak in the way I have indicated but also we are not in control of our own affairs.  A country like Turkey, for example, which is much bigger and much more populous but poorer in GNP terms per capita compared with us is sovereign in a way that we are not.  Therefore, both by the quantity of our income and the size of our economy, on the one hand, and the lack of sovereignty, on the other hand, we are simply not comparable with any of the other nine. Therefore, arguments about what is good for them and what is not good for them do not apply to us.</P>
    <P>We had a discussion in recent times as to whether or not Ireland is one nation or two nations.  It was not a very serious discussion because I do not think anyone put forward seriously <Col N="1930" /> the two-nation idea.  However, the whole point when one says it is one nation is that, in fact, in terms of territorial unity it is not yet; in terms of economic sovereignty it is not yet, if it ever will be.  Ireland as a nation has never been mature and established in the sense of any of the applicants or any of the members.  It is much more fragile in regard to its institutions and its continuity, in regard to its very survival than any of the other nine of the ten nations.  Therefore the outflow of capital and the inflow of goods against which our industry would not be competitive would be a threat to our national survival in a way that it would not be a threat to the national survival of, say, France or Germany.</P>
    <P>Ireland's completeness as a nation does not yet exist; all that exists at the moment is an aspiration, a movement in that direction, a striving, a determination. Therefore, the appropriate posture for the Government is a posture that is defensive, cautious, that keeps options open, that recognises our special weakness, and that puts the greatest possible number of barriers in the face of the free play of market forces.  If one were to indicate the objections to the EEC in one sentence it is that it is dedicated to the abolition of all those hindrances to the operation of free market forces.  If you abolish all those hindrances it is our contention that you abolish Ireland because we are simply not strong enough to withstand those pressures.</P>
    <P>Let us try to validate briefly this argument about the nature of our economy and therefore what free movement of capital and goods will do to us. Again I propose to abbreviate here what I had intended to say.  I think we can categorise our industry into three groups.  First, there is the indigenous industry that has existed here for a long period &mdash; the industries that come immediately to mind are Guinness, whiskey and other sorts of beer, food processing and so on.  Then there are the industries that grew up after Fianna Fáil came to power in 1932, industries that grew up in circumstances of very considerable protection, which were geared for the home market, which was a small and a poor <Col N="1931" /> market but which gave us such industry as we had, and this was a very welcome and correct thing to do up to the late fifties.  In the late fifties there was then a fairly radical change of direction of economic policy and we had the abolition of limitation on overseas ownership and the inviting in of foreign companies which, by and large, have set up branches of multi-nationals.  All the industrial growth we have seen in the last decade has been from these branches of multi-nationals.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that where the White Paper was inadequate was in its omissions. If we become full members of the EEC we must, over a transition period but quite a short one, dismantle all of the protections we have got against the input of goods by European competitors.  Again what I consider a great inadequacy of the White Paper is the section on dumping.  I refer to pages 99 and 100.  Before going on to consider the protection in the matter of dumping, let us look at the economic scene.  Every commentator from the extreme right to the extreme left and all the reasonable people in the middle are agreed, I think, that in the last 18 months or so a new economic period has opened in the EEC.  Rapid growth has ended. Investment in capital goods has diminished very much.  The simultaneous phenomena of inflation and stagnation are to be seen, and there is a new word &ldquo;stagflation&rdquo; coined to describe it.  There is very sharply intensifying competition in EEC circumstances and rising unemployment now well over the two million mark inside the Community.  By our standards that is very little but by their standards of five years ago it is very large and it is rising, and of course our standards in world terms are very special.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have sharply intensifying competition in the Community and sharply diminishing economic growth at a time when we are required, over a very short period, to open our frontiers to the products of industries which have been geared over the last decade to a market of over a quarter of a billion people.  Let us briefly consider <Col N="1932" /> what this will do to the three categories of industry with which we are concerned and which I have already listed.  In regard to the old industries, some branches of our food industry, as we have been seeing to our regret in the last few months, are inefficient and not capable of competing; some parts are efficient but others are not so efficient.  In regard to commodities like whiskey, presumably there will always be a future if it can be marketed effectively and if it catches on to the public taste.  Even in regard to a commodity like beer, where you have old-established, centrecity breweries and where these are on very valuable sites, and where the tendency is towards a very small number of very productive and automated breweries, the future is not particularly good, because you can supply a whole market from a small number of breweries and people say: &ldquo;We will sell the sites and set up a new brewery somewhere else.&rdquo;  I hope Guinness will never leave Dublin, and the Taoiseach knows I am not talking about a problem that does not exist.  The question of where Guinness can best be brewed, with an existing Park Royal site, is a real problem, and it will be decided by the Guinness management in the light of certain pressures that I hope our Government will be able to bring, but also in the light of where the most effective rate of profit and the easiest distribution occurs.</P>
    <P>That is the first category.  One cannot see a particularly hopeful development there because they are not on a par, most of them, and the arguments to move them closer to their consumer are powerful ones.  If, then, you take what I might call the Fianna Fáil protected industries, all their efforts at adaptation and all the examinations of these industries indicate that they are not competitive, but they are rapidly becoming competitive, and already with the half bite, because it is not fully in force yet, of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement we are seeing the appalling damage that is being done to them in terms of quality, of design and of marketing.  I do not say the material is not good; I mean the product is not just tailored to the sort of thing the housewife wants.  It is <Col N="1933" /> not easy to do that.  It is not the fault of the people.  It was not possible when you had production runs catering for a couple of million relatively poor people.  But their competitiveness, as indicated by innumerable adaptation and other documents, is low.</P>
    <P>The third category then, the post-1959 category, is the multi-nationals and these multi-nationals will tend to put their investment wherever the return is highest.  Why the return should be higher in an island beyond an island in the process of trying to equalise its social services and wages and, therefore, to diminish any competitive advantage that might have come from low wages and poor social services, why it is more profitable at the edge of the Community in that context than it is to invest in the centre of the Community nobody at any stage in this controversy has explained.  They have made feeble noises about the golden triangle being crowded; they seem to think the factories are end to end but, in fact, there are oceans of space inside that already developed area.  Now, for that, the greater industry exists inside the whole Community at the moment.  All the infrastructure is there so that the free movement of goods for our three categories of industry pose a very great threat to jobs, that free movement of goods in, and there is very little about it.  What is there about it?  Again, I do not mean this to be abusive; I think it is almost funny; I am referring to the listing of the protections against dumping on pages 99 and 100 of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>There is a definition of dumping, by the way, with which economic textbooks would not agree.  It is internationally accepted that dumping takes place when goods are exported at prices lower than those at which they are sold on the home market.  It is a very widespread practice to do this and it does not constitute dumping.  My understanding of dumping is the selling of goods below the cost of production; it is not related to the home market price, but to the cost of production price.  In fact, sellers calculate their profits in different markets on the basis of what the market will stand and often, for the sake of getting into <Col N="1934" /> overseas markets, they will sell below the home market price.  Sure, British industry in the last decade preferred to sell at home than to sell overseas because the return was always less overseas, but that did not constitute dumping when they did that, provided they were making a profit, even though it was a lesser profit than the profit at home.  However, having had that small crib, we will not argue about that.</P>
    <P>The protection then against dumping: Article 7 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality.  Now that is the one that is put first in the protections against dumping.  God help us!  If you prohibit discrimination on the grounds of nationality that takes away your power to stop dumping.  It does not give you the power to stop dumping.  It takes it away.  If you cannot discriminate against something that is Italian on the basis of nationality &mdash; let us say consumer durables where they have the enormous factories and have mopped up the rest of Europe what are you to do?  That this should be put down as a protection against dumping I find so ridiculous as to be a reversal of all meaning of language, as I understand it.</P>
    <P>There is also the suggestion that inside a single, if we had a single, economic area, by definition dumping could not take place.  Now it would not matter a bit to the little Irish industries that were knocked on the head by much bigger European communities whether semantically the process of dumping was abolished since, by definition, it cannot take place inside a single market.  It would not matter; it would be, of course, dumping in any sense in which it means a threat to our industry by big or more efficient producers who can divert maybe one day's or two days' production to abolish our national industries.</P>
    <P>Article 85 says that protection prohibits agreement between enterprises which would adversely affect member states.  We are not worried, in this particular context, so much about cartel agreements, which often exist to raise prices and prevent trade wars, but we are worried about big companies with huge volumes of production being able to get their cost of production down <Col N="1935" /> below anything we can do and knocking out our industry.</P>
    <P>Article 86 prohibits improper exploitation by enterprises with a dominant position within the Common Market.  But enterprises with a dominant economic position use that dominant position to keep their prices up as a general rule.  That is no guarantee against dumping.</P>
    <P>Article 92 prohibits state aids which distorts competition.  State aids that distort competition might conceivably give some protection to our industry against dumping and it is precisely what we need, but Article 92 takes away the protection against dumping. Four Articles of the Treaty protecting us against dumping and everyone of them does the opposite!  That is a ridiculous section.  That is pitiful.  It is on the dangerous area that the White Paper is silent &mdash; the dangerous area of the input of goods by big companies geared up to a quarter of a billion market.  That is the danger.  As protection against that danger we are offered the four fatuous protections I have read out.  Interesting silence in the White Paper, interesting weakness, because that is where the weakness of the economy lies and the threat to jobs is.  Nothing is said about that.  The Taoiseach did not mention it in his opening speech.  But we will wait in the hope that Ministers with particular areas of responsibility will give us some answers.  How do you protect jobs in small industries which are less competitive and lest cost efficient than their enormous European rivals?  That is the question.  It is a simple question, but it is an important question for Irish industry and Irish jobs.  It will be interesting to have an answer.  We say we are economically evolved enough by the whole Government position to become full members and therefore to have the free movement of goods without any let or hindrance into this country after the transition period.  Our contention is that we are not and that it will be destructive for jobs and for industry.</P>
    <P>Let us take the other great freedom which we say we are strong enough to have inside full membership &mdash; the free movement of capital.  It is our contention <Col N="1936" /> that the free movement of capital out of Ireland has been the single greatest source of our present economic impotence.  In round figures there are £300 million of publicly held Government external assets and it is impossible to tell how much are privately held.  It has been estimated about £700 million.  You are talking therefore about a billion pounds worth of external assets for 3,000,000 people which comes out at quite a lot per family.  It is a large amount of money and it is the source of the impotence of Irish industry.  No small peripheral economy that has done well in Europe or elsewhere in this century has done well on the basis of allowing the free outflow of capital.  Not the Danes.  Not the Norwegians.  Not the Austrians. Not the Swiss &mdash; the Swiss are a special case because Switzerland is one of the three or four world banking centres. Not the Finns.  You always had to dam up the accumulation of capital at home so that it sought out investment opportunities in your own country if you wanted to develop a small economy.  The great economic mistake of the half century life of this State has been the refusal to set up separate financial institutions and have our own currency.  We had a pound on it in Irish, but it meant nothing.  It was a pound sterling.  The refusal to prevent the outflow of capital has meant that we have accumulated £1,000 million assets.  But the suck of the sterling area, and it has sucked capital and people out of Ireland, will be weaker, is weaker; Britain is already sluggish and in pretty bad trouble economically on a whole series of fronts.  Where growth rates are higher, as they are in Europe, then the effect of abolishing any controls to the movement of capital will be to accentuate a process which did us the most ferocious damage in the past and is still doing us the most ferocious damage.</P>
    <P>Again, I am going to omit a section that I had intended to document &mdash; the effect of this outflow of capital.  I had intended to start off by comparing the size of the economies of England and Ireland at the time of the Act of Union in population, gross national product <i>et cetera</i> and to see the way the concentration <Col N="1937" /> of capital towards a dynamic growth centre in the last century denuded Ireland, destroyed our community, destroyed the fabric of our society.  This happened at a time when Britain was extremely rich, dynamic and rapid-growing.  It was the technological, industrial and financial leader of the world.  Far from that producing a spin-off of capital from London and the dynamic parts of the United Kingdom it produced the emptying of Scotland, parts of Wales and Ireland of people, money, industry, everything.  This tendency of a dynamic growth area to concentrate the capital into it is the second great danger which is not mentioned at all in the White Paper.  The White Paper has a tiny section on page 22.  It is paragraph 3 (48).  It contains about 12 lines.  It says that we, simultaneously with Britain, will have to dismantle the protection against the outflow that Britain had erected for her own protection. We did not do it for protection against Britain but Britain did it. From inside the sterling area if you want to invest outside it it is not just a dollar for investment in the United States&mdash;the same applies to Europe&mdash; there is this auction of investment dollars which sell at a dollar premium. That will have to go.  That is a tiny bit of protection.</P>
    <P>The great threat, along with free trade in goods, is free outflow of capital. These are the two things we cannot stand economically.  That merits 12 lines out of over 200 pages.  That is ridiculous.  That is concentration on the inessentials.  Let us take Ireland's experience with the UK in the last century when we were in the UK.  It happened in the United States at a time when the United States was the richest country in the world which it still is.  The dynamic growth of certain industrial areas has produced Appalachia. There has not been a spin-off of wealth in peripheral areas.  There has been a dragging of wealth and of people out of them so that they become dying regions, as Appalachia is.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago the Community itself produced figures on what had happened inside the Community since it started 14 years and a few months <Col N="1938" /> ago.  Indeed, there has been an increase in wealth everywhere.  Perhaps, I will not have time to talk about the fairness of Government comparisons of growth rates but they are tendentious because they compare slow-growing Britain with fast-growing Europe and suggest that there is an economic miracle in Europe.  This will not stand up to examination if you look at some of the other areas of Europe which grew just as fast as the Community or faster.  However, let us revert to what has happened inside the Community. All areas show a growth but on their own measurement of it the differences in income between the poorest regions and the richest regions did not stay the same and they did not narrow; they got wider.  The terrifying process of the concentration of capital is to be seen inside the Community at this moment from their own figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald has said on occasions that Italy is the country that benefited most in his view.  He must be aware that at this moment, were it not for a very strong public sector in Italy, the flight of capital is such that the Italian economy would be in a vastly more profound crisis than it is even now.  It is in a profound crisis and the Community's measurement of unemployment is that there are 1.2 million out of work in Italy.  There are different measurements so you can take any figure from about 900,000 to 1.2 million. That does not measure the underemployed, people who do not register. The Italian economy at this moment is seeing precisely the flight of capital, the sucking out of wealth under free movement of capital conditions that poses such a vast threat to us.</P>

      <P>Much as I am tempted, I suppose I would be wasting the time I have if I started pursuing Deputy FitzGerald.  Serious economists know that if you have very sophisticated calculating machinery, computers, and if you put into those computers every relevant statistic and modifying factor that you can think of, you get predictions.  No two models come out with identical predictions. They are quite often wrong.  That is not to say the exercise is not worth doing.  The predictions get less useful the further you get from the moment at which you are speaking.  One year away it is possible.  Five years away nobody takes seriously because there are so many imponderables.  Yet we have lighthearted predictions that result from multiplying two figures on the back of an envelope and thinking that the third figure has some economic meaning.  Deputy FitzGerald and others, as working economists, know just how little weight to give to those things because that is their trade and because they see First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion and what became of them and they see the British, the French, the Americans and everybody making predictions which turn out, with the best will and the greatest expertise, to be meaningless. They know that but unfortunate people in the street seize on figures like 50,000 jobs or the trebling of incomes by 1980 and think that they are meaningful. They have no real meaning whatever except, perhaps, to indicate that the people who take them seriously are not familiar either with the nature of statistics or the nature of the economic process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give Deputy FitzGerald the date but the source is <i>The Economist</i> within the last six weeks where there was a lengthy discussion of this topic.</P>
      <P>I have talked about the danger of the free inflow of goods and the free outflow of capital if we cannot limit it. I have said that we have suffered profoundly because we had no restraint on the outflow of capital.  We have seen the effect of that in regard to our relations with Britain.  The suck of Europe will be even greater because Europe is very dynamic.  Our contention is that not alone will the input of goods be disastrous for industry but that the outflow of capital will be disastrous for industry and employment also.  I asked a question which I made as simple as possible.  I will try to make the question about capital investment as simple as possible.  We are agreed that inside the European Community, whether it is six or ten, all barriers to the movement of capital are to be removed.  If that is the case, then why would a multi-national company striving simply, regardless of nation, to maximise its profits, able to raise capital freely pretty well everywhere because of its special position, come to Ireland if we have to make uniform our special incentives with other peripheral countries?  I know that we can retain a differential in regard to our industrial incentives&mdash;the centre of the Community will have less industrial incentives than the periphery &mdash; but I also believe that we will not be able to maintain any differential with the Norwegians and the western French, the southern Italians and the Scotch and the Welsh must harmonise their incentives, even if those incentives in the peripheral areas are less than the incentives in the central area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the arguments that make a significant amount of capital settle here rather than going into the golden triangle, the dynamic centre?  If you say that the arguments are lower wage rates, the long-term effect of the Community will be to harmonise wage rates.  If you say that they are less <Col N="1941" /> expenditure on social services the long-term effect of the Community will be to harmonise social services.  Then you are left with a Community from the west of Ireland to Berlin and from Sicily to the north of Norway where you harmonise all of the factors of competition and you do nothing that will interfere with free market forces, and this, of course, is in contradiction with the serious regional policy, but I will refer to that later.  Then, where does the industry go?  It goes to the already sophisticated and developed areas; the industry goes into the golden triangle.  If you believe that the regional policy can reverse this trend, then you are looking for a reversal of the dominance of the market place on which the whole Community is built.</P>
    <P>You are not looking for investments like £40 million for all the peripheral areas, which is tiny and insignificant; you are looking for thousands of millions of pounds, even for a country of this size; you are looking for enormous quantities of money and there is not the faintest prospect that the Community will develop a regional policy that will pump out from the centre capital on that scale.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are pleased to see the declarations of good intentions of policy.  They are a bit late but they are welcome, but we must not take anything that they say as indicating that a serious counter effort to the tendency of capital to concentrate into the centre is being mounted.</P>
    <P>In the document, <i>A Regional Policy for the Community,</i> which the committee put out in 1969, they say that they have noted that the immediate consequences of opening frontiers is an accentuation of tendencies towards geographical concentration.  That is a Community quote.  In those circumstances, there is the second great threat.  For the reason that we are not developed, that our capital does not attract the investment funds of other countries without the level of development that would raise profits to be comparable to European profit rates, then the money will get sucked out. And what stops it?  That again is a simple question.  The Taoiseach said he wanted the real issues debated.  I <Col N="1942" /> am trying to do that.  I am saying what is the protection against the free movement of goods in and I am saying now, what is the protection against the free movement of capital out?  I see nothing serious in the White Paper that even recognises that those things are problems, much less does anything about them.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances we are faced with very severe damage to the three categories of industrial jobs that I tried to talk about; we are faced with an outflow of capital that will be very serious and we are faced with this differential growth in the dynamic central areas and the peripheral areas, much slower, much weaker.  We are faced with the fact that regional policy is nothing like adequate at present and nothing visualised at this time will be significant in relation to the huge amounts of money being attracted towards the centre.  This again is serious.  This again raises the issue of what do we do to protect ourselves.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend time in analysing these capital movements in any more detail but there is one argument that I would like to deal with which relates to differential growth rates inside and outside the EEC.  The little bits of propaganda that have been put into every post office around the country show growth rates for the six countries and also the growth rate for Britain and for Ireland.  If you present it like that, of course, it looks great because the growth rates for EEC countries are much higher than the growth rates for Britain and Ireland but it just is not fair to pick the countries where growth has been exceedingly slow.  Again I go to a Community source.  I want to talk about this matter of whether some of the peripheral countries grew quickly or grew slowly and I want to make comparisons.  I refer again to a document for which I gave the reference at the beginning &mdash;<i>Enlarged Community in Figures,</i> put out by the Communities in February.  Page 7 of that document shows the average annual growth rates for the decade 1960 to 1970, which is taking it over a fair span, at constant prices, <i>per capita</i>.  The figures are: United <Col N="1943" /> Kingdom, 2.2; Ireland, 2.5.  The Six as a whole grew at the rate of 4.3. The range inside the Six was from 4.8 down to 2.6 in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>That looks very much in favour of the Community, that putting the Six countries together you got a tremendous stimulus to growth and they grew much faster.  This argument is being widely put about and it is widely believed.  In fact, I think it was believed by Mr. Donal Barrington, an eminent barrister but perhaps not quite so familiar with the figures, on our side in a recent television broadcast.  He said he conceded the great economic developments and the great economic victories of the Community.  I do not concede them for a moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at the <i>per capita</i> figure over a decade &mdash; annual growth rate for Denmark, 4.1; for Norway, 4.2.  If we did it for Austria, Finland and Switzerland then you would see that this little thing that is put into every school and every post office in the country is bogus and tendentious and is a use of public money to make party political propaganda, because, if you look at the growth rates of the small, independent, peripheral countries around the Community, leaving Britain, the sick man of Europe &mdash; it is a cliché to call it that &mdash; and Ireland out of it, then you can demonstrate neither a benefit from being in the Community nor a benefit from staying out of the Community and you can see very comparable growth rates on both sides.  In fact, economists more profound than anyone in this House would claim to be are not able to find a clear trend either way when they look at it carefully; <Col N="1944" /> they just do not know.  There are people who say, yes, there was some economic benefit from putting the Six together.  There are others who say no, there was not.  They are both serious and they are both also, which makes a nice change, willing to show the arithmetic on which they base their arguments, which is clearly lacking in our present estimates.</P>
      <P>This business that you automatically get a boost by joining the Six, that the Six got a boost by going together is bogus.  Perhaps to many it is not.  We have no way of knowing.  But that consequently we would get a boost by going in with them, for the reasons I have indicated, is profoundly misleading because of the arguments about the outflow of capital and because of the arguments about the inflow of goods.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is our contention that what we want in regard to industrial produce &mdash; and I am coming to the agricultural situation later &mdash; is the kind of agreement the Community have negotiated with many countries that were honest enough to describe themselves as less developed economies, or not fully developed economies.  I am not going to read the details of these agreements into the record because I respect the need and wish of others to make contributions.  I want to come to what free trade means and what has been obtained from the Community in the course of trading agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Free trade means that at the frontiers all hindrances, either by tariff or by quota, to industrial and agricultural goods are abolished.  There can be all kinds of pure free trade; the kind of Adam Smith textbook free trade has never existed in the world and never will exist.  You can have special financial incentives and special taxation incentives for your own producers; you can have special policy-making in regard to expenditure of public funds which benefit your own producers.  This has been the case in this country in regard to expenditure of public moneys on goods that originated inside the State.  You can have all these things which give industry protection at the time when you <Col N="1945" /> have free trade in the formal sense, namely, the abolition of tariffs and quotas.</P>
    <P>Under Community rules and ideology member states are obliged to abolish all protection by way of grants, by taxation and by special financial incentives, by Government policy in regard to expenditure and by the policy of semi-State companies.  The two kinds of free trade are not comparable. We will have to face a liberalisation of trade.  However, given our own financial resources, given control of the outflow of capital, given the right to have special kinds of grants and incentives and the right to have our own taxation system&mdash;which we will have to give away in full membership&mdash;we could protect our industries much more than we could protect them under the kind of free trade that exists in the Community.</P>
    <P>The relevant point is the agreement that was negotiated with Turkey and some other countries&mdash;the agreement with Turkey is the only one I wish to put on record.  There is an agreement between the Community and Turkey whereby the Turks will put in their industrial products immediately; in return they have to dismantle their protection, some in 12 years and some in 22 years.  In other words, they are able to get themselves a long inter-regnum in which they can grow and develop.</P>
    <P>That is called a trading agreement but it is the kind of protection we want.  We can foresee a liberalisation of trade.  There are the continuous efforts of the GATT and UNCTAD to dismantle barriers that will give some hope for the Third World, for the weaker economies to have their place in the sun and not to get crushed.  In the long run, and having regard to the responsibilities of more developed countries towards the poor countries of the Third World, this is to be welcomed. If I thought our economy was on the level of development of the other nine countries I would say that we should take our place with them and take the risks.  But the same situation does not exist here as can be seen from the figures I have given and the <Col N="1946" /> many other figures I could give.  We cannot face this free trade now.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we can get a decade or two decades of protection, when we have the free input into the Community without having to face total free competition against us because we can protect our industry by the retention of tariffs and quotas and by our own special internal arrangements of taxation, of Government policy and of financial incentives, we can have industrial growth so that we can face free trade in one or two decades.</P>
    <P>I do not find membership of the EEC unthinkable.  The EEC may develop into something reasonable or it may develop into something loathsome. I do not pretend to be able to say whether it is going to grow into a super power having nuclear weapons, building up armies and getting into a super-power race <i>vis-à-vis</i> Japan, China or America, and thereby bankrupting everybody by expenditure on arms.  I do not know if it is going to develop in that way or if it will develop into something like an enlarged Nordek.  If it develops into the latter it will be a reasonable place to be, but if it develops the other way it will be a loathsome place.  Therefore, the prudent thing is to take up a defensive posture, to keep options open, to be able to say in a decade; &ldquo;We like the way it is evolving and we will go into full membership&rdquo;.  On the other hand, if we do not like how the Community has developed we should have the option of not entering into full membership.  The point about an association agreement is that it keeps such options open.</P>
    <P>What I am saying in essence is that our industry cannot stand the full competition of European firms, it cannot run the risk of an outflow of capital. We can get our industrial growth and our right to put industrial goods into the Community without having to give up our sovereignty, without having to become full members.  This is possible, and it is an important possibility for us because we need that industrial export possibility.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to a much more difficult <Col N="1947" /> situation and the situation the pro-Common Market side have chosen to fight on&mdash;the position of agriculture. They have not chosen to fight on the danger of free trade for our goods or on the danger of the outflow of capital. They have said nothing significant about either matter and, in fact, there have been ridiculous statements made in this connection in the White Paper. Agriculture is a more difficult prospect from our point of view.  It is essential that we have a satisfactory outcome from the point of view of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the common agricultural policy.  Many of our attitudes regarding European agriculture were formed when we first applied for membership ten years ago and we have not noticed the vast changes that have taken place in the Community's agricultural policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In that period comparable indices of the things farmers buy have risen in real terms.  Farmers' costs have risen in real terms and their prices have dropped.  At this moment there is a very significant effort to give a good hike to farm prices.  It is deadlocked just now but I think the deadlock will be overcome during the next few weeks and there will be a significant rise, largely as a result of intense agitation by farmers in Brussels last spring in the light of their deteriorating economic situation which resulted in the sort of demonstration at which one person was killed.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances farmers in Europe see their position in regard to profitability deteriorating.  There are many indications that this deterioration is likely to continue and is intended to continue.  For example, when Mansholt presented his first plan to the Commission in December, 1968, he talked about his price proposals for 1969-70 and said:</P>
      <P>The price proposals are closely linked with the overall set of measures proposed.  They are part and parcel of the new strategy which the Commission hopes will be adopted for agricultural prices and which should gradually make these prices economically meaningful again. There can be no doubt that if the errors of the past were to continue, the very principles of the common agricultural policy might be undermined.</P>
      <P>The new strategy which should gradually make agricultural prices meaningful again, means a reduction of agricultural prices in real terms.  We saw that during the period 1963 to 1970.  Mansholt made it quite clear then that it was his wish that this reduction in prices in real terms should continue.  I am quoting from page 20 of the same document:</P>
      <P>Our prices are too high to enable us to export on satisfactory terms... The Community is forced, therefore, to adopt a cautious policy on prices.</P>

      <P>We will come to that later.  The point is that we can anticipate the movement of agricultural prices from what happened in other highly industrialised groupings at times when competition sharpened.  We know about the battle in Britain in the last century which culminated in the repeal of the Corn Laws and in a movement towards a cheap food policy.  Agriculture in the United States is the most capital intensive and most productive in the world.  It is the envy of the world.  Yet the farmers there are making very little or no profit.  This is not a mystery.  Books have been written about the tendencies of agricultural prices and the forces that move them.  Agricultural prices in part, not entirely, are the result of a tug-of-war. On one end of the rope you have farmers who want to sell their food for more money.  On the other end of the rope you have industrialists, who want cheap food so that they can get a cheap end product because food is a significant part of the cost of an industrial product, and workers who want cheap food so that their wages will go further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is happening at a time when the industrial and working sectors are getting stronger and the agricultural sector is getting weaker because the farmers are becoming fewer.  When you find circumstances like that, as you currently find them in the Community, you find that farm prices tend downwards. In the long run the Community is going in the direction of adopting a cheap food policy.  I developed this argument very briefly on television about ten days ago.  A German from the Commission, called Froschmeier, if my memory serves me, said to me afterwards&mdash;and it was not a private conversation&mdash;that he entirely agreed with my argument about farm prices. <Col N="1950" /> I have quoted what Mansholt said.  I have talked to many people in the Community and they are agreed that the long term tendency of farm prices is downwards in the Community.</P>
    <P>This is something one could see happening over the past nine years or so.  One can predict from various external forms of reasoning that this is likely to go on happening so that the real profits of farmers in the next decade, in my view&mdash;and I am putting it as weakly as that&mdash;will be very much less than they were in the Community in the past decade.  The erosion of farming profitability which has been taking place, and which is continuing, and which it might be argued will accelerate, has already had its effects inside the Community.  In this context I should like to put on the record of the House something which I have already quoted elsewhere.  I will have time now to quote it at greater length. I refer to the supplement, &ldquo;Europe in 1975&rdquo; to <i>The Times</i>, Wednesday, 23rd February, 1972.  An Italian, Manlio Rossi Doria, described by the newspaper as a Senator specialising in agricultural problems, wrote an article about European agriculture and a number of the things he said are quite interesting.</P>
    <P>He talked about what he called the sick man of Europe requiring a radical cure and said that the reason is not difficult to find.  He said:</P>
    <P>In spite of artificial props and the unquestioned progress of the past decades, on average the gap between the incomes and the standard of life of farmers and those of other social classes has widened.</P>
    <P>He mentioned the reasons and said there were specific reasons for this.  He said one of them was &ldquo;the farmers' reduced bargaining power on the market in relation to the increasing strength of the other economic sectors.&rdquo; That is another way of saying something I have already said.  He said:</P>
    <P>The consequences are there for all to see: the repeated postponement of structural reform; the useless enrichment of a few powerful farmers working the most fertile <Col N="1951" /> holdings; the protracted death throes of the weakest undertakings and the poorest regions... the increasing predominance of a few financial groups in the food sector; the piling up of unsaleable surpluses and the onerous Community commitment to dispose of them below cost.</P>
    <P>He talked about the erosion of prices and the way in which he sees agriculture in the Community evolving.  Many people who have looked at this&mdash;I am using this as an example&mdash;see the landscape of Europe evolving into an area of large farms like the American farms, very capital intensive, very productive but not very profitable.  When this has happened we will have lost a very valuable section of the community. I come back to the quotation from <i>The Times</i> of London of 23rd February which to my mind rings a bell.  It is this:</P>
    <P>On average or poor holdings, noted in the past for noble national traditions, the flight from the countryside would in its turn bring the danger of creating a void so vast as to make inevitable first depopulation and subsequently the return to more extensive use of land.</P>
    <P>These are not the sentiments of the anti-EEC campaign in Ireland.  They are projections given by an Italian specialist in agriculture.  There is very good reason to believe that farmer's real prices and real profits will drop. The gravy was in the early 1960s.  It was already disappearing in the late 60s and it has disappeared much more of late.  We are doing an extraordinary thing.  We are holding out extraordinary expectations to our farmers and the result is that they are bidding up the price of cattle so that there will be very little difference between EEC cattle prices and ours.  They are bidding up the price of land so that there will be very little difference between our prices and EEC prices in the expectation of some future bonanza which will simply not be there.  In the process of doing this we will lose our small farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald, in an interjection, <Col N="1952" /> said something which I am not sure he meant me to take seriously. Perhaps, he intended me to take it seriously.  I was referring to the first Mansholt Plan and I think he suggested that it had been dropped.  I am quoting from a source dated June, 1970&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  The first Mansholt Plan was put out in December, 1968 and this was 18 months afterwards. It is an article with a picture of Mansholt and it is called &ldquo;The European Community&rdquo;.  The paper is the <i>Journal of the Community</i>.  It is No. 6 and it is dated June, 1970.  It states:</P>
      <P>The broad aims of the plan, published in December, 1968, known officially as &ldquo;Agriculture 1980&rdquo;, remain unchanged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can make interjections like that but it is absolute nonsense.  We were not talking about the precise suggestions, if the Deputy will listen, for the first stage of the implementation.  We said &ldquo;The broad aims of the plan remain unchanged&rdquo;. That is the quotation.  They did remain unchanged until June, 1970, and they remain unchanged to date.  The broad aims of the plan are to get small farmers out of agriculture in what is in Belgium or in Holland or in France or in Germany a humane and reasonable way.  I do not think Mansholt is a wicked man at all.  I think he is not a bad fellow, but the point is that if you provide the cash incentive and the retraining grants you must have the industries if you are to keep people in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exercise in the White Paper about industrial growth is useless.  One could produce a contrary set of figures which would be equally meaningless. It is an exercise without meaning in regard to the number of industrial jobs because there is no effort to quantify the possible flow in either direction.  If you displace people from Irish land in <Col N="1953" /> a way perfectly humane in contemporary Europe, unfortunately, you also displace them from Ireland because the growth of industrial jobs will not be there.  What is humane and reasonable for the highly industrialised parts of France, adjacent parts of Germany, Northern Italy or Belgium, is not humane and reasonable for Ireland.  I make this general analogy about the way in which the Community functions: it functions at the centre in a sort of average way.  There is profound deadlock and then there is a package which does not satisfy anybody but throws a little bit to everybody.  That precludes the sort of fine tuning that the more specialised areas of the Community want and require.  Since we are talking about farming, if the applicants for membership are a litter, we are certainly the runt of that litter in economic terms, and if the European sow will lie on us with as little hostility as any sow has towards her litter, we are too small and insignificant and they are too large and indifferent.  Our circumstances are special.</P>
    <P>Mansholt, in the face of public opposition of course, had to water down what seemed in current political terms the outrageous immediate suggestions, but neither Mansholt nor the people around him in the Commission have given up their long-term objectives one little bit.  Indeed, it is stronger in their minds than it ever was.  Market forces are moving them in that direction.  We have had these wonderful predictions about vast growths in agricultural output.  We are told we are the only area inside the enlarged Six that possesses the precise geographical advantages.  That is just not true.  There are vast areas of France and a good deal of Britain that have many of our advantages, and you can follow that into Belgium and Holland.</P>
    <P>These projections of these vast growths are depressing because they are not based on any serious figuring that I know of.</P>
    <P>There is something I have come across recently and, perhaps, I might read it into the record because I ordered a copy but I have not got it. <Col N="1954" /> The people at Michigan University have produced a larger report of 367 pages concerned with their agricultural situation and it deals with the impact on the US agricultural trade of the accession of the UK, Ireland, Denmark and Norway to the EEC. Using a computer and a bit of sophisticated analysis, they have come to some conclusions, one of which is interesting for us.  I quote from the March issue of the British periodical <i>The Dairy Farmer</i>.  They, in turn, are quoting the document which I have not seen yet but of which I have a copy on order, as I have said.  Butter consumption, for example, is projected for 1980 to be reduced from 630,000 metric tons to 430,000 metric tons.  The magazine states that the ten-member EEC will have an overall surplus of milk.  With the current relatively high butter price, with the sharp rise in Britain, one can see a swing away from butter and into margarine.  It is happening here, it is happening in Britain and in a number of other places.  This is just the sort of real event which makes nonsense of the predictions I have been talking about. Does anybody believe that if a butter mountain emerged again the EEC would let us go on producing any amount we liked, that the Irish, the British, the Dutch or the Danes would not in any way be restricted&mdash;that they could go on and on and up and up in butter production?</P>
    <P>This is a ridiculous assumption and it is, therefore, misleading the people to suggest, even if the increases in price called out the sort of production increase which would be technically possible, that this is likely to happen. There are too many contrary forces which indicate that at a certain level you would get a cut-off of your butter production, that you would get milk production rationed between the Community members in the light of their existing levels.  You simply cannot go on and on and up and up in butter production.  If there is one thing in general that is certain about the EEC in regard to agricultural policy it is that it is in crisis and in change, that it will not remain the same&mdash;that it is moving towards big American-style <Col N="1955" /> farming with low profits and moving away from small farming; moving away from unlimited production of the things we may want to produce and moving towards much more modern, intensive farming in which only the richest will survive.  All the signs are pointing in that direction.  Therefore, our farmers have been misled.</P>
    <P>There was a brief television programme the other night and one odd thing was that one person said he did not think there is any argument in regard to agriculture against our full membership.  He did not believe there was a case.  If we had got in in 1961 we would have had a good decade but it is not 1961.</P>

      <P>It is a useful thing for people to be able to interject across the House if the interjections are serious.  I do not consider that one to be serious and I do not propose to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens to agriculture in an associate agreement?  The answer is that we do not know.  Of course it is a weakness on our side of the debate and it is strength on the Government side <Col N="1956" /> that all the time the Government are proposing something which is absolutely clear-cut and that we are proposing something which is not clear-cut and cannot be so because we cannot say what the outcome of negotiations would be.  We could not say what the terms of an associate agreement would be until they were negotiated.  I believe the correct negotiating position would have been for our Government to do, as the British Government did, to negotiate a package and decide at the end and not at the beginning.  It would have been desirable for us to negotiate a number of packages.  If I could be shown that a serious effort was made to negotiate an associate agreement and that it had totally failed then I would be satisfied that it is better to have full membership than total exclusion.  If I was convinced of that I would have to go for full membership with all the risks involved.</P>
    <P>The Government have not looked at alternatives.  They dismissed them in a few pages in the White Paper.  Now we have the extraordinary spectacle of people in the Government and people in the major Opposition party going around saying at the tops of their voices that we have no negotiating position, that we could not get this, that or the other.  Negotiations in terms of the Common Market it very much like negotiating in a commercial undertaking which farmers and other people know about.  If you are trying to drive a bargain of great advantage to yourself it is foolish to decry what you have to offer.  If the people doing that are a nation it is anti-national to decry what you have to offer.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Hillery, came back from Brussels he was heckled at the airport in a way he did not like.  He said the people who did that were anti-national.  It seems to me to be weakening a national bargaining position persistently to say that we are so weak that we could not do this, that or the other.</P>
    <P>I believe we could have done very much better than the New Zealanders did in regard to their getting agricultural products into Britain in circumstances <Col N="1957" /> in which Britain is a member of an enlarged EEC.  The New Zealand agreement guaranteed them at the end of a five-year transitional period 71 per cent of the income they enjoyed at the opening of that period.  We have to be careful about purchasing an illusory future for our agriculture at the cost of our industry and at the cost of our level of employment.  The agricultural future we are purchasing will only be good for large intensive grass farmers producing livestock products.  Even if it were permanent we are doing it at a great risk.</P>
    <P>One sees, if one takes the actual levels of production and consumption of milk and milk products inside the Community and in the African countries that the Irish problem is, in European terms, a very small one.  I am referring to figures in a Community document of January of this year.  This gives production of milk for the applicants, for the Six and also for the USA, USSR and Japan.  The production of milk in the Six is 75 million tons.  The production for the Ten is almost 100 million tons.  Our production is 3½ million tons.  It would take a decade of remarkable agricultural growth to double our milk production and we would still be talking of 7 per cent of the total production of the Ten.  We are not talking on the scale of New Zealand production.</P>
    <P>Our milk problem is very small.  The Australians, who have been sending milk products to Britain on a considerable scale, did not try to get into the enlarged Community because they have Japan on their doorsteps.  The Community knew, in negotiating with New Zealand, that the Japanese and other markets were there.  They know that our great dependence is on the British market.  There are many people in British agriculture who benefit much more than Irish farmers particularly in regard to cattle.</P>
    <P>We have some leverage in regard to the scale of our industrial connection with Britain, in regard to imports and exports, but particularly as an industrial market for Britain, and we have a very valuable strategic position astride the most important shipping lane in the world.  It seems to me with <Col N="1958" /> this on our side of the scales that the total amount of milk and milk products we are arguing about is so very small that to say we have no possibility of getting an agreement which would be much better than what exists at present, even though it might be less than we would have in full membership, is a disgraceful thing.  I see it happening on both sides, but until one goes to the bargaining table and tries, how can one know?  We have not a serious long-term difficulty in regard to the projections concerning beef.  We have certainly such difficulty in regard to milk.  The well-being of industry and tourism must be set against this difficulty.  If we preserve our country as a lower price food area and a lower wage area this could have advantage for tourism.  I know I have suggested that we might have to put up with slightly lower wages.  Will the possibility of wages identical with those in Europe be accepted or will it be accepted that our industry is slightly less involved and that we must retain wages which are slightly less but which leave us with our industry and with the possibility of growth? We may have to make such a choice. In regard to milk, if we take the scale of European consumption and production, as compared with ours, the difficulties have been magnified.  We are talking now about our own national position.  We must explore it fully.  By Mansholt's standard I am an efficient milk producer.  I say that for myself and for this country it is better to risk losing this five, seven or ten years of special advantage which we will get with regard to milk products and to get a little less while preserving our industry and our special competitive position in regard to tourism.</P>
    <P>Tourism is important in terms of gross earnings.  It is not right to judge farming in terms of the well-being of certain sorts of farmers.  Practically all milk farmers are convinced that the long-term evolution is such that in ten years' time the Community will choose to import their temperate products from lower cost producers anyway and will completely dismantle the special position in regard to butter and meat. The whole agricultural argument is <Col N="1959" /> being based on false ground.  We must keep our people in the countryside. They need more protection than the people in Germany or elsewhere.  The economic forces which are emptying the countryside must be allowed to work slowly.  People could be moved out of the country as well as from the countryside.  The actual economic and social embodiment of our Gaelic culture is in an area which is weak agriculturally. The operation of the Mansholt policy in Gaeltacht areas would result in their extinction.  The vast majority of Gaeltacht farms are not even potentially viable by Mansholt standards.  We must talk about the survival of the Gaeltacht and the survival of the countryside.  This is under profound threat.</P>
    <P>I concede some points about milk and meat prices, although with the recent rise in beef cattle prices the differential between Irish prices and Community prices is very much less than is generally presented.  We have discounted a lot of that rise already, as we discounted land rises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I find Deputy FitzGerald's logic is really almost of the kindergarten variety.  Processes in real life are vastly more complicated than that.  One cannot draw those conclusions <Col N="1960" /> so lightheartedly.  I am not going to continue talking about agriculture at any great length.  There is certainly a milk problem.  It is not right to say that it cannot be solved inside the context of an association agreement until we try.  This leaves us with the matter of our negotiating posture.  We said in advance that we wanted full membership, but we were negotiating about the duration of the adaptation mechanism and the size of our representation.  We started off substantially negotiating about nothing else.  Other things come into the negotiations later on.  The original declared negotiating policy of both the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs, as he then was, was that these were the areas in which we were concerned to negotiate.  Of course, the negotiations deepened but not nearly enough.</P>
      <P>Let me indicate some of the areas of inadequacy.  One relates to fisheries. I do not propose to pursue all the ridiculous chickens that have been hatched in the Department of Foreign Affairs at public expense or to indicate the fallaciousness of their arguments or the downright misrepresentation as I did earlier in regard to growth rates. I must refer to fisheries.  When one says something that is as untrue as this in a public document which is as serious as a White Paper it cannot be defended and there should either be an apology or an explanation or a resignation.  On page 47 of <i>The Accession of Ireland to the European Communities</i> it says:</P>
      <P>As a member of the Council we will be in a position to ensure that our national interests in the fishery sector will be provided for by appropriate arrangements including the maintenance of special limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take special notes of those words. They are not true.  It is known that they are not true.  &ldquo;To ensure&rdquo; means what it says&mdash;to make sure of something. The position is that there is a derogation from the fisheries policy for ten years.  After the ten years, unless there is unanimity among the ten&mdash;and we have not the veto although the other nine have the veto on us&mdash; no special arrangements can be continued. The derogation then lapses and <Col N="1961" /> the full fishery policies come into operation.  That is what was negotiated. The Norwegians fought a bit more and finally surrendered.  Their Minister went home and resigned, saying that he could not protect their limits in the future.  Our Minister came home and said we could, which is not true.</P>
    <P>I would like in this context to refer to a speech made in Oslo by the Norwegian Foreign Minister on the 14th January, 1972.  I am quoting from an unofficial translation, circulated by the Norwegian Embassy in London.  I refer to pages 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 23.  This raises the question of the nature of our negotiations.  The references I have to make are partly about fisheries and partly about a protocol on agriculture which has not been widely referred to and which the Norwegians secured and we neither sought nor secured.  In regard to the fisheries proposal, there is a very interesting comment which occurs on page 22 of this document of the Norwegian Foreign Minister.  I shall read the two concluding sentences of the previous paragraph, also on page 22, so that Deputies can get the flavour of the bit that interests me particularly:</P>
    <P>At an early stage in the negotiations the Norwegian delegation proposed that fishing within the fishery limits should be based on the same principles as those valid in the Treaty of Rome in the sector relating to the right of establishment.  This would mean that foreign fishermen would have to be domiciled in Norway in order to carry out fishing within the Norwegian fishery limit.</P>
    <P>This is a very useful protection but the interesting paragraph is the next one:</P>
    <P>During the enlargement negotiations we were not supported in our proposal by the Community or the other applicant states.</P>
    <P>One can see why the British might not want to support the Norwegian initiative and possibly why the Danes might not wish to do so, but why did we not support it if we were negotiating seriously about protecting our fishermen?</P>
    <P>I shall quote now from page 23:</P>
    <P>As early as September 22nd, 1970, <Col N="1962" /> the Community stated that it was prepared to recognise, in due course, the attention which it will be appropriate to ascribe to the problems faced by Norway in the fisheries sector.</P>
    <P>The interesting sentence here is:</P>
    <P>No other applicant state received a statement of this kind from the Community.</P>
    <P>The Norwegians got that statement: we did not.  Why not?  The problems of our inshore fishermen are at least as acute as theirs.  But let us look at the agricultural protocol.  I said earlier that we had special problems in regard to our small farmers and that the rules that might be very good for Holland or Belgium might be very bad for Ireland and that we could not allow the policies to be applied equally over the whole Ten except at terrible social cost to our countryside.  The Norwegians talking about their negotiations said&mdash;I am quoting page 18:</P>
    <P>The greatest difficulty during the agriculture and fisheries negotiations has therefore involved reconciling EEC's regard for fundamental provisions with Norwegian demands for special arrangements for agriculture and fisheries beyond certain transitional periods....</P>
    <P>On page 19, we find:</P>
    <P>The Norwegian agriculture protocol on which agreement has been reached constitutes a supplementary arrangement for Norway in addition to the common agricultural policy. The preamble to the protocol specifically recognises that problems cannot be solved by means of a transition period, and that it will therefore be necessary to have special arrangements which, without constituting precedents, will aim at maintaining the standard of living of Norwegian farmers, while observing the rules of the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>The measures which may be taken, according to the protocol, to achieve this objective, is a system of support.  The support that may be granted in accordance with these provisions is to be a support system which &ldquo;will vary according to <Col N="1963" /> regions and the categories of farmers concerned.  The measures to be taken are to be adapted in accordance with the various types of production&rdquo;.  It is furthermore made clear that a number of the support measures at present in use in our agriculture may still be used.  This applies for instance to such cost-reducing measures as subsidies for chemical fertiliser and feed concentrates. Our operating subsidies will also be compatible with the provisions of the protocol.  I might mention that the support system may comprise every branch of agriculture and horticulture, and that Norway will be in a position to continue using freight subsidies both for agricultural produce and for farm equipment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the most important single sector in agriculture, viz. milk, the following provisions are contained in the protocol...</P>
    <P>On page 21 it says:</P>
    <P>The system laid down in the Norwegian protocol has no time limit.  The protocol is an annex to, and consequently a part of, the Accession Treaty.  It is therefore just as lasting as the treaty of which it constitutes a part.</P>
    <P>If my predictions for the next five or ten years are correct about the evolution of farm price policy and if by European standards diminishing profits are to continue in farming and if market forces are to root people out of the countryside it will be interesting to remind the Irish farmers that the Norwegians negotiated a protocol for their farmers open-endedly but we did not and that our Taoiseach professes to be very satisfied with the terms we got.  Had he said that they were the best we could get, that we do not like them, that might be a defensible position, but the eulogies we heard today of what we got do not stand up to examination.</P>
    <P>We have seen how an association agreement would be vastly more advantageous to our industry because we could place goods on the European market and we could now phase out <Col N="1964" /> our protection over a decade at least and possibly two decades and even when we phased out tariffs and quotas we could retain special protections by differential taxation and by direct aid by Government policy.  In a number of ways we could distort free competition which our industry cannot survive; we could give the special benevolence of a government which is essential for our industry.  The case is overwhelming in regard to industry that an association agreement would be much more advantageous for us than full membership.</P>
    <P>The case is then made that for the sake of agriculture we must go in, that we have no option even if it is very destructive for industry.  I have talked about the evolution of agricultural prices and the evolution of the agricultural situation of the Community and about the probable development of the countryside.  I think our farmers are buying a pig in a poke and are being misled.  But if we go in, time and events will become the judges.  I argue that, even if we go in, we could have got a protocol like that of the Norwegians which might not seem particularly advantageous to us now, but if my predictions are right over the next five or ten years it would be profoundly advantageous to us in a decade and we shall bitterly regret its absence in less than a decade, because the Norwegians carried this fight about their fisheries alone and without success in their case, but carried a fight alone about an agricultural protocol with a success that is very valuable to them and the lack of which is a serious defect for us.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to talk of what one might call the politics of the situation. There are people in Fine Gael who for a long time have believed that we should opt for full membership.  Of course, they are entitled to that belief but for the reasons I have given I think they are wrong.  They believe that to be European it is necessary to favour full membership.  I would remark in passing that in so far as this party are concerned we yield face to no one in being European, in our concern with Europe, in our appreciation, in our understanding of it and in our wish to <Col N="1965" /> participate in it, but we deny that to be European one must be in favour of full membership.  The political point I wish to make is this: surely in the light of the threat to industry and to our small farmers and of the failure to protect our fisheries and of the lack of a protocol regarding protection for certain sectors of our economy and of the real threat to sovereignty, it would have been prudent for Fine Gael to say that they were in favour of full membership but that they could not accept the terms that have been negotiated?  The reality is that Fine Gael are now the prisoners of the Taoiseach on this issue.  It will be the articulateness of certain Members of Fine Gael that may be the determining factor in deciding which way the referendum will go.  At this moment I do not know how it will go.  I am aware that certain soundings of public opinion have been taken but have not been published.  The fact that they have not been published interests me because I conclude that, should they be published, they would conclude that my side would be favoured rather than the other side.  I understand they give a rather equivocable answer.</P>
    <P>The position now is that there is an alliance on a crucial issue between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  The way in which Fianna Fáil negotiated this issue and the package they brought back have been in line with their inadequacy on almost every issue during the past two years.  They are now a Government of extraordinary weakness, incompetence, negligence and indifference and give the impression of being preoccupied all the time with something else.  The package they brought back is in line with the quality of their performance across the whole spectrum. They jumped blindly and abandoned the sort of protective and defensive position that a weak economy and a weak nation like ours requires.  What they did in opting for full membership was extraordinarily dangerous and irresponsible.  They did not consider the alternatives but acted in panic and in a desire to shift responsibility elsewhere and to get out of the job of governing.</P>
    <P>What depresses me is that Fine Gael have gone along with them.  It would <Col N="1966" /> have been no diminution of Fine Gael's admiration for Europe and no change in their traditional policy of being in favour of Europe to have said that, while they approved of the idea, they could not accept the terms that have been negotiated because of the danger involved for jobs and for industry as well as for small farmers, fishermen and all the other special interest groups that will be at a disadvantage.  It would have been a magnificent opportunity for them to have pulled down a weak and incompetent Government and to have gone back to Brussels and negotiated a satisfactory package.  I am interested in the fact that Fine Gael did not choose to do this, but I am disappointed also because they have allowed themselves to be brainwashed by a small number of people and to be carried away by arguments that do not stand up to examination.  I have not heard any arguments from anybody which convince me that our industry can stand up to the full blast of competition. There is no argument that can convince me that we will not suffer a flight of capital more grievous than in the past or that over a decade our small farmers will not have suffered very severely.</P>
    <P>For a country as weak and as fragile as ours and one that is still striving towards nationhood, should we not need a posture that is protective and cautious?  Should we not need a good defensive position?  Should we not need to keep our options open, perhaps to go into the Community if we evolve well and if they evolve well?  What we are doing is irrevocable in reality if not in law.  Surely the greatest defence of national interest would be a position strong in defence, cautious and circumspect, a position of compiling a balance sheet of the pros and contras for all the possible alternative relationships, of measuring the advantages and disadvantages&mdash;there are both&mdash;of an association agreement by comparison with full membership?</P>
    <P>It may be that I am wrong as to the dangers to our industry and to our free trade from the big European factories. As a probability, perhaps there is a 50-50 chance that I am wrong, but even that would mean that our industry <Col N="1967" /> would be wiped out substantially. The experience of the north of Scotland and of those parts of the United States that used to be industrialised has been that when an area is emptied, it is very difficult to refill it.  My argument about the flight of capital does not have to be right but, again, if the probability is only 50-50 will it not damage profoundly our country and take people out with it?  Is it not a dangerous and foolhardy policy to put everything at risk?  By association agreement, we would be keeping the options open as to joining and we would retain the power to protect our industry while retaining the power to export.  We run some risks in agriculture and we cannot quantify them until we negotiate but we have a lot to bring to a negotiating table provided we do not talk away our own position.  Therefore, I am disappointed and even a little shocked that Fine Gael should have delivered a sterile victory, that is, provided the people listen to the two larger parties.  If the people vote for entry, this sterile victory will turn back on those who won it because I believe that during the next decade my arguments will be seen to be correct and then the people will judge who told them the truth.  Deputy Cosgrave said here that the Government had no chance of being successful in the referendum without the support of Fine Gael.  My view is that Fine Gael are participating in something that is foolhardy and reckless.  They will be abandoning a path of prudence and safety. It is possible yet for them to say that they cannot accept the terms that have been negotiated.  It is possible for us to say we approve of the Community as well as approving of Europe but that we are not satisfied with the terms because the case of our country is a special one.  We are only half as developed as the other countries and we do not control our financial institutions so that the rules that will be good for these other countries will be destructive for us.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is no way at the moment of predicting what will be the outcome of the referendum because there are so many imponderables of Irish life that is so turbulent <Col N="1968" /> now.  Therefore, I am not speaking of a likelihood but of a possibility when I say that if this referendum is passed we will not alone be abolishing the chance of ever growing to nationhood, which we have not yet done, but, in regard to community, population and tradition, we will be abolishing a good deal of Ireland.  As somebody said recently, it will be the last action we will ever take as something almost a nation if we vote ourselves in.  Fine Gael will have to bear a very heavy responsibility for that.</P>
    <P>I want to develop one thought, I hope seriously and responsibly, because it is an area in which irresponsibility would be very easy and in which irresponsibility has occurred, in regard to the EEC and national unity. The North of Ireland has suffered from the flight of capital just as profoundly as the South of Ireland.  We have to try to think and to argue for Ireland as a whole in this Assembly here.  We claim to do so and we do not often do so.  Even with a subsidy running at £150 million a year, unemployment in Northern Ireland is desperately high. Many industries are in crisis.  The concentration of capital into the south east of England is damaging the North just as much as the South, and £150 million a year is not strong enough to counter that general tendency.</P>
    <P>There is only one way that I see that a significant majority of Northern Protestants could ever opt to join the Republic.  That one way is for us to be better off than they are.  If we take it that we can have the votes of the 40 per cent of the Catholics for joining and 60 per cent of the Protestants want it the other way&mdash;we have got used to talking over the last couple of years in the crude religious terms that would have shocked us two years ago but which now, unfortunately, represent a real polarisation.</P>
    <P>How do you ever persuade enough, after the events of the last two years, to come over to the point of wanting a unified Republic if you are going to forswear the use of violence as a persuader? It is only by having a higher standard of living.  If my argument is correct about the flight of capital from both parts, the only way we can ever establish a differential in our favour <Col N="1969" /> between the Six Counties and the Twenty-six Counties is for us to have an association agreement, not to be full members.  If Britain goes in and we stay out, they will suffer the flight of capital; they will suffer the loss of jobs and of people, and we will be able to retain the capital, because then there will be a real barrier between the City of London and us in regard to the flow of £s.  That is not a bad thing.  It is an essential thing for national development. Then we can dam up the capital here.  Then we can have a regional policy ourselves, not from Brussels, and we can direct industry.  Then we can have the sort of industrial growth that will produce the differential that will make the Republic of Ireland attractive.  Nothing else will.</P>
    <P>The solution of the problem of unity that abolishes the Border is also a solution, in my view, that abolishes this nation.  Certainly, it abolishes this State in any real sovereign sense and, therefore, is no solution.  An association agreement which gives us the possibility of the industrial growth that will make us more attractive is the only solution that, not just in my lifetime but the lifetime of anyone now living would make it attractive to enter a Republic for people who are Northern and Protestant and value their link with the United Kingdom.  For us to accept an economic dispensation which would come to us with full membership and which would empty our country and diminish the possibility of real industrial growth in the way I have argued earlier on is to give up any possibility of ever establishing an economic differential in our favour such as would make it attractive for any minority of the Northern Protestant population ever to opt for joining this Republic.</P>
    <P>I have tried not to use emotive terms at any stage and to make this an economic argument.  The dearth of serious economic projections about job opportunities, the movement of capital and the movement of people in full membership circumstances is very striking.  How is it that we can have sophisticated economic work about all sorts of national matters, that we have the Economic and Social Research Institute, <Col N="1970" /> that we have a number of university departments, that we have a fairly large volume of very elegant economic work going on in the country, and no economist has faced the question: how do you create the jobs set out in the White Paper?  What will the balance of capital inflow and outflow look like?  What will the balance of the inflow and outflow of people look like?  What will the competitiveness of Irish industry be? Nobody has tried to quantify those, and the reason is not indifference or accident.  The reason is that were these studies to be carried out by the standards and techniques accepted by serious economists everywhere, they would reveal just the sort of dangers I have been pointing out.  Therefore, our opposition to this motion, the amendment to which I must thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me permission to move at this late time is, I think, justified.  In it we deplore the inadequacy of the negotiations.  The negotiations should have protected job opportunities; they should have protected us against the full blast of industrial free trade; they should have had an agricultural protocol; they should have protected our fisheries more extensively by making common cause with the Norwegians.  They should have done many things they did not do.</P>
    <P>The White Paper sets out the terms adopted.  The belief in Irish independence and Irish sovereignty, though it is often expressed in mystical terms, was not a mystical thing.  It expressed the intuitive knowledge of the people that no peripheral and weak economy ever developed in free trade conditions. The great upsurge of Irish republicanism and the wish for sovereignty came after a century of participating in an economic community when we were part of the United Kingdom.  It was the knowledge of every farmer and every worker, although the workers were fewer, of what that meant in terms of loss of capital and loss of opportunites that turned the Irish people into a nation of separatists who wanted economic independence.</P>
    <P>We believe, therefore, that we are <Col N="1971" /> upholding the best interests of the Irish people.  We recognise the danger of being cut out of the Community.  We believe that by negotiating an association agreement we could have overcome that.  We believe the time still exists to negotiate it, because we believe that the Norwegians and very possibly the Danes will not become members.  There seems a less than even money chance of the Norwegians voting themselves in and, if they stay out, it seems that the Danes, who, on balance, want to go in but who have a great sense of Nordic solidarity, will stay out also.  Therefore, we may have a completely new ball game with Norwegians, Danes, Swedes, Finns, Austrians, all trying to finalise the sort of agreement in the near future which we need, close association but not full membership.</P>
    <P>We urge the House to adopt this amendment and we urge the people, when the date is finally announced on which they may express their opinion in the month of May, to reject the terms on which the Government have negotiated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with considerable attention to Deputy Keating and I followed his arguments with interest during the course of his comments. I agree with him that the decisive factor, subject to the people's view on this referendum, is the attitude of this party.  I agree with him that some of the terms might be better than they are.  But I am a pragmatical politician and I have to decide this issue on the terms that are put before us.  Where I disagree with him is where he seeks to suggest that Fine Gael could, by some action, have defeated the Government.  I recollect two occasions in recent years when there was an election opportunity offered to the Labour Party and that party sat on the fence and allowed Fianna Fáil to be re-elected. Because of that decision I reject the suggestion from any quarter that we have been in some way deficient. I look at the record of this party, <Col N="1972" /> a party I have seen grow from 25 to over 50 Deputies in my time here. There are two lessons to be learned from that.  One is that, if you have the will to fight and you survive, you can increase your strength; the other is that it demonstrates our faith in the democratic process as entitling the people to assert, through the ballot box, their views and to get effect given to those views through the force of public opinion.</P>
      <P>This referendum is, I believe, coming at a time when it is being foreshadowed, as it were, by a debate which is taking place in utterly unreal circumstances.  There is an air of unreality about this debate for some of the reasons that Deputy Keating put clearly and well before the House. There is at the present time a lack of confidence in the Government and that lack of confidence stems from the belief that it is both weak and indecisive. There is a threat to the very fabric of this State which transcends party politics and personalities.  I subscribe to the view expressed by Deputy Keating that one of the ways in which the people in Northern Ireland could be attracted into this State is by making it more prosperous and, therefore, more attractive for them to come in here because they would be better off in here than they would be elsewhere. That opportunity certainly offered on one occasion.  But the opportunity was missed because party and personality took precedence over the people's or the national interest. Whether it will ever return again is a matter of conjecture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This discussion and the referendum are being held in circumstances and conditions that are unparalleled since the establishment of this State.  They certainly have been unparalleled for 50 years.  One of the important elements to get clearly and unmistakably before the electorate at this juncture is that the institutions of this State are going to last and the people and those elected by them are determined that they are going to last.  Secondly, the decision taken on this matter will be the decision of the people.  Whether it is for or against, it will be the people's decision and the politicians will naturally <Col N="1973" /> and properly have to accept that decision.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise the challenge that there is to the democratic institutions established here.  There is a challenge.  Because it is more obvious in the North of Ireland than it is here, it is, nonetheless, a real challenge and there is an inescapable obligation on public representatives and political parties to ensure that our democratic institutions, with all their defects, must be preserved and will be defended as representing the best interests of the Irish people.  Having accepted this, I believe the issue is relatively clear.</P>
    <P>The Common Market is now a fact of life.  It is an institution of six countries which came together with the objective of unifying Europe and developing aims and objectives to which most Deputies here would subscribe. We, in common with other countries, sought membership just a decade ago.  It is not necessary now to recount why we did not adhere to the Community before this.  It is not necessary to recount what happened to prevent the enlargement of the community.  If the Community is enlarged, and it now looks as though it is almost certain that it will become a Community of six plus Britain&mdash;whether the other two applicant countries and ourselves join depends on the results of the referenda in these countries&mdash;we must look at the facts of the situation on the assumption that Britain is as good as in.  If we take our present trade with Britain and the trade we have with the EEC countries the total amounts to about 80 per cent of our total trade.</P>
    <P>The European Economic Community operates, and this is an accepted fact, a common external tariff against non-members under a customs union in full operation for the benefit of member States.  If, therefore, Britain, with which we have almost 70 per cent of our total trade, becomes a member and we then have the EEC and Britain together, then just 80 per cent of our total trade would be with this enlarged Community.  A common external tariff would apply against non-members.  It would apply against us.</P>
    <P>Whatever argument there is, and I do not deny that there are aspects of <Col N="1974" /> the agreement that could be improved &mdash;I will refer to detailed provisions later&mdash;the fact is that, whatever alternative there is to full membership, there is no alternative to free trade in industrial goods.  Whether we have a trade agreement, some form of association or full membership, it is recognised and accepted that the aim of the Community is to work towards and operate free trade arrangements in any event.  That would put at risk here a total of 35,000 people in industrial employment.  At the same time, we would have no direct say in Community decisions.  To a great many people these are in many respects academic questions.  The average individual looks at the proposal and tries to analyse the alternative.  Having done that, he or she will decide for or against.  This is the issue the electorate will have to decide when the referendum is held.  There is no point now in failing to disclose the actual date of the referendum.  There are 31 days in May. On the assumption that it will not be held on a Sunday or on a Saturday, and it is unusual to have elections on either a Monday or a Friday, it leaves Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of four weeks.  It should be possible to come to a decision on which day in which of these weeks it is proposed to have the referendum.  It would simplify matters.  I think it is symptomatic of the indecision that characterises this Government that they cannot announce on this date, 21st March, on what date in May the referendum will take place.</P>
    <P>That is beside the point.  What we have to decide and what we believe the people have to decide is, on the basis of the proposals that are put before the country and on the alternatives that are available, where does the balance of advantage lie.  I approach this entirely in a pragmatic fashion.  I think people generally subscribe to the idea of European unity, to the aims and objectives of bringing the countries of Europe closer together and of trying to eliminate the dissensions and causes of conflict that have bedevilled and affected Europe, particularly affected it twice in the last 50 years.</P>
    <P>Leaving these altruistic aims aside, this is mainly, for the average individual, an economic or a social question. <Col N="1975" /> Whether he is a farmer, an industrial worker, a manufacturer or an urban dweller, no matter what his calling in life or his occupation, it is a question of economics or social interest that will decide the question.  These are the issues that have to be decided and these are the questions that the average voter will have to ask himself when he comes to vote.  Without again outlining the aims of the EEC in dealing with the ending of conflicts which divide Europe, the economic aims were to improve by joint action the working conditions and living standards of the people of Europe, to abolish the outdated barriers which split up western Europe in small protected markets, to speed up technological progress and to make possible large scale operations in the increasing number of industries in which it was essential and to make a special joint effort to help the less favoured areas of the Community and its other associates.  With that end in view a number of decisions were taken by the EEC and certain actions were taken as a result of which this is the kernel of the question that the people will have to decide in the referendum.</P>
    <P>The facts disclose that the EEC, and here I recognise and admit that its growth in recent years has not been as spectacular as it was initially, over the last 14 years was one of the fastest growing economic areas of the world. Between 1958 and 1970, a period of 12 years, the GNP of the Community increased by 90 per cent in real terms. This compares with 61 per cent here and in the United States and 42 per cent in the UK.  The Community at the same time achieved improvements in living standards while having a low unemployment rate, 2½ per cent average as against about 8 per cent here. Trade in the Community increased, it is estimated, five-fold between 1958 and 1970 and EEC trade with nonmember states accounts for 20 per cent of the world's imports and exports. This compares with over 18 per cent in the United States, 8.5 per cent in the UK and 8 per cent in Japan.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, this country and the other applicant countries become members of the Community under the <Col N="1976" /> terms of the Treaty of Rome we will have free access to a market of 250 million people. On this basis we would have a much larger market than we have at present.  I have repeatedly expressed the view that no one owes us a living, that no other country or no other combination of countries will provide this country or its people with a living. We will have to earn it ourselves.  It does not matter whether we trade with one country or a number of countries this is a task that must be undertaken by ourselves and nobody else will do it for us.  However, the advantages of this Community and the benefits which will flow from it are there to be earned if we are fit to earn them.  The problems involved in remaining outside it would be considerable if Britain became a member and if there was a common external tariff operated against us.</P>
    <P>This is a very large assumption, but provided conditions are stable here, provided we make it clear as a united people, irrespective of party politics, that the rule of law is going to run and that unauthorised action by any section or group will not be tolerated; provided that is implemented in practice no matter what the cost, then I believe that the confidence which was there and which may be temporarily eroded&mdash;and in this the Government have a responsibility that they cannot evade&mdash;the confidence there was in the stability of our institutions, in the rectitude of our public finance and the manner in which we administer our affairs, will again attract outside investment. Despite recent events that have coloured outside views of this country there probably is still an inflow of foreign capital on the assumption that the present problems, grave and serious as they are, and damaging as they are to the external view of this country, are a passing condition of affairs.  A recent survey which was published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 11th March carried out by Daiwa Securities, one of the top three merchant banking houses in Tokyo, showed Ireland as rating high as an attractive base for Japanese industrialists.</P>

      <P>In the &ldquo;Note&rdquo; in the Fourth Schedule, on pages 8, 9 and 10, to delete the words &ldquo;in the smallest characters compatible with legibility&rdquo; in each case and substitute &ldquo;in 6-point type&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>To be quite frank with you, Sir, it is really not up to me to make the case about this matter in the Bill.  It is much more a matter for the Minister.  I have suggested that the words &ldquo;in the smallest characters compatible with legibility&rdquo;, which are void because of uncertainty and which have been interpreted in various sizes throughout the country, should be deleted and the words &ldquo;in 6-point type&rdquo; should be substituted.

Therefore, I suggested in the amendment the type which is the smallest known to me, the 6-point type.  I am quite certain that there are smaller types of print.  The 6-point type is legible, even to an ordinary man like myself when I am wearing my spectacles.  I hope Deputy Browne will help me out and will speak on the amendment.  I should like to ask a question of Deputy Browne as distinct from the Minister.  What is the smallest size of type that can be printed without splotching?</P>

I do not mind if &ldquo;in 10-point type&rdquo; is substituted for my &ldquo;in 6-point type&rdquo;. <Col N="1978" /> What I object to, and rightly so, is the size of type shown on the ballot paper produced by Deputy Hogan, which was 24-point type, which is nearly two-and-a-half times the size that Deputy Browne suggests.  Deputy Browne's suggestion is quite acceptable to me.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Minister was genuine on the last occasion when he talked about contracts for seven years. I shall not dilate this evening on the value of money, the way it is going and all that kind of thing, but I do not think the Minister was genuine about contracts being for seven years.  They may be in existence but they are not going to stand up, if I am any judge of the situation.

      <P>I rise to support Deputy O'Donovan's amendment.  We discussed on the last day the question of eliminating the numbers altogether and the Minister is not prepared to agree to that.  He seems to wish to retain the number for some reason of checking.  It has never been used, has never been of any use, since the State was founded and we saw no reason why it should be retained.  In view of the recalcitrance of the Minister on <Col N="1979" /> this issue Deputy O'Donovan put in an amendment to substitute a point type which he was told was the smallest type that would be available to print numbers.  None of us is a printing expert.  We can only take what we are told in a matter like this.  Deputy O'Donovan has also intimated now that he is prepared to accept a bigger type if it is impossible to print the point type that he has suggested in his amendment.  That is being very reasonable. I am sure it will beget an equal degree of reasonableness on the part of the Minister.  I am confident of that. We will see when he is replying what he intends to do about it.  In the absence of agreement to remove the number, this is the furthest we can go to render the voting of electors as untraceable as possible.</P>
      <P>The main purpose here was to eliminate any element of suspicion that the ordinary citizen might have that his vote could in some circumstances be traced, to ensure that the absolute secrecy of the ballot was preserved. There is no other purpose in looking to have the number on the back of the voting paper abolished or made as small as possible.</P>
      <P>Former Electoral Acts stated that the number was to be as small as would be legible.  That was a rather indefinite, imprecise way of stating the case. Deputy O'Donovan has attempted to lend a reasonable degree of precision to that by putting in a specific measurement, a measurement based on some kind of points system used and understood by printers.  I ask the Minister would he not consider the amendment.</P>
      <P>I understand that in this country the voting papers are kept after the election for some period.  I do not know exactly how long they are kept.</P>

      <P>Perhaps, the Minister would leave that to the Ceann Comhairle. The Ceann Comhairle is sufficiently strict without the Minister trying to help him or to put bad thoughts into his head.  I am merely putting the point to the Minister.  If he has any information on it he might be kind enough to give it to us.  He is in a position to be better briefed on practices elsewhere than I or Deputy O'Donovan would be.  As the Minister says, we are dealing only with the number on the back of the voting paper and the amendment specifically deals with that but on this occasion we are entitled to a little latitude.  I do not wish to pursue that aspect any further.  This amendment is a reasonable one and I am hopeful that the Minister will acknowledge this and accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to be as reasonable as possible.  If I <Col N="1981" /> thought this amendment desirable I would accept it but I outlined last week some of the difficulties I face with regard to the size of the numbers. The effect of this amendment would be to make it obligatory under law that the serial numbers printed on the back of ballot papers for use in referenda be in 6-point type.  There is a practical reason which makes it essential for me to oppose the amendment.</P>
      <P>The contract for the printing of ballot papers for use in the referendum on accession to the EEC has been arranged by the Stationery Office.  The Stationery Office have taken up the matter of the size of numbers on the ballot papers with the contractors. They have ascertained that if serial numbering of the size specified in the amendment were to be used on the ballot papers for the referendum it would be necessary to have numbering boxes of the appropriate size made to specification by a firm located abroad. They have indicated that a period of approximately three months would have to be allowed for delivery.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said in the House today, the intention is to hold the referendum probably in May.  If we were obliged to await the supply of papers bearing 6-point serial numbers the referendum would be held up for several months and there would not be any guarantee of the actual delivery date for the small numbering boxes.  As Deputies are aware, the referendum must be held not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days from the date I make the order fixing the referendum.  It would be an impossible situation if the making of the order had to be postponed on such an indefinite basis pending delivery of the relevant numbering boxes.  I think the House will accept that in the circumstances I have no option but to oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I should like to repeat that I accept the point made by Deputies that the wording of existing legislation on this matter is somewhat indefinite.  I expressed my intention to consider this matter and to see if smaller numbers could be used in the numbering of ballot papers but I cannot afford to leave myself in a position <Col N="1982" /> with no room to move.  If I make it law now and the machines are not available&mdash;I do not know when they will be available, an estimate of three months has been given&mdash;it is on the cards that acceptance of this amendment, even the 10-point type the Deputy has recommended now, could mean the holding back of the referendum date and I do not think the House would accept that that would be a reasonable thing to do.  However, for future elections I am having a look at this matter to see if smaller lettering boxes could be acquired.</P>
    <P>I have checked with the Stationery Office and asked them to get in touch with the contractors with whom arrangements have been made for the printing of the ballot papers with regard to the size of the serial numbers. They have informed the Stationery Office that the smallest size serial number available for use on the machine which must be used is 14-point. The machine in question has a high speed and the type is set in curved form.  This machine must be used because some two million ballot papers must be printed in a short space of time.</P>
    <P>I think the House should accept the difficulties I face in this matter and accept my expression of intent in relation to considering it for future elections and, if necessary, availing of future legislation proposing amendments in the electoral law.  I have already informed the House that I intend to introduce this legislation some time in the future.  I could avail of that occasion to introduce legislation governing the size of type but I could not accept it at the moment in view of the difficult position the Government and the House would find themselves in in relation to the forthcoming referendum because the machines are not now available.  I do not think it would be desirable to get the work done abroad.</P>

      <P>The Minister has mentioned 14-point type but I think Deputy O'Donovan can accept that is a face of about 10-point type.  They speak of a 14-point body with a 10-point numbering face but I doubt if there is any difference between what <Col N="1983" /> the Minister has said here and what Deputy O'Donovan is looking for.  The Deputy said that he would be prepared to accept 10-point and I have said that as far as I am aware this is about the smallest numbering face we have with the box numbering machines.</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Minister that we are not blind. All kinds of print may not be as legible for me now but I know the different sizes when I see them.  The Minister has said that he has made a contract for 14-point type.  Let us put in this figure; if the Minister will not accept that suggestion I will know where he stands.  If he is not prepared to do this it will be obvious that the Minister is not being honest in this discussion.  Although I have considerable respect for Deputy Browne, I do not believe the ink would blot on the 6-point type.  However, I am prepared to be reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want a number on the ballot paper, and neither does Deputy Hogan.  We are both right but if the Minister does not want to be reasonable I cannot stop him.  He is raising the size all the time; it is 10-point, 12-point or 14-point.  With respect to the Minister, I take it that the company that are going to print two million ballot papers has every kind of type and in enormous quantities.  The Minister need not try to fool me.  I have had enough to do with the printing of books and so on to know something about the various kinds of type <Col N="1984" /> and to realise that any company have these kinds of type in enormous quantities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am aware of the steps that are being taken to ensure that it will not be held in April or May.  I will not do anything about it.  Once in a lifetime is often enough for that kind of job.  I realise that I am laying my head on a block once again, but will the Minister give me his word that he will arrange to have the numbers printed in 10-point type, as suggested <Col N="1986" /> by Deputy Browne?  I believe that there is not a snowball's chance in hell of the referendum being held in April or May of this year.  The Minister's case falls down straight away.  If the referendum is not held until the autumn, how will the Minister look in relation to this discussion which has been going on for the past fortnight with Deputy Hogan and myself trying to persuade him to see reason on this matter.  I departed from my original intention of trying to have no number on the back of the ballot paper&mdash;the right thing&mdash;and I agreed to try to have a number in 6-point type.  I have now accepted Deputy Browne's suggestion of 10-point type but the Minister wants it to be bigger and bigger.  He can do what he likes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I was referring to the survey that was carried out, as reported in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, of 11th March, by three Tokyo merchant banking houses.  That survey considered the opportunities which were available in Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland and Ireland was rated highest with 40 per cent of the possible marks, the Netherlands 31 per cent and Belgium 27 per cent. One of the factors which, apparently, influenced the decision was the absence of a language barrier.  Also the traditional ties with the United States were regarded as of importance.</P>
      <P>However, the facts of this situation, as has been repeatedly emphasised, indicate that after the EEC has been enlarged and Britain and the Six&mdash;for the moment leaving aside the two other applicant countries&mdash;are one, we will realise that 80 per cent of this country's trade has been with Britain.  This alone justifies a positive decision on our part in the sense that to reject the opportunity of membership and to put at risk not only agriculture but employment in a number of existing industries that export to these markets would be an unwarranted decision.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I believe it is important that we should at the same time look at the disadvantages.  It is a mistake to present this to the electorate as a decision which provides only opportunities of employment.  We must also put to them that there are certain disadvantages involved and that it is advisable to consider them and to enumerate them so that it can be clearly understood what the disadvantages are and what action can be taken to minimise, or to offset in certain cases, these disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be an increase in the cost of living.  It is, however, a statistical fact that the increase in the cost of <Col N="1988" /> living in the EEC countries in the past three years has been lower than it has been here.  There is not much compensation in that&mdash;it is still an increase&mdash; and it is on this particular aspect that I find the Taoiseach's introductory speech unsatisfactory.  The sections in the community who are likely to be hit more than others in increases in the cost of living are pensioners and those others on fixed incomes, apart from the social welfare categories.</P>
    <P>On the assumption that EEC membership will result in a saving to the Exchequer here of something between £30 and £36 million annually in respect of agricultural subsidies, it is essential that there should be a firm public commitment to compensate social welfare recipients to the extent to which they will be affected adversely by the increased cost of living. We must go even further.  Our social welfare level of payments is in general lower than other European countries.  Apart from the social welfare classes, a great number of State pensioners, retired State, semi-State and local authority employees, retired members of the Army, Garda and teachers, find that the cost of living increase over the years has left them, particularly those who have retired for some years, substantially worse off compared with pensioners filling the same positions as they filled but who retired more recently.</P>
    <P>There must, therefore, be a firm public commitment not only to increase all social welfare benefits, widows' and orphans' pensions, children's allowances and so on, but pensions of retired State and other public servants.  There must also be a commitment to give parity to pensioners who retired some years ago.</P>
    <P>One of the issues adverted to in a recent study indicates that in 1970 it was estimated that the disparity between pay and pension increases had approached about 4 per cent.  Pending and subsequent pay awards have widened that gap and although some increases were granted in recent Budgets, the aim of bringing up the pensions of earlier retired State employees to parity with fellow pensioners who retired recently and who had filled precisely the same positions, has not <Col N="1989" /> been implemented.  As well, the cost of living increase indicates that the 4 per cent pension increase granted in 1971 has been eroded very substantially.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are in the community a large number of persons who do not qualify under any of these heads, who are neither State pensioners nor former employees of local authorities but who are in comparable circumstances, living on small fixed incomes. They are feeling severely the conditions which are eroding their savings. They, in addition to the social welfare classes and all public pensioners, must be clearly designated as being entitled to a substantial share of the £30 to £36 million that will be saved in respect of agricultural subsidies in the event of EEC membership.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments in favour of EEC membership is that it will mean considerable benefits to agriculture. There are arguments from time to time about where the likely benefits will flow most freely.  Nobody will dispute that if there is a rise in agricultural prices it will penetrate through the whole agricultural community: it does not matter whether the farm is big, medium or small, the benefit will naturally be there irrespective of size. Naturally the most intensive and the best organised will get the most advantage out of it.  That injection of prosperity will react in other ways. There will be industries based on food processing, industries founded or getting their supplies of raw materials from agriculture which will affect the agricultural community and also others indirectly involved, those employed in industries depending for their supplies of raw materials and supplying either the home or export trade.  These improved economic conditions, to a great extent, do not benefit pensioners or others on fixed incomes.  In fact, the contrary may be the case.  It has been estimated, and I think this figure is reasonably accurate, that some food prices will be affected, such as meat and milk.  According to the household budget inquiry of 1965-66 only 6 per cent of consumer expenditure was spent on certain food products.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake to tie inquiries of this <Col N="1990" /> kind too closely in the sense that very often the effect on the individual is different to what it is estimated to be. On the assumption that there is an increase pensioners and others on fixed incomes will naturally be the most affected.  Statistical information is available in the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Finance and other Departments concerned with pensioners, whether social welfare or other categories.  The Government should be able to give a reasonably close figure of the sum of money necessary from public sources to compensate on an adequate basis as well as to raise in real terms the pensions of the categories of the people I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>A number of surveys have been made, including one published some years ago in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, which indicated that this was one of the few countries that had failed to measure up to the general improvements in pensions and in addition had fallen behind in the pattern of pension increase that were then becoming common to a number of European countries, where pensioners who had retired at an earlier age were given parity in respect of pensions with those who retired at a later age.</P>
    <P>There are certain other aspects of the European Economic Community that will cause concern.  Certain industries will be adversely affected, and I believe this must be recognised. The CIO reports indicate that steps in some cases were taken and in others the dilatory nature of the measures taken to deal with the problem is a cause of concern.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the White Paper which I believe is unsatisfactory and which has caused concern is that in regard to fisheries.  I agree with the criticism expressed by Deputy Keating. It is a mistake to suggest, as has been suggested on page 47 of the White Paper at paragraph 5.33 on fisheries:</P>
    <P>As a member of the Council we will be in a position to ensure that our national interests in the fishery sector will be provided for by appropriate arrangements including the maintenance of special limits.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that is a correct representation <Col N="1991" /> of the facts.  I believe this is a unanimous decision.  Although we have power to argue about it, the Council have the right to take a decision and it is a unanimous one. There is concern in regard to the fishery aspect of the agreement.  I speak as a representative of a constituency that has in it a harbour, which has one of the largest fish landings in the country and which has grown considerably over the years as a result of developments there and schemes designed to improve the harbour and landing facilities at Dún Laoghaire.  There is concern because in the fishing areas the alternative employment available is very limited.</P>
    <P>It is true that many of our fishermen are part-time fishermen, but the terms of the fishery arrangement indicate that a sufficiently strong case was not put up and was not argued to its logical conclusion.  This is one aspect of the negotiations in which I believe the Norwegians were right.  We should have gone along with them in the battle they put up to get an agreement.  It was said here to representatives of the different political parties, when the Norwegian delegation was over here, that they had to put the question of fisheries as a question of principle, that whether they would recommend the arrangement hinged on whether they would get satisfactory terms.</P>
    <P>Fisheries do not rank to the same extent in this country.  Nevertheless, I believe that the agreement in respect of fisheries is not satisfactory.  Mr. Froschmeier, who was on the recent RTE programme, confirmed in a reply he gave that the decisions of the Council in this regard are unanimous decisions.  To suggest here that we have a voice in influencing decisions does not accurately represent the position.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the terms negotiated which I believe is unsatisfactory is that in connection with dumping.  This is an area in which there is concern because of the size of the market, because of our proximity to a highly industrialised country like Britain and because of past experience with Britsh competitors but also with other competitors.  The terms in respect of dumping are less satisfactory than <Col N="1992" /> they should have been.  In the event of accession further discussions will be necessary.</P>
    <P>The other matters that have been the subject of comment here are ones more of detail than of substance.  I want to refer to an aspect which of course has emotional overtones, that is the question of sovereignty.  It sounds tremendous to suggest that we are abandoning sovereignty, that we are giving away something we have that we should not relinquish.  Everybody believes in the independence of the country.  It is one of the fundamental tenets of the party I represent that we believe in the reality and substance of independence.  One of the realities of independence that is valuable is the right of the electorate to decide an issue of this sort.  This right was secured for the people to exercise through the ballot boxes whether they wish to adhere to an arrangement of this sort or to remain outside.</P>
    <P>Any emotional suggestions that we have some sort of immense power of a military or naval character or that somebody outside will impose their will on us is of course largely illusory. In any organisation that we join, whether it is the old League of Nations, the ILO, the United Nations, or the World Health Organisation, any international body presupposes that those who join it are prepared to abide by the terms of the treaty or other rules of the organisation concerned.  It is true in this particular case&mdash;and this is one of the reasons for the referendum&mdash;that certain decisions made by the Community have application within the member countries.  The terms of our Constitution, which vests the complete authority for making laws in the Oireachtas &mdash;in other words, in the Dáil and Seanad&mdash;give the final decision on the constitutionality or otherwise of legislation to the Supreme Court here.  It is necessary because of these Articles, which have been quoted here on many occasions in other debates, for the country to decide by referendum on certain amendments included in the legislation passing through the House. That legislation will involve, if it is enacted, that the necessary changes will be made in order to allow the <Col N="1993" /> terms of the Rome Treaty to operate. To that extent an outside body, of which we will be members, will have the right to take certain decisions.  Provided we accept the terms of membership we will go along with those decisions.</P>
    <P>If a member country objects to something because it considers it is contrary to its essential interests&mdash;and it is entitled to oppose it&mdash;the unanimity rule almost invariably operates. We can always opt out if we want to. On the one hand it is testing credulity too far to suggest that we are handing ourselves over, lock, stock and barrel, to some outside authority and then to say we have done that in perpetuity. If we decide that it is not in our interests, we can always leave the Community. Many of us, irrespective of party, when discussing this with politicians from other countries, and with people of every political persuasion whether Christian democrats, liberals, socialists, labour supporters or supporters of no particular party, found that they all expressed the view that EEC membership would mean a substantial improvement in the standard of living.  Even the Italian community admitted that their standard of living has improved.  Recent figures indicate that the growth of the EEC has not been as spectacular as it was in earlier years.  That may be a temporary phenomenon or it may indicate a general decline in expansion.  Having reviewed this as critically as it is possible to do &mdash;and none of us regards the terms negotiated as perfect&mdash;none of us wants to suggest that there will not be difficulties. There will be difficulties for certain industries and for pensioners on fixed incomes and for certain categories of people involved in certain types of production.  The substantial balance of our trade&mdash;and this is a significant fact which has been overlooked&mdash;is with Britain and the EEC. One of the factors to which I wanted to refer was that 65 per cent of our total exports go to the British market. Britain relies for about 5 per cent of her total exports on the Irish market. Almost 50 per cent of our exports are agricultural products.  In 1969 the exports of agricultural goods as a percentage of total exports in Austria <Col N="1994" /> was 4.1 per cent; Finland, 3.2 per cent; Sweden, 2.4 per cent and Switzerland, 2.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, obvious that our interest in actual membership as distinct from a trade agreement is far greater than that of these countries. Eighty per cent of our exports go to Britain and the EEC.  Less than 2 per cent of their total exports come to us. It is obvious from the economic facts of our trade with Britain and the EEC that it is substantially in our interest as of now to join the EEC.  Some of the alternatives which have been suggested do not hold water.  The eastern European countries have been mentioned. Neither Japan nor such countries buy in any sizeable quantity from us.</P>
    <P>There was some talk recently of opening diplomatic relations with Russia.  I put down a question and it was shown that the imbalance of trade between Ireland and Russia was phenomenal.  The same is true in regard to other countries.  In fact, the countries with which we trade to any sizeable extent are Britain and the EEC.  The only other country with which we have significant trade is the United States.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude on a point which I made earlier.  This is an important decision.  It is important for the public that the facts should be put clearly before them.  There is, because of the present very serious situation in Northern Ireland, an air of unreality about this debate.  It is vital in present circumstances to make it clear in this House beyond question that there is only one sovereign authority in this country.  The Government have an obligation to make this clear.  Attacks on the Garda, Army or institutions of this State will be resisted, no matter who instigates them or from what quarter they come.  This House is the only legitimate authority.  It speaks, acts and is responsible to the people. The people can change the Government; they can change any of us; they can change any of the parties.  No one outside this House has authority to speak or act for them.  That must be clearly emphasised and not merely in speeches or comments or broadcasts. It must be seen to be operated in <Col N="1995" /> practice by resisting with whatever resources are necessary attacks on the institutions of this State so that we can carry conviction to those who have negotiated with this country, those who are prepared to accept this country as a member of the EEC, and above all, to those outside either the Community or Britain who are anxious, willing and concerned to invest here to provide employment, that we intend to preserve, no matter what the cost, the fabric of this State and our society. In doing that we are showing we are prepared to play a part as a member of the EEC, recognising that we have an interest in Europe as part of it, that politically we are part of Europe and anxious to see Europe coming together and that the aims and objectives of the Community coincide generally with our aims and objectives: We wish to see achieved the wider objectives of the European Community&mdash;the maintenance of peace, the increasing of prosperity, the elemination of social injustices and the more effective protection of the environment.  These are all matters in which we as a people have as much interest as anybody else in Europe.</P>
    <P>In many cases these objectives transcend national barriers and the views and aspirations of political parties. Most of them are common to all parties and every country.  We are anxious to play our part in achieving these aims and objectives.  We recognise that we are a small country on the edge of Europe and as regards the EEC we shall be on the periphery and in many ways less involved than other countries but because of our history and because of our present beliefs and the views and attitudes we value and consider basic to our way of life, we believe in the enlargement of the Community and that it is a decision that must be taken by the people.</P>
    <P>We believe there are opportunities and advantages in it which we should exploit; that there are disadvantages that we shall have to minimise, problems we shall have to overcome and resolve and ease in respect of certain categories in the community but, looking <Col N="1996" /> at the general situation and viewing the opportunities and advantages of membership, recognising that there are no realistic workable alternatives, we believe it is in the national interest to adhere to the EEC.  We recognise that it is a decision that must be taken by a free, independent people.  Having put the facts before them, we believe they will make the right decision and whatever it is, it will be a decision taken freely by the people and we will defend their right to make it and to decide it freely without hindrance from anybody.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to avail of this debate to deal as clearly and as comprehensively as I can with the implications of EEC membership in regard to land structural reforms in this country.  As the House probably knows, the Council of Ministers at the moment are in the process of finalising a package of structural reform measures which, when adopted, will apply to the Community as a whole and to the applicant countries should they become members.</P>
      <P>The principal provisions of these proposed measures are by now fairly widely known especially through the publications issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs and also through a comprehensive statement issued by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries towards the end of last January.  I said that the package is being finalised but, obviously, some changes may yet emerge in the final discussions but I think it can be accepted that the main provisions as we now know them, will remain. There are some aspects of these which we feel do not quite suit our conditions here and we have raised them as items for consultation with the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three dominant features in these proposed measures.  First, their ultimate purpose in relation to those farmers who intend to continue in farming is to ensure that for the future their conditions both as to income and <Col N="1997" /> quality of life will be comparable to the conditions in any other sphere of economic activity.  The second important feature to note is that the proposed measures are entirely voluntary. It will be for each individual farmer in any member state to decide whether he wants to participate in any of these agricultural structural reform schemes. He will be the social arbiter.  The third matter for special notice is that measures have now been provided to ensure that those farmers who wish to give up farming can do so under the best possible conditions.  These three points cannot be emphasised too strongly having regard to the widespread and rather malicious misrepresentation that EEC entry means the elimination of the small farmer.</P>
    <P>The proposed measures with which my Department will be concerned chiefly relate to the provision of aids to those small farmers who adopt development plans and to those farmers who for one reason or another wish to give up farming.  The farmer with the development plan will be able to get substantial reductions on the interest on investments needed to execute the plan.  He will get an income allowance while the plan is being carried through.  This allowance will decrease in amount from a maximum to a minimum during the period of the plan.  He will get priority in the allocation of lands becoming available for distribution provided he requires more land.  Deputies from rural parts will know that progressive small farmers at the moment get priority from the Land Commission in the allocation of land in their localities.  A new system will merely copperfasten this priority system since in the new dispensation the progressive farmer will have the evidence of his development plan to put before the Land Commission. Clearly, the successful implementation of this programme will require the closest possible co-operation between the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>I shall deal now with the proposed aid for those who wish to leave farming and to give up their land for the benefit of those with development plans.  First, these will get the price of the land.  Also, they will get a bonus <Col N="1998" /> and if they are between the ages of 55 and 65 they will get an annual minimum allowance of £250.  I should add that this is one of the features which is not appropriate particularly and which will be the subject of discussion. I refer to the age group of 55 to 65. We consider that an age group of 60 to 70 years would suit better our conditions. The amount of the bonus has not been calculated yet or agreed so far as this country is concerned because on the mainland of Europe it is calculated by reference to the lease system which is prevalent there but which is non-existent here.  Therefore, the amount of the bonus so far as farmers in Ireland are concerned would have to be worked out on some different basis, possibly and even probably representing a percentage of the agreed purchase price.  I should add also that the pension scheme which was introduced in section 6 of the Land Act of 1965 has had very disappointing results to date.  This may be due in part to the fact that the inducements offered were inadequate but I suspect also that a very significant contributory cause is the exceptional attachment to land that exists in our countryside.  I do not think this will change overnight.  The inducements offered under the EEC scheme represent a very big advance on our terms but whether they in turn will be sufficient to ensure a reasonable measure of success remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>These, and other proposals of the EEC will involve a fairly drastic reappraisal of the current operations in the policy of the Land Commission where the full implications are being studied now.  As I mentioned earlier, arrangements for ensuring closer integration with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will have to be worked out.  Indeed, they are being worked out so as to ensure that the proposed agricultural structural reform programme, when approved by the EEC, can be brought into operation in this country quickly after our accession.</P>
    <P>I turn now to an aspect of our accession to the EEC which of late has been the subject of grave misrepresentation. For some months past <Col N="1999" /> certain individuals and bodies have been active in predicting the wholesale sell-out of our land to foreigners which they claim will follow our accession to the Community.  These predictions are without foundation and appear to be designed deliberately to alarm the rural population and thereby influence them against accession.</P>
    <P>This campaign is a dishonest one and is relying for its results on the emotive attachment of Irish people to their land.  In order to dispose of these misrepresentations I propose to deal in some detail with the question of the right of nationals of the EEC to purchase land in Ireland should we join the enlarged Community.  We must go back to the Treaty of Rome, which provides that the Council shall issue directives to enable nationals of one member state to acquire and to use land and buildings situate in another member state.  I must point out straightaway that this is subject to the proviso that in so doing there is to be no conflict with the principle of the common agricultural policy.  These principles provide that in the working out of the common agricultural policy account shall be taken of: (a) the particular nature of agricultural activity that results from agriculture's social structure and from structural and national disparities between the various agricultural regions, (b), the need to effect the appropriate adjustment by degrees and (c), the fact that in member states agriculture constitutes a sector linked closely with the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>To date progress in achieving the right of nationals of a member state to purchase farms in another member state has been confined mainly to two Council directives which provide for (1) the right to acquire farms which have been abandoned or left uncultivated for more than two years and, (2), the right of member state nationals who have worked as paid agricultural workers in another state for an unbroken period of two years to acquire farms in that state.</P>
    <P>The adoption of these directives does not pose any problem for this country. Accordingly the Government have <Col N="2000" /> agreed to accept them.  I should add that within the definition of the words &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; or &ldquo;uncultivated&rdquo; as used by the Community, there is no land of either category, that I know of anyway, in this country.  In this connection I think it is relevant to say that grass is regarded as a crop, so that land let on successive 11-month grazing lettings would be considered in use and not abandoned, and I think would also be considered as having been cultivated. It would certainly not be regarded as having been abandoned, since grass itself is a crop.</P>
    <P>Also I do not think that the provision in regard to foreign agricultural workers who would qualify to buy land after a minimum period of two years poses any real problem, because these would not be sufficiently numerous, in the first instance, or wealthy, in the second, to present a problem for the Land Commission or for Irish citizens who might be interested in purchasing land when it comes on the market.</P>
    <P>There are two other minor directives in the matter of land purchase which also must be mentioned, and these provide for the right to change farms and for a legal equality of access to the rural lease system.  These directives again do not pose any real problem to us, and I should add that the leasing of land, as the House knows, is almost non-existent in Ireland.  All we have are the agistment, conacre and grazing lettings on the 11-month system, and indeed, it is doubtful, having regard to our history, if a system of leasing land will become acceptable here for many years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that if he is already here and legitimately here he has the right to go into the open market on equal terms with anybody else.  I now come to the draft directive which was put on the Table of the Council of Ministers in January, 1969, and which sought to grant the full right of establishment as envisaged in the Treaty.  This directive has not been adopted to date, and there is no indication that it will be adopted before the date set for our accession; in fact we have been assured that it will not be adopted before that date.  Of course after accession we will be in the position, as one of the member States of the Community, of having a full voice through our Minister on the Council of Ministers, and I can assure the House that he can be relied upon to ensure that our special interests are taken fully into account.  I think it relevant to add that the mere fact that the directive is still in draft form and has not been adopted obviously indicates lack of agreement among the existing countries about its merits, and the fact is that this is so and the identity of the countries are also well known.</P>
      <P>Let me say also that right through the negotiating period the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or External Affairs as he then was, indicated quite clearly to the existing EEC countries our very serious concern about the possible extension of the right of establishment on land and stressed the need to maintain sufficient control over the disposal of land here in Ireland to enable us to pursue policies to deal with a serious structural reform problem.  We are, of course, unique among the countries involved, in that we still have almost 30 per cent of our people engaged in farming.  We therefore have a unique problem and one that is acknowledged by the existing states in EEC and equally well understood by the other three applicant countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall now pass on to deal with the <Col N="2002" /> question of the disposal of land which comes on the market for one reason or another under the existing Land Commission powers, because it is badly worked or the owner is not residing on it or because it has been let for a long period of time.  At the moment, as the House knows, this land is taken up for the benefit of the existing uneconomic farmers and under EEC the right of the local people will be greatly strengthened because land given up must be disposed of to people in the locality who are working a farm development programme.</P>

      <P>Yes, they can, because their existing powers enable them to do so, and that will continue, and indeed it will be the Land Commission's responsibility to ensure that such land does not pass into the hands of, shall we say, undeserving applicants of one kind or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because, as the Deputy knows, the existing powers of the Land Commission do not discriminate. They apply equally to our own citizens as they do to anybody who might be coming in from outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and in regard to the land voluntarily given up which must be used for division among <Col N="2003" /> deserving local farmers operating a development plan, this is clearly an advance on the present situation so far as those are concerned.</P>
      <P>Finally, provided that the terms of any further legislation which we might like to introduce are not discriminatory but apply equally to our citizens as well as to the citizens of all other countries, then we can take such further measures as may be necessary to push through a vigorous and effective structural reform programme as is envisaged under the measures which I have mentioned as now being in the process of finalisation.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, clear from the weapons we operate at the moment that we are now well equipped as compared with seven or eight years ago when the first effective measures to control the purchase of land were taken under the 1965 Land Act.  These weapons we can continue to use against the type of land I have mentioned&mdash;land that is to let, land that is badly used or land offered for sale.  We are already well provisioned and, on the adoption of the EEC measures after accession, we will have further methods at our disposal to bring into operation an effective land structure programme in regard to agricultural land.  Provided we do not discriminate against the nationals of another member State, we can take such further legislative measures as the House will agree and deem appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated at the outset that it was my intention to confine myself to those particular aspects of EEC entry pecularily relevant to my Department and that I would not stray into discussion on other matters.  I will conclude by adding that I personally approach the prospect of Ireland's entry into a new Europe with great enthusiasm in the belief that it will bring a new era, a new spirit, a new determination and a new dimension to the Irish people and to their future because, in the end, the sole purpose of economic activity is to make social conditions and people's lives better, just as the object of a father working is to make the life of his wife and children better. Through increased economic activity and the broadening of horizons generally <Col N="2004" /> I believe the Irish people will rise to the challenge and their true potentiality will then be realised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things I dislike intensely about the present campaign by the pro-EEC people is the fact that, not alone do they skate around the truth but, on top of that, they continue to refer to those who are opposed to entry as dishonest and anti-national.  I have heard this repeated so often that I wonder if, in fact, those who make the allegations really understand what it is they are talking about.  I listened to Deputy Seán Flanagan, Minister for Lands, for the last half hour.  I like him.  In my opinion he is an honest man and always pretty factual in anything he says.  However, his comments here tonight could not be further from the truth.  I would not say that he was deliberately telling lies but either the script he was using was written by someone who knows nothing about the EEC or it was deliberately designed to try to prove that things are as they are not.</P>
      <P>Let us deal, first of all, with the question of land and land purchase by non-nationals.  I have here <i>The Accession of Ireland to the European Communities</i>, a Government publication. The heading to paragraph 3.46 is &ldquo;Purchase of land by non-nationals&rdquo;. The paragraph states:</P>
      <P>The progress made to date by the Community in regard to the right of nationals of a member State to acquire agricultural land in another member State has been confined mainly to the adoption of measures which provide for (a) the right to acquire farms which have been abandoned or left uncultivated for more than two years, and (b) the right of nationals of member States who have worked as paid agricultural workers in another member State for an unbroken period of at least two years to acquire farms in that State.  The Council has had before it since 1969 a proposal which, if adopted, would permit nationals of other member States to purchase agricultural land generally on the same conditions as nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> I suggest that, if the Council were going to refuse to accept that, they would have done it a long time ago and I believe that ultimately that will be the decision.  Let us go on now to pages 168, 169 and 170 where there is a reference to the same subject&mdash;the purchase of land in certain limited cases.  Paragraphs 264 and 265 read:</P>
    <P>Of particular concern to us is the effect of the Community provisions on our present legislative controls in regard to the purchase of land by non-nationals.  The EEC Treaty envisages that nationals of one member State should be enabled to acquire and use land and buildings situated in another member State.  Under our legislation all non-nationals who have not lived in Ireland for at least seven years require the consent of the Land Commission to acquire rural land other than land required for industrial purposes or holdings up to five acres for residential purposes.</P>
    <P>The measures adopted so far by the Community in regard to the right of nationals of a member State to purchase land in another member State are of limited scope.  They provide for the removal of discriminatory restrictions on</P>
    <P>&mdash;the right of nationals of member States to acquire farms which have been abandoned or left uncultivated for more than two years in other member States;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the right of a national of a member State to acquire a farm in another member State where he has worked as a paid agricultural worker for two years;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the right of a national of a member State to change farms in another member State if he has been established in farming for more than two years in that member State;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the right of access by a national of one member State who is established or who is establishing himself in another member State, to the rural lease system in that State; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the right to buy wooded land or forest for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2006" /> That is plain sailing.  That is as the Minister stated the position to be.  However, the following paragraph, paragraph 266, reads:</P>
    <P>The implementation of these directives will not raise any significant problems for us.  However, the Council has before it proposals which would in effect grant a national of a member State the right to acquire agricultural land generally in another member State on the same conditions as nationals of that State.  The present indications, however, are that the Community is unlikely to reach a decision on the adoption of these proposals until after the accession of the new member States.  Should the Community reach the stage of making decisions before accession we will, under the procedure agreed in the negotiations, be consulted by the Council so that full account can be taken of our interests in the matter as prospective members of the Community. Should adoption of these proposals be deferred until after our accession they will, of course, be the subject of examination by the enlarged Council in which we will have a full voice as a member of the Community.  In the negotiations, we expressed our concern at this possible extension of the right of establishment and stressed the need to maintain sufficient control over the disposal of land in Ireland to enable us to pursue policies to deal with our structural problems.</P>
    <P>I suggest that neither the Minister for Lands nor Foreign Affairs are really serious in their contention that they can protect Irish interests, interests that should have been included in the agreement made with the EEC, and, since that agreement has now been made, there is no doubt in my mind that over the next few years the EEC will extend the right, as was originally intended in the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>I do not want to bore the House by going through the Treaty.  In that Treaty the right to purchase land in another member State was given to people moving from one State to another.  There is no use in any Minister or anybody else in this House or <Col N="2007" /> outside it trying to bluff his way through by saying that land can be protected and that the Irish are the only people who will be allowed to buy.  It is too bad that we should be asked to accept that when the people who make such statements must know that this is not true.</P>
    <P>I have a document here&mdash;&ldquo;Agriculture, 1980&rdquo;&mdash;published by the European Community Information Service, London.  It contains things which lead one to believe that the EEC we are talking about is not the same one these people are talking about.  It starts off:</P>
    <P>The European Commission&mdash;the Common Market's executive body&mdash; has proposed a revolutionary ten-year farm-reform plan to help modernise the peasant basis of farming in the Six European Community countries and to give farmers adequate incomes based on minimum production units of:</P>
    <P>200-300 acres for grain and root crops;</P>
    <P>40-60 cows for dairy farming;</P>
    <P>150-200 head of cattle for beef and veal production;</P>
    <P>100,000 chickens for poultry producers;</P>
    <P>10,000 laying hens for egg-production.</P>
    <P>I wonder if this is what the Irish farmer has to look forward to.  I know we have people saying that the structure of Irish farms will remain, that there will be no change, that everything will go on as it is now and that anybody who says otherwise is dishonest.  Yet this booklet, dealing with agricultural employment in the Community, gives these figures.  From a total of 20 million in employment in 1950 in the Six it was down to 15 million in 1960, down to 10 million in 1970 and there is a projection that the number of people who will be employed in agriculture in the Six countries of the EEC in 1980 will be 5 million.  As a percentage of the total work force the figures are 1950, 28 per cent; 1960, 21 per cent; 1970, 14 per cent; 1980, 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Are the Government really serious or are Fine Gael serious?  Fine Gael <Col N="2008" /> should have looked at it even if they had not got the responsibility; they did not have people in their party who had declared that we would go in on our own whether anybody else did or not, that we would take everything in our stride.  Surely they should have looked at the facts.  Surely they must realise that they cannot wish away facts like those, that they will not be able to persuade themselves in the years to come, if we are unfortunate enough to go into the EEC, that it was not their fault that we finished up in the mess in which we must finish up if these figures are correct.</P>
    <P>In the fifth page of this document there is a heading:</P>
    <P>Fewer farmers, larger farms.</P>
    <P>The document goes on to say that various far reaching measures will be needed to alter the structure of production. It continues:</P>
    <P>In the past, it was mostly farm labourers or members of farmers' families who left the land.  In the future, the number who leave the land will have to include a much higher proportion of the farmers themselves.  The authorities will have to take special steps to help those who give up farming and are too old to find other work, or who are switching over to some other occupation. Young people, in particular, will need good training for jobs outside agriculture.</P>
    <P>Training for what?  We have almost 80,000 people who cannot get jobs.</P>
    <P>The new structure of production must not impair the balance of the market.</P>
    <P>This is an interesting comment.</P>
    <P>A great deal of land will have to be taken out of farming.  Farmers' organisations and producer groups will have an important part to play in helping to adjust output to market needs.</P>
    <P>The programme needs the support and help of farmers.  Their participation must be voluntary and no compulsion will be used.</P>
    <P>How do they propose to do it?</P>
    <P>The programme should offer <Col N="2009" /> farmers a wide range of opportunities, leaving them to decide how they will take advantage of them.  This means that the programme must be adaptable to regional and local conditions.</P>
    <P>It goes on in this vein until it comes to the question of how they will get the farmers out.  It says:</P>
    <P>To make it easier for farmers to move off the land, the children of farmers and of farm-workers could receive educational grants of £250 a year.</P>
    <P>That is a help.  It is not as much as they are getting at present under our free education system but it is a help. It goes on:</P>
    <P>For farmers aged 55 years or more who were prepared to give up farming, special help will be given:</P>
    <P>Farmers could receive an annual allowance if they allowed their land to be developed under the programme.  For those aged 65 and over, the allowance would be about £420 a year, less their old-age pension.  For farmers aged between 55 and 65, the allowance would rise from £275 at 55 to about £420 at 60.  It would stay at that level until the beneficiary was entitled to an old age pension.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister for Lands thinks this should encourage people to leave the farm.  He must know that a better system than this which was introduced in this House under the Land Act, 1965, has persuaded only four farmers to avail of it as far as I am aware.  This document goes on:</P>
    <P>A similar system could be worked out for farm workers and members of the farmer's family who had been working on the farm.</P>
    <P>The whole point in this is that&mdash;and I am dealing deliberately with this because the Minister for Lands began and finished with it&mdash;apparently in the EEC they must prevent overproduction.  It says under the heading of &ldquo;Selecting the Products&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The authorities would have to exercise caution in encouraging investment <Col N="2010" /> in products already in surplus.</P>
    <P>This would apply to the milk industry here.</P>
    <P>They would also have to consider regional needs, and to give priority to regions whose need is greatest. Between now and 1975, they should concentrate aid on setting up modern agricultural enterprises; after 1975 they should reserve aid exclusively for them.</P>
    <P>Here is an item which the Irish farmers may not be too happy about:</P>
    <P>Modernising the system of land tenure will be a major task.  The Community needs to overcome obstacles to mobility in ownership or use of land.</P>
    <P>Nice phrases.  We know what they mean here.  They were used a lot before security of tenure was introduced. Maybe it is the right way. Maybe the system that is used in Britain where land is leased instead of owned is the right one.  If this is what the Government or Fine Gael want they should say so because this is what this document says and they are talking about 1980 in the EEC. They say:</P>
    <P>Member Governments must consider how far legislative changes might encourage farming in larger units.  The Commission is studying these points, and plans to submit specific proposals.</P>
    <P>To adjust the supply of farm products to demand, the member States should try to concentrate the sources of supply, and adapt quality to changing requirements.  The Commission's earlier recommendations on producer groupings are still valid.</P>
    <P>The idea is that we should change the system of farming and produce what there is a market for.  That of course, will mean that many farmers will have to go out of production and the wonderful market which so many people hoped to have in some of our products may not be there because if they are going to rationalise, particularly on milk products, then they will not need the milk from the Irish farms and in case anybody has any doubt about it <Col N="2011" /> let me give the solution which the Common Market have for that little problem.  There was, this time 12 months, a million tons of surplus butter in the Common Market which was disposed of.  They give several ways in which they disposed of it but they do not give them all.  They say that they suggested lowering the price of butter.  Of course they would never do that in this country.  They sold it to some Army and I understand quite a lot of it was fed to animals.  Some of it was turned into fertiliser.</P>
    <P>However, they disposed of the one million tons and then they decided that this could not happen again.  So, the Commission proposed a system of subsidies in order to give farmers an incentive to abandon dairy farm work and to slaughter their dairy cows.  The Commission estimated that as a result of these subsidies an extra one-quarter of a million dairy cows could be slaughtered each year, cutting the annual output of butter by 30,000 tons, but they said that even this would not be enough because by 1973 butter stocks would be rising again and a balance could be established only by reducing dairy herds by three million cows between now and 1976.  They were talking of the six countries without counting the agricultural countries which would be attached to the Common Market if the four applicants became members.  They said:</P>
    <P>Such a drastic reduction is bound to alter the pattern of Community farming.  It can be carried out only as part of a programme that considers all the human aspects involved. The Commission is none the less convinced that farming must be reorganised if a durable balance between output and sales is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Commission proposes:</P>
    <P>An average subsidy of £125 for each dairy cow slaughtered; to qualify for the subsidy, the farmer must have at least two dairy cows, and must slaughter his entire dairy herd.  The Commission estimates that about 250,000 cows&mdash;about 125,000 tons of meat&mdash;would be slaughtered annually.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> The principle of a slaughter subsidy was accepted by the Council on 13th May, 1969.</P>
    <P>So, whatever we may say about the position with regard to the dairying industry at the present time and the promises which have been made to the dairy farmers of this country, that they will get lán an mhála if they join the Common Market, it does appear that this is not what the Common Market holds for them and they should be told that.</P>
    <P>One thing that I cannot understand is that of all the documents produced by the Government, so far I have come across only one in which there was even a slight suggestion that we were not going into a land flowing with milk and honey.  It is terribly dishonest of the Government, as Deputy Keating said here this evening, to put in every post office&mdash;and I understand they are now being passed to school children &mdash;documents which give only one side of the story.  We are entitled to get the two sides.  Deputy Keating pointed out, and Deputy FitzGerald picked him up on it very quickly, that at the present time the price of fat cattle in this country is similar to the price in the Common Market.  In fact, the price of dropped calves here is, for some reason or other, higher than in some parts of the Common Market.  Deputy FitzGerald asked would it drop considerably if we do not go in to the Common Market.  It will be nothing to the drop the Irish farmer will get if he does go in.  Because of the propaganda by the Government, the farmer is under the impression that he will again get a very substantial increase in prices over and above what he is getting now, if we enter the Common Market.  I have not heard anybody on the Government side or on the Fine Gael side attempting to put the facts straight for the farmer.  I have not heard anybody saying that due to the fact that it is believed that we will enter the Common Market, prices have already increased and those buying in calves are under the impression that by the time they are fattened they will be selling them at Common Market prices.  But, they are paying Common Market prices for their calves now and the fat cattle <Col N="2013" /> prices are as near as possible to Common Market prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The calves are as dear but fat cattle are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Fat cattle in this country the week before last were at exactly the same price as in Italy.  I checked. It is difficult to understand, but that is the position.  There is something else I cannot understand.  Nobody on the pro-Common Market side has taken the trouble to explain that if there are higher prices in the Common Market for most commodities, as there must be, the cost of production will also be higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was intrigued listening to some of the people on the television programme last week and to Deputy FitzGerald on a radio programme earlier, in which I also took part, trying to explain that even though it is admitted that the cost of foodstuffs, particularly those with an agricultural base, will be higher in the Common Market, this will be counterbalanced by a lower cost of industrial goods.  They seemed to think that that was all right and that everybody should accept it.  It seems to be generally accepted that that will be the case.  Let us follow it a step further.  If industrial goods are to be lower, does it not follow that Irish industry has not a snowball's chance in hell of survival? Let us be honest about it.  I cannot understand why we cannot get the two sides of the story.  Why must we always have the story that everything will be grand and that we will get the best of both worlds when those who make the statement must know that it is not true?  It is like the story that was current for quite a long time about there being no unemployment in the EEC.  Eventually it leaked out that there are at least 1½ million registered unemployed in Italy and possibly another one million who are not registered. I will not swear to the figures but they are the figures that I have got. It should be borne in mind that more than half a million have become unemployed since last October.  Therefore, it cannot be suggested that they are all unemployable, as I heard being suggested on a programme recently. These people were employed up to last October and it was over the <Col N="2014" /> winter period that they became unemployed. In West Germany, where, we always understood, the economy was so good that unemployment was unthinkable, there are roughly 260,000 persons unemployed at the present time and of that number nearly 80,000 have become unemployed since the fall of last year.  Over all Common Market countries there is evidence of unemployment. In those circumstances it is not right for people claiming to know the facts to come into this House or to go on radio or television and to announce that there is no unemployment in the Common Market.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>Time and again we have asked what is the alternative to going into the Common Market.  If Britain goes in, what can we do?  Deputy Keating said that he understood, and I think he is correct, that Norway will almost certainly vote against entry.  There will be a plebiscite in Norway.  Denmark is closely associated with Norway and the Danes will almost certainly adopt the same decision.  If the people of Britain were to get the opportunity of voting they would most certainly vote against entry.  A rather extraordinary situation has arisen in Britain. I was speaking to Members of Parliament in Westminster the week before last.  I was amazed to find amongst a group of anti-Common Market Conservatives the certainty that they would not enter the Common Market because of the fact that legislation in Westminster would be so bogged down by late June or early July that the matter would have to be abandoned and therefore, as far as Britain is concerned, the Common Market is as far away as it ever was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolute nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Only Deputy Dockrell and God would know whether that is right or wrong.  I am merely giving an opinion which I heard expressed in Britain.  I am giving this opinion for what it is worth.  The difference between the pro- and anti-Common Market people is that the latter admit they could be wrong but the people <Col N="2015" /> in favour of the Common Market, according to themselves, are always right.  However, we have seen them proved wrong frequently.  Fine Gael supported the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement but now they say it was not a good agreement.  I am not at all surprised at the attitude of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  Somebody said to me last week that now Fianna Fáil are in the same position as was Cumann na nGaedheal in the early twenties&mdash;I do not know where that leaves Fine Gael but it is a point worth remembering.</P>
      <P>It has been asked what is the alternative if we do not enter the EEC. There is an alternative.  We should have asked for some kind of association, if for no other reason than to give us an opportunity of seeing what would happen.  I am not prepared to go along with Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy FitzGerald that if we do not like the Common Market after entering we can leave it again.  It is ridiculous to make such a statement.  If we enter the Common Market and adopt the laws of the Community we have got to stay in whether we like it or not.</P>
      <P>The question of whether we could leave the Common Market was raised in connection with any defence commitments we might have to undertake. It is correct to say that at present according to the Treaties of Rome and Paris they do not require any defence commitments.  However, that did not stop the Taoiseach from volunteering three years ago in Paris that this country would be prepared to back the EEC to the hilt, even if it meant entering defence commitments.  His comments have been repeated here on more than one occasion by the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has said that a Europe worth joining is a Europe worth defending.  I do not think he will carry the country with him on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald has pointed out that if defence commitments arise it will be necessary for the Government to hold a referendum and we could then opt out.  I should like to know what use there would be in voting against entering defence commitments <Col N="2016" /> if we were five or ten years in the Community.  Holding such a referendum would be a waste of time and money.</P>
    <P>The alternative to entry should be either a treaty or a form of association. During the years other countries have succeeded in getting treaties and this is evidence that we could have succeeded here.  In 1961 when there was a democratic form of government in Greece, that country got a 22-years agreement&mdash;we settled for a three-year agreement.  That agreement enabled Greece to sell their industrial goods in the Common Market free of tariffs and they were allowed to retain their tariffs against Common Market goods entering Greece.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the Treaty of Ankara in 1963, Turkey obtained a 22-year agreement.  They got the right to maintain tariffs against EEC goods and in addition got a loan of 175 million dollars.  Israel obtained a similar agreement; in fact, I understand 98 countries negotiated agreements with the EEC.  They include the Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, Yugoslavia, Spain, Malta, and the United Arab Republic. I heard somebody remarking that the EEC will allow in only goods they do not produce themselves.  It is evident that this is not true because the person who made that remark said Israel was allowed to sell citrus fruits in the Common Market only because they are not available in those countries.  Anyone who thinks that the South of France or Italy do not produce these fruits does not know much about Europe.</P>
    <P>Sweden, Austria or Finland have not entered the EEC.  At the moment Sweden is negotiating a trade agreement. The reason that country did not apply for membership was because they have a treaty of neutrality.  It may be pointed out that in some cases countries have such treaties with large neighbours who do not wish them to become involved.  It does not matter what is the reason; the facts are that these countries will not enter the EEC because they are neutral countries. Yet, we find no difficulty whatever in accepting that this country, which traditionally is neutral, should be prepared <Col N="2017" /> to enter into all commitments, including defence.</P>
    <P>I think the Government have jumped into something that is too deep for them and now they find they cannot get out.  They are trying to get this business through and they are hoping for the best.  I agree the EEC has been a livesaver in the past ten years for the Government because every time the economic situation got bad they were able to fall back on the EEC and tell us everything would be all right when we entered the Community. The late Seán Lemass was the first person I heard use this argument but since then down to the present Taoiseach it has been repeated time and again that the way to solve our problems is to join the EEC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the things in the Common Market campaign which I do not like is that Ministers apparently are requisitioning civil servants to attend Fianna Fáil meetings for the purpose of selling pro-EEC propaganda; I might add that this was denied here last week.  The Parliamentary Secretary may shake his head but the facts are that these people have appeared at such meetings. Either they have no option but to attend the meetings or, worse still, they have volunteered to do it.  If this is the case it places their colleagues who do not take such action in a rather peculiar situation.  Such a precedent should not have been adopted and the Government should stop it immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the question of horticulture and fruit and vegetables. The one document published by the Government which contained some semblance of truth about the Common Market was the one which referred to fruit and said there was not much chance of the fruit industry surviving. Since that time numerous suggestions have been made in documents produced by the Government that there is a future for soft fruit and that we will be able to export to the Continent certain types of soft fruit, particularly strawberries.  It was also suggested that at least we would have the home market for apples and that a good type <Col N="2021" /> of apple is grown here.  It was suggested that because imported apples would have to be brought a long distance the Irish apple industry would not be interfered with.  Surely this is a lot of nonsense.</P>
      <P>If you go into a shop and buy an apple, four times out of five you will get an Australian apple.  You may get an English apple but you most certainly will not be offered an Irish apple.  With regard to the question of soft fruit, but for the fact that there is an embargo on foreign fruit it would be impossible to sell within the country the soft fruit which is being grown here.  In the circumstances, is it not wrong for anyone to suggest that there will be a market for Irish fruit when we go into the Common Market and that we may possibly be able to export Irish fruit to the Continent?  It is terribly unfair to the people who make their livelihood out of growing fruit to make this suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Nolan is a very decent man but I think I know a lot more about the soft fruit industry than he does because I have been involved in it for a number of years.  I know quite well that it is impossible to protect the Irish fruit industry.  If you can grow strawberries in February you can sell them and get a good price but I cannot see anybody growing strawberries in February in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are exporting strawberries from Bunclody to Britain and elsewhere in competition with other European countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into an argument with Deputy Nolan but I think I know a lot more about it than he does because I happen to be involved in this industry.  It is stated in &ldquo;Agriculture 1980&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>The Commission is convinced that steps should be taken to prevent structural surpluses, and that large-scale destruction of fruit and vegetables is a bad way of restoring balance to markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2022" /> To me that suggests that in order to keep up the price on the Continent, fruit and vegetables have to be destroyed in the same way as the butter was destroyed.  It also states:</P>
    <P>The Commission therefore proposes action to influence supply; to introduce a real Community system of intervention; to prevent good-quality produce from being destroyed or distilled; to encourage processing of surplus produce; and to cut down sharply on subsidies for new orchards.</P>
    <P>This means that they recognise that there is no future for the fruit industry and therefore they will not encourage the growing of a product for which there is no market.</P>
    <P>Another problem about which we hear a great deal is the question of a regional policy.  We are given to understand, by people who do not mind telling a few fibs, that if this country goes into the Common Market we will get subsidies to improve the outlying regions of the country.  The people who say that conveniently forget that, as far as Europe is concerned, the whole country is an outlying region.  The people in Brussels treat the people here in the same way as we treat the seagulls on the Aran Islands.  We know they are out there somewhere but they are not annoying us very much and therefore we do not have to worry very much about them.</P>
    <P>It is terribly dishonest&mdash;and this word was used by the Minister for Lands when he was referring to the way the anti-Common Market people talked&mdash;of the pro-Common Market people to try to put across the story that there is a regional policy which will improve conditions here if we enter the EEC.  It is quite true that we can continue with a regional policy of our own supported by our own money, but there will not be any support coming from Europe to outlying regions such as ours.  They tried it once and it was not very successful and they will not try it again.</P>
    <P>Another myth which has been created mainly by the Minister for Finance is that, if we enter the Common Market, in some peculiar way it <Col N="2023" /> will do away with the Border.  That is the usual expression used: &ldquo;do away with the Border&rdquo;.  It may do away with the customs border but it will not take one British soldier out of the Six Counties.  Although there is nothing in the Treaty of Rome which says so, it is generally recognised that, when countries join the Common Market, political boundaries remain, and the evidence of this is there for anybody to see.  There has been no change in political boundaries in any of the countries that have joined, and the effort being made by the Government to sell the idea that we can in some way end Partition by joining is a lot of nonsense. Anybody who stops to think about it will realise that.</P>
    <P>The whole problem&mdash;Deputy Keating says he does not know when the referendum will be held but there is word going round that 14th May has been selected&mdash;which will face us in the referendum is whether the people will understand what they are voting for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know one of them is. If they are to vote, at least they should get the opportunity of knowing the two sides of the story.  In this, the Government are being unfair to them. We had the question some months ago of whether the over-eighteens should be allowed to vote and we were told the legal position would not permit this until after the new register is out. Be that as it may, in view of the fact that it is the youth of the country who will have to live with it for a long number of years after we have passed on, they should be given a say in the making of the decision of whether we join or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the youth are not given this opportunity, at least those who will vote are entitled to get full facilities. They are not getting them.  Not alone should the people be given the two sides of the story but every facility should be made available to them to enable everyone to vote who is entitled to do so, even if this means providing transport to the polls.  It will be a terrible situation if we see the two big parties hauling in everybody whom they think will vote for entry <Col N="2024" /> to the EEC while many who would possibly vote the other way will not vote because they will be unable to get to the polls.  An effort should be made to ensure that we will have a big poll and a decisive result.</P>
    <P>We have listened to a lot of talk about the effect Ireland's vote will have on the affairs of the Community, that if we do not obtain full membership we will have no say.  We must face the facts in this respect.  In the European Parliament of 208 members, Ireland will have only ten votes.  In the Commission, France, Germany, Italy and the UK will have two each and we will have one.  In the Economic and Social Committee of 153, we will have nine votes only.  That gives an idea of how much our say will be in the running of the Community.</P>
    <P>There is the argument I got from a senior statesman in France last summer.  I discussed Ireland's application for membership and our objection to it.  After he had tried to persuade me by way of all the old arguments, he put forward a new one and, perhaps, this is the real reason why some countries are so anxious that Ireland should become a member.  He pointed out that during the last war Germany attempted to over-run Europe and had nearly succeeded, that the German nation had peaceably got control of quite a large portion of Europe and would do so because they wanted one State of Europe, and his suggestion was that the small countries would stand behind France which wanted individual States, each with autonomy, in order to try to outvote the Germans.  Perhaps, that is an argument in favour of joining the EEC.</P>
    <P>However, I think the greatest mistake in our joining is that we will hand over completely to another authority the right not alone to decide our future but to decide the ordinary laws of the country.  Do not forget that the referendum proposed is for the purpose of giving the right to the Government to enter the EEC and in doing so to allow any law which is in contravention of the laws of the European Parliament to be over-ridden by the European Parliament.  I think the <Col N="2025" /> people would be very foolish if they voted in favour of entry and I hope, therefore, that the Government will be defeated in the referendum.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully is normally regarded in the House as a first-class all-rounder, a man who can make a good case for most causes, but any of us listening to him this evening must realise that he was speaking with something less than his usual conviction on the cause he was trying to support&mdash;that we should and the people should decide to stay outside the EEC.  He spoke about references to honesty and dishonesty in relation to putting the case for or against entry. Certainly, I agree there should be absolute honesty in our discussions on this subject because there is no question that in deciding this issue the people are taking one of the biggest steps in the history of the country. I agree it is necessary that the greatest sincerity should be used and the maximum of information should be made available to the people.</P>
      <P>Many feel that the people in the country generally know very little about the EEC or about what they will be facing and what the country will be confronted with as a member. I am not a bit sure that is correct. The people read the newspapers, watch television and listen to the news on the radio and I believe they know far more than most of us give them credit for. They may not know the final details but, broadly speaking, they now have made up their minds whether the EEC will be good for the country or not, whether there are real alternatives for us.  They are the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to support the view that the recent television show, on which there was a discussion on the lines of a court, was extremely effectice. Ample opportunity was given to all sides to put their case before the people.  I watched the programme throughout and was convinced at the end that although those who oppose entry had no case to make they, in fact, did make a case.  It could be said that Father McDyer in his <Col N="2026" /> own way made a case for the small farming communities in Donegal and other parts of the country.  At least the man sounded sincere and I am sure he was sincere in what he had to say.  He put his point of view over very well.  It would not cut much ice with most people who have worked on the land.  We talk about small farmers and the wonderful thing it is to keep them in existence but they will not remain and accept this low standard of living any longer.  Small farmers endured this in the past but the people who are now aged from 18 to 21 years will not remain on farms of 20 or even 30 acres of any type of land. Many of them will emigrate because emigration is very easy.  If they do not emigrate they will migrate into the industrial areas and get a higher standard of living.  The pull to the lights is there.</P>
    <P>We have heard much discussion about the fact that money and investment will be attracted to the more prosperous and larger areas.  I had the experience recently of meeting an industrialist who came in here and made inquiries about a rural area.  This industrialist felt there would be less labour unrest and there would be more stability in a rural area.  However, the majority of industrialists want to put their investment in the large towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Those of us who feel that the right and proper thing to do is to go into the Common Market should not try to oversell it.  It is possible that some people are overselling or underselling the Common Market.  It is like high pressure salesmanship.  It is no use just telling people that there will be an increase in the cost of living.  Of course there will be a substantial increase in the cost of living.  We have had a substantial increase in the cost of living here over the past few years and there was no Common Market.</P>
    <P>Small farmers have been flying from the land without any Mansholt Plan. Some people pretend we have no problems now and that we will only have problems when we enter the EEC.  We have a very high unemployment rate in this country at the moment but this has nothing to do with our entry into the EEC.  Those people who try to sell <Col N="2027" /> that point of view are giving the impression that it has in some way something to do with our entry to the EEC. That is an indication of the type of semi-dishonesty and of overselling and underselling we have in connection with the whole treatment of the Common Market situation.  I am glad that the case has been put simply to the people and I am also glad that the date of the referendum has been postponed until after the new register of electors becomes operative in the middle of April.  This gives an opportunity to a greater number of people to have a say in this important issue.</P>
    <P>I could understand to some extent the attitude of the members of the Labour Party while the negotiations were in progress.  This was good for the country and it helped our negotiators to get a better bargain.  All of us had a responsibility to prod them to look for the maximum they could get. We may be satisfied or we may be dissatisfied with what has been secured by our negotiators.  However, the negotiations are over and the Treaty of Accession has been signed.  All of us would like to see better terms but on the whole the terms negotiated are reasonably satisfactory and perhaps are as good as we could hope for in the circumstances where we were mainly an agricultural country and where we had little or nothing to contribute to the EEC.  In fact, we could only add to their problems.  Now that the negotiations are ended and that we know the terms we should go out and advise the people that there is not, in fact, any real alternative.  It is nonsense to be talking any longer about other possible agreements or some form of associate agreement or even some sort of trade agreement.  Nobody could honestly say that any of those forms of agreement short of full membership have a decided advantage for this country.</P>
    <P>Some people talk about things we lose by becoming full members.  The main thing they talk about is a loss of sovereignty.  What good is this sovereignty to us and in what way do we exercise it at the present time?  In what way can we insist on getting any particular benefits from having this sovereignty at the moment?  Most of <Col N="2028" /> those things will be decided in future for us in the EEC.  In what way will this particularly curtail us as a nation? I do not believe it will curtail us in any way.</P>
    <P>I am glad that it has been made clear that there is no defence commitment in the EEC for this country.  This cannot be emphasised too often because there are people who are putting forward the idea that if we enter the EEC we have to accept a defence commitment and that we will find ourselves out fighting all over Europe as a result of this.  It should be made quite clear that we go in without a defence commitment and that if we were to enter such a defence commitment this House and the people would have to decide on it.</P>
    <P>I hope we never enter into such a commitment.  We have more than enough to do to bring the strength of the Army in this country up to a level where we will have enough people to defend us.  Obviously we have to strengthen our defence force above what it is at the moment, but I do not think we should ever strengthen it for the purpose of going out to fight in Europe.  It is fairly clear to most people that we are not entering into a defence commitment.  Those who do not want us to enter see nothing good in this. They see no advantages.  Unfortunately, some of the people who want us to enter see nothing bad in it.  Both are wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully says that there is no advantage in a regional policy and no great hope for the poorer parts of this country if we enter the EEC.  It has been shown that the part of Europe which has gained the greatest advantage was the poorest part.</P>

      <P>The maximum advantages will accrue to the regions which make the greatest effort to prepare schemes.  Funds exist to assist such schemes of development.  The Government are falling down badly in their preparation for entry.  I have not heard of schemes being prepared.  If we have a programme for regional development the Minister should have given the House some information about it today. We cannot proceed too fast in this direction.  If we are to take advantage of membership, we should be preparing to make use of the various funds in the EEC for this type of development as soon as we enter.  We must prepare now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is being said that immediately we enter the EEC Irish land will be purchased on a large scale.  Many people have mentioned this point to me. Wholesale purchase of Irish land will not happen.  Purchase of Irish land will be on a limited basis.  Some time ago Deputy Tully said that there was a man employed in County Meath as a labourer and that he was from one of the EEC countries.  This man probably has sufficient money to buy land and wishes to come in and qualify.  He is prepared to endure his present position for two years.  Any young man could do this.  There will be a limited transaction in regard to the purchase of land.  There will be no wholesale land purchase in this country.  The land of Ireland will not pass out of the hands of the Irish people.  There is an emotive attachment to land here, as the Minister for Lands has said.  If it was not for this love of land many more people would have left it long ago because the level of income was very low.  There was very little to brighten the lives of people in many rural parts of the country.  It was only the love of the land that kept them there.  It is hard to extinguish it. If the Land Commission want to pursue a vigorous policy of keeping the land of Ireland for the Irish people, <Col N="2030" /> they can certainly have a scheme ready which will ensure that the land will not pass to foreigners.  The scheme cannot be framed in a way that will give the impression that we are discriminating against any of the people in the member countries, but our land re-structuring programme could be so arranged as to ensure that the Land Commission would buy up all available land and distribute it among uneconomic holdings in order to bring them up to a certain level.  Such a scheme has progressed too slowly over the years. It can be improved.  We should be preparing that sort of legislation now in order to ensure that the things that could happen can be satisfactorily arranged when we enter the EEC.  A certain danger exists but safeguards can be arranged and loopholes closed.</P>
    <P>Government Departments may already be actively engaged in this type of exercise.  It is a little disappointing that we have not heard more about the preparations which are being made behind the scenes to ensure that the maximum advantage will be gained by membership of EEC and that the disadvantages or dangers that some people see are guarded against as far as it is possible to guard against them.</P>
    <P>Fisheries have been mentioned. Many of our fishermen are dissatisfied or not fully satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations.  It could be said perhaps that a better bargain could have been made.</P>

      <P>The Minister was obviously relying on the fact that any decision reached up to now required the unanimous vote of all members of EEC.  He stayed with that view and if he had succeeded the outcome would <Col N="2032" /> have been better.  But he did not succeed.  With hindsight, it is easy enough to say that if we had stayed with the Norwegians and adopted their attitude from the beginning we might have got a better bargain.  That is also conjecture.  The fact is that we have not a very satisfactory arrangement for fisheries and that we have only succeeded in getting the 12-mile limit for portion of the coast and the six-mile limit for the remainder.  It is a great pity that the EEC countries were not somewhat more generous with us here because great strides were being made in the past few years in improving our fisheries.  Our fishermen displayed great courage in the amount of money they were prepared to borrow and invest in boats and gear to equip themselves, first, so as to provide themselves with a better livelihood and, secondly, to meet the competition that was inevitably ahead.</P>
      <P>We have a degree of protection for the next ten years but it still presents a rather insecure position for our fishermen and one can understand their apprehension and disquiet, but we must admit that a hard effort was made and a hard fight fought to make a better bargain for these men.  They were in Brussels themselves at the conclusion of the negotiations and saw at first hand how difficult it was to do better.  What is of most concern is that fishermen from the member countries have a right of access to our harbours from the beginning.  This gives them a kind of foothold that can make them competitors in a way in which they have never been competitors before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disgraceful that anybody should come into this House and, as Deputy Tully said, turn it into a sort of bear garden when we are discussing a subject that concerns the people very seriously.  I should like to say a word about industry. There is no doubt that here again there will be disruption in certain industries but we should be extremely grateful for the conditions that have been secured for industry.  It was particularly hard to believe that it could be fully agreed that the tax concession on exports would be allowed to remain until 1990.  But that has been allowed or, if there is any alteration in the situation, we have a guarantee that the incentives that will take its place will be at least as good as that already there.  While some industries will not be able to continue in EEC, certainly the fact that we are allowed to retain this incentive and that we now have access to a market of 250 million people should be a great attraction to American or Japanese industrialists and industrialists from parts of Europe which are still outside EEC and unlikely to enter it for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope to see quite an in-flux of industry here as soon as it is definite that this country is going into EEC and will have free access to that market.  I understand that the number of inquiries is increasing all the time but still I do not think definite decisions will be made by people who will eventually come here until there is a final decision on our entry.  We should have a very big attraction for <Col N="2034" /> Americans and Japanese and outside countries in Europe such as Sweden where salaries, wages and taxes are extremely high and where, because of the costs of production, they are importing quite a large proportion of their own requirements and have a ready market there at present if they came over to produce here with very much lower production costs.  On the whole I would see industry prospering, not immediately but in quite a short time.</P>
    <P>During the time I spent on the Council of Europe I availed of the opportunity to discuss with representatives of countries that are already members of EEC the effects on their small industries and on their small farmers particularly because these are the areas in which people are fearful and apprehensive of the changes that are likely to take place.  Without exception they assured me that all of them gained as a result of membership and that the small farmer and small industrialist benefited by the increased prosperity generated in EEC.  All of them got some of it.  They said there was initial disruption in certain industries and instead of producing for themselves they became service industries to larger industries but they are still in existence as small industries. Their small farms are still in existence and I do not understand how anybody can say small farmers will fare worse in EEC.  I cannot see how increased prices will be bad for a small farmer. He will not, of course, get the same advantage as a large farmer who is producing more goods because there will be more profit on more produce but he will gain the advantages.  There will be enormous advantages, for milk products particularly, and milk production is intensive farming.  If people want to stay on a rather small acreage they are most likely to get most through milk production.</P>
    <P>By small farmers I do not mean those having 20 or 30 acres because any farmer who has less than 50 acres has a very poor livelihood today. Small farmers will have to get more land if they are to continue in agriculture. In Germany, for instance, farms are much smaller in size than they are here but these people are not <Col N="2035" /> worried.  As well as getting increased prices for their produce the opportunity is open to them of being employed in industry.  In fact, people are being imported to Germany to work in industry.  I am aware that recently a figure for unemployment in the EEC countries was quoted but by comparison with the level of unemployment that exists here and in Britain, this was very low.  This unemployment within the EEC is a recent development.</P>
    <P>Membership of the EEC will result in huge increases in the prices of beef, lamb, milk and barley.  These will be our main products.  The prices for wheat and sugar beet will be much the same as they are now.  Of course, the inputs will be greater but I think it is acknowledged by all that the profits from farming will increase substantially.</P>
    <P>It follows automatically that there will be an increase in the cost of living and unless incomes and social welfare benefits are increased accordingly there will be suffering and hardship. I fail to see how any Government would allow that situation to develop. If they did they could not hope to stay in office.  It has been made clear that there will be a substantial saving in subsidies on milk products alone&mdash; about £30 million.  This money will be available for distribution among people on fixed incomes and those in receipt of social welfare benefits to enable them to meet the increased cost of living.  However, there is no point in exaggerating the effect of these extra moneys because in any case there will be some increase in the cost of living regardless of whether we enter the EEC.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress again that the question of preparation for membership is one of great urgency.  This applies to many Government Departments and I hope that before the conclusion of this debate we will be told something about the plans that are being formulated in the various Departments so as to enable us to reap the full advantages of membership at the earliest possible date.  I hope, too, that we will be told something <Col N="2036" /> of the measures being taken to safeguard against any danger that may exist in regard to entry.  I was surprised that the Taoiseach did not give us some insight into what is happening.</P>
    <P>I am one of the people who believe that there is no alternative to full membership and I consider it nonsense for anyone to say otherwise.  We know that approximately 65 per cent of our exports go to Britain and that approximately 15 per cent go to the EEC countries.  Should tariff barriers be erected against these exports what would be our position?  We know how poorly industry can stand up to any rough wind even now and if our firms were faced with tariff barriers, they would go out of business and wholesale unemployment would result. Therefore, those people who talk of staying out must have no idea of what the position would be.  We would be exporting shiploads of our young people.  I do not accept that there are alternatives by way of trade agreements or association agreements that would prevent this happening.  By not entering we would have a situation that would be much worse than the economic war because our people at that time at least were accustomed to low standards of living.  However, standards have increased very much since then and there must be money to maintain this changed situation.  If we were faced with tariff barriers we would almost starve.  We should consider these aspects very carefully before deciding to vote against entering.  We are getting an opportunity now that has been denied us for far too long.  For as long as any of us can remember, we have been tied hand and foot to the British market.  It was they who decided the amount of produce they would take from us and the price to be paid for that produce.  We had no power to alter their decisions and neither had we any alternative market to turn to.  The amount of produce that we were able to sell outside the British market was so small as to be of very little consequence. It is unreasonable for anyone to state that because we are Britain's third best customer we have a certain leverage that we could use because, of course, Britain could not continue <Col N="2037" /> prices.  In Brussels, we will have our accession to the Community if we should remain outside it.</P>
    <P>Now that it is clear that Britain will enter, those people in this country who oppose membership for us should discontinue this opposition and tell our people that there is no chance for us if we stay out.  The false impression is being created that we could stay as we are.  If we could do so, even with the prospects we have at the moment, I would probably opt to stay out rather than face the unknown and the fierce competition that we will have to face, but that option is not open to us.</P>
    <P>During the referendum campaign I shall strongly exhort the people in my constituency to vote for joining. I will tell them that this is our opportunity to produce to the maximum and to sell at good prices but if the Irish people are not as good as any others in Europe then, in my opinion, they deserve to remain poor.  As well as those advantages there are sufficient safeguards built into the terms that have been negotiated to give us an opportunity of building up where we are weak and of enabling us to reach a standard that would allow us to produce alongside people in any other country in the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must agree with Deputy Clinton in his opening remarks.  I also listened to Deputy Tully, who is an able contributor to debates in this House, but, like Deputy Clinton, I too felt he was not putting into his speech the same punch and conviction that we normally associate with speeches from Deputy Tully, which, to my mind, proves that even he is not convinced of the &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign that has been launched against our entry into Europe.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in his address to the House, said that the referendum would be held in May.  In this referendum the people will make the biggest decision they have ever made since the State was founded, and it is right that as many people as are eligible should be on the voting list.  Therefore the decision to hold the referendum in May when the new register will be available was a wise one and one on which the Government should be complimented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2038" /> The usual argument has been trotted out in defence of our staying out of Europe.  As many Deputies have said, there is no such thing, as there was in the last referendum, as stay as you are or change.  In this case there will be change whether we go into Europe or stay out of it.  If we stay out we shall be cut away from the main stream, a little island in the west, divided, as we are, and with an economic barrier and a political border to our country which would be greater even than it is today.  However, I am satisfied that the people are not foolish enough to vote against entry and that Ireland will be going into Europe.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we must have some defence commitments with the other applicant and member nations of Europe.  Why this issue has been bandied around I do not know.  It may be because certain applicants and present members are also members of NATO, as is America, but America is not part of the EEC.  It is no harm to quote from the Taoiseach's speech today on this matter:</P>
    <P>These obligations do not entail any military or defence commitments for there are no such commitments involved in Ireland's acceptance of the Treaties.  The reason why I am emphasising this point again is that some people are persisting in their attempts to make this an issue in our membership of the Communities despite the clear evidence to the contrary and the repeated, unequivocal assurances on the subject.  One can only assume that this is a diversionary tactic designed to distract attention from the real issues involved in membership to which they are opposed for other reasons.</P>
    <P>We all know what a trade agreement is and this entry into Europe is, strictly speaking, a trade agreement.  How anybody can say there is any defence commitment in a trade agreement is beyond me.  For example, we have a trade agreement with Britain, but surely we have no defence commitment with Britain.  Industry and agriculture are the matters involved here. Other matters like housing, social welfare <Col N="2039" /> and health will still be matters for the Government, matters to be discussed here and for the Irish people to pay for.  There will be no special grants or concessions in respect of them whether we are in or out of Europe.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about agriculture.  It has been stated recently that anybody engaged in agriculture, whether he be a farmer or a farm labourer, or engaged in the service industries associated with agriculture, or has any other connection with agriculture, should be certified if he does not vote for entry into the EEC.  I shall come back to agriculture afterwards, but, generally speaking, there will be problems.  The proof of that is the hard negotiations conducted by our Minister for Foreign Affairs in connection with the motor car assembly industry and in connection with our sugar quota.  The Minister has done his part to see that, at least, we shall have time to adjust ourselves to the changes that will come about. In regard to industry we can still have our tax-free concessions; we can still pay grants to industrialists who wish to set up here, and as Deputy Clinton said, there are quite a number of inquiries in the pipeline by such industrialists.</P>
    <P>The main problem we must face is that there are 35,000 people employed in industry which depends on the export market.  Most other workers are associated with industries that supply the home market or with service industries of various kinds.  Certain protective action can be taken if the jobs of these 35,000 people are in jeopardy as a result of our entry into Europe. What I want to ask is: if Britain with the Six and the other two applicant countries apart from ourselves form a trading group to be known as the Nine and we are outside it and they put on a tariff or duty on our industrial exports coming from the firms in which those 35,000 people are employed, where are we going to export those goods to?  It has been suggested that we could export to Iceland, Portugal, Spain, eastern Europe, Yugoslavia, Latvia, Lithuania.  Why is it that we are not exporting to these countries now?  If exports can be <Col N="2040" /> made to these countries the people in this House who are making these suggestions should see to it that such trade is developed.  To say that by staying out of Europe we can sell our industrial goods to Europe, and that we can put duties on imports coming in here, is not a reasonable expectation. Whether we like it or not there must be free trade for industrial goods. Even if we stay out of Europe we cannot expect to get special concessions to send our industrial goods into Europe and, at the same time, impose duties on their goods coming in here.</P>
    <P>It is very unfair to management and to workers to say that we are not able to compete in industry at this stage with other industrialists in Europe or anywhere else.  Irish men and women in the field of education and in every other sphere, as workers who have travelled from Dunkirk to Belgrade, as the saying goes, down through the years have held their own with everybody else in Europe.  I am quite satisfied that, with the adaptation grants that have been availed of by management for the retraining of workers and for the further training they will get between now and the time that all protection will have to go, Irish manufacturers and Irish goods will hold their own with any other nation in Europe.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Clinton said, there is no alternative.  From the first moment that I learned of the formation of the European Economic Community I was in favour of it.  I was in favour of it before we ever started to negotiate our entry into Europe.  We have been tied to Britain economically for 700 years or, perhaps, longer.  It has been argued that, when we enter Europe, our decisions will be made for us in Brussels. The price of our agricultural produce will admittedly be decided in Brussels. During the 700 years, or more, to which I referred earlier, where were the decisions made?  The price of our agricultural produce was decided in London in the Smithfield market.  If there was a recession in Smithfield it was a case of their getting a cold there and our getting pneumonia.  When we enter Europe we will be able to break away from that and have prices decided for us in Brussels.  In London, we had no voice in any decision about <Col N="2041" /> making agreements with us on her representative.  He will be a member of the Council of Ministers.  Some member states will have two representatives. Britain will have two.  Belgium, Ireland and Norway will each have one representative.  Bearing in mind our population and the population of Britain surely one representative for 3,000,000 of a population is a generous representation.  Britain will have two representatives for a population of something over 50,000,000 people.  The Council of Ministers is the really important body and we will have in that Council equal representation with the three smaller countries and I am satisfied our representative will be as good as any of his counterparts in Europe.</P>
    <P>I doubt if it would be possible to have a debate in this House without some reference to the Border.  If we were to stay out of Europe we would have a border not merely between the Twenty-Six and the Six and not merely between Britain and Ireland, but we would have a border also between this country and Europe.  When we enter Europe, the economic border goes and we hope it will not be long before the political one goes too.  Those who would claim to be superior republicans&mdash;that is the best way to describe them&mdash;are joining with Ian Paisley, William Craig and the other great Irish Republicans.  But why do Ian Paisley and William Craig want to stay out of Europe?  Because they want to keep the Border and the nice subsidies from Britain.  These will have to go when Britain and Northern Ireland go into Europe.</P>
    <P>Looking at Europe, can we not see how world trade is going?  After the last war we had not alone countries joining together for trading purposes but we had businesses amalgamating for trading purposes.  Europe is now a big trading bloc, one of the richest in the world from the point of view of population and the amount people have to spend.  There is then the eastern trading bloc made up of the Communist countries and there is the United States trading bloc.  Where will we go to trade?  If a man in Deputy Esmonde's constituency of Wexford <Col N="2042" /> wants to set up a business and trade with Galway, it is not in Wexford he will set up; he will set up in Galway. If he wants to trade in Wexford he will set up there.  We cannot move this island of ours out into the North Atlantic in order to trade with America.  The only suitable area in which to trade is in Europe with our European neighbours.  I cannot understand how we could hope to trade with North America.  America does not want many of the products we produce.  We have some quotas for meat and we supply about 4,500 tons of sugar, but we have not much else with which we could trade with America.  Eastern countries then, because of poverty, perhaps, or for some other reason, are not very keen on buying from us.</P>
    <P>Ours is basically an agricultural country.  Deputy Pattison and I come from a predominantly agricultural constituency.  Every town and village in our constituency is based on the surrounding agricultural hinterland. Everybody is tied in in some way with agriculture.  Even the road worker is tied in with agriculture because he is maintaining and repairing the roads to provide an easy passage for the farmer's agricultural machinery, his tractor and so forth.</P>
    <P>In Carlow town we have the sugar company.  There is a steel industry. These survive on agriculture.  The sugar company is based on agriculture. That is why we were so pleased with the sugar quota in the Common Market.  We got a quota for 150,000 tons, an excess of about 15,000 or 16,000 tons on the average production from sugar beet in Carlow over the last ten years.  Apart from that, if the factory is able to produce it and the farmer grows the beet, we will have a further 50,000 tons.</P>
    <P>As I said, our whole economy is based on agriculture.  Every shop is supplying something directly or indirectly connected with agriculture. Even the lorry driver who carries milk or manures is connected with agriculture. Anyone who does not vote for entry into Europe should be certified.</P>
