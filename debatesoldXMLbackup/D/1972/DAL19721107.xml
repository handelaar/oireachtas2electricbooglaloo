      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. P. Brennan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether in addition to protesting at the holding of the plebiscite in the Six Counties he will take action to counter this misleading gambit by arranging a plebiscite on similar lines to be held on the same day in the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer Deputies to the remarks I made in this connection in this House on Thursday last, the 2nd November, 1972, arising out of my reply to Questions Nos. 3 to 6 and Question No. 8 on that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a similar question some months ago before the Dáil went into recess for the summer and the Taoiseach's reply at that stage was that, until such time as the <Col N="787" /> Government did so decide to hold a plebiscite, he would not say what their intention was.  Having regard to the fact that the British Government intend to initiate legislation to effect a plebiscite in the Six Counties, would the Taoiseach now announce what the Government's intention here is?  Will they hold a referendum, or will they not, on this side of the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to know that this is a serious matter and one which requires considerable thought and careful consideration.  In so far as he has mentioned legislation by the British Government, that legislation has only been introduced.  The extent to which it may be amended, I do not know, but I hope it will be amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire as to whether or not the Taoiseach has indicated his fears and, indeed, his displeasure at the proposed holding of this plebiscite in the Six Counties, the dangers inherent in the holding of it, the provocativeness of the assured result and whether, in fact, all of this will move him and the Government to make a decision to counterbalance that misleading result, a result assured before ever the plebiscite takes place, and have a true plebiscite on this side of the Border to which could be added the minority vote in the Six Counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave in this House on that particular matter before the summer recess.  It was very detailed. I spelled out with some precision the dangers I foresaw in a plebiscite in the North on the Border issue, especially a plebiscite with a question in the terms in which it would seem now to be, and, in the course of that statement, I said that, apart altogether from the provocation that would arise, there did not seem to be much point in having a question put the answer to which was already known.  I have the same feeling about a plebiscite down here but, nevertheless, I still have the matter under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising directly out of Question No. 8, will the Taoiseach <Col N="788" /> continue to make perfectly clear to Mr. Heath the misgivings which just about every party in this House have about the terms in which the proposed British plebiscite has been put? Will he continue to propose to Mr. Heath and, indeed, to Mr. Wilson, that the terms of the British plebiscite be altered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my position on this matter very clear, and not only on the holding of the plebiscite but also on the terms of reference. The Deputy need have no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling Question No. 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a brief question arising out of the Taoiseach's reply. Might I ask whether or not the Taoiseach has made it quite clear to the British Government that this plebiscite, the result of which is already assured, as we all know, is just not acceptable to us?  We just do not accept it.  We never have and we never will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I may say that our view about the right of a small section of any nation exercising a right of this nature is that it is not accepted by us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will furnish particulars of pay, hours of work and holidays for industrial workers and agricultural workers in the nine countries of the enlarged EEC in the form of a reply of 28th April, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing data on rates of earnings, hours worked and holidays for industrial workers in this country, the present EEC countries and the United Kingdom in so far as it is possible to derive them from official sources.  It should be borne in mind that the validity of international comparisons of figures of this kind <Col N="789" /> may be impaired by differences relating to coverage and scope.  The overall average figures also reflect the structure of manufacturing industry which differs substantially between the different countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of official exchange rates in international comparisons is another factor which affects their meaningfulness; however a valid comparison of <Col N="790" /> relative money values between different countries would require a very detailed investigation based on consumption patterns and relative prices for principal consumption items in the different countries.</P>
    <P>Corresponding data for the agricultural sector, which are comparable between different countries, are not available.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>I.&mdash;Average earnings per hour and average weekly hours worked by industrial workers in manufacturing industry in the EEC countries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in the number of medical cards referred to by the Deputy, at 1.4 per cent, is not regarded as significant.  Detailed analysis of the reasons for minor variations of this nature is not normally undertaken by the health board.  In any event, the figure at 30th <Col N="796" /> September, 1972, which has only just come to hand, shows a considerable increase on that applicable three months earlier.</P>
      <P>The current criteria for assessing eligibility for general medical services were only introduced by the Eastern Health Board in June, 1972. It would be premature for the board to alter them at this time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also have noted, from my answer to his question of November 2nd, that there was an increase of 2.4 per cent in the number of persons covered by medical cards as between June, 1971, and June, 1972.</P>

      <P>As regards Convention (No. 99) and Convention (No. 101) existing legislation is generally in conformity with the provisions of these conventions, but there are some points of difference which prevent their formal retification. The situation is being reviewed.</P>
      <P>In the case of Convention (No. 129) the position is that, the inspection system operating under the Agricultural Wages Acts and the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts is concerned with enforcement of the statutory minimum rates of pay, overtime and holidays.  The convention in question is a most detailed one and its requirements are couched in rigid terms.  I have doubts whether the changes which would have to be made in our law to enable the convention to be ratified would be acceptable here but the matter is being reviewed.</P>
      <P>The convention on the Guarding of Machinery (No. 119) applies to all sectors of the economy.  Again, this is a most detailed convention which would call for exceptional measures of investigation and supervision over all sectors using both power-driven and manually operated machinery, new and second-hand.  The sale, hire, transfer and exhibition of machinery are also involved.  I am reviewing the situation in this case also, but I have no proposals at present for amendments to the law relating to the matters covered by the convention.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister must admit that the conventions referred to are accepted as standard in the EEC countries?  While we seem to be terribly anxious to adopt every EEC provision, which has not been investigated too deeply and to pass it through this House while, as I pointed out the other day, it is in French, <Col N="801" /> and has not been translated into English, here are conventions which have been in operation for years and the Minister is now telling us that because there is some difficulty about them, the Minister does not see why they should be dealt with immediately. Could the Minister say if he has any proposals at all with reference to these conventions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>I have said that in my reply.  These conventions, in some cases, are the concern of more Departments than one.  We have legislation, which may not be adequate. Contrary to what the Deputy said, we have not subscribed to any of the conventions or adopted any conventions unless we had them properly covered by legislation here.  Perhaps we could adopt some of these if we were prepared to take a not serious view of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, having regard to the recent report that capital <Col N="807" /> gains on the Irish Stock Exchange during 1972 have amounted to £200 million and to the fact that the total earnings of workers in manufacturing industry are no more than £225 million, it is now proposed to introduce a capital gains tax in the interests of social justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, I assume, referring to a newspaper article in which it was alleged that, this year, the owners of Irish shares had made a collective tax-free capital gain of over £200 million.  The article went on, however, to say that this gain had not been realised but that it was in fact only a paper profit which would disappear if everyone tried to cash in at the one time.  Furthermore, if a capital gains tax were in force, it would apply only to realised gains and then only to that portion of those gains attributable to the period subsequent to the introduction of the tax.</P>
      <P>The general question of introducing a capital gains tax or some other form of wealth taxation in addition to the existing death duties is a matter for consideration in the context of the taxation system as a whole which is the subject of continuing review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that, while the individuals concerned may not have realised their gains, they most certainly have accumulated them?  Their bank managers will be quite appreciative of the fact that the so-called paper profits he referred to will be of considerable benefit to them as individuals, in the short or the long term.  In the circumstances, would the Minister not now accept that the demand from the Labour Party, which has been repeated in this House <i>ad nauseam</i> since 1965, for the introduction of a capital gains tax, is justified in the light of the major capital accumulation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Despite that fact, when the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are replacing telephone installations in Government Departments or State bodies, the possibility of providing a type of switchboard suitable for blind telephonists is examined on each occasion.  There are more blind telephonists employed by the State than is indicated in the answer I have given, as the Deputy will appreciate, because of the terms of the question.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the meeting at Luxembourg on the 30th and 31st October was to consider measures to combat inflation. During the two-day meeting there was a wide-ranging discussion of the problem as it affects each of the nine countries concerned and agreement was reached on the terms of an EEC Council resolution designed to provide remedies.  I am arranging to have a copy of the resolution placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> The resolution provides for anti-inflation action under various heads, principally related to the moderation of the growth of prices, incomes, and the money supply.  As agreed, the resolution applies only to the existing six EEC member countries.  However, the three acceding countries, including Ireland, have agreed to the objectives in mind, subject to the needs of their own economies.</P>
    <P>On Ireland's behalf, I fully welcomed the Community's initiative which is in our immediate interest as a country currently experiencing the highest rate of inflation of the nine. The resolution gives us valuable guidlines for the fight against inflation.</P>

However, I should like to state that since the Shannon drainage scheme was mooted in 1965, the potential of the River Shannon as a recreational cruiseway and for other aquatic sports has projected itself. With the growth of worldwide demand for aquatic sports generally, and in view of our entry into the EEC, these resources must be taken into account <Col N="818" /> fully when the cost/benefit study is being made.</P>

    <Title>Marriages Bill, 1972: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This short Bill has two main purposes. The first is to determine a statutory minimum age for marriage; the second is to eliminate difficulties or doubts which the present legislation relating to marriage causes and to make some urgent amendments of the existing law relating to marriages.</P>
      <P>Deputies will remember that a former Marriages Bill was circulated in 1965 and lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil.  This present Bill is much the same measure with some amendments and the addition of other provisions which have accrued since then.  These provisions and amendments, the consequential consultations which were themselves rather lengthy, and legal complexities which were encountered, added up to considerable delay in bringing the new measure before the House.</P>
      <P>Before speaking about the detailed provisions of the Bill, I would like to make some observations of a general kind.  Deputies will see that this is an interim measure which makes no pretence of establishing a new marriage code.  Its modest aim is to make desirable and rather urgent changes of a limited character.  Most of the provisions of the Bill could, I think, be described as liberalising provisions; they either meet a specific need or remove or modify an existing restriction or give an additional power which has been sought or welcomed by the denomination concerned.</P>
      <P>I would like to bring openly into the picture the relevant parts of the report of the Dáil Committee on the Constitution of December, 1967.  The committee commented in paragraphs 128 and 129 of the report in the following terms&mdash;and I quote:</P>
      <P>128.  Article 44.2.3º0 (of the Constitution) provides that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" />&ldquo;The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the grounds of religious profession, belief or status.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the Marriage Acts different conditions are prescribed for marriages performed in accordance with the rites of (I) the Church of Ireland, (II) the Presbyterian Church, (III) other Protestant Churches, (IV) the Jewish Religion. These conditions relate to prior residence, district where the marriage is to be celebrated and place and time of the marriage.  No similar conditions are laid down in connection with Roman Catholic marriages.</P>
    <P>It appears that the Marriage Acts are now being revised but that it may be necessary to continue with the differentiation between the different kinds of marriage ceremonies. The abolition of the conditions relating to the marriage of non-Catholics is not regarded as an advisable step as some of the smaller denominations are not sufficiently organised to ensure that parties who present themselves for marriage are, in fact, free to marry.</P>
    <P>129.  The opinion has been expressed that these provisions constitute discrimination on the grounds of religious profession or belief within the meaning of Article 44.2.3º0 and that at least the penal provisions of the existing code would be declared not to have been carried over under the Constitution. We recommend that this difficulty be removed by adding a suitable provision to this part of the Constitution to the effect that the prohibitions on religious discrimination shall not prevent the enactment of different procedural rules relating to different kinds of marriage ceremonies with a view to ensuring that all legal rules are complied with by the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>To summarise&mdash;paragraph 128 of the report spells out differences in law about conditions applicable to Roman Catholics and conditions applicable to <Col N="831" /> other religions.  Paragraph 129 quotes an opinion as having been expressed that these differences may be discriminatory for these other religions.  The committee do not themselves pronounce on this opinion except by implication in recommending that the Constitution be amended to enable these different conditions to be continued. In so doing the committee, in effect, accepted that the differences should be respected and that any necessary changes should be made in the Constitution itself and not in the law which sets out those differences.</P>
    <P>There are some important issues involved here and I want to be quite explicit about my view on them. First of all, it is, of course, correct to say that there are different conditions provided in the law; but I should emphasise that most of them are 100 years old or over.  These differences arose for historical and developmental reasons and I sincerely hope that nobody regards them as arising from fresh impositions by the State on anybody&mdash;majority or minority. If anybody so regards them, then he is totally wrong.</P>
    <P>These differences must be clearly seen as complementary to the rules and regulations of the religious denominations concerned.</P>
    <P>Many persons, including myself, would welcome a general overhaul of the marriage laws, a consolidation and codification and modernisation of enactments which, as I have said, go back over 100 years.  If this view is supported in the debate on this Bill, then, quite clearly, such a comprehensive measure will come.  But, to achieve full effectiveness, I firmly believe that the need for it must be accepted generally and that, in its extent, its content and its timing, religious denominations must have a considerable voice.  In matters so delicate, so complex and so important as the marriage laws, which affect every member of the community in one way or another, which are interwoven with religious beliefs and practices, which are interlinked with rights to property, and which have repercussions on the marriage laws of <Col N="832" /> other countries, as they in turn must have on ours, I do not have to stress that the enactment of a comprehensive measure, however essential, will call for thought and care of an exceptional degree in its preparation. It will be a task of considerable difficulty.</P>
    <P>The amendments effected by the present Bill are urgent and, even if they have taken a long time to mature, they cannot await the enactment of the comprehensive measure to which I have alluded.</P>
    <P>The Bill, I have described as a small one, but it is not so small that the complexity attendant on any amendment of the marriage laws does not clearly emerge.  I would not willingly undertake the sponsoring of a Bill of this nature through the Oireachtas were I not fortified, as I am, by the knowledge that the Bill respects those different beliefs and practices and is, in general sought or welcomed by the denominations affected by its provisions.</P>
    <P>Where a provision affects one denomination only I think that I can say that in all cases I have given total satisfaction to that denomination. Where it affects more than one, I have endeavoured to afford the highest possible degree of satisfaction taking into account the views put forward and the involvement of the parties commenting.</P>
    <P>Deputies should know that widespread consultations regarding this Bill were held with the authorities of religious bodies in the State before the terms of the Bill were formulated.  Discussion on other aspects of the Bill were continued after that date.  Indeed, in order to ensure that nothing was missed, on the day when circulation of the Bill to Deputies was effected, a letter issued on my instructions to each religious body enclosing a copy of the Bill and explanatory memorandum, inviting each to examine the printed Bill and, if desired, to furnish comments on its contents in time for consideration by me, for consultation with other religious bodies affected by the comments and for the preparation of Committee Stage amendments in appropriate cases.  May I take the <Col N="833" /> opportunity of expressing my gratitude for the co-operation so readily given by those so consulted?  I shall have amendments to propose on Committee arising from all these actions.  May I add also, that if, during the course of the passage of the Bill through the Dáil other desirable amendments are brought to my notice which can conveniently be incorporated in an interim measure, such as this, without delaying its passage unduly, Deputies and members of the denominations concerned may count fully on my good will and understanding.</P>
    <P>As to the detailed provisions of the Bill itself, Deputies will already have seen the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill and I shall, therefore, be as brief as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 1 prescribes a statutory minimum age of 16 years for male and female parties to a marriage with provision for marriage under that age subject to specified safeguards.  This is the first time that a statutory minimum age has been set down here in legislation in this State and in itself this is a major step forward.  Up to now reliance has been placed here on the common law under which minimum ages of 12 years for a girl and 14 years for a boy had been settled.  I feel that the limits now set may in time come again under review in the light of changing conditions.</P>
    <P>May I say that a convention of the United Nations in 1962, relating to marriage ages provided for participating States taking legislative action to specify a minimum age for marriage?  Article 2 of that convention reads:</P>
    <P>State parties to the present Convention shall take legislative action to specify a minimum age for marriage.  No marriage shall be legally entered into by any person under this age, except where a competent authority has granted a dispensation as to age, for serious reasons, in the interests of the intending spouses.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that no specific age was mentioned in the convention but a few years later, in 1965, the General Assembly of the United Nations recommended <Col N="834" /> member states to fix the minimum age at not less than 15 years and repeated the reference in the convention to a provision whereby a competent authority may grant &ldquo;a dispensation as to age, for serious reasons, in the interests of the intending spouses.&rdquo;  Deputies will see that I have attempted in the Bill to follow the United Nations convention and recommendation and to keep the interests of the intending spouses at all times to the fore.</P>
    <P>The numbers of marriages of persons, one of whom was under 16 years of age, are averaging about 30 a year and the statistics indicate that the great majority of those marriages were Roman Catholic.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with a small number of Catholic marriages of Irish people contracted in Lourdes, by religious ceremony only, before the passing of the Act, where the requirements of the French civil law were not complied with.  That law requires marriages to be by civil process whether or not a religious ceremony is also performed. In this country there is no separate civil ceremony and the Catholic marriage ceremony is, of course, recognised as legally valid.  The number of marriages involved was 33 and the period covered was 1953 to 1960, when the practice ceased.  It has been argued that, under common law, the courts here would surely recognise as valid in form marriages by religious ceremony only of Irish citizens at Lourdes.  It is undesirable, however, that the validity of such marriages should be left for determination to <i>ad hoc</i> legal argument and determination by court proceedings and I am satisfied that this is a matter which should be settled by legislation once and for all.  It is not a recurring problem; but I should point out that the section does not affect future marriages and, therefore, that Irish people if they marry abroad, whether in Lourdes or elsewhere, should satisfy themselves, that all legal requirements of the State in which the marriage is celebrated, are complied with.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with certain marriages of members of the Church of Ireland.  Some churches of the Church of Ireland have, in the past, been amalgamated <Col N="835" /> or closed and the districts of the closed church or amalgamated church should have been attached for marriage purposes to a church which was still open.  The section provides for any case where this was not done in good time.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is of interest to the members of the Jewish faith and authorises the secretary of a synagogue to appoint a deputy to act for him to make the necessary registrations under the marriage laws if he is absent through illness or other reasons.  This is a practical step to remedy an omission in the existing law.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is of special interest to members of the smaller denominations which have very few churches and where marriages are performed on presentation of a licence or a certificate obtained from the district registrar of marriages.  It will dispense with a residence qualification which has caused inconvenience up to now in obtaining registrars licences or certificates to marry.  At present it is necessary for a person who is a member of one of certain religious denominations who wishes to be married in the church of his own faith by his own clergyman to live for at least 23 days in the registrar's district in which the church in which the marriage is to be solemnised is situated.  When there is no church of his own faith in the registrar's district in which he normally resides, this involves a temporary change of residence. For example, it has sometimes meant coming to live in Dublin for this period although the person might reside ordinarily in Kerry or Donegal.  This special residence requirement will now be dropped and the necessary residence qualification can be established in the district of normal residence.</P>
    <P>Section 6 modifies the present law about the marriage of a person or persons under 21.  Where a parent or guardian of a minor refuses permission to marry, the minor may at present appeal to the president of the High Court.  In future under section 6 an appeal may be made in appropriate cases to the High Court.  The same procedure will in future apply <Col N="836" /> to cases where there is no parent or guardian and in this case the provision will stop a loop-hole in the existing law.  Deputies will notice the provision whereby the Minister may by regulations reduce the age of 21 to a lesser age.  If the voting age is reduced to 18, for example, a similar reduction in the age mentioned in the section would seem appropriate.  I intend to move a Committee amendment which will effect certain changes in the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill will change the words &ldquo;Meeting House&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;Church&rdquo; and will bring the legal titles into line with the usage of the Presbyterian Church.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives the Assistant to an tArd-Chláraitheoir the same formal statutory powers in relation to marriages as he now has in relation to births and deaths.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is concerned with the marriage in registrars' offices of members of the Church of Christ Scientist. Notice of intended marriage in these cases must now be published in the newspapers.  In future this will not be necessary and the notice of marriage may be sent to the secretary of the church.</P>
    <P>Section 10 removes a restriction on Church of Ireland marriage procedures occasioned by the strict wording of an Act of 1870 relating to those marriages.  The reference in the Act to church rules in force in 1870 is being altered to relate to church rules in force from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is of interest to members of the Church of Ireland who have continued to worship in a particular church after moving to another area. A typical example is where persons move from the centre city to the suburbs.  One of the parties who intend to marry by ordinary licence is now required to live for at least 14 days in the district of the central city church if they want to marry in that church.  This causes inconvenience. The section provides that this residence requirement will not be necessary if one of the parties has been a member of the congregation of the church for a period of three months before the marriage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> Sections 12 and 13 deal with statutory provisions about special licences.  Special licences under the law are issued by specified religious leaders who may authorise the marriage of persons of the same religion as themselves at any time, without residential qualification, and in any place.  These powers exist for over a century.  Sections 12 and 13 provide that, in future, only one of the parties to the marriage need be of the religion of the person issuing the licence.  Section 13 also authorises the Chief Rabbi to issue special licences; this is a new power in his case.</P>
    <P>Section 14 will enable two or more religious bodies to combine in the use of one building for marriage services by the religious bodies if they wish to do so.  Legal difficulties sometimes exist about the use of temporary buildings for marriage purposes where, for example, the main church building is being reconstructed or has been destroyed by fire.  Subsection (2) of section 14 makes the necessary amendments about this.</P>
    <P>Section 15 authorises an tArdChláraitheoir to issue a special licence for a marriage which would ordinarily be performed in a registrar's office if one of the parties is so seriously ill that he is not expected to recover and he or she could not travel to the registrar's office for the ceremony.  This will relieve hardship in the occasional cases of this nature which arise from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 16 repeals the various statutory requirements whereby marriages solemnised by various religious denominations may be solemnised only between the hours of 8 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon.  In future they may legally be solemnised at any time.  A time restriction is maintained in the case of registrars' offices only; but in this case the hour during which marriages may take place are being extended.  The present hours are from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.  The new hours will be 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the provisions of the Bill to which I hope Deputies will give a ready assent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I want to <Col N="838" /> say that this Bill contains provisions to meet the wishes of the individual churches.  It is interesting that it comes so soon after the Bill to delete the mention of churches in our Constitution.  It shows that, while our society is anxious not to be sectarian and not to cause offence to any church, it recognises the value of religion and the wisdom of accepting the advice of religious leaders in their own domain.</P>
      <P>With regard to section 1, subsection (3) I regret that the Minister did not introduce a new and up-to-date comprehensive Marriages Bill instead of trying to graft new law on to old Acts of 1844, 1863 and 1870.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to section 1 (4) where it states:</P>
      <P>The following persons are authorised persons for the purposes of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of subsection (3) of this section.</P>
      <P>It names the different people.  I wonder if any of the churches have, through any error, been left out of this list.  Why is there no mention of the Unitarian Church, the Free Presbyterian Church or the Church of Christ Scientist?  I believe there are two such churches in Dublin.  There is no mention of the Church of Latter Day Saints who now have a church in Rathgar.  I draw this to the Minister's attention in case through an oversight any of the churches have been omitted from this Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (1) (a) states:</P>
      <P>This section applies to a marriage&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) which was solemnised before the passing of this Act solely by a religious ceremony in the département of Hautes Pyrénées, France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does it mean, unless this section is passed, that children of such a Lourdes union&mdash;I do not like to use this word; it is only because of the legal aspect that I use it&mdash;would be illegitimate and that the widow of such a union would not be entitled to succeed to her husband's property on his death?  I know this is purely a legal matter.  I was rather amazed to find <Col N="839" /> that this Bill came under the Department of Health.  It looked to me to be more a legal Bill.  One would almost require a barrister or a solicitor sitting beside one for guidance in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to section 6 (1) where it states:</P>
    <P>... as the Minister for Health may by regulations appoint unless there shall be first obtained the consent of the father of such of the parties so under age ...</P>
    <P>Why is it that only the father's consent is required?  Why is it that the mother's consent as well is not required?</P>
    <P>Section 13 (a) states:</P>
    <P>By the insertion of</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Chief Rabbi of the Jewish Communities in Ireland:&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Constitution the word used is &ldquo;congregation&rdquo;.  I wonder why in this Bill it should be changed to the &ldquo;Jewish Communities&rdquo;?  Why is it not the Jewish congregation?</P>
    <P>These are just a few points I wish to raise on the Bill.  As I said, it would have been much wiser if the Minister introduced a new and up-to-date Marriages Bill to cover all marriages instead of grafting new law on to old Acts.  My party have no intention of holding up this Bill.  It is a good Bill, it is long overdue and should have been introduced long ago.  Perhaps the Minister might give me some guidance on the matters which I have raised, why there have been omissions and why this Bill was brought in as an amending Bill instead of a comprehensive Marriages Bill.  It would have been much better to have done this rather than to attempt to tidy up Acts of 1844, 1863 and 1870.  The Bill is not a controversial one and there is no reason why its passage should be delayed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the answer to Deputy Governey's question is to be found in the Minister's statement where he states that a comprehensive Bill would be a very detailed and lengthy piece of legislation.  Until now <Col N="840" /> nothing has been done in this matter since a Bill was introduced in 1965 and this Bill, while not incorporating everything we would wish for, is attempting to improve conditions that are long outdated and some of which are causing much embarrassment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Governey referred also to the position of persons who are married at Lourdes.  I question the Minister's figure of 33 as being the number of persons involved.  I do not know whether that figure was obtained from official statistics but I can say that many more people than that have been in correspondence with me telling me that they were affected by the position. These people had gone on pilgrimage to Lourdes and were married while there.</P>
      <P>I have in my possession a copy of correspondence between the then Department of External Affairs and the French Government.  In this the French Government pointed out that while these marriages were not carried out legally in France they could not be recognised by the State.  Therefore, it is wishful thinking to suggest that there might be a way in which the Irish courts would accept that since a church marriage had taken place at Lourdes, the marriage was legal.  I understand that there was one tragic case where legality was not proven and, consequently, a person was dispossessed.  I am glad that the Minister has decided to introduce the amending legislation at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Governey say that he was not aware of the situation because I would have thought everybody knew of it since I have been pestering the Minister for the past 12 months to bring the Bill before the House.  I am sure the Minister will forgive me for having raised this question on so many occasions both with him and with the Taoiseach.  However, now that the Bill has been introduced I hope it gets a speedy passage through the House. The Minister has referred to his having one amendment to the Bill.  I wonder if that amendment is ready. If it is I see no reason why the Bill should not be completed tonight.  The Minister will have the full co-operation <Col N="841" /> of this party in putting the Bill through and I would hope that he will have also the co-operation of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of an age limit, it seems ludicrous that at this stage when we are talking of raising the school leaving age to 16, we are only now declaring the minimum marriage age to be 16.  I consider that the Minister is correct in introducing this legislation and there is a safeguard to apply under exceptional circumstances. There is a proposal to reduce the voting age to 18 and I suppose that before very long that also will be reduced to 16.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of points that I should like to raise and perhaps when the Minister is replying he will enlighten me on them.  Under section 1 (8) there is being established what I would consider a rather dangerous procedure.  The subsection reads:</P>
    <P>Where a marriage solemnised according to the rites and ceremonies of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church would not be regarded as valid in law unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a permission under subsection (2) of this section in respect of one party has been granted, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a permission thereunder in respect of the male party and a permission thereunder in respect of the female party have been granted,</P>
    <P>the marriage shall not be registered save on production, to the person effecting the registration....</P>
    <P>It goes on to list certain documents.  I suggest that the subsection needs to be looked at again.  We know that in the US 65 per cent of what are referred to as teenage marriages go on the rocks subsequently.  At any rate, marriages that take place at a very early age seem more prone to break up than do others.  The Minister will appreciate the point I am making&mdash;that if because of a legal quibble a marriage is not recognised, although it has taken place, there might be some odd result.  There might be a situation, for instance, where a person, although married in a <Col N="842" /> church, might find in years to come that one of the partners could opt out on the technicality of not having been married legally.  According to our Constitution, we seem to be determined not to allow divorce but a technicality of the kind I have mentioned would provide a simple means of breaking up a marriage.  Therefore, the legislation should ensure that this cannot happen. Perhaps the Minister considers this proposed legislation to be adequate but, on the other hand, he may find it necessary to introduce another section or subsection to cover the point.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Governey when he says that to mention religions is dicey.  When the present Constitution was drafted in 1937 specific religions were mentioned which were in existence at that time.  This means that religions introduced to this country since then are not recognised legally. However, at least one of these religions is given a special mention here, that is, the Church of Christ Scientist.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred that the Minister would have been able to introduce a comprehensive Bill to up-date the entire marriage code but, under the circumstances, he is doing the best he can and the House should give a speedy passage to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a recommendation made a few years ago by the Committee on the Constitution.  I was a member of that committee. When discussing the marriage laws, we found that included in our Constitution were certain sections which we deemed would be more appropriate to the common law of the country.  A recommendation on those lines was made. The commission was rather peculiar in that the views expressed by each member were recorded but no recommendation as such was made although certain strongly held views were reported. When the final legislation to deal with the marriage laws is introduced, the views of that commission must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is very much more.  Residence clauses and so on are dealt with in a reasonable way.  Unfortunately we still have a situation where it is not unknown for people who are non-Catholics who have come, say, <Col N="843" /> from Britain or America to this country and who go through the form of becoming Catholics to be married even if they are married before they come here.  For some reason there is a tendency not to check on their background the same as with a Catholic who must have what is known in the country as his marriage lines.  This is a loophole which is pretty difficult to stop.  Perhaps the church would be better at doing this than the law would, and I suppose there we have to leave it and see how it will eventually work out.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that since the Bill was published he has asked the various religious leaders to give their views.  I would be interested if he could let us have some of the views, particularly of those who seem to object to certain of the changes which are made.  I understand there is a rumour in the city that one gentleman is talking about taking a High Court action to prove that a certain section of the Bill is not constitutional.  I would like the Minister to clear these issues when he is replying, because this is the sort of thing that causes annoyance.  It was reported that the main reason why the Bill did not come back into the House since 1965 until now was the opposition of some church leaders to the 1965 Bill. Some people may have got the view that a change in legislation is not necessary, but I think it can be proved very easily that the change suggested in the Bill is very necessary.</P>
    <P>Let me finish by referring again to the Lourdes section.  If this Bill is introduced for no other reason than to straighten out that matter, it is well worth spending the time of the House on it.  It is all right for people who have been married for a number of years and who have their own children grown up and who could regulate their own wedding easily enough by going to a registry office and having the ceremony carried out, but they could not, without this Bill, include their own children.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this practice ceased at a certain time&mdash;1960, I think he said.  I would not be quite happy that this is the end of it and it is a pity that when the Bill was being drafted <Col N="844" /> some effort was not made to try to ensure that not alone weddings which took place in the past in Lourdes be validated but weddings which may take place in the future, because many young people are still inclined to go to Lourdes on a pilgrimage and get married out there for a number of reasons. I think it would be a simple matter to do it, but I do not want to hold up the Bill by suggesting that the Minister should start framing an amendment to have that included now.</P>

      <P>The Minister and other Deputies have made the point that it would be desirable to have a comprehensive marriage law framed. However, the Minister says that the difficulties and complexities involved would mean an interminable delay and therefore he has settled on what he admits himself are minor changes. I do not know whether the difficulty to which Deputy Tully refers in relation to Lourdes marriages applies to Rome marriages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, Deputy Tully has been very prominent in highlighting this problem of the legal marital status of such couples in this country, the difficulty being that because a civil ceremony had not been gone through in Lourdes by such couples, then according to our law, their standing could be the subject of legal argument in relation to property disposal and so on.  That being so, I do not know how one can provide statutorily for future contingencies, how one can provide for avoiding the problem in the future, whatever about legalising or putting above argument such marriages in the past.  It is a fact that most of the marriages which take place in Lourdes are Roman Catholic marriages and obviously there is a responsibility on the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical authorities to inform these couples who are getting married in Lourdes of these difficulties.  That would seem to be the proper course to adopt, seeing that there does not seem to be any solution in our statute law in respect of future occurrences of the same kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> On the main provision, in relation to the minimum marriage age, speakers have mentioned the arguments against listing particular churches.  In the referendum debate last week we discussed the difficulties in relation to naming particular religious sects at any particular time.  There have been certain revelations which in 1972 have expanded into religious sects which were not there in 1937, and possibly the same multiplying effect will continue down through the years.  Therefore, there are strong arguments against listing religions in the statute form.  I wonder if there is not also a place for parents as well as for ecclesiastical authorities in this matter of permission for young marriages.</P>
    <P>Although I do not have figures to back it up, I would say that in general 16 is too low an age for marriage.  I think the minimum age, subject to exceptions which this Bill permits, should be 18.  Sixteen is too young an age to contract a marriage for which, in our law, there is no provision for dissolution.</P>
    <P>We must be the only country in Europe with such a low minimum age for marriage.  I have not had an opportunity of comparing the ages set in other countries but I hazard a guess that we must be amongst the lowest, if we are not actually the lowest, permitting marriage at such a very young age and, even when we pass this Bill, we will still be amongst the lowest.  The minimum age for marriage should be 18 because 16 is far too young particularly in the case of a contract which is regarded as indissoluble.  There are certain circumstances in which marriage, after the passing of this Bill, will be permitted at an even lower age than 16.  We have the opportunity now, and we should take it, of providing that the minimum age for marriage should be 18 and not 16.</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted he would prefer a comprehensive Marriages Bill. I, too, would prefer a comprehensive measure.  There is grave need for a comprehensive family charter.  In present circumstances men and women are not regarded as equal before the law and this is a contentious aspect that has yet to be tackled.  It must be <Col N="846" /> tackled.  It should no longer be postponed. There should be a comprehensive family charter to protect the interests of the child, the wife and the husband.  As things stand, authority still rests with the husband and the interests of the wife and children are really not sufficiently well recognised. This is a matter that should be considered. There is the entirely unsatisfactory law relating to ownership of the matrimonial home and its contents.</P>
    <P>The Minister says, legitimately, that if we were to go into the matter in this fundamental way we would fail to get agreement and we might possibly fail to get legislation passed.  The Minister infers that there might be difficulties with interests outside this House and the process of legislating would be so long drawn out it would be difficult to see any end to it.  Despite the Minister's argument it is vitally inportant that we should revise the whole code of marriage law as it exists.  We must not postpone this.  I should like the Minister to tell us, accepting the limitation that we cannot go into the matter at this stage in a comprehensive way, why, when we had the opportunity of raising the minimum lagal age, we did not make it 18 instead of 16.  I believe 18 would be more in accord with the minimum age in other European countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the United Nations decision on a minimum age of 15.  That declaration covers, of course, all sorts of experience in countries all over the world.  In European experience I would say 18 would be more in accord with the generally accepted level in European countries.  Marriage here is an indissoluble contract lasting for life.  People of 16 could not possibly appreciate the gravity of the contract. We are wrong to incorporate in legislation a minimum age of 16.  Even with the proviso that this would not occur very often and there would be consultation, the age is still too low.  This is too great a responsibility to put on young people who could not possibly appreciate just what it is they are entering into.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am not nearly as clear about this matter <Col N="847" /> as other speakers, save in one respect; I am as clear as any who have spoken so far that this should have been a comprehensive measure.  I cannot understand why this kind of legislation is so favoured by the draftsmen and by the Government.  I know that certain people love to make law complicated. I can understand why certain administrators like to make law complicated but this is not a complicated matter and this is a matter in which administrators <i>per se</i> have no great power at all because it is others who will administer it.  Candidly, this kind of thing worries me.</P>
      <P>That is my most important reflection on the Bill.  There is another important point.  This is a matter about which I have protested here frequently.  In the first subsection of the first section we fix a minimum age of 16 and in the second subsection we say that people under 16 may be deemed to be 16.  This is deeming an elephant to be a cow, though the expression &ldquo;cow elephant&rdquo; is used. This kind of thing happens too frequently in our legislation: something which is not so is deemed to be so.  We all of us remember an occasion some years ago when a marriage was solemnised down in Wexford between a boy of 15 and a girl of 14.  It created a great deal of interest and received a great deal of publicity.  I think people had a genuine human interest in the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says the provisions of this Bill are liberalising.  They are and they are not.  Fixing a minimum age of 16 can scarcely be called a liberalising provision.  The word &ldquo;liberalising&rdquo; has been loosely interpreted ever since the last war, particularly in relation to trade, but I scarcely think this measure can be described as a liberalising measure.  It is regrettable that after a period of seven years&mdash; 1965 to 1972&mdash;we could not have a comprehensive Bill.  The Acts referred to here are not very numerous. Neither are they very long.  Why do we refuse so resolutely to follow the example of the United States of America?  There every new Act of Congress is self-contained.  I can <Col N="848" /> understand that the cost would be tremendous if each Finance Act were to be completely self-contained.  I suppose that is why the Revenue Commissioners go in for all this reference back.  The paper might be expensive, and the printing might be expensive, but a saving would be effected on the cost imposed on people now compelled to employ chartered accountants, counsel and so on.  In particular cases, it would save a great deal of confusion&mdash;I am talking at the moment of a comparison between this and the Finance Act each year&mdash;if instead of these constructive efforts, our draftsmen were to go in for straight enactments.</P>
    <P>I agree particularly with what Deputy Tully said about people who come here from abroad and who can behave as though they were not married at all.  This is a most unfortunate situation and it is the kind of thing that should be cleaned up.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked of the aim of this Bill being to make desirable and rather urgent changes of a limited character.  Nothing can be rather urgent which, in fact, has lasted for seven years without, apparently, giving rise to any great fuss at all since the last Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters in the Minister's statement which I do not quite understand.  For instance, the sentence: &ldquo;It appears that the Marriage Acts are now being revised but that it may be necessary to continue with the differentiation between the different kinds of marriage ceremonies&rdquo; is one the meaning of which I do not understand.  Then there is the next sentence: &ldquo;The abolition of the conditions relating to the marriage of non-Catholics is not regarded as an advisable step as some of the smaller denominations are not sufficiently organised to ensure that parties who present themselves for marriage are, in fact, free to marry.&rdquo;  That matter could be dealt with in a relatively simple way by the inclusion of a simple section to provide for such contingency.  The Minister did mention that he would have amendments to propose regarding certain matters <Col N="849" /> and I have no objection to those amendments being put in this evening if the Minister has them ready.</P>
    <P>In his brief the Minister made quite a song and dance about the difference between a person appealing to the president of the High Court and a person who will now be able to appeal to the High Court.  This is simply the difference between one being able to appeal to one man and being able to appeal to a number of men.  It may well be that the president of the High Court is not as liberal as others, and I do not know if it is intended in that way at all, but obviously it is to give the people concerned a choice.  They can go, where their legal advisers can so arrange, to any member of the High Court.  That is the interpretation I put on it.</P>
    <P>There is one section in particular which I consider to be drafted in a most extraordinary way.  It is section 16 which appears to me to be remarkably long-winded in dealing with a comparatively simple matter, a change in the hours during which marriages may be solemnised in a registrar's office.  The present law sets out &ldquo;between the hours of eight in the morning and three in the afternoon&rdquo; and these are now being changed to eight and five, but a whole page is taken up with providing consequential amendments.  The fact is that under the Interpretation Act of 1937, once the words are taken out of the Marriages (Ireland) Act, section 4, &ldquo;between eight in the morning and three in the afternoon&rdquo; that deals with the matter completely.  The simplest thing to do would be to take out &ldquo;between the same hours&rdquo; and then it obviously becomes &ldquo;between eight in the morning and five in the afternoon&rdquo;. That is an extreme example but this is pursued right through all the Acts.  I must admit that I have never seen a piece of drafting like this before and I cannot see the need for it.</P>
    <P>I notice another interesting point, that whereas the Acts subsequent to the Act of 1944 are all called the Marriages (Amendment) Act, the Act of 1918 was called the Marriages (Ireland) Act 1918, without the word &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo;.  The Minister has followed this in calling this the Marriages <Col N="850" /> Bill, 1972.  In view of the limited way in which he is doing it, it would be much better to call it the Marriages (Amendment) Bill, 1972.  Could I ask the Minister this very serious question: why does he call it the Marriages Bill, 1972, instead of the Marriages (Amendment) Bill, 1972?  If it were a comprehensive Bill, there would be every reason for calling it the Marriages Bill, 1972, but since it is merely making limited amendments, I cannot see why he calls it the Marriages Bill, 1972.  It deals only in a very limited way with the whole subject and it would be more appropriate to have called it the Marriages (Amendment) Bill, 1972.  I hope I have made these rather involved remarks reasonably clear.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for their kindly reception of the Bill. Deputy Governey asked about section 1 (4) which sets out the persons authorised to issue special licences.  All the persons who are authorised to issue special licences, plus the Chief Rabbi, are included in the list.  There is none excluded.</P>
      <P>Deputy Governey and Deputy Tully asked about the legitimacy of children born of Lourdes marriages.  There is a doubt about the validity of Lourdes marriages and by reason of this section any such doubt will be removed.  With regard to section 6 in which the father's consent only is indicated, there will be an amendment which will provide for both parents' consent.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a comprehensive Bill and this has been suggested by all Deputies, but I am afraid it would take a very long time to prepare.  One of the reasons, I suppose, is that we are to some extent captives of our marriage laws and customs in the same way as we are captives of our history and such a Bill would take a very considerable time to prepare but now that I know the Dáil wishes a comprehensive Bill, to be prepared, we will look into this and see what we can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary asked whether a question arises about Rome marriages and the answer is that the position in Italy is the same as in Ireland&mdash;<Col N="851" /> religious marriages are legally recognised there.  In relation to Lourdes marriages, I understand that the Catholic Church authority has now instructed its flock not to contract marriages in Lourdes in the way they did before.</P>
    <P>The very natural question was asked why we chose the age of 16 as the age at which marriage could be permitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that we got a general concensus for 16.  The position in Europe is as follows: as regards males a minimum of 16 years obtains in Britain, Italy, Portugal and Spain, in the case of Spain for Catholic marriages: a minimum of 18 years operates in Belgium, Finland, Sweden, France, West Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Turkey.  A minimum of 20 years obtains in Denmark and Norway.  As regards females a minimum of 12 years obtains in Spain for civil marriages only; a minimum of 14 years obtains in Italy, Portugal and Spain for Catholic marriages; a minimum of 15 years obtains in Belgium, France and Luxembourg; a minimum of 16 years operates in Britain and Northern Ireland, West Germany, the Netherlands.  A minimum of 17 years applies in Finland, and 18 years in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Turkey.  I suppose one could say that at the age of 16 we are at the lower end of the medium scale.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully questioned the wisdom of section 1 (8).  The answer is that the clergy should not marry a person under 16 without the consent as required in the Bill.  This subsection stops the registration of those Catholic marriages as subsection 9 <Col N="852" /> does for others, so there should be no doubts in regard to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, there is no danger but I shall have the Bill examined to see if there is. Deputy Tully also raised the question of the recognition of religious groups other than those mentioned in the Constitution.  There is no statutory barrier to such recognition and one amendment on Committee Stage provides for such a group, the Dublin Jewish Progressive Congregation, who will have marriages in their synagogue recognised for civil purposes. The objections by religious bodies after they had read the Bill were not of any great significance.  There was a general welcome for it and the only objections, in fact, were to the procedure for granting exemption from section 1.  I think the religious authorities now understand the position. There is no provision for future marriages in Lourdes as I have indicated. The authorities have stopped the practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> This is a very short Bill of eight sections which has as its objects the improvement of the system which operates for the registration of births, deaths and marriages.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the obligation to register a birth, marriage or death is a statutory one.  It falls on persons in different categories associated with the particular event, and I am sure that I do not have to emphasise the importance of achieving the greatest possible degree of compliance with the law.</P>
    <P>Any short-fall in registration diminishes the validity of our vital statistics which are essential to all forms of social planning.  The short-comings of the present system are especially serious in relation to registration of deaths.  This applies particularly to deaths in rural areas of old people who are not property owners and not covered by life insurance.  It is not possible to cite precise figures in this connection, but from studies carried out in recent years I am satisfied that there are areas where under-registration of deaths may be of the order of 7 to 8 per cent.  Where a failure to register a death comes under the notice of a registrar, or of the Office of an tArd-Chláraitheoir, the omission is, of course, corrected, but this can account for only a small number of cases.  It will, I am sure, be readily accepted that any organisational changes which will assist in achieving maximum registration should be effected, and this is one of the main objectives of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Failure to register births is quite rare, but registration is sometimes delayed and effected only when the need to produce a certificate arises. Marriage registration can be accepted as comprehensive.</P>
    <P>It is evident that whatever can be done to improve the registration system should be done as expeditiously as possible.  This, in fact, is the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the present Bill.  I would describe it as a Bill designed to improve the quality and efficiency of the registration system, to settle the basis for a new and improved service by facilitating members of the public in making registrations, to clear up points of difficulty and hardship <Col N="855" /> which have persistently hindered the making of registrations in certain cases, and, finally, to eliminate a lot of the formidable and cumbersome documentation which up to now was part of the system.  The present system, first established over 100 years ago, has served us well but it is not surprising that changes of a significant nature now require to be made.</P>
    <P>To turn to detailed provisions&mdash; section 2 of the Bill has the important effect of authorising the chief executive officer of health boards to make appointments to fill vacancies in posts of registrar.  The vacancies are those existing at the passing of the Act and those arising subsequently.  The appointments will be subject to any directions which may be issued from time to time by an tArd-Chláraitheoir. Existing permanent registrars are not affected.  They will continue to hold office on the same terms as hitherto.</P>
    <P>At present there are about 650 registration districts, generally coterminous with the dispensary districts in which the dispensary service functioned.  I am referring here to districts for the registration of births, deaths and Catholic marriages&mdash; there are registrars of marriages other than Catholic marriages and their districts are another matter.  People are now much more mobile than when the registration service was established; hospital systems have developed; the great majority of births now take place in hospitals and nursing homes rather than at home as was the case when the service started.  A much higher proportion of deaths occur in hospitals also.  All of this adds up to the conclusion that such a large number of registration districts is nowadays unnecessary.  In fact, the large number of registration districts is now a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>As things stand, over 400 districts, or 60 per cent of the total, each register less than 50 events in a year and account in total for less than 10 per cent of registrations.  Such a large number of districts with low work loads inevitably leads to a loss of administrative <Col N="856" /> efficiency.  This is so simply because registrars have not a sufficient variety or volume of registrations to be experienced in the unusual cases that can arise.  The net effect is that the central registration office in Dublin, Oifig an Árd Chláraitheora, or, as it is more generally known, the General Registrar Office, is regularly called upon to provide guidance and assistance in cases which would be well within the competence of a local registrar handling a reasonably wide span of work.  And, of course, this leads to delays and inconvenience for members of the public.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the needs of the service could be better met by reducing&mdash;by, perhaps, one-half&mdash;the number of registration districts now operating and I hope to achieve this by amalgamating smaller districts as opportunity offers and vacancies arise. In this connection I will ensure that the convenience of the public will at all times be borne in mind.  If, say, the low density of population on certain western seaboard areas warrants retaining certain existing small sized districts, then they will be retained in those areas.</P>
    <P>We cannot proceed with the amalgamation of districts without removing a lien which dispensary doctors have had up to now on registration posts.  This is the purpose of section 2 (1) (b). Section 2 (1) (a), as I have said, gives the function of appointment of registration staff in future to the chief executive officer of health boards.  Under the 1970 Health Act, health boards have, of course, taken over the responsibility of supervising the registration service and also act as superintendent registrars at regional level in many cases.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, under the Bill, to bring within the administrative ambit of the health boards the registration service at local level in respect of all events which are routinely notified to the Registrar of Births and Deaths. Existing registrars hold their appointments from an tÁrd Chláraitheoir and it would not be feasible, nor desirable, to alter that arrangement.  It would also be incongruous to apply a different basis of tenure of office to registrars <Col N="857" /> who will be appointed from time to time to vacancies.  Accordingly, it is proposed to continue the system for existing registrars and to apply it to new appointees until such time as the health boards are, in fact, the registrars for the entire country.  This is the reason then for section 2 (2).</P>
    <P>I might also mention that I see the amalgamation process as leading to the establishment in the larger areas of population of general registration offices open throughout normal working hours.  These are a feature of registration services in other countries and are much more effective in populated areas than the service now provided on the basis of one or two hours attendance on mornings of the week in a number of scattered locations.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions are of varying degrees of importance.  Section 3 seeks to remedy distressing personal difficulties which arise occasionally, for example, where the facts of a birth or a death can clearly be established but a statutory informant is not available or is seriously ill and unable to attend and sign the register.  At present such events cannot be registered. The provision in the Bill will remedy this problem, while, of course, maintaining the requirement that an tArd-Chláraitheoir must be satisfied as to the <i>bona fides</i> of each case.</P>
    <P>In section 4 I seek to remedy other difficulties about registration of certain births or deaths occurring outside the State where the person born was the child of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State or the person dead was an Irish citizen domiciled in the State.  Difficulties arise where registration records of foreign countries are either non-existent or have been destroyed, for example, in wartime or by fire or accident.</P>
    <P>Another urgent provision is to permit of a change from the present cumbersome statutory requirements in which forms were prescribed, their content specified, their layout settled, their incorporation in ledgers required and so on.  All of these requirements are now outmoded.  Modernisation of documentation and procedures which <Col N="858" /> have subsisted for a century is essential if advantage is to be taken of modern recording techniques and the use of automatic data processing, microfilming and other modern office procedures.  Regulations under section 5 will enable these changes to be made and also changes in the present arrangements for informants to register events so as to facilitate certain new procedures, e.g. undertakers may be required to notify registrars before a burial.  This should help to reduce the number of unregistered deaths which I have already spoken about. Any such regulations must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 6 applies the appropriate provisions of the Registration Acts to registrations authorised by an tArd-Chláraitheoir. The provision is necessary because, under the existing legislation, certified copies of registered births and deaths are acceptable as &ldquo;proof of the event without further evidence&rdquo; only if made under the signature of an informant or on the basis of notification from a coroner.  Section 6 will place registration made under sections 3 and 4 of the Bill on the same standing as the normal registration of a birth or death.</P>
    <P>On section 7, the position is that section 2 (5) of the Vital Statistics and Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1952 prevents any person engaged in the collection, compilation, abstraction or publication of vital statistics from disclosing information relating to any identifiable person unless for the purposes of a prosecution under the Act.  This has restricted the work of medical and social research workers and has made for difficulties for medical officers in their efforts to control and eliminate outbreaks of infectious diseases.  I have been pressed by medical and professional bodies to modify the restriction in the interests of the health of the community and to aid research work.  I am satisfied that the present limitations could well operate against the advancement of medical knowledge and the effectiveness of existing services, and I am, accordingly, proposing to authorise the disclosure of information in this type of case subject to conditions which I <Col N="859" /> lay down.  The House may be assured that the terms of the consent which I shall give will be very carefully considered, indeed, and that I shall be at pains to preserve the confidentiality of all information.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the health services and the adoption of a choice of doctor scheme replacing the dispensary doctor system operates to provide an impetus to adopt a more effective registration organisation by underlining the need for change and providing an opportunity for change.  I hope the House will assist me to take the opportunity by endorsing this Bill.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Minister in introducing this Bill is trying to bring the matter of registration into line with the Health Acts, involving the abolition of the dispensary system. In rural areas the dispensary doctor was the registrar of births and deaths and he was entitled to appoint somebody to act.  I take from the Minister's statement an assurance that the persons who held these offices will continue to do so.  Am I right in that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>When such posts become vacant I gather from what the Minister said that he intends cutting down on the numbers and that the areas will be larger.  I would fear that if we make the areas larger a certain amount of inconvenience may be caused to people in rural areas because of the distance they might have to travel to register births or deaths.  I know that babies are born in hospitals and deaths take place in hospitals and they are registered straight away, but the difficulty I referred to may arise in country areas.  I should like the Minister to keep this in mind.  He should not cover too wide an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like an assurance, if it can be given, that the cost will not be prohibitive.  The registrars do not get very much at the moment and, if the Minister intends to hand over this matter to the regional health boards, we may find ourselves again with the problem of much higher expense.  It <Col N="860" /> may be completely overloaded at the top level.</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised to learn from what the Minister said that the number of unregistered deaths may be of the order of 7 to 8 per cent.  That strikes me as an alarming figure.  I had no idea that it was so high but I am sure the Minister has proof of it.  I did not think there could be anything like that percentage of unregistered deaths.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this Bill has been introduced because it is modernising the system of registration.  Those of us who are engaged in social work of any kind know the difficulties that arise from time to time when matters affecting the registration of births, deaths or marriages come to be checked.  If the system which it is now proposed to introduce improves the situation, we should all welcome it.</P>
      <P>I quite agree that the number of unregistered deaths can be 7 or 8 per cent, or even higher.  It is not generally known that when people die, particularly old people living alone, somebody should register the death.  Unless the doctor does it, it can be overlooked.  Recently I knew of somebody who died in hospital and was registered as a widower.  He was a married man and his widow was still living.  When the registrar registered his death and recorded him as being a widower all sorts of complications arose.  The matter had to be referred to the Custom House before the death was properly registered and the death certificate could be issued properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which has been mentioned briefly&mdash;and I think the Minister got around it&mdash;is the question of somebody who dies violently and an inquest has to be held.  I am sure it is well known that some coroners seem to think it is all right if they <Col N="861" /> adjourn an inquest indefinitely until they can have a gala evening with four, five or six inquests at which they preside.  In the meantime the relatives of the deceased are waiting for a death certificate which will not be issued until the coroner has recorded some verdict.</P>
    <P>I have known cases where widows were unable to get a widow's pension, or insurance which they had been paying over the years, or to draw gratuities which were due from local authorities, because of the fact that the inquest verdict was not given for months.  Some of these people could not pay their way.  It is ridiculous that this situation should have been allowed to continue.  I assume from what the Minister said that this is now being got around because, if the registration is done in a different way, it will not be necessary to wait for the coroner's inquest before the death certificate can be issued.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that position when he is replying because I believe the matter is really important.</P>
    <P>It is amazing how many people have never been registered as having been born.  Usually this is not discovered until they apply for a pension of one kind or another, usually the old age pension.  It is then discovered that, so far as the State is concerned, those people do not exist.  I have come across numerous cases of that sort which I have had to investigate. While it is possible on occasion, so far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned, to get such evidence as school attendance or something like that to prove the date of birth sometimes that is not possible.</P>
    <P>I know of the case of a man who was born in an itinerant camp.  Apparently nobody bothered to register the birth.  When he reached 70 years of age, although he had left the itinerant life and had worked all his life, and had been insured by the Department of Social Welfare, the Department refused to accept statements from his employer that he was 70 years of age.  They would not allow him to draw benefit.  Eventually he ended up in an old folks home.  He <Col N="862" /> told me he started life depending on charity; he worked all his life and he did not think he would end his life depending on charity.  This sort of thing will be prevented by the new system of registration suggested in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that, if possible, an effort should be made through advertisements or otherwise to find out for people who are not registered whether they should take steps to become registered even at this late stage and have some evidence given of their date of birth so that complications will not be caused for them later on in life.</P>
    <P>It may not be generally known that if somebody was alive when a particular census was taken, and was registered for census purposes, it is possible to get a copy of some of the census papers to produce evidence of age.  It should not be necessary to do this but it is possible to do it.</P>
    <P>I must say that during the time the British were here the RIC went to far more trouble to try to find out the names, ages and relationships of itinerants scattered throughout the country than do our present police force.  Perhaps it is regarded as <i>infra dig</i> to visit a tinkers' camp to inquire for such particulars.  As I have said, it was done very thoroughly by the British.  Again and again I have had to try to help those people by getting their births registered.</P>
    <P>The idea of passing these matters over to the health boards may be a good one but it seems to me that these boards are becoming repositories for the affairs of the various sections in the community about whom nobody else wants to do anything. The administration of this will cost money, even if it is a small amount, and the last speaker expressed the hope that the costs will not be increased with the change over.  Since the introduction of the health boards, the cost of various items appears to have been raised slightly and this is still another area where it could happen.</P>
    <P>I agree it should be mandatory on all to have births, marriages and <Col N="863" /> deaths registered but should the Minister not endeavour as far as possible, before handing this service over to another body, to have all existing births, marriages and deaths registered?</P>
    <P>I am aware that some people have been appointed to act as registrars and it is important that we should decide now that these offices should be opened during normal hours.  I am acquainted with people who have travelled long distances to try to find necessary documents only to be told when they arrived that the offices were open for only a couple of hours.</P>
    <P>The idea behind this Bill is an excellent one but we should not let this opportunity pass without paying a tribute to people who have been registrars for a long time.  They seemed to take a particular interest in seeing that the public got a good service.  I know a very old lady who if she got a request either by a visit to her or by a letter replied by return of post.  It would be unfair of us if we did not pay a tribute to the people who gave such an excellent service for a small remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the friendly way it has accepted the Bill.  I shall deal first with a point made by Deputy Tully, the adjournment of inquests. This is outside the scope of the Bill but I will bring the matter before the Minister for Justice.  I know that provision exists whereby once the inquest has been opened and adjourned the coroner can refer the necessary registration date to the registrar.  If the system did not work properly, it was the fault of the coroner.  However, the Minister for Justice can refer the registration date to the registrar.</P>
      <P>In regard to unregistered births and the resultant problems in relation to insurance and so forth, section 3 of the Bill deals with just such problems.  If a person brings forward reasonable evidence in regard to births he can be registered and benefits depending on age would follow automatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Governey referred to the position of existing holders of the office <Col N="864" /> of registrar and said that existing permanent registrars are not affected.  I stated in my opening speech that they will continue to hold office on the same terms as heretofore.  He referred to the suggestion that many of them have too big an area to cover.  Under the Bill, areas will be arranged so that maximum benefit can be given to persons concerned and so that the work will be effectively and efficiently carried out, so that unusual cases will be dealt with and that account will be taken of remote rural areas where the population would be extremely scattered and where people would have to travel extreme distances.  The situation of registrars will depend on the needs of the areas.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill about the cost of registration but under it the Registrar General will still retain his supervisory and control functions.  It is not proposed to interfere with supervision and control, and though the health boards will manage the registration system, they will do so with the advice, consent and authorisation of the Registrar General.  That covers the point of any health board attempting to engage in unnecessary expense in this sphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are:</P>
      <P>(i) to extend to the ESB general staff an improvement in superannuation benefits already enjoyed by the board's manual staff.</P>
      <P>(ii) to eliminate any doubt which might arise as to the powers of the ESB to accord equal rank to all their borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before proceeding to the individual sections of the Bill, I should like to mention that the proposed amendments in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill are identical to those contained in sections 3 and 4 of the Electricity (Supply) <Col N="865" /> (Amendment) Act, 1970, except that the two sections in the 1970 Act are in respect of manual employees while the two sections in the present Bill concern the general employees.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for the addition of a further subsection (subsection 9) to section 7 of the 1942 Act. The general employees superannuation scheme came into operation on 1st April, 1943.  Where a general employee entered the board's service after 1st April, 1943 his service up to the date he was admitted to the scheme was not reckonable for superannuation purposes. Section 2 of the Bill defines this service as &ldquo;previous service&rdquo; and enables the board to reckon half of it for superannuation purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill enables the board to pay a supplementary allowance equal to the full pension value of the other half of a general employees previous service provided that the employees involved make a nominal contribution towards the cost of such an allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill refers to the borrowing powers of the ESB.  Up to the time of the passing of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1954 the board's capital requirements were borrowed from the Central Fund.  All such borrowings under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927 and subsequent Acts carried with them either specific or floating charges on ESB property.  Under section 4 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1954 the board were empowered to make their own arrangements for getting, direct from the public or otherwise, the capital required to finance their development and since then no money has been borrowed by the board from the Central Fund. Section 4, subsection (3) of the 1954 Act provided that the terms upon which capital is borrowed by the ESB may include provisions charging the moneys borrowed on the property of the board and also permitted the inclusion of provisions under which any charge in respect of money borrowed under the 1954 Act may rank before or equal with charges on the board's assets in respect of borrowings from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> In fact, however, the ESB did not give any charges on their property in respect of borrowings under the 1954 Act and they do not envisage the giving of such charges in respect of future borrowings.  As a consequence, the board are now advised that technically these borrowings under the 1954 Act cannot be ranked equally with the loans from the Central Fund in respect of which, as I have stated, a specific or floating charge on the board's assets was created under the Electricity Supply Acts.  It was, however, the intention of the board that moneys borrowed under the 1954 Act would rank equally with loans from the Central Fund and the purpose of section 4 is to establish this position in law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to bring our legislation up-to-date and thus it is not regarded as contentious.  So far as this party are concerned, we will assist the Minister in every way to put this Bill through the House promptly.</P>
      <P>The provisions regarding superannuation bring this matter up-to-date and extend to general staff improvements that were previously enjoyed by other grades.  I am sure that this will be welcomed by the House.  It is obvious that the ESB must continue to borrow.  Capital expenditure on electricity supply will continue for many decades to come and we must realise that it will be necessary for the board to borrow the necessary funds.  However, if any anomaly exists it is proper that we should get rid of it and, from that point of view, we do not object to this Bill.  It does not seem there will be any great change in the manner in which funds will be available in the future to the ESB.  We regard this Bill as necessary and we welcome it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As the previous speaker has pointed out, there is nothing contentious about this Bill.  It merely regulates matters and corrects omissions in the 1970 Act in respect of superannuation for general workers. Section 2 of the Bill provides for the addition of a further subsection to section 7 of the 1942 Act.  It might be asked why this was not done in 1970 <Col N="867" /> since manual workers and general employees are specifically mentioned in the 1942 Act.  The fact that this omission is being corrected is welcomed and now both grades are covered by the Superannuation Acts.  Although a few individuals may have suffered because this was not done in 1970, nevertheless the correction was made quickly when the matter was brought to the notice of the ESB.  For that reason we welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>The other main provision of the Bill is to regularise borrowing in accordance with the 1954 Act.  It is stated that the ESB did not give any charges on their property in respect of borrowings under the 1954 Act.  It is proper that the Bill be put through the House and that the position with regard to borrowings be amended in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In looking at this year's report and accounts of the ESB, one reads that capital expenditure in the year was financed by internal resources arising mainly from provisions for depreciation in capital contributions.  I wonder if any of the borrowing covered by the 1954 Act is included in that category? Under the heading &ldquo;capital borrowing&rdquo; one can see that most of the money has been raised either from public stocks on the home market or from abroad.  I wonder if any charges are still made under the 1954 Act which are included in the first category of borrowing?</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister has introduced the Bill to regularise the position, the Labour Party will give it full support.  It is most desirable that the provisions of the superannuation scheme and the borrowings of the board be on a proper footing.  We welcome in particular the changes made for general workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill refers specifically to the ESB Acts of 1927 and 1971 and, therefore, I am entitled to speak about the ESB on the Bill and to speak about the manner in which the board functions.  If the Government insist on spending enormous amounts of money&mdash;thus creating inflation&mdash; and, at the same time, clamp down on the very best of the semi-State companies, it is obvious that there will be serious difficulties created.  There is no point in the Government clamping down on this particular body.  They have always paid their way.  They have always paid their way in full to the Government because the ESB have always paid interest on moneys borrowed from the Government.  The ESB are the only semi-State body that have always paid their way.  I realise it would be popular for me to say nothing can increase in price and that, above all other things, the ESB, who are strong financially, should be compelled to have a deficit in their accounts.  That is bad financing. Strangely enough, this Bill has been brought in to rectify an error which was made by the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Lenihan, and myself when the 1970 Act was going through the House.  I must plead guilty. I thought that in the amendments I proposed, and which the Minister accepted, I was putting the manual workers on the same basis as the general employees.  It now appears that we put them above that level.  I am delighted we did so.  It was a great day for the country when manual workers were treated better than the officer classes.  I have no objection to this error being rectified and the officer class being given equal treatment now.  The leader of the Labour Party thanked the Minister for accepting the amendments.  It had not been intended to treat the manual workers in the ESB better than the engineers, accountants and clerical staff.  The amendments were intended to rectify what seems to me to be an anomaly under the pensions scheme.  It now appears that we overdid it.  I have no <Col N="869" /> objection to the matter being rectified in this manner now.  It is right and proper that this should be done.  The Minister for Transport and Power and myself put the manual workers above the ordinary workers.  This was a great sign for the better.  It improved the social confidence of the community.</P>
      <P>The other part of this Bill is connected with a technical financial matter. It is a legal rectification and of no real significance.  The ESB borrow a great deal of their moneys abroad. The people whom they borrow from might be pleased to see this rectification. The explanatory memorandum sets out the conditions under which this position has come about.  The board have raised their requirements of money from finance houses at home and abroad.  They have raised money in Switzerland and Germany. The bankers have been in a better position to borrow than the Government. I am not suggesting that that is any reflection on the Government, but it is a reflection on the method of thinking which is prevalent among bankers.  They like to have something concrete.  They feel then they are helping to build something like Turlough Hill power station, which is one of the most modern stations in the world.  They are pleased, therefore, when they see provisions such as are contained in this Bill being brought into force.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh has given me the statement of repayable capital and redemption as at 31st March, 1972. The Minister for Finance, under the Electricity (Supply) Acts and the Shannon Fisheries Act, 1935, advanced £68,450,236.  Stocks were issued as follows:</P>

    <P>I would like to know from the Minister what is the meaning of that last item. It is probably some form of international currency of which I have never heard.  Deputy Kavanagh suggests that it may be some sort of EEC money.  It certainly is not &ldquo;Euratoms&rdquo; or other things which have been suggested.  The total of that is £200,725,347, of which a large amount in recent years was obtained abroad.  Apparently the ESB can borrow abroad more effectively than the Government can.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> There are corresponding items on the other side of the balance sheet.  Out of the £200,725,347 loans and stocks fully redeemed account for £756,021.  This is why the Government are able to clamp down on the ESB in regard to increases to meet current costs.  The ESB has been very well managed down through the years.  No plea can be made that the cost of electricity is more in this country than it should be.  These figures suggest that the ESB is an extremely well-run organisation.  Not alone is it as well run technically as other semi-State bodies are but it has paid its way, unlike many of the other semi-State bodies, who are very fond of advertising themselves all over the place and who have never paid their way.</P>
    <P>I welcome this amendment of the law in both categories.  Since the necessity for this amendment was discovered I am all in favour of putting it in.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendment to the part of the 1970 Act dealing with superannuation, I am all in favour of that too.  I believe that all men are equal, absolutely.  I do not believe that some men are more equal than others. Therefore, if by accident the Minister for Transport and Power and myself made the manual workers somewhat better off, I can assure the present Minister that it was an accident.  It was not my intention.  My intention was simply to bring them up and make them even, to put them all on the same level.  It is an interesting change in society to find that the officer class in an organisation have to have their pensions improved so that they may be made equal to the ordinary worker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As all speakers have admitted this is a non-controversial Bill clearing up a few omissions or anomalies in the previous Bill and brings the general employees in line, for superannuation purposes, with the manual workers.  The terms are quite favourable and agreed. Nobody is at any loss.  It was not done before because the ESB has to await submissions from its employees before it can undertake to do a particular thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> The borrowings referred to are understandable.  This refers only to money borrowed directly from the Exchequer before the 1954 Act gave them authority to borrow elsewhere. It is really putting all borrowings on equal terms.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to say anything further about it at this stage. I would like to get all Stages.  It is completely non-controversial and is making good omissions one might say were overdue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that at this stage in our social development the House will welcome this piece of legislation and I am pleased to be able to present the Bill for consideration.  We have our social <Col N="873" /> welfare code and our redundancy payments legislation and I think it is a logical sequence that we should now give legislative backing to the concept of minimum periods of notice in respect of the termination of employment. As a first step in this area, the Bill, as I have indicated, provides for minimum standards and I would expect that these standards will be reviewed periodically in the light of experience.  In anticipation of this, provision is made in the Bill for variations in the periods of notice by way of affirmative order.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out to do two simple things.  The first is to prescribe a minimum period of notice which must be given by an employer who wishes to dispense with the services of an employee, or by an employee who wishes to leave his employment.  The second is to give any employee who is in doubt about any or the more important terms of his employment the right to have the terms confirmed in writing by his employer.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill an employer will be entitled to a statutory minimum of one week's notice but the entitlement of an employee will vary with his service. He will be entitled to one week's notice if in service for at least 13 weeks but less than two years, two weeks' notice if in service for two to five years, four weeks' notice if in service for five to ten years, six weeks' notice if in service for ten to 15 years, and eight weeks' notice if in service for over 15 years.  I should like to emphasise that this legislation should not impose any financial burden on employers.  Where an employer proposes to dispense with the services of a worker, he notifies him in one form or another.  It should not cost anything to bring this notification into conformity with the minimum period requirements laid down in the Bill, where such is not the case already. There is, of course, nothing to prevent an employer from giving better terms than those provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not interfere with the rights of employers and employees who may wish, by mutual agreement, to dispense with notice of any kind. Neither will it interfere with the rights <Col N="874" /> of one party to terminate employment without notice in the event of serious misconduct by the other party.</P>
    <P>In addition to the minimum notice question, I am providing in the Bill that a worker will have a statutory right to get from his employer, on request, written particulars of the main terms of his employment: in the absence of better terms the statutory minimum periods of notice would, of course, form part of the terms of his employment.  I see no good reason why a worker who wants this kind of documentary evidence should not have the right to get it on request.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that disputes under the Bill will be dealt with, in the first instance, by the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal but that there will be a right of appeal to the High Court on a question of law.  This provision has been prompted not only by the desire to provide readily accessible machinery for resolving such disputes, but also by the high degree of acceptability which the tribunal's decisions in other fields have won from employers and workers alike.  I hope that this piece of legislation will be conducive to good employer-employee relations, and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome this Bill.  The Minister says that it is a minimum notice and terms of employment Bill and that he intends to go much further. This is an area where legislation could be introduced in many respects which would clear up many small irritants and differences between employer and employee.  This Bill will look after one of these differences.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out to do two simple things.  The first is to prescribe a minimum period of notice which must be given by an employer who wishes to dispense with the services of an employee, or by an employee who wishes to leave his employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill says that the minimum period if an employee has been in the continuous service of an employer for at <Col N="875" /> least 13 weeks but less than two years, shall be one week.  I think that should be increased.  Nowadays a period of one week is not sufficient for any employee. If he is given notice on a Friday night he only has until the following Monday week to find employment. This is frequently very difficult.  It should be increased to a minimum of two weeks.  The other periods of notice necessary should be realigned upwards, that is, the period from two years to five years should be increased.  In 1968 the Fine Gael Party produced an industrial relations policy and stated:</P>
    <P>The hardship involved in changing employment must be mitigated in the interest of the personal welfare of those on whom it is forced, as well as in the interest of increasing mobility of labour for economic reasons.  To this end, and in supplementation of recently introduced redundancy compensation, Fine Gael will introduce legislation laying down the minimum period of notice which must be given to an employee on termination of employment.  It is suggested for permanent employees that this should never be less than four weeks.</P>
    <P>If the Minister finds it impossible at this stage to go as far as four weeks he should certainly keep in mind that we would in the future increase the minimum period of notice under which any employee could be dismissed from his employment to four weeks.</P>
    <P>We should make a start by saying that the minimum period under this Bill should be two weeks.  I cannot think of any other employment, outside the building trade, in which an employee is given less notice than the time for which he draws his payment, that is, if he is paid by the week he will get a week's notice and if he is paid by the month he will get a month's notice.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech today said that the second objective of the Bill is:</P>
    <P>To give any employee who is in doubt about any of the more important <Col N="876" /> terms of his employment the right to have the terms confirmed in writing by his employer.</P>
    <P>This is something which should be stated more positively than that.  An employee is obviously only interested in the terms of his employment if he is in dispute with his employer.  He should not be asked to go cap in hand to his employer to get the terms of notice when he is probably at that stage fighting with his employer.  A contract of employment should be given to every worker.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael industrial relations policy stated in relation to the contract of employment:</P>
    <P>Many disputes at work could certainly be avoided if conditions of employment were stated clearly in a contract.  We believe that there is a great deal to be gained from the issue of service contracts to all permanent employees.  These would be detailed documents containing the terms of employment and an agreed procedure for arbitration on shop floor disputes.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of document an employee would only want to read if he was in dispute with his employer.  We should avoid asking him at that stage to look for a document that might only aggravate the dispute.  The Minister has written into this Bill what the employee can look for under this Bill &mdash;the date of commencement of employment, the rate or method of calculation of his remuneration, the length of the intervals between the times at which remuneration is paid, whether weekly, monthly or any other period. It is also written into the Bill the terms of conditions relating to hours of work or overtime and also holidays and holiday pay.  These are standard. The Department of Labour could produce a form, to be issued to employees through their employers at the commencement of work, setting out in writing, as part of a contract between the employer and the employee&mdash; before work commences; not when a dispute arises&mdash;all the conditions of employment.  At that stage if the employee is looking for information of this kind it would aggravate the dispute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> The people who are excepted from this&mdash;the permanent Defence Force, the Civil Service, the Garda Síochána &mdash;should be included.  Possibly their terms are much better than the terms set out in this Bill.  At the same time the Government should not ask employers to do things which they are not willing to do themselves.  This Bill recognises the fact that better terms may be given by an employer than those set out in the Bill.  Even if the terms are better, the Government should be bound by this legislation to give to their employees minimum periods of notice and to write those into contracts between the employer, that is, the Government and the Civil Service or the Garda Síochána.  I shall be putting down an amendment to increase the minimum period of notice. Generally speaking, this is a start in a field which badly needs investigation in this country, that is, the industrial relations policy, the conditions existing between employers and employees. I welcome this as a start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that, as a start, this Bill is welcome, but it is not much of a Bill.  The very minimum notice should be one week for each year of service and I would regard that as inadequate.  Deputy Barry said that when men were employed by the hour they could be sacked on an hour's notice, if they were employed by the week they were entitled to a week's notice, and employed by the month they were entitled to a month's notice.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the question of employment in the Civil Service, the Army and the Garda Síochána.  It used to be said that it was difficult to get into the Civil Service and impossible to get out of it.  It is still impossible to get out of it but it is not difficult to get into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good of the Deputy to say that.  I hope I am more <Col N="878" /> useful where I am at present.  Some attempt has to be made to keep democracy going in this country.  I hope I am making a contribution to that end.  This Bill requires considerable amendment and I propose to put down a number of amendments for the Committee Stage.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that an employee is entitled to notice of:</P>
      <P>(a) one week if in service for less than two years</P>
      <P>(b) two weeks if in service for two years to five years</P>
      <P>(c) four weeks if in service for five years to ten years</P>
      <P>(d) six weeks if in service for ten years to fifteen years</P>
      <P>(e) eight weeks if in service for over fifteen years.</P>
      <P>Some people may be 20 or 25 years in the one employment.  We have a notorious example in the textile industry at the moment, where a company which is over 100 years in existence is now under the threat of extinction.  One particular company which has been mentioned, which a group of consultants reported on, is the Convoy Woollen Company in Donegal.  I have a personal interest in that firm because I was married in a piece of their cloth. It was a very excellent suit.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Minister that I was not married in a blanket.  At that time we were not as keen on being married in morning dress as are people nowadays, though perhaps we could have afforded it better than can some of the people today who hire it.  I often wonder whether it is not a bad idea to have too much show at a wedding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Too much display may not be the best omen for, as we were told this evening, the long distance future that marriage entails.  To get back to the Bill, I agree with Deputy Barry that service contracts in writing <Col N="879" /> would be a help.  Of course every civil servant is presented with a contract of service although if one is a permanent civil servant, consideration by the Government is required before one can be dismissed.  In fact it would take a long time for the case to reach the Government because one would meet many kindly intentioned people at the various stages.</P>
      <P>As a beginning this Bill is better than nothing, but not much better.  With a different title it might provide for a matter that should be attended to at this stage, that is, the question of a minimum holiday period for workers. At present the period is 12 days.</P>

      <P>I am familiar with the practice of the Government in trying to restrict the scope of a debate.  It is a well established practice in this House that on Second Reading speeches, Members may make suggestions as to what should be in the legislation.  I stand over my suggestion that in discussing conditions of employment, the question of holidays in relevant.  The present regulation in this regard has been in existence since 1961.  Now that a five-day week is in operation the 12 working-days holiday mean a little more than a fortnight but this is still very much less than what is the position on the Continent.  In France, for instance, workers get a month's holiday each year.  If one visits a major city in France during the month of August one will find it comparable to Goldsmith's &ldquo;Deserted Village&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is being modest enough when he says that as a first step in this area the Bill provides for minimum standards.  He goes on to say that he would expect that these standards would be reviewed periodically in the light of experience.  We <Col N="880" /> shall have to put down amendments to review the provisions of this Bill before it is enacted.  It is my intention to table amendments for Committee Stage.  In section 8, for example, there is the right to terminate a contract of employment without notice. This appears to be reasonable in that it cuts both ways but, of course, that is not the position.  It says that &ldquo;nothing in this Act shall affect the right of any employer or employee to terminate a contract of employment without notice because of misconduct by the other party&rdquo;.  May I ask the Minister in what private enterprise company can a worker ever have the right to penalise his employer if, for example, the employer has used vulgar language to him?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is saying is that large organisations are more impersonal and while this is true they are also more human in the sense that, for example, many a man in his fifties, who is working in a company and who &ldquo;has arrived&rdquo; as is said, puts in his time at his ease. But in a small concern this might not be tolerated because of the inability of the concern to bear any loss on this account.  Of course it is an advantage to be working for a big company because one is less likely to get into trouble for cheeking one's immediate boss than would a person in a small company.  I notice that the Minister agrees with me.  It is good that there is one item at least on which we think alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As drafted, section 8 is in favour of the employer rather than the worker. <Col N="881" /> I find it very difficult to understand how misconduct can be effected by an employer.  There is one obvious area but good manners prevent me from referring to it although something allied to it was discussed earlier this evening.  That is the only example that I can think of where an employer would be guilty of misconduct, whereas an employee can be guilty of misconduct if, for instance, he executes his work badly.  In such case his contract of employment can be terminated without notice.</P>
    <P>I shall check on this before Committee Stage but I take it that the employee must be entitled to the provision which allows for so many weeks notice or, to put it another way, to so many weeks compensation so that after spending a number of years in a firm a man will not be dismissed without compensation even if he is guilty of misconduct.  This is an old problem.  As far back as one could go in economic literature there is concern for the rights of workers.  We all know that the law has been liberalised considerably in this connection, that the time of the combination Acts is long passed but it is the case yet that on the whole the weight is in favour of the employer.  In the first place, he is usually better off than the employee and if he receives notice from the employee he will only be inconvenienced for a day or two, whereas an employee given similar notice might be out of work for six or 12 months.  Therefore, I do not think that is a fair or reasonable section. Those are the main points I want to make at this stage but when we take Committee Stage I shall have a number of amendments to put down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with my colleague in welcoming the Bill so far as it goes.  It is high time that notice to employees was given statutory effect.  Although we cannot say where the authority comes from, we are aware that people must be given notice but at long last we have it as a form of legislation to which we can refer in our dealings with employers.  A great deal of my own time as a trade union official is spent in dealing with problems as a <Col N="882" /> result of the hiring or firing of employees.</P>
      <P>My colleague has pointed to the great weakness of the Bill, that is, the provision in section 8.  I imagine the word &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; would lead to a great deal of legal interpretation were it to be stated as blandly and simply as it is in section 8.  Many hours of negotiations and tough talking has been spent prior to this Bill being passed to decide whether an employee was sacked because of misconduct or for some lesser reason.  I understand my colleague will be putting down an amendment designed to change the wording and meaning of section 8.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Donovan said, the matter of misconduct is usually interpreted in one direction only.  I cannot remember in the ten years in which I have acted in my town as branch secretary of the largest trade union in the country ever being summoned by an employer to say that he had committed some act of misconduct and that because of that an employee intended to leave or to take some action against him.  I always find the problem is in the other direction, and it is too simple to imply, as it does in the section, that that will always be to the advantage of the employee.  Indeed, it will not; it will be used by unscrupulous employers to get rid of employees on occasions.  On other occasions, of course, it will be used by employers because misconduct has occurred.  A great deal of money will be hanging on this term, and so it is imperative that the Minister should make it much clearer what he means by misconduct and why an employee must lose the benefit of many years' service, perhaps, if an employer has to let him go and claims, as a subterfuge, that that employee has been guilty of misconduct, perhaps, in the few weeks before he is eventually let go.  I would ask the Minister to look at the section, as amended, so that an employer is not able to use the section to get out of his responsibility of paying an employee or giving him sufficient notice so that he can get several further weeks' employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us in the trade union movement welcome many of the provisions in this Bill.  However, we have <Col N="883" /> reservations about that section and hope that on Committee Stage something will be done to make that provision a little more watertight in favour of the employee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with just one specific matter.  That is the result of the decision taken some time ago that instead of having an omnibus bill on industrial relations, the various matters would be dealt with by separate legislation. The Holidays Amendment Bill has been cleared in principle by the Government already and will, I hope, shortly be before the House.</P>
      <P>The criticisms of this legislation, which, to my mind, is a very important piece of legislation, are not many. I would ask those Deputies who have suggested they would put down amendments to give serious consideration to what they intend doing and as to why these sections contain the provisions they do contain.  It must be remembered, first of all, that this Bill is heavily weighted in favour of the worker.  He can have up to as much as eight weeks' notice, whereas there is only one week in it for the employer if the worker wants to go, and that week, I would argue, is as much in favour of the employee as it is of the employer in the case of misconduct.</P>
      <P>I do not think any of us are sufficiently naïve to pretend that there is no such thing as misconduct.  If an employer finds an employee with his hand in the till, he is entitled not to give him eight weeks' notice.  It is as simple as that.  The majority of employers are excellent and we cannot all the time be imputing motives to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was going to explain.  Did we not often hear of an employee walking out in a fit of temper when the employer said something to him that was unbecoming or insulting?  The week's notice is something that would be for <Col N="884" /> his own benefit in this case.  There are occasions when workers have reason to have disputes with their employers and very often employers are the people who are to blame.  As I said when Deputy O'Donovan was speaking, this can happen in small concerns where there is close personal contact with the proprietor or the manager. These people have to be looked after just as much as the people in the large concerns where they might not see the boss in 12 months.</P>
      <P>A good deal of thought has been put into the provisions in this Bill. If Deputies wish to seek to amend them it is their privilege to do so, but I would like to tell them that the provisions were not framed without a good deal of opinion being sought from both sides.</P>

Any legislation enacted here makes provision to safeguard employees but an employer must have the right to deal with cases in which there is misconduct.</P>

      <P>I say it is weighted in favour of the employee.  Deputy Collins and Deputy O'Donovan referred to one week being too short.  The one week is calculated to meet the case of the least permanent type of employee, I do not think we would have difficulty in visualising instances in which long notice would hardly be practicable.  The building industry is one.  A man might have to give notice to men tomorrow but he might not know today that he would have to do so.  There are many types of employment in which there are casual employees who move from one job to another and they could not possibly get long notice.  These do not find it difficult to get employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must have regard to the employer who hires and fires men frequently.  Casual employees are accustomed to moving from one job to another.  It is different in the case of a man who has been 15 years in the same employment.  He might not be able to step into another job very easily and so he needs long notice to help him to adapt or retrain. This is good sense.  This Bill is weighted in favour of the employee. There is no doubt about that.  We can discuss this in greater detail on Committee Stage.  I have discussed this matter with many people on both sides and they did not find anything wrong with it.</P>

      <P>I am looking here at the other countries which have made provision.  We would be on a par with Britain.  I am not saying this is something about which we should be happy.  In France a wage-earner with six months service is entitled to one month's notice.  A salaried worker, with two years service, is entitled to leave of two months plus an indemnity. In Belgium, it is 14, 28 or 56 days according to seniority; for clerical workers it is three months notice for every period of five years or part thereof.  White collar workers in Germany are entitled to six weeks notice.  This is increased to six months for service of five, eight, ten or 12 years after age 25.  Manual workers must be given two weeks notice, but this is increased to one, two and three months in respect of service after age 35.  In the Netherlands the notice is the length of time between two successive pay days up to a maximum of six weeks.  This can increase to 13 weeks. In Luxembourg the minimum notice is four weeks for up to five years' service and eight weeks for service from five to ten years and 12 weeks after ten years.  In Italy in the case of non-manual workers the minimum notice is 15 days increasing to four months depending on service, responsibility and so on.  No two countries are quite the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>You are aware, Sir, that Deputy Ryan and I tabled a motion which touches on the Bill we are now about to discuss.  Under the procedure groomed by Standing Orders the motion would clearly be discussed separately.  I thought, however, that on the Financial Resolution I might briefly refer to this matter for the purpose of getting an indication from the Minister of his and the Government's view on the idea enshrined in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the Second Stage debate and, indeed, I think on some other occasions, reference was made to the need for the establishment from the House, or as the motion we have tabled envisages, the establishment <Col N="888" /> of a Select Committee representative of both Houses, to consider, advise on and examine the draft regulations, directives, decisions and other proposals and the Acts of the institutions of the European Community. In view of the very many regulations, directives and Acts which issue from the Community or are issued by the Community, it is considered desirable to have a Dáil committee or a committee of both Houses to consider these matters rather than to proceed as we do at present, the Minister or Minister's responsible answering to the House in discussions taking place on particular motions or during the course of Estimate debates.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the quantum of work will come from the European Economic Community is much greater than that of any similar body and in addition, this country will have ten representatives in the European Parliament. The various methods by which these regulations might be brought before the House are considerable, but having looked at the precedents and having endeavoured to draft a suitable amendment for Committee Stage, it was considered that the most practical way of doing it and the one most in accord with Dáil procedure was to table what is known as an expediency motion.  Deputy Ryan and I are not by any means wedded to the particular phraseology of this motion which has been circulated in White Paper form, but I raise the matter now because I would like to get from the Minister an indication of the Government's view on this and what I believe would be the reaction of the House and probably also of the Seanad, although we cannot speak for the Seanad, to a proposal for the establishment of a committee of both Houses for the purpose of considering these matters.</P>
    <P>I think also it may well be necessary to establish a special secretariat, with technical and other assistance.  This will be a continuing committee.  We have, I think, only two or three committees, two of them meeting frequently and one appointed to deal with particular work each year, the Public Accounts Committee.  Other than these, we have no permanent committees here and the staff of the House <Col N="889" /> provide the necessary secretarial assistance for the public accounts and other committees.  The work which this committee will have to do will be entirely different and the type of regulations, directives and other Acts which issue from or are the subject of consideration by the Committees, as well as the matters which will arise in the European Parliament, are obviously in many cases of a highly technical and specialised nature.  It will, therefore, be essential to have technical assistance of a specialised kind and for that reason it may well be that a new procedure in that regard will have to be adopted.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prolong this matter at this stage further than to say that we have tabled this resolution and the remarks I am making now are directed to the Financial Resolution because this is the appropriate occasion on which we can consider the matters in the European Communities Bill and unless time were set aside specially to consider the motion at some fairly proximate date, it might well be that the accession of this country to the EEC would have come and gone before it was considered.  In any event, I believe that there is a general view that a committee should be established and I would naturally be anxious to ensure that whatever proposal is made is one which commends itself to the House.  For that reason we mention it now to get the reaction of the Government, as well as any other views that may be expressed, in order to ensure that the committee, which is established, will meet the needs of the particular circumstances and also reflect adequately the views of this House and, if necessary, the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Reading of this Bill, I, on behalf of the Labour Party, supported the committee idea and other speakers from the party agreed that this seems to be the sensible approach.  Everything that Deputy <Col N="890" /> Cosgrave has said is obvious to us.  If we are going to do the job properly, we must have some way of dealing with it and it cannot be dealt with in the way in which at the present time it is proposed to deal with it.  The Minister may have made a decision on this already.  I am surprised that some proposal has not come forward from the Government but, perhaps, it is as well that it should come in this way because by coming in this way it ensures that it has the unanimous support of the House if the Government agreed to it.</P>
      <P>There is one thing which worries me about it more than anything else and it is that it does mean a necessity to have staff to help in the running of this committee. The tendency has been to draw on already overworked staff without replacement.  We have had in this House for some time a situation in which people are doing a job and are fully taxed in doing it, and when extra work comes along, it is put on to them also and the result is that without producing replacements, we seem to be attempting to carry on with the ordinary work and a certain type of work of the House has fallen very much behind.  I would ask the Minister, if he is going to agree to the suggestion made by Deputy Cosgrave, with which we agree, that the necessary steps will be taken to ensure that there is proper staffing for it without reducing the number of staff doing other work already or attempting to do it.</P>
      <P>There is one other thing about which I feel very strongly.  Perhaps it was a catty remark, but I commented during Second Reading that while we were prepared to pay £7,000 a year on top of the initial £4,000 for this provision of the box up there to translate any word of Irish that might be spoken for our benefit through earphones&mdash;may I say that I think it must be a very hard thing to sit in that box up there throughout the entire sitting, a job none of us would relish&mdash;no effort seems to have been made to translate these documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can foresee our having EEC directives which will have the force of law here but which will not have been <Col N="891" /> translated into the English language, the language most used here.  May I ask that if we are to have a committee set up, the first thing that committee should require is to have all Community documents translated?  I appreciate that English will become one of the EEC languages in 1973 and that the problem will not then be as bad, but if we do not do what Deputy Cosgrave suggested today and what we suggested on Second Stage, we will become bogged down in this House with EEC business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has indicated that he would like the views of the House on the proposal that a select committee be established.  I should like at this stage to say briefly that I agree with all that has been said about the necessity to devise some legislation or machinery to keep the House and the people of the country in touch with the flow of directives, Acts, recommendations and so on that will come from the EEC.  I think that is very important because, as has been said by a number of Deputies who spoke here on Second Stage, it is essential that the general public be kept as fully informed as possible of the legislation that will become so important to us as a community.</P>
      <P>It is also important, of course, from the point of view of the people whose interests will be vitally affected by these Acts and directives, that no impression should be created among the people that Brussels is a very remote place in which all sorts of things are happening and being promulgated about which they know very little, thus alienating them from the source of authority and power which will reside in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there is a necessity to have some machinery in the Oireachtas to enable us as Members and the general public and the people whose special interests will be vitally affected to keep in touch with this new legislation.  I do not, however, agree with the idea of a select committee. I have some experience of select committees and I have never found them very satisfactory.  They <Col N="892" /> suffer certain disadvantages which a committee of the whole House do not suffer from.  There is a certain behind-closed-doors, a closed shop, thing about a select committee whose membership, of course, is restricted.</P>
    <P>This would become very important in this context&mdash;this restriction of membership of a select committee&mdash; because I doubt if there is any Deputy in the House the vital interests of whose constituents will not from time to time become affected by regulations of the EEC, and if a Deputy is not a member of the select committee and some regulation comes forward which vitally affects the interests of his constituents, he will be at a severe disadvantage.  In my experience it has always been much more desirable that the business of this House should be conducted by a committee of the whole House in full public view, as it were, with the right of public attendance. I do not mean to suggest there would not be the right of public attendance at a select committee, but they would not have the same accessibility as a committee of the whole House sitting here in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>I realise that the idea of a select committee is put forward to deal with this situation and I have tried to see if there is some alternative to a select committee.  I would put forward tentatively a proposal that this House meet as a committee of the whole House on a Friday, perhaps every second Friday or on a Friday once a month, for a fixed time, say from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. or something of that order, and that that special sitting of the House would be devoted to EEC legislation.  I realise there are certain disadvantages in that proposal but I think they could be overcome.</P>
    <P>It would be important, first of all, that the quorum of that special sitting of the House would be relatively small so that it would not be particularly onerous on the House to provide a quorum for such special Friday sittings. It would have the advantage that any Deputy who was particularly interested in a particular piece of legislation, or the interests of whose constituents would be vitally affected by such legislation, could attend that committee of the whole House at that <Col N="893" /> Friday sitting.  As I have said, I put that proposal very tentatively&mdash;I hope it will be considered&mdash;because I dislike the idea of a select committee, particularly because such a committee would not be open to any particular Deputy who might have a vital interest in a particular matter but who would not be a member of that committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave and the Fine Gael Party are grateful for the way their suggestion has been met but I should like to emphasise to the House, and Deputy Haughey in particular, that the resolution, as drafted, provides that the committee would have a right to co-opt five Members of this House and two of the Seanad, because, quite clearly, there might be Members who might have an interest in agriculture but not an interest in legal matters and so on, who would like to be present when the committee were making a decision.</P>
      <P>Accepting all the criticism of a select committee, it seems to us we must have a select committee because it would be asking too much of all Members of the House to involve themselves in EEC affairs.  At a Friday sitting there might be a loose, flabby debate which would never be able to get to some of the directives, regulations, <i>et cetera</i>.  There would be a more intimate discussion and exchange of views at a select committee meeting than at a committee of the whole House.  It must be remembered that a special committee is required by the resolutions Deputy Cosgrave and I have tabled.  While sympathising with what Deputy Haughey has said, I think we can attain the best of both worlds by having a select committee doing the hard work and by requiring that committee to report to the House.  It could report to the House monthly or even more frequently, if thought desirable, and the House could then in general committee debate it if that were considered to be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree that we must have the fullest discussion of European affairs if European affairs are to be meaningful to the general public.  The way in which the Government have presented the European Communities <Col N="894" /> Bill shows two very dangerous trends, first, their utter contempt for democracy and, secondly, their total lack of preparedness for the obligations of the European Community.</P>

      <P>The Chair would point out at this stage that it is because taxation is involved by this Financial Resolution that the suggestion of a committee to watch over <i>inter alia</i> financial matters would be in order.  Therefore, what the Chair would suggest to Deputies is that they would keep close to the taxation implications of the resolution and not widen the scope to a general discussion of the proposed committee <i>per se</i> which would anticipate discussion on the motion which has been put down.  We cannot anticipate discussion on that motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir.  Accepting the limitations of the Financial Resolution, I want to point out that the secondary legislation of the European Communities already fills more than 44 thick volumes and there is not even one of these volumes in the Library of this House and yet we are required to pass a Financial Resolution and a Bill on information which is not even available to Members of this House in any language of the world, not even in French, the language of the Communities as the Communities stand at the moment.</P>
      <P>It is making a farce of this House, it is making a farce of democracy in this country, to be asking that this House and the other House and the country in general would approve of legislation which governs so many vital things that even the headings of these vital things as contained in the appendix to the Government's explanatory memorandum shows that there are the best part of 2,000 different regulations and these are not yet available.  This clearly indicates the need to pass this Financial Resolution so that if it be the Government's excuse that they had not the authority to spend the money on these things to date, at least they will have the authority, and the sooner they have it the better, so that we can have this vital information available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> My information is that a basic library on community legislation and law and interpretation of the legislation and the treaties would cost £13,000 and would require annually £1,800 in order to keep it up to date. Here we are, eight weeks from entry to the European Community and none of this essential material has yet been made available to Members of the House and through us to the people of the country.  We are now being asked to adjudicate upon a Bill which is supposed to deal with these matters of legislation which in volume is now as great as the total legislation passed by Oireachtas Éireann since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>This is an appalling state of affairs. As discussion has been allowed on the resolution seeking the establishment of the committee, I would like briefly to make this comment: we are now less than eight weeks away from membership of the European Community and in about nine weeks' time 10 Members of this House and, possibly, the Seanad will have to go to the European Parliament and we have not yet got any kind of committee selected, official or unofficial, considering this problem.  Was ever any country so unprepared for the vital part which it has to play in international affairs?  It is a downright disgrace.  The Government should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. We would not be even as far as we are today in discussing the form of committee work if the Opposition had not tabled this resolution and the amendment that Deputy Bruton has tabled to the Bill.  The Government should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.  They have shown contempt for democracy and contempt for all the people of the country.</P>

      <P>No.  It is not quite right to let this go off into a rambling thing when it is not necessary.  We all intend to do what is proper for the country. There are 43 volumes in the Library, in English.  That is the first thing. The second thing is that there has been a referendum and the people have made a decision that we join the Community and the act of joining makes us accept regulations of the Community in direct application here and decisions and directives of the Community implemented by our own legislation.  So, to say what he has said is to confuse people as much as he is confused himself about the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, with reference to what the Minister has just said, that what is important from the point of view of this House is not so much the fact that there is a translation of existing, agreed, Community legislation in the Library but the fact that there is not in existence an English translation of Community draft legislation which may come into effect by decision of the Council of Ministers.  That is what is politically important to us in this House.  The drafts are available only in French.  Therefore, it is difficult for Members of the House who do not have a facility in French, but are interested in regard to the future position of the Government under the proposal which is before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair must remind the Deputy again that we must keep to the financial implications of what is before the House at the moment.  The Chair has already said that we must not anticipate the debate either on the motion or on amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but it is fair to say that the provision of English translations of Community draft regulations would involve a charge on the Exchequer and in my view their provision would be a desirable charge on the Exchequer.  I would feel, therefore, that it is relevant to the Money Resolution as it is a direct consequence of the provisions of the Bill. <Col N="897" /> The Minister was not fair in reply to Deputy Ryan in drawing attention to the fact that we have English translations of existing EEC law.  What is important is future EEC law and draft directives and regulations which can affect the Irish Minister's future position.</P>
      <P>I support the attitude adopted by the leader of my party in regard to this matter.  It is essential that we have a committee.  As some of these matters will be of a highly technical nature, of a much more technical nature than much of the legislation which has come before the House, it will be necessary to have very elaborate research facilities available to members of the committee and as this would involve a charge on the Exchequer it is relevant on the Money Resolution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to the Financial Resolution.  Perhaps Deputy Cosgrave's resolution does not provide for a sufficiently large membership of the committee.  I think it will be necessary to set up sub-committees of this committee dealing with agriculture, industry, political affairs and other matters.  Perhaps a 12-member committee would not be large enough.  The possibility of extending the membership for certain purposes may cover that point but it would be difficult to anticipate the need to extend the committee for a particular purpose because a small committee, possibly not competent in relation to a particular directive, will have to take the decision in the first place on whether or not it would be wise to extend the committee.  If you had a large committee in existence already, you would have a sufficient number of specialists on the committee to examine this matter.  It is important in establishing such a committee, or in adopting any procedures, that we do not diminish the effectiveness&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion was allowed because as, I think, was pointed out at the time, the whole field of Irish taxation and Irish Government expenditure was affected by this Financial Resolution.  The suggestion that a committee should be set up to <i>inter alia</i> look after this was held to be in order at that stage. The Chair does not wish that there should be a discussion on the committee <i>per se.</i></P>

      <P>Would I be correct in believing that it is important to establish the effectiveness of procedures to cover the propriety of expenditure and that I am in order in commenting on the lack of effectiveness of proposed procedures?

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, if the resolution we are concerned with deals with taxation, is it not the case that this Bill will bring into Irish law provisions of the European Community law which involve Irish Exchequer revenue being directly applied to the Community and that any decisions which are subsequently taken can vary the amount of that without control by us?  Therefore, are we not in order in discussing anything that will control subsequent Community decisions which, by their implementation, would affect the amount of taxation to be levied by the Community directly here through the common external tariff import levies and the 1 per cent value-added tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has already pointed out that we have the Financial Resolution which deals with taxation, and the Money Resolution which deals with the expenditure of what has been raised by way of taxation.  If we are to discuss both of them together, it should be agreed to take both together&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that taxation is affected by this Bill because, by passing this Bill, we join a Community which has a system of legislation <Col N="900" /> under which it can levy taxation here directly by collecting all our customs duties, all our import levies, and up to 1 per cent value-added tax. The decisions the Community take, and which will be applied here under this Bill, will affect the amount of that taxation.  Therefore, if we are discussing the question of the effect on taxation, we must be able to discuss the control of Community decisions which will affect and vary the amount of taxation the Community can levy here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the Financial Resolution deals with the imposition of taxation and the Money Resolution deals with expenditure of public money in so far as it is provided for by this measure. If it is agreed, we can have a discussion on both together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I understood that Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Ryan mentioned the question of setting up a committee and this was permitted because it dealt, as you said, with the entire financial aspect.  This was to be before the discussions took place on the Bill itself, I understood, and we were expecting the Minister to give us some indication as to what the Government proposed to do.  Perhaps I was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the original purpose of the ruling. This was a watchdog committee which was being set up to watch <i>inter alia</i> both taxation and expenditure.  For that reason it was allowed, but the House now seems to be branching forth into a discussion in anticipation of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a watchdog committee which will keep an eye on legislation which could influence taxation here, surely we are entitled to discuss any aspect of watchdog activities, whether by the committee or anything else, which would affect taxation.  If we relate our remarks directly at each point to the possible effect on Irish taxation of a decision taken consequent on the passage of this Bill, surely we are being relevant.</P>

      <P>I submit that you cannot narrow the debate in view of the fact that this Bill authorises the direct levying of taxation here, the amount of which will be determined by decisions taken under legislation, direct or indirect, or derived from this Bill.  As long as what we are talking about is the control of that, we are in order and, indeed, we would be in order in discussing the question of control by the European Parliament of the amount of taxation just as much as we are in order in discussing control by a committee of this House or by the whole House.</P>

It was for administrators and it referred to a competitive examination for their appointment.  The advertisement has caused astonishment and amazement to at least 200,000 Irish people who recognise the Irish language as the national language of this State.

Can the Chair tell me on what occasion I can deal with the discrimination shown in Brussels against the Irish language? I consider I am entitled to make that point.  An example of this discrimination is the advertisement issued by Brussels regarding the examinations I have referred to.  In that advertisement German, French, Italian, Dutch and English are regarded as the languages of note and importance. The advertisement makes reference to people of &ldquo;English mother tongue&rdquo;. I am one Member of this House who does not recognise English as the mother tongue of this country.

      <P>I want to make it clear to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that taxation has reached a very high level.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should give a detailed and candid statement to the House in regard to this matter. As a rural Deputy I am not happy with the situation.  It requires explanation to convince someone like myself about European matters.  The Minister should give this matter some thought.  I am expressing these views because the people of the country are being left in the dark.  The Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, should give more information.  This House has the right to demand information.  If there is any question of a committee to deal with the financial matters Members of this House should cherish the right of eliciting information on behalf of the taxpayers who will have <Col N="909" /> to meet the financial obligations.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should give the House the necessary information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk briefly on this question of a means of ensuring some kind of control, in the competence of this Parliament, directly or indirectly, over taxation arising from this Bill.  There are various ways in which this can be done. One way is to set up a committee for this purpose.  This has been suggested by the leader of the Opposition. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle permitted him to speak about this committee and permitted the spokesman for the Labour Party and members of the Fianna Fáil Party to speak about it because this committee would perform, in their submission, a valuable function, although Deputy Haughey thinks it would not be so valuable a function in regard to the control of taxation.</P>
      <P>There are two sections of the explanatory memorandum dealing with the relevant parts of the Community legislation.  They are section 1 and section 11.  We are concerned about how we can best ensure control over taxation which would be effected in existing regulations and directives. They are mostly decisions of the Coal and Steel Community.  There is also a regulation of the EEC at the top of page 5.  There are a number of directives on page 40.  We are concerned with how the taxation levied under these can be best controlled by this House.  This House has a responsibility in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several methods of doing this.  A committee of this House would be a helpful element.  It would examine proposals relating to certain matters. I submit these are the only matters which we should be discussing.  These matters are the regulations, directives and decisions affecting the external tariff.  It is through this tariff that taxation is levied for the purposes of the Community.  The directives and regulations which we are adopting are ones that entitle the Community to levy taxation from 1975 onwards <Col N="910" /> directly in this country by means of this tariff.  We are concerned with future changes in the common external tariff involving the levying of taxation in this country at the ports of entry to it, with future legislation involving changes in the import levies, with legislation involving any change in the percentage of VAT which the Community are entitled to levy&mdash;that is the 1 per cent figure&mdash;with any legislation involving decisions about how much of the 1 per cent should be levied on any one occasion and, finally, with any legislation involving the actual system of VAT and decisions as to how comprehensive this tax should be and what exemptions should be permitted.  All that legislation directly affects taxation here. Anything I say will relate directly to those headings and will be relevant.</P>
    <P>There are two main approaches to the problem.  One is to ensure that this House will have an adequate chance of considering draft regulations and directives before they are made.  The other approach is to ensure that this House&mdash;through the control it will have of choosing people for the European Parliament, through the influence it may have in the future concerning the method of election to the European Parliament, and through the views it may express in the future which may influence the powers given to the European Parliament&mdash;will have in the future control over the legislation, not at the draft stage only but when it actually comes into effect.</P>
    <P>What combination of actions should we undertake here in regard to the procedure of this House meeting in full committee, and Members of this House meeting as a select committee, or the procedure of the European Parliament?  What procedure should we adopt to ensure adequate control of taxation?  The idea of a select committee of this House is a good one for this purpose.  The reply of Deputy Ryan to points made by Deputy Haughey indicates that the Fine Gael motion is sufficiently flexible to allow for Deputy Haughey's objections, which have some force, to be met.  If there are other ways in which our motion could be varied or amended that would help to meet any legitimate <Col N="911" /> objection which Deputy Haughey raised, I am sure that we would have no objection to making any necessary changes.</P>
    <P>The idea of a select committee is valuable.  That committee should be in a position to report back to this House so that if on examining a draft regulation or directive which involves proposals for taxation affecting this country, the committee feel that such matters should be debated by the full House or, if the House, having heard the views of the committee so decides, the House should be in a position to debate them.  That is legitimate and proper.  I would suggest that there is a danger of proceeding solely by that method of control.  If we seek to exercise our control solely by and through the national Parliament we may reduce the impetus towards giving to the European Parliament effective power, and the impetus towards direct elections to the European Parliament which would give it the authority from the people of Europe, from which alone it could derive the right to seek power to control taxation directly.</P>
    <P>As proposed now under existing legislation here, the power to levy taxation in this country will in future be delegated by us, subject only to consultation, to a group of nine Ministers&mdash;the Irish Minister and eight others&mdash;who are the legislators.  They are not the executive committee.  They are legislators.  Having conferred with various groups they will take the decision as to what the taxation shall be.  This is something to which we are not accustomed.  It is something about which we are rightly concerned.  We are concerned that we should reach a stage where the members of the Executive in this country can, by participation with people in other countries, turn themselves into a legislature and pass laws which this House cannot properly control.</P>
    <P>We must be concerned to bring such legislation as far as possible within the ambit of this House.  We should not be content with doing that.  If we were content with doing only that, our influence could be minimal on our own Minister.  In this House we might express <Col N="912" /> our views on what form the taxation should take.  The Minister, as a legislator, retains the right to decide with other Ministers what the law will be and what the taxation will be. Regardless of what views we may express our Minister would not be amenable to this House in his capacity as legislator.  We should certainly proceed to set up a committee of this kind. It would be useful and valuable.  It is vital that we know what is proposed. It will be most undesirable that we should be content with that.  We must go beyond that and insist that the legislators of the EEC, who are the Ministers and members of the Executives of member countries, shall become amenable to the European Parliament, itself a legislature.  That parliament should be directly elected.  Only in that way will the people of Ireland exercise jointly with the people of other European countries direct control over taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may say it is a pipe dream.  That is the atitude which I fear.  That is precisely the point I fear.  If that attitude takes root here and if we become content to permit members of the Executive of this country to impose taxation on us jointly with members of the Executives of other countries, without parliamentary control at home or in the European Parliament, then we are giving up a right we should certainly be seeking to retain.  I would be concerned that this Parliament and all parties in it would seek to use their best endeavours to persuade the Governments and the Parliaments of other countries to move with us towards securing effective Parliamentary control of taxation in Europe and taxation in this country.  While certainly this Parliamentary committee is useful, valuable and necessary we must not delude ourselves into thinking that if we agree to it, and if we have such a committee, that it will be sufficient. We must be willing to do what Deputy de Valera is sceptical about, go beyond that and insist that at an early <Col N="913" /> date, by 1975 if possible, when the full budgetary powers of the European Communities come into effect, we have a directly elected Parliament with adequate legislative power to control taxation.  Otherwise, instead of creating, as we should be seeking to do, and as, indeed, was the full intent when these communities were established, a democratic Europe, we will be creating a bureaucratic Europe and indeed, to some degree, an autocratic Europe in the sense that the executive will have a power of taxation uncontrolled by Parliament.</P>

Those who went out wholeheartedly and campaigned for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum and come in here now and say that the existing Community law is not available to them are confused. First of all, it is not true to say that the 43 volumes of legislation of the Community are not available.  I think that what was said here was that not one volume is available.  The whole 43, in translation, are available.  That is not the point.</P>

I said in many speeches, and, in fact, I was very much criticised by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien repeatedly in the House for having accepted the Treaties and the secondary legislation and the decisions arising from the Treaties&mdash;I think it was the most frequent criticism made of me in this House that I accepted these but I accepted them and publicised my acceptance of them because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy missed an earlier speech.  We can drop the argument about legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the House seems to be bothered about is its participation in legislation in the future.  The Bill before the House deals with ministerial regulations mainly to get us in line with Community directives and decisions. I think the House accepts this differentiation.  Community directives and decisions are implemented by the method of the country in any of the <Col N="915" /> nine countries.  Regulations of the Community have direct application in the nine countries and regulations made by the Community are far and away the biggest number of documents produced.  Last year they produced 2,900 regulations.  These have direct application and, again, as far as this Bill is concerned, we can do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Last year they produced 410 directives and we can expect, having dealt with the first backlog of about 70 ministerial regulations to get us in line, about 20 ministerial regulations each year to implement directives and decisions of the Community.  However, I do not think this is what was in the mind of the House.  I think what was in the mind of the House, from listening to Second Stage speeches, was how it could influence the formulation of these directives in the Community before they come for implementation here because there is not much option then and it is better to give the power to the Minister to get them done quickly with the power of the Dáil to stop them, as proposed in the Bill, after a year&mdash;if they do not agree then they can stop them&mdash;but how do they influence them in the development stages and, as well as influencing these directives, influence the Community regulations.  The way to do that, as Deputy FitzGerald has said, is to influence the Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To give the Parliament power, which is slightly different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you have to influence the Parliament.  At the moment the Parliament has a certain amount of power.  You have to deal with what is.  What is desirable you have to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How do we get this House effective? I think Deputy Haughey is quite right. Any Deputy in the House would want to be free to make his statement and protect his constituents, this is why we are here, but there is a mass of documentation.  How long would the House have to sit or how many Houses would have to sit to deal with any of this massive legislation in the way we dealt with our business tonight?  There were 2,900 regulations last year.  About <Col N="916" /> 90 per cent of these had to do with the common agricultural policy.  Many of these are ordinary administrative decisions.  They do not need any involvement of the legislature.  They can be done by administration.  They can be done under legislation already passed through this House, But certainly some of them would have policy content, some of them should be considered by the Deputies of this House. I think what we should address ourselves to is to finding a method by which we could separate the technical from the policy, whether in a select committee or in a total committee of the House, which is an attractive idea, if both were existing together.  The Government are not against a select committee; the Government would like a way of handling the problem. The problem, as we see it, is one of a massive amount of work to be done. We see merit in a committee but we think the committee would have to have its own secretariat and the secretariat would have to be full-time, of a high level.  It might not be very big but it would want to be of a high level and have access to all Departments so that the Deputies would be informed of the facts.  Perhaps, we can deal with the realities rather than the doubts and the misinterpretations.</P>
    <P>The number on the committee, I think, we should look at again.  In other countries the committees have existed for a long time and have not been able to handle the whole range of documentation coming out of the Community but if we could stream it and select policy documents which influence the lives of the people here and be able to inform Deputies, then through the Parliament and through this Dáil, through the Council of Ministers, we could have an influence. I think we should get down to structuring that committee.  I would see a function for it of briefing Deputies of this House or Deputies who are selected or elected to go to the European Parliament.  It will be very difficult for any Deputy to make himself fully acquainted, if he has to plough through all the technical material to find the policy matters.  I think it would be a function of this committee to make certain Members <Col N="917" /> of this House very well acquainted with the European structures and institutions because it is envisaged that the legislation applying to the Community, to member countries of the Community, will be a function of the institutions of Europe and any influence we have will be through these institutions&mdash;the Commission, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers. I mention these because the number of 14 from the Dáil and six from the Seanad is mentioned.</P>
    <P>We should get down to consider how this committee could, perhaps, be linked with Deputy Haughey's idea of meetings of the full Dáil every now and again.  In this terribly difficult task of informing Deputies we wanted to have a debate from time to time.  We had a one day debate on Europe; there were those marathon speeches from three or four Deputies and the day was gone.  That was no service to the ordinary Deputy. The House will have to face up to the problem of giving ordinary Deputies&mdash;Deputies who are not in any special position&mdash;access to knowledge and the time to study it.  Some Deputies have to have this knowledge made easy for them.  Deputies must be given an opportunity of coming in and saying what the problems in their constituencies are without having to listen to marathon lectures.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that a Deputy on the committee would have an advantage over a Deputy not on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I think membership of the committee would be an essential for a member of the European Parliament, just for that reason.  We had a committee in our party during the past few years which I found very useful because everybody did his own work.  As I envisage how the Dáil will be informed I think the first thing is to place all documentation in the Library and the second thing is to hope and pray that it will be read by people who are coming in here to talk.  I will say that the committee which I had helping me in the party during the negotiations was a very hard-working, interested committee.  It could very easily set the <Col N="918" /> pattern for committees set up by other parties.  If they developed along the same lines as the Fianna Fáil committee, then you could have a very effective nucleus of Deputies in this House who would be fully informed and would be helpful to other Deputies who do not have the same time available to them.</P>
      <P>There will be occasions when some of the documentatiton coming from the Commission will be confidential and could not be given to the committee. The committee will have to accept that limitation.  We would like some effective way of dealing with Community legislation. We accept the idea of a committee. We also have to accept the right of all Deputies to be brought into this.  We will have to marry the two ideas in some way.  It is not so difficult if the House accepts Deputy Haughey's idea of one day meetings at regular intervals.  Then we could have the committees made up of members of each party who would be responsible to their own parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The first business of the committee would be to work out some way of informing Deputies.  It is basic that the information be available and that Deputies use it.  It is impossible to have the whole Dáil on this.  It takes a long time and it would be impossible to have the whole Dáil up to date on everything.  It would be a help to have in each party certain people specialising who would be able to guide their own Deputies in terms of reading, matters coming up which affect their constituencies and so on.  The committee could be a good idea as a basis for solving the problem as long as we remember that in other countries with committees well established they have not been able to handle the amount of documentation coming in.  I think we can do it if we are sensible about it and avoid trying to do the things we are not entitled to do now.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister to clarify one point?  Is it his thinking that the committee would at least <i>inter alia</i> concern itself with segregating technical legislation from policy legislation with a view to directing the attention of the Dáil towards the policy areas where debate would be particularly fruitful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason I think the committee would want to have a very good full time secretariat and especially equipped to find out legislation which is policy as distinct from technical.  Each Department will have its own officers working at legislation and a secretariat with access to these Departments will to a much greater extent than any Deputy or any group of Deputies be able to separate the technical from the policy. Once it is identified the committee could bring it to their own parties and the House could discuss the policy matter.  That is how I see it.  It would have to be in practice before you would know how effective it would be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that a committee such as he has in mind would be left to the various political parties to appoint.  There are Deputies associated with political parties who would never have a hope of being selected on such a committee.  Independent Deputies have the same right to protect the interests of their constituents. If we are to have a committee such as the one the Minister suggests Deputies should be allowed to volunteer for such a committee.  It should not <Col N="920" /> matter if the committee consisted of half the Members of this House.  It would be wrong to leave Deputies out of such a committee.  The more we seek to restrict the right of Deputies to seek information and supply their constituents with information the greater the disservice we are doing to the country.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any conflict.  I think the committee should help Deputies.  We should be able to structure a committee which would report to the House and permit a discussion in the House which would help Deputies to deal with matters.  Because of the mass of legislation it would be quite impossible for a Deputy, financed as we are compared with other Parliaments, to go through all the legislation and find out what affects his constituents.  If you had a committee with a secretariat reporting to the Dáil it would make it easier for individual Deputies.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such charges on and payments out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof and such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to make provision with respect to membership of the State of the European Communities.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us if the procedures for this authorisation will be the same as those obtaining at the moment and, in particular, if we have a regulation which is applicable directly in this country and which, consequently, involves a charge on the Exchequer, whether it would be possible to incorporate a discussion of money arising out of such a direct regulation under the existing procedure, for instance, under Estimates, or would it be necessary that Estimates for discussion in this House will be matters over which the House can have control?  As I understand it, a directly applicable resolution will not be a matter over which this House will have any control regarding the amount of money to be spent whereas the Estimates which we approve here each year are in relation to matters over which the House, theoretically, can have some control.  Are the existing Estimates procedures adequate to deal with such a situation?  This matter needs to be clarified.  It is essential that some procedure be set up to screen such proposed charges on the Irish Exchequer in advance of their being agreed by the EEC Council of Ministers. For that reason I would support the proposal of a committee of the House.</P>

If it is decided in Brussels that there is to be, say, serious credit restrictions in all member countries and since this would be a matter over which this House would have <Col N="922" /> no control, surely in the interest of the economy of the country opinions should be expressed in Parliament as to the implications of any such decision.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage they spoke against a committee.  It is envisaged that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will be the intervention agency for Ireland.  An intervention agency must be set up for each member state for the purpose of regulating the market for agricultural produce which is subject to common organisation.  Some of the administrative expenses of this agency will be met from the Vote for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and it is likely that part of the expenditure on measures for the structural reform of agriculture will be met by the individual states.  In our case this expenditure will be met from voted moneys, again, primarily from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and possibly from the Votes for the Department of Land and Social Welfare.  It is likely that expenditure on training in the Department of Labour which would be eligible for part recruitment from the European Social Fund would continue to be met from the voted moneys.</P>

    <P>As will probably be fairly obvious to the House both these amendments and, indeed, all the amendments which stand in my name, are directed to the drafting of the Bill rather than to any principles that are enshrined in the legislation.

I can understand how he must consider himself committed to the principles which he has put forward in the Bill but perhaps he will be prepared to consider my amendments as attempts to improve the drafting of the Bill.  I am very conscious of the importance of this piece of legislation and I think all Deputies will agree that it is quasi-constitutional in its stature.  Certainly it will be a very important piece of legislation in the years ahead and will be scrutinised and dissected at the highest levels. Therefore, it is important that to the best of our capacity as legislators we should ensure that the legislation is clear, certain and positive.</P>
    <P>That is the background against which I have tabled these amendments and I would hope that because of the importance of the Bill it would be as near perfect as we can make it.

For that reason, too, I would be very anxious that it be as near perfect as possible. I do not think we should look on the Community as something from which we are only to seek benefits. It is something to which we can also make a contribution.  In the area of law making I think we are particularly well equipped to make a contribution to the Community as it evolves because we are in the unique position of being a common law country and at the same time having a written Constitution.  Because of this we are perhaps more intellectually adapted to the Community system of law than our neighbour, and I would hope that, as the Community and its institutions evolve and develop, this is one area in which we can make a very important intellectual contribution.  For that reason I would like if we would begin with as near a perfect piece of legislation in this Bill as we can possibly get.  Amendments 1 and 3 deal with the definition of the word &ldquo;act&rdquo; in the Bill and I want to point out at <Col N="926" /> the outset that I differentiate between &ldquo;Act&rdquo; with a capital &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;act&rdquo; with a small &ldquo;a&rdquo;, because, of course, &ldquo;Act&rdquo; with a capital &ldquo;A&rdquo; refers to the piece of legislation itself whereas the `act&rdquo; with a small &ldquo;a&rdquo; is something completely different.  It covers directives, regulations, decisions or recommendations of the European Community institutions.</P>
    <P>I had some difficulty in looking at the Bill because of the way in which the word &ldquo;act&rdquo; or &ldquo;acts&rdquo; is used. Deputies will notice that section 1 (1), line 41, contains the words: &ldquo;as supplemented or amended by treaties or other acts of which...&rdquo;  There is no mention there in line 41 of by whom those acts are made; whereas in section 2, line 12, where the Bill again speaks of &ldquo;acts&rdquo; it is quite specific by including the words &ldquo;adopted by the institutions of those Communities&rdquo;. It seems to me that there is a difference between the two sections. In section 2 the Bill is quite clear that the acts must be the acts of the institutions of the Community, whereas in subsection (1) of section 1 there is no reference to the fact that the acts must be acts of the institutions of the Community.</P>
    <P>Confronted with that apparent contradiction, at least, between these two sections, it seemed to me that the desirable thing to do was to put into the definition section, that is, subsection (1) of section 1 a clear definition of what we mean by &ldquo;acts&rdquo; throughout the Bill.  As you see, my amendment seeks to define &ldquo;act&rdquo; as &ldquo;any enactment, regulation, directive, decision or recommendation made or adopted by the institutions of the European Communities&rdquo;.  I think that removes any doubts which may exist. Again, I emphasise that in any piece of legislation of this fundamental and quasi-constitutional importance it is essential that there be no doubt.  If that definition is included in the definition section, then I think the Bill is considerably improved.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is a necessary follow-up to amendment No. 1, because if I include in the definition of the word &ldquo;act&rdquo; the stipulation that these acts must be acts adopted by <Col N="927" /> the institutions of the European Communities, then there is no need in section 2, line 12, for a repeat of the words &ldquo;adopted by the institutions of those Communities&rdquo;.  The two amendments, as you rightly point out, a Cheann Comhairle, hang together, and if we adopt the definition in the definition section, then it follows that section 2 would have to be changed accordingly.</P>
    <P>I would make one final point, that is, that nowhere in the documentation attached to the Treaties is there any definition of &ldquo;acts&rdquo;; indeed, to a large extent there are very rare references to acts as such.  It would be very convenient if we could say that &ldquo;act&rdquo; with a small &ldquo;a&rdquo;, has the same meaning as it has in the Treaty of Rome or the Treaty of Accession or some corresponding document.  There is certainly no reference in the main Treaty to &ldquo;acts&rdquo; as such.  All in all, the adoption of these two amendments would help to make this piece of legislation much more positive and much more clearcut and I recommend them to the House.</P>

      <P>I see the point of the Deputy's proposal.  The word &ldquo;act&rdquo; does appear in two places and has a different meaning in section 2 from that in section 1 (1).  Interpretation of this is a matter which may be of importance and we have taken both these wordings from the Act of Accession.  If interpretation ever has to be made, it would have to be made by the European Court.  Therefore, while it would be desirable to have it clarified, clarification in the way the Deputy suggests for our legislation could lead to conflict afterwards.</P>

I am not pressing it but perhaps it might be considered between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 12, before &ldquo;acts&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;existing and future&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is really a drafting amendment. It seems to me that if we just leave in line 12, section 2, the wording &ldquo;acts adopted by the institutions&rdquo; it could possibly be interpreted as referring only to acts&mdash;again I am using &ldquo;acts&rdquo; with a small &ldquo;a&rdquo;&mdash;which have already been adopted by the Community at the date of the passing of this piece of legislation. I do think it is open to that interpretation, particularly as the earlier part of section 2, which deals with the Treaties, the wording quite clearly restricts the operation of the section to treaties which have, in fact, come into operation or will come into operation by 1st January, 1973.</P>
      <P>With that sort of headline, as it were, in the earlier part of the section it is, I think, very important to spell out precisely what we mean.  It is clear, as everybody will agree, that by &ldquo;acts adopted&rdquo; we intend to refer to acts which have already been adopted or which will be adopted in the future. I should like the Minister also to confirm my view, if he can, that in section 2 we are only bringing into our domestic law the treaties as they will exist at the 1st day of January, 1973, and, if there are any new treaties, presumably it is the intention that these will be legislated for or put through the Oireachtas because of their importance as treaties in some other way.  In section 2, however, we are dealing with acts adopted up to now or which will be adopted in the future.  If I am right in that it would, I think, be desirable, and it should not cause any objection here, in the European Court, or anywhere else, if we just put in the words suggested to clarify the acts about which we are talking.  There should be no objection to the inclusion of the words &ldquo;existing and future acts&rdquo; Accordingly, I recommend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>Surely, if they do not do any harm, and there is the possibiliy that they might make the situation clearer, then <i>ex abundante cautelae</i>, the Minister might be inclined to accept them.  If the Act annexed to the Treaty of Accession should prove in any way ambiguous surely it can only help matters to make our law totally devoid of any ambiguity. There is no doubt that the use of the phrase &ldquo;the acts adopted&rdquo; could in certain circumstances be interpreted as meaning only acts which have been adopted at the passing of this piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey has proposed something and the Minister has pointed out that interpretation will ultimately be made by the European Court on the terms of the Act of Accession.  It occurs to me that a point in favour of Deputy Haughey's approach is that, when the court comes to interpret the Act of Accession, it will naturally look around for whatever interpretations are there and if we offer an interpretation in advance we will be making a contribution towards the interpretation we would wish. Therefore, although the court would not be bound by it, there could not be any conflict because ultimately the European Court will rule.  There might be some point in putting in the interpretation in advance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me there could be an advantage if the Bill, as drafted, contained the weakness that Deputy Haughey fears might be in it because there might be an occasion in the <Col N="930" /> future when some act of the Institutions might not be to this country's advantage and, if that weakness was there, it might be to our advantage to escape through this particular loophole. However, if I put on my legal hat for a moment, I do not see that legal weakness there at all.  You may have acts adopted in the future just as acts may have been adopted in the past or acts adopted now.  They will have their own particular meaning in any particular tense.  I am not impressed by the Minister's argument that we should not vary the words contained in the Act of Accession.  There is certainly ambiguity here in relation to the earlier section. Deputy Haughey is quite right.  The same point arises here.  There is ambiguity in our legislation in relation to the earlier section.  The Minister says we should not vary the phraseology because the Act of Accession uses it, but that was the phraseology in use in a Community document and quite clearly does not relate to the local bye-laws of any particular State.  It is the language of the Community itself and our courts, if interpreting section 1, as it stands, could certainly say that the acts relates to something other than Community enactments.  However, in relation to this particular amendment, I would say the fears Deputy Haughey has are not justified but, even if they were, I would consider it advantageous to leave that area of freedom for our lawyers to use in the future to our advantage if they thought it advisable to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not subscribe to that very fallacious argument of Deputy Ryan.  Do not forget this is domestic Irish legislation and it will also be open to interpretation by the Irish courts and it will be capable of being the subject of actions in the Irish courts.  Therefore, there is a very heavy onus on us, both from the point of view of our own domestic law and from the point of view of our being good international citizens, to make our legislation as precise and as clear as possible and not to phrase it in such a way that we leave loopholes through which someone can escape at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that Deputy Ryan has come <Col N="931" /> into the argument I want to make this point to him and also to the Minister. My worry arises not so much out of that one phrase &ldquo;acts adopted&rdquo; but because section 2 in the first few lines deals only with treaties which will be, have been and are in operation on 1st January, 1973, and not any future treaties.  Section 2 does not deal with treaties which may be adopted or made in the future.  To that extent, therefore, there is an implication in the section when it refers to &ldquo;acts&rdquo; that they are only acts which have been adopted by 1st January, 1973.  That is my worry.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 15, after &ldquo;treaties&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and in case of conflict shall prevail over any other part of the domestic law now in force or hereafter to be enacted or to come into force.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again this is a drafting amendment designed hopefully to make the situation clear.  It is quite clear that section 2 is concerned with incorporating into our domestic law the treaties and acts of the Communities and the institutions of the Communities. Surely it is quite possible that at some stage we in this House might pass legislation, or indeed under existing legislation some order or regulation might be made, which would be in conflict with a directive or a regulation or an act of the Community and it is to avoid any such situation arising in future that I put forward the amendment.  The Minister has spoken about the vast amount of legislation which has already accumulated and the amount we can expect to issue in the future.  This legislation, these directives and regulations, are going to be very complex and complicated, so that it is quite possible that even if we are as wary and as watchful as we possibly can be, we could have a situation in which something which we would pass here as part of our domestic legal processes would conflict with some Community legislation. It is to try to make the section appear as clear and positive as possible that I put forward the amendment, making it quite clear that in any case where there would be any conflict between our domestic law and the European law, the European Community law would prevail.  I understand that there is some discussion in Brussels in legal circles about this matter and that some countries, other member countries, <Col N="933" /> are at least approaching the particular problem and considering what might be done about it.  I recommend the amendment to the Minister purely on the basis of making this Bill as clear and as precise as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment uses a couple of words which are also contained in the original section upon which I would like some guidance. These are the words &ldquo;domestic law&rdquo;. I think this is a legal concept which has not been defined in any statute. It is not in our constitutional law and I think it is a concept which is unknown to our whole legal system.  I think we have a general understanding of what &ldquo;domestic law&rdquo; means.  It means law which is applicable within our own jurisdiction or environment but it occurs to me that it is something which ought to be referred to in the definition section of the Bill, but if I am wrong in saying that it is not defined in our statute law, I would be very glad if the Minister would refer me to the authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey's proposal, as I read it, is to tie the legislators here hand and foot so that, even if they consciously decide to pass a Bill which appears to be contrary to Community law, such law will not have effect.  I do not think this a desirable thing.  I feel that, even if it only means chancing our arm, if we find that something has been introduced with which we violently disagree, this Oireachtas Éireann should have the right to pass a law, even if it does appear to be in conflict, because the Community law may not always be right.  Being one of the people who bitterly opposed entry into the EEC, I am now accepting that we must go in, but I do not see why we should deliberately tie ourselves hand and foot in going in, so that if we want to get out of a situation, we are unable to do so and even if we are allowed out, if the EEC decide that they will tolerate something, if we accept this amendment does it not mean that we cannot do something which may appear to be contrary to EEC law?  I may be misunderstanding both the amendment <Col N="934" /> and the section and I would like some guidance on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out very clearly earlier on, the decision about the European Community has been taken by the people by an overwhelming majority.  There is no question of not accepting Community law.  We have decided to accept it and this is the machinery by which we actuate the acceptance. I am not concerned with that but I am concerned that there might be ambiguity in future and I am anxious to make the law, whether it is Community law or domestic, precise and clearcut with no ambiguity, and with having a situation in which the courts, the citizens and the practitioners know what is the law and that if there is an apparent conflict between that law and the other, to have it clear which law prevails.</P>

I understand that he wants to have the areas of black and white recognised as such but if there are grey areas where there may not be a clearcut decision and if it appears that some law which could be passed here would be in the interests of the Irish people, why should we insist on putting in a clause which will mean that we cannot get an advantage even if that advantage would otherwise be open to us?

      <P>I think it is important that we have some information which I certainly do not have about how this problem has been got over before, <Col N="935" /> because it seems that as a result of this legislation we are going to bring about a unique situation in the legal history of this country in that we will have two bodies of law in effect at the same time and there will be no absolute certainty where one begins and the other ends. Even with Deputy Haughey's amendment, which does establish the primacy of one law over the other, we do not solve the further problem of deciding where that law stops in so far as its general appliability is concerned and where do you find yourself having to revert to the existing law which is domestic law?  This to my mind is a case for introducing as far as possible Community regulations into the law of this country by means of specific implementing legislation in this country, because if you do that you will be able to spell out in the course of that legislation precisely what sections of existing or pre-existing Irish law are affected by the proposals contained in the Community legislation which is being implemented.</P>
      <P>I can see great difficulty if we leave that matter subject to debate in the courts.  It will be a great opportunity for lawyers to make big money debating whether a particular section is affected by a particular section of Community law.  To avoid excessive legislation it is necessary that we should implement Community law by specific legislation within this country so as to nail this matter down and say precisely: &ldquo;This section of this existing Irish statute is hereby revoked.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to labour this point but it does seem as if it has greatly been misunderstood.  Deputy Haughey's amendment establishes the primacy of EEC law over Irish law. The problem I am trying to get at is deciding where EEC law is no longer applicable and where you have to revert to existing law.  There are vast areas of Irish law that will not be affected at present or in the foreseeable future by EEC legislation.  I think the problem is that it will be uncertain, when you introduce a particular item of Community legislation, how far that goes in affecting existing Irish legislation, whether it affects section 1 of a particular Act or sections 1 and 2 of that Act.  A service would be given in reducing litigation if we could implement as far as possible EEC legislation by legislation here, which would state specifically that sections 1 and 2 of a particular Act are affected by this piece of EEC legislation.</P>

    <P>Deputy Haughey's amendment does not deal with particular items of legislation; it lays down a general principle which will not help us in dealing with some piece of legislation, say, with regard to the grading of eggs.  If we want to decide whether our existing Egg <Col N="937" /> Marketing Act is affected as to sections 1, 2 and 3 or as to sections 1 and 2 Deputy's Haughey's amendment will not help.  I am trying to make the point that, if we are altering the Egg Marketing Act by means of legislation, if the Community law is going to affect the Egg Marketing Act, we should affect this by means of legislation in this House specifying precisely whether it is sections 1 and 2 or sections 1, 2 and 3 that are involved.  While that may entail greater labour in this House we shall reduce the amount of labour in the courts, which would cost individual litigants a great deal of money, by nailing down the precise area of applicability of Community law in relation to Irish law once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I get some information from the Minister in reference to this proposed amendment of Deputy Haughey which states:</P>
      <P>...and in case of conflict shall prevail over any other part of the domestic law now in force or hereafter to be enacted or to come into force.</P>
      <P>It is better to inquire now than later. In Britain abortion is absolutely legal at present.  Assuming divorce and abortion laws were to become binding on the Community, I want to know how our domestic laws would stand.  It is only right that at this stage, lest any conflict should arise&mdash;and Deputy Haughey's amendment envisages such a conflict of laws&mdash;this information should be sought.  I am asking if, not this year but at some future date, there should be in member countries a law similar to that in Britain now in regard to abortion, which would be binding on other countries, are we committing ourselves to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cite that as one instance.  We do not advocate or legislate for divorce and we have no intention now or in the future of legalising abortion, but what would be the position if a law such as exists in Britain now were passed by the European Community?  Would it be binding on us or would this Parliament have the right to put that law aside?  Or would it be a law that could be considered, in county management terms, as a reserved function, a law <Col N="938" /> which we would not adopt?  Would the Minister clear up that point?  Such a possibility may not arise but it is better to have it on record and I am raising the matter so that it will be on the records of the House in the event of such a possibility arising in the next three, five, ten or 15 years.  Perhaps I shall not be here then but we should know how we stand in relation to laws which will have an effect on the economic, moral and social standards of this country, laws in regard to our culture and our national standards.  I want to ensure that there will be no conflict.  If laws are to be imposed on us which are foreign to our Irish traditions what authority will this House have to prevent the laws of Brussels becoming our domestic law?</P>
    <P>The Foreign Minister has probably gone fully and closely into this during years of negotiation but, for record purposes, it is right that we should raise the matter.  If the laws of the Community are to be on the same level as our domestic laws are we to adopt Community laws which will automatically become our domestic laws after 1st January, 1973?  I have given the legalising of abortion as a typical example of a law that this country would not relish or stand for, that the Christian traditions of this country would not subscribe to.  For that reason it is only right, for the records of the House, that we should hear here and now exactly what the Minister for Foreign Affairs has to say in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any point in what the Deputy raised. I do not think what Deputy Flanagan fears in the area of abortion, divorce, contraception, will be imposed on him by the European Communities, however else it might happen.  The area in which Community laws will be effective here and will prevail over our own laws is limited.  It is economic, trading, commercial and related social.  I do not envisage legislation in relation to the fears expressed by Deputy Flanagan arising at all.  I do not think the marking of eggs, either, arises on this section.  It may arise on an amendment later.  Deputy Bruton made a very long statement about the marking of eggs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an amendment later which might make an area for this discussion.  How do we find out what the law is?  I think this will be dealt with in two ways.  Deputy Flanagan, Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy Haughey said it and I will say it again, that Community law within the area covered by the treaties prevails, and that is that.  What we put in this Bill does not change that.  How do you get this tidy situation as Deputy Bruton sees it?  One is interpretation by the courts and the other is what is intended to be done here and that is the tidying up operation of statute law which will be done by revision at regular intervals here.  The fact is that because we have signed treaties in relation to the application of Community laws, Community law would <Col N="940" /> take precedence over any domestic law made in conflict.  As to whether it is necessary to write it into the legislation, I do not think so.  There have been two individual cases in two parts of the present Community in which the courts made this decision.  So, I have no doubt and I do not think any of the Deputies has any doubt about the fact of the law prevailing.  So, the only thing I can say about Deputy Haughey's amendment is that it is not necessary.  I mean, there is nothing wrong with it except that it is not necessary.</P>

      <P>If it is not necessary then I suppose that in itself is a failing. We should not be enacting unnecessary legislation.  I am not going to press the amendment, of course, but, with all due respect, I should like to suggest to the Minister that between now and Report Stage he would consider this a little further because I think it is important that this principle should be spelled out.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that it is so, that it is a fact that if there is a conflict between some of the laws we make here and Community law, the Community law will prevail.  That is the only possible logical way we can approach this.</P>

But, I am not satisfied that that is the position and I believe that there <Col N="941" /> are some authorities at least in Community legal circles who support me in what I suggest and that it is, perhaps, necessary to be quite specific in this section about the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very unhappy about section 2.  I did not put down the amendment because it may be that my unhappiness is due to a misunderstanding on my part and I felt that if I could clarify the position on Committee Stage I could then see whether in my view, having heard the Minister, an amendment might be required on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that sections 2 and 3 are trying to handle two things at once that are quite different in character and in so doing confuse the issue and may, in fact, be bad law.  I am looking for guidance here.  Let me put my case and be reassured if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 talks about acts adopted by the institutions of those Communities. The word &ldquo;acts&rdquo; is not there defined.  It goes on to say that these acts shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law thereof. That seems to me, in my ignorance, perhaps, to be a reference to a regulation of the Community, which is, of course binding on us and part of our <Col N="942" /> domestic law.  But it does not seem to me to be the description of a directive. A directive may be binding on the State in a sense of an international obligation.  It is binding on the State as an international obligation but it is not part of the domestic law, at least, so I understand.  A directive is something which requires us in good faith, as a member of the Community, having accepted the obligations of membership, to implement in our own domestic law the provisions of the directive by introducing a law&mdash;or it may be a statute or a regulation&mdash; which will achieve the objectives of the directive while, of course, doing this in a way consonant with our own particular interests, our own particular national characteristics, the particular nature of our laws and the particular needs of our people.  A directive leaves a wide range of tolerance to us as to how we implement it.  The fact that it is a directive, not a regulation, implies some tolerance is left in this respect; otherwise it would be a regulation.  I cannot see that a directive which simply requires us to do certain things, imposing on us a binding obligation under the terms of our accession to the Treaty, can be part of the domestic law.</P>
    <P>When I go on to section 3, if the Chair will permit me to refer to it briefly in order to explain my problem in relation to section 2, I discover there that a Minister of State may make regulations&mdash;this is domestic regulations&mdash;for enabling section 2 of the Act to have full effect but in so far as what is referred to in section 2 is a regulation of the Community, that is directly binding on us and is part of the domestic law and would not, as I understand, require any domestic legislation by statute or by regulation to implement it.</P>
    <P>Section 3 seems to be referring to the making of regulations to implement directives of the Community.  It then describes the directives as being in section 2 and refers you back to section 2 which talks in terms which are only appropriate to a regulation which is directly binding.  It seems to me that there are two quite different things here.  We need to draft <Col N="943" /> these two sections together in such a way that we make it clear, in so far as it is necessary in this Bill to implement our obligations under the Treaty, that the Community regulations are directly binding and part of the domestic law of the State.  It stops at that point.</P>
    <P>Another section is required to say that in respect of directives and the other appropriate terms to describe acts which are akin to the directives, they are binding on the State, if that is the correct terminology&mdash;I am not 100 per cent certain of that&mdash;and that the Minister may make domestic regulations to implement those directives. They are two quite different issues and, as drafted at present, it seems to me that these two sections are defective in that the first reads as if it refers only to regulations of the Community whereas the second implies that section 2 is, in fact, talking about directives.</P>
    <P>I will not press the argument any further at the moment because, if I have got the wrong end of the stick, the sooner I am told the shorter the debate will be.  I shall therefore sit down and hope that the Minister can clarify the point, but I reserve the right to come back again if he does not clarify it to my satisfaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey raised the problem in regard to establishing whether there was a primacy of Community law over domestic law.  I think I could help him by quoting a case decided by the European Court which deals specifically with the problem he raised.  The case in question is the case of Costa <i>versus</i> ENEL, case 26/62.  It states:</P>
      <P>The reception, within the laws of each Member State, of provisions having a Community source, and more particularly of the terms and of the spirit of the Treaty, has as a corollary the impossibility, for the Member States, to give preference to a unilateral and subsequent measure against a legal order accepted by them on a basis of reciprocity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that clearly establishes the <Col N="944" /> primacy which Deputy Haughey sought to establish in his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that when we get to the European level the European Court will decide that Community law prevails.  But this is a piece of legislation which will also be interpreted by a district justice in Ireland.  It was to put his mind at rest that I wanted to make the amendment. It was with our domestic situation that I was primarily concerned so that a district justice, or a High Court judge, or a Circuit Court judge, in this country would be under no doubt as to which law would prevail.</P>

      <P>Section 2 provides:</P>
      <P>From the 1st day of January, 1973, the treaties governing the European Communities and the acts adopted by the institutions of those Communities shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law thereof under the conditions laid down in those treaties.</P>
      <P>That conveys clearly to me that all the directives, decisions and laws of the Community to date will be part of our domestic law from 1st January, 1973.  Must we not admit, and must not the Minister for Foreign Affairs subscribe to the idea, that our people are not familiar with all the laws and regulations, directives and decisions that have been decided.  Members of this House are not familiar with them. Members of this House never saw them, never read them, never studied them, and do not know what is in store.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Mansholt said that the EEC <Col N="945" /> is a monster with many heads and that it is very difficult to explain clearly to people what it is intended to achieve.  The public have read this statement by a responsible leading figure in the EEC.  When you hear such a distinguished personality as Dr. Mansholt making a statement of that kind you have not very much confidence in the laws of the Community to date which will become our domestic laws on next New Year's Day.  I have grave doubts when I read a statement like that from a person who was one of the founding members of the Community.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs tell us what Dr. Mansholt does not know?  Does he know more than Dr. Mansholt about this matter?  If he does, he could now enlighten the House. Does he know what it is intended to achieve?  Dr. Mansholt said he does not.  Maybe our Minister possesses a higher degree of intellect than the distinguished Dr. Mansholt whose opinions on the EEC have differed greatly in recent months.</P>

As soon as the chimes of St. Patrick's Cathedral ring out on New Year's Eve these Community laws will be our domestic laws.  Dr. Mansholt was talking about these laws.

If the Foreign Minister differs from Dr. Mansholt this is the occasion for him to tell the House that Dr. Mansholt is wrong.  May we presume, if Dr. Mansholt is wrong now that he was wrong in his statements here when he was brought around by the Minister and his colleagues?  I am satisfied that the laws of the European Communities will be enforced on our people by the free will of the vast majority; we cannot deny that; the people accepted it.

      <P>When the equivalent of the legislation we are now discussing was going through the German Bundestag in 1957 I understand it was proposed by the Bundestag that the German Government would have the responsibility of communicating to the Houses of the Bundestag projected EEC decisions so that the opinion of the Bundestag could be elicited on them prior to a position being adopted by the Government in the Council of Ministers.  I understand that this section refers to the acts adopted by the <Col N="947" /> institutions of the Communities and we are seeking to accept these acts by means of this section into our domestic law.  It is relevant in this context to discuss the procedure whereby these acts become Community law and thereby come within the ambit of this section.  For this reason I drew the attention of the House to the practice in the German Bundestag which involved the German Parliament in the process of deciding on Community law through its representatives in the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>I hope to be in a position to introduce on Report Stage an amendment to this section to require the Government to adopt a similar procedure to that adopted in the German Bundestag and accept it into their Act ratifying the Treaty.  If such a proposal is adopted, that projected EEC decisions should be discussed by the Irish Parliament in advance of a decision being taken by the Community, the most appropriate method of discussing these would be by means of a committee of the House.  That is a matter with which I propose to deal later on another amendment.  I am just putting that proposal into context in regard to what I am saying on this section.</P>

Every week we circulated material and we had Question Time and still they kept on repeating that they were not getting information. That is not good enough; it will not do in the Community.</P>

      <P>In answer to Deputy FitzGerald, section 2 says:</P>
      <P>...acts adopted by the institutions of those Communities shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law thereof under the conditions laid down in those treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions laid down in the treaties are what the Deputy has so often repeated here, regulations are directly binding; directives and decisions implemented by any method adopted by the individual countries.  That is the meaning of it; it covers the ways of bringing Community legislation into effect in our domestic law.  The Treaty of Rome envisages wide horizons which the men who founded the original Community sought to attain, closer co-operation between the countries involved, unity, the betterment of their peoples.  The most obvious achievement to date is the common <Col N="949" /> agricultural policy which organises the markets and which ensures prices.  The Deputy will be aware that a great deal of the legislation which people say is not available to them is already obsolete.  When we speak of this secondary legislation a big proportion of it consists of administrative regulations, and so on, regarding prices.  It is all the time changing and that is why there is such a mass of it.</P>

      <P>Only some of them become part of our domestic law.  The Minister made that clear.  In his reply on the Second Stage the Minister told us that a regulation of the European Community applies to the whole Community. It is not for decision by the national parliaments whether to apply it or not.  The Minister told us that the directives of the Community are to be applied to member states by whatever method the national governments or parliaments choose to adopt.  He told us it was these directives which are concerned in the ministerial regulations which will be made under the Bill.  The Minister has told us that the ministerial regulations to be made under section 3 are only directives, not regulations.  He has excluded regulations.  He has told us they are not for decision by the national parliaments whether to apply them or not, and he has stated that the directives of the Community are to be applied by member states by whatever methods the national governments or parliaments choose to adopt.  What we are concerned with here are the ministerial regulations which will be made under the Bill.  It appears to me that Deputy O'Donovan's point is correct and the point I have made has more merit than I thought.  The Minister's reply is inadequate.  With regard to the words &ldquo;shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law&rdquo;, I do not think Deputy Haughey's intervention solves Deputy O'Donovan's problem.  A decision of the Commission on a cartel matter is not binding on the State, it is binding on an individual.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;and&rdquo; between the two clauses invalidates Deputy Haughey's point.  It says that these acts are both binding on the State and part of domestic law.</P>

      <P>All acts shall be both of these things, not just one or the other.  I think Deputy O'Donovan is right in suggesting that, whatever about a decision in a cartel matter being part of domestic law, it is not binding on the State.  As all acts are stated to be covered by both of these points because of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;, Deputy O'Donovan's point is well taken.  The Minister has also suggested that the words &ldquo;under the conditions laid down in those treaties&rdquo; have the effect of reversing what goes before in certain instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I made that clear.  In emphasising those words, the Minister seemed to be suggesting they had the effect of invalidating what went before in certain cases.  If I understood him correctly&mdash;perhaps he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;when the section states &ldquo;shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law thereof&rdquo; the words &ldquo;under the conditions laid down in those treaties&rdquo; is taken to mean that if they are directives they are not part of domestic law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The words are &ldquo;shall be binding on the State and shall be <Col N="953" /> part of the domestic law&rdquo;.  They have to be made part of the domestic law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different thing.  The Minister is conceding an important point.  What is said here is that these acts shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law, not that the intent and effect of these directives shall be introduced into domestic law by domestic legislation. As it came across to me, the Minister's defence of the phraseology in section 2 combined with section 3 seemed to be that, although a directive is not part of domestic law, its failure to be part of domestic law is covered by the phrase &ldquo;under the conditions laid down in those treaties&rdquo;. Acts are part of the domestic law only under conditions laid down in those treaties and if the treaty says the directive is not part of the domestic law it is not part of it.  I do not think one can read that effect into the words &ldquo;under the conditions laid down in those treaties&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When one says something shall be part of domestic law under the conditions laid down in those treaties, one is saying that the method by which it applies is laid down in the treaty but one is not saying it is part of the domestic law.  The &ldquo;conditions laid down in those treaties&rdquo; refers to the method by which it becomes part of domestic law.  It does not permit of an interpretation that certain things are not part of domestic law because the treaty says so.  To import to the words &ldquo;under the conditions laid down&rdquo; the power to reverse what has gone before and to invalidate it is to go beyond what the words are capable of doing. I submit that here the drafting is defective. If I have understood correctly the Minister's defence and his attempt to suggest that section 2 at present could relate to a directive, his defence is a bad one.  We need to redraft section 2 in order to distinguish clearly between regulations which are binding on the State and part of domestic law and directives which are perhaps binding on the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <P>I shall give the Minister the opportunity in a moment to give his explanation.  The only answer he has given so far is not a direct reply; rather it is an implied one which seems to be invalid.  I do not think directives can be brought within the compass of section 2 by saying that because of the words under the conditions laid down in those treaties a directive which is not part of domestic law can come under section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I can see why section 2 is drafted in this way.  I think what lay behind the drafting was a desire not to distinguish in our domestic legislation between the different types of Community legislation.  I can see the draftsman being concerned with the question of whether he should talk about directives, regulations and decisions and lay down a different procedure for each.  I can understand his fear that this may introduce into the legislation of this House complicated <Col N="955" /> terminology; perhaps it is a question of finding a <i>portmanteau</i> phrase, a way of lumping in directives and regulations into one section which will be so brilliantly devised that it manages to do the impossible&mdash;to combine two incompatible things&mdash;and to use a form of words which simultaneously covers things that are part of domestic law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is an act of the community which imposes an obligation on member governments to introduce legislation and on the parliament, to legislate in such a way that the import and purport of that directive find their place in the domestic law of the State through domestic legislation but leaving it to the State to devise the framework of that and to vary all kinds of surrounding aspects of it as long as the clear intent of the directive is implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This word &ldquo;acts&rdquo; as used in section 2 is quite clearly intended to cover regulations, directives, recommendations and decisions. It is taken from the Act which is annexed to the Treaty of Accession, Article 9, which states:</P>
      <P>...in order to facilitate the adjustment of the new Member States to the rules in force within the Communities the application of the original Treaties and acts adopted by the institutions...</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that the draftsman took that phrase there in Article 9 of the Act annexed to the Treaty of Accession and he used the same wording here deliberately because he wishes to be in accord with the Treaty and the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole problem.  It arises because the draftsman decided not to distinguish between these different forms of Act in the EEC which are different in this country&mdash;some are part of our domestic law by virtue of the EEC decision and some are not&mdash;and put the two of them into one section where he treats them as if they were both part of the domestic law, which in fact, directives are not nor are recommendations, and I do not think that decisions are either though there might be some cases in which they are.  I am speaking in the terminology of the EEC.  I know the words have different meanings in the ECSC Treaty, but I do not want to get <Col N="957" /> involved in that.

We are talking about legislation made outside this State, part of which is to become part of our domestic law and part which is not, but is to impose on us an obligation to introduce something along these lines into our domestic law.  I submit that the Minister should reconsider the wording of section 2 and that his implied defence that &ldquo;under the conditions laid down in those treaties&rdquo; can have the meaning that because a directive or a recommendation is part of domestic law the words immediately preceding it have no force.  That as a method of interpretation is quite inadequate. What should be done here is to distinguish between regulations and directives, because they are so totally different in character that one will get very confused by bad legislation which is dangerously ambiguous and obscure and legislation will be muddled as is done in this section and in section 3 in relation to this section.</P>

      <P>One could argue about any point.  It is like what we did as <Col N="958" /> students when we picked out something and found all sorts of meanings in it.  What section 2 aims to do is what the Treaty of Accession aims to do and that is to bring certain acts of the Community into legislative force here.  We recognise that there are two kinds of regulations.  Regulations directly binding will need in some instances ancillary legislation to bring them in.  Some directives have direct application.  There are some regulations which need ancillary legislation, but this is what satisfied the draftsman in relation to the Treaty of Accession as implementing the decision of the public to join the Community.  What we are doing is taking on the responsibilities of implementing legislation in the area covered by the treaties in our own State.</P>

      <P>Suppose a directive was adopted by the EEC and a time limit of one year given for the implementation by Ireland and the other members of the EEC.  If Ireland, for one reason or another, did not introduce the necessary implementing legislation and at the end of that year, or maybe the following year, a case came up in regard to a particular matter covered by the directive, we would have the problem of deciding here whether that directive is binding or not.  This section says that acts adopted by the institutions shall be binding.  It would appear that the Irish courts would be entitled to interpret the directive even though that directive had never been implemented here and even though that directive was only framed with a view to its being implemented by domestic legislation and was not framed as something which should be directly applicable.  It seems to me this difficulty in interpretation would arise.</P>

      <P>Certainly not.  It may be necessary to put down amendments on Report Stage to meet this point.  I interpreted what the Minister said at an earlier stage as meaning that the words &ldquo;as laid down in the conditions under these treaties&rdquo; can have the effect of reversing the sense of what goes before &mdash;&ldquo;shall be part of the domestic law&rdquo;, and that he is standing on that principle of interpretation. I want to know whether I <Col N="960" /> am right or wrong in understanding that to be the Minister's case?  I am entitled to know the ground on which the Minister defends this and I do not want to have implied something which is not his feeling.  I want to be clear that that is the ground on which he is defending it.  Is that the case?  Is the Minister's case that the words &ldquo;under the conditions laid down in those treaties&rdquo; have the effect, in relation to a directive, of invalidating the words &ldquo;shall be part of the domestic law thereof&rdquo; immediately preceding them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where the Minister is going completely wrong. What we are talking about here is that we are passing a law saying that something shall, by reason of its existence, be part of the domestic law.  We are not saying that it is something that at some appropriate stage may become part of the domestic law by some appropriate legislative action and the Minister must not use such loose terminology in an interpretation here. Is it his case that the words &ldquo;under the conditions laid down in those treaties&rdquo; can have the effect of invalidating what goes before and making it null, the words &ldquo;shall be part of the domestic law thereof&rdquo;, if it is a directive?</P>

      <P>We tell a draftsman to draft an article which makes it possible for us to take on responsibilities which we have accepted in the Accession Act to the Treaty.  This responsibility means taking the acts of the Community as binding on this State and they will be binding on this State either directly or by how we apply the other conditions laid down. The draftsman drafted it in this form which quite satisfies me and the Government that it covers this.  That is a general provision.  The next section makes provision for regulations&mdash;as Deputy de Valera pointed out this is not new&mdash;to implement the law.  The general section makes it binding on the State to bring into our domestic law under the conditions laid down in the Treaty and the conditions are either direct for a regulation or by our own regulations which come in section 3.  It is as clear to me as it could possibly be.</P>

      <P>May I make a contribution which I think may be of assistance?  Deputy FitzGerald and his colleagues are concerned about directives and, rightly, they are concerned about the fact that directives may not be immediately applicable in a member state.  They may be but they may not be.  They are a very flexible sort of thing.  In the case where they are not immediately applicable they are directives to the member state to do something or conduct itself in a certain way.  In so far as they are directives of that sort then the State, by virtue of this section, binds itself <Col N="962" /> to put them into effect ultimately as directives.</P>

      <P>Section 2 does two simple things in the Minister's interpretation. I would have a little refinement on his interpretation if I had my way but in so far as the Minister's interpretation is correct it is absolutely clear.  In so far as they are treaties they are binding on the State; in so far as they are directives or regulations or whatever, they may be binding on the State by the phraseology or they may be binding on the individuals inside the State by becoming part of our domestic law.  It could not be clearer.</P>

      <P>It is an act; it is Community legislation.  The analogy that I draw here is that we frequently pass an Act of Parliament here in our own way.  We empower, and I think there are instances where we have directed, a Minister to make certain regulations.  Incidentally, these regulations could be only for Cork, as local as that.  The analogy is there.  From a legal point of view I would prefer to see an omnibus capture of all Community legislation because what you are dealing with is an act.  A directive is an act that is binding on you in all phases.  It merely needs the subsequent detailed development by what is called regulation here.  I cannot see what the difficulty is.  Is a directive an act?</P>

      <P>The first misleading idea was &ldquo;in&rdquo; the State.  These things are binding on the State.  It goes on:</P>

    <P>&mdash;and shall be part of the domestic <Col N="964" /> law thereof under the conditions laid down in those treaties.</P>
    <P>If you put in the words &ldquo;and shall be made part&rdquo;&mdash;but it would be wrong&mdash; that may make it clearer to the Deputy, but the draftsman is right.  It shall be part of the domestic law.  The first binding is on the State.  The thing shall be part of the domestic law under the conditions laid down in the treaties and the conditions are, broadly, regulations directly applying, directives implemented by local legislation.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  There are two ways of doing this.  You can say that something shall be part of the domestic law, which has a legal meaning, and I shall be surprised if the Minister's legal advisers suggest to the contrary, which means that by virtue of this section of this Act and the regulation being made by the Community, by virtue of the composite effect of those two things, once the regulation is made it is instantly part of the domestic law of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Under conditions laid down in the treaties.  Not the first sentence but the last sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are talking of a regulation which under the conditions laid down under the treaties is one which purports to be and is a regulation directly binding on a member state and directly applicable and part of the domestic law by virtue of <Col N="965" /> being made.  We accept by virtue of this section that it is so part of the domestic law.  Then, by virtue of that regulation being made, it becomes <i>instanter</i> part of our domestic law. The meaning of these words &ldquo;in law&rdquo; surely is that it shall be part of the domestic law by virtue of being made, if it is made under the conditions laid down in the treaty for making a regulation which is binding and becomes part of the domestic law.</P>
      <P>The alternative situation is where there is a directive which requires us to do something.  It would be legitimate, though slightly strange, if we were, in relation to regulations and directives, to say &ldquo;shall be binding on the State and shall be made part of the domestic law&rdquo;.  We can say that if we like, but that is quite a different thing.  You either have the word &ldquo;made&rdquo; inserted or you do not.  If it is not in, then it only refers to a regulation which is part of the domestic law by virtue of being made by the Community.  If you put the word &ldquo;made&rdquo; then it cannot apply to such a regulation because it is an obligation on us to do something and it then refers to a directive.</P>
      <P>The attempt to combine the two in one must of its nature fail.  The Minister put forward a possible defence and seemed to me one which he might attempt to sustain&mdash;although I could not see the validity of it, I would like to hear him developing it&mdash;that the words under the conditions laid down in those treaties in some way have the effect of invalidating what goes before if what goes before is irrelevant under the conditions laid down in the treaties for a directive.</P>
      <P>The Minister then denied that that was his intent and said he did not rely on that implication I had understood to be there.  The Minister is in the position now that there is no way &mdash;if he is not pressing the point about the concluding words I thought he was making&mdash;in which he can sustain and stand over the section in its present form.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is quite dishonest in this.  He is changing this for some reason that is not obvious. He could not be as obscure as he seems to me.  I will ask Deputies to read the matter for themselves, but it is quite clear to me that, as from the 1st January, the treaties and the Acts adopted by the institutions of the Communities shall be binding on the State.  That is quite clear.  The Deputy wants to make it &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;.  The law is that it shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law of the State under the conditions laid down in the treaties.  The conditions laid down in the treaties are automatically part of the law or by regulation.  We provide in the next section for the regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that &ldquo;shall be part of the domestic law&rdquo; cannot have that dual meaning&mdash;that, in law, when you say in an Act of this kind that something shall be part of the domestic law and immediately following that say &ldquo;shall be binding on the State&rdquo; you are making it, by virtue of what you say here and the making of the regulation, automatically binding, instantly, from the point of time the regulation is made. You cannot give it a dual meaning by saying that in a different case, where it is not part of the domestic law, by virtue of being made it shall be made part of the domestic law.  You cannot use the words &ldquo;shall be part of the domestic law&rdquo; in those two totally different senses and I do not think any court of law would uphold that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this may help the Deputy's difficulty over the use of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  This section also covers the treaties and it says &ldquo;these treaties shall be binding on the State and shall be part of our domestic law&rdquo;.  Therefore, the treaties come under both parts of the section.  I think the Deputy was trying to make the point that something cannot be binding on the State and part of our domestic law at the same time.  The treaties are and any other &ldquo;act&rdquo; may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; there requires that anything described as an act shall be both, by virtue of its being made.  My point is that if it is a directive it would not be part of the domestic law by virtue of being made.  Deputy de Valera asked me whether a directive which was not implemented in <Col N="968" /> domestic legislation here by the Government would be interpreted by our courts or by the European Courts as being law.  The answer to that, I am quite clear, is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The directive simply imposes on us a binding obligation. If we fail to implement that we are in default of our obligation under the treaty.</P>

      <P>May I just finish. I was never so interrupted in my life in this House.  We are in default of our obligation and that raises the question of our relationship with the other States.  They could raise the question with us at that stage of whether we are serious about the treaties, whether we are going to accept our obligation or whether we are not, and political action could follow.  If the directive imposes an obligation it is not itself part of our law and no court would so interpret it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pose a problem which is relevant to this matter. There is a directive which has been agreed by the Community in regard to farm modernisation and it states that certain aids shall be made available towards the keeping of farm accounts.  This directive says also that the Government shall be free to determine whether or not this shall be applicable in different ways in different regions within the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose the Government never adopt any implementing legislation to put this directive into effect and, after the time limit for its implementation has expired, a farmer comes along and says that he wants to get this aid for farm accounts, the courts here will turn him down because there is no Irish legislation under which he can get it.  He can go to the European <Col N="969" /> Court, as Deputy de Valera says, and they say that perhaps he is entitled to it but there is a provision in the directive that the Government cannot implement this within certain regions within the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Gun Licence Issues.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of the Parliamentary Secretary who may not have been here this afternoon when I raised this matter, the question concerns the general position relating to the regulations which permit customs officers to issue gun licences to any person entering the country who is able to produce any simple means of identification.</P>
      <P>The situation is that any person coming in here, whether he arrives at an airport, a seaport or a land frontier, must be issued with a gun licence on request so long as he produces any means of identification, be that identification correct or otherwise because under the regulations laid down by the Department of Justice a customs officer is bound to issue such a licence in such circumstances.  In effect, this means that any member of any illegal organisation in Northern Ireland, be it UVF, UDA or Provisional IRA who wishes to carry guns on this side of the Border can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been hearing statements from the Government concerning gun clubs in the North of Ireland.  Indeed, all parties in this House abhor the <Col N="970" /> thought of the number of licensed guns in that part of the country. Despite that the Government here permitted a situation to develop whereby any gunman who wishes to come across the Border with a gun can be issued with a licence.  I appreciated the reason for introducing such a regulation a few years ago.  Its purpose was to encourage gun clubs on this side of the Border and to encourage people from the North of Ireland, from Britain and from western Europe to come here for game shooting. However, the situation now does not lend itself to this practice and the relevant regulations should not be continued by the Department.</P>
    <P>If a citizen of this country applies for a gun licence he must present himself to the local gardaí.  If the licence is required in respect of a shotgun the local superintendent will O.K. the application if the person is considered suitable to hold a licence.  A person of less than 21 years of age must have a letter of consent from his parents before being considered for a licence and if a licence is required for a .22 rifle, the chief superintendent of the district examines the application. However, any person who has reached the age of 21, whether fit or unfit to hold a licence, can obtain one by presenting himself at the Customs and requesting it.  This is a bad and a weak law which must be changed.</P>
    <P>Recently in Donegal a car was stopped by gardaí.  None of the five people in the car was known to be a member of a gun club but there were five guns in the car each of which was licensed.  One of the group proudly displayed his arm band on which appeared the letters UVF but we are left to guess whether he was a member of that organisation or whether he had some other reason for his action.  I have it from very good authority that this incident took place.  Law and order must be preserved and a bad law must be exposed. It is not good enough for the Department of Justice to continue to tolerate such a law.  The sooner it is changed the better.  I call on the Minister for Justice to revoke the present law and the sooner he revokes <Col N="971" /> it the sooner he will have my support on other matters.</P>
    <P>I am not a person who has tried to use the northern situation for any political gain.  The situation is much too delicate for that.  I speak now in the calmness of the evening and I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to ask the Minister for Justice to accept that the law is wrong.  I should not have to come here and assert this. All that should be necessary to have the regulations changed is a simple telephone message to the Department.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to say anything that would worsen the present situation but I would point out that there are people holding gun licences at the moment which have been issued by Customs officers.  These people will appear before the district court for offences arising out of the Game Preservation Act.  These are not fit people to hold gun licences for the purpose for which they were granted.  Of the five people who were in the car I have referred to, two are known to be convicted criminals in the North of Ireland but, I emphasise, they were not convicted for political offences.</P>
    <P>The present regulations are a complete contradiction of the Government's concern in respect of gun clubs in the North.  In the interests of the preservation of law and order these regulations should be changed so that this foolish system might be discontinued.</P>

      <P>At the outset I apologise to the Deputy for the absence of the Minister for Justice who is attending an official function this evening.  The Minister has asked me to give the Deputy an assurance that this matter is being dealt with and that he is keeping in close touch with it.  I am sure the Deputy did not intend to be excitable about what he described as evidence he received on good authority in relation to one of the persons he referred to as having been wearing a UVF band.  After investigation by the Minister into this alleged incident there is no evidence to substantiate its having taken place.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that inquiries were made in the short time available to the Minister.  It has been possible to identify one particular incident which might have given rise to the information given to the Deputy.  This concerned a case where the gardaí found, not rifles, but two shotguns that were held under certificate both in the North and down here. There was no reason to suspect that the guns were intended for use other than in a perfectly lawful fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the position which the Deputy suggests exists.  The Deputy says he has no wish to make political capital out of the situation.  I would like to believe that. I am not condoning in any way any situation, hypothetically or otherwise, which the Deputy suggests exists, as neither does the Minister for Justice, who, since assuming that office, has indicated his will in respect of matters of that nature.  What the Deputy is questioning is neither a regulation nor a law.  It is an arrangement which came into existence in 1965.  Under the 1925 Firearms Act non residents&mdash;people living in the Six Counties or people from outside this island&mdash;had to apply directly to the Minister for Justice for firearm certificates but it was fair to presume then, as it is fair to presume now, that these people were <i>bona fide</i> and that they received clearance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The position between 1925 and 1965 was that one had to apply directly to the Department of Justice for a firearm certificate, that was people coming into the country carrying firearms.  Since 1965 an arrangement has been in operation whereby non-residents, due to lack of knowledge of our law or due to late application, receive these certificates from the customs officers who act as agents of the Minister for Justice.
