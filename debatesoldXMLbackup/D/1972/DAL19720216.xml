    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that nurses duly qualified to attend UCD for the nurse-tutor diploma must pay half their university fees and also pay for their text-books and examination fees; and if he will instruct the Hospitals Commission to meet these costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Permanent nurses employed by health boards or voluntary hospitals who attend the nurse-tutor diploma course at UCD may be granted special leave with full pay for the duration of the course, which covers two academic years, subject to an undertaking from the nurses concerned that they will serve in an Irish hospital for at least two years on completion of the course.  The employing authority may also pay half the course fee and advance the remaining half, to <Col N="1820" /> be repaid by monthly instalments. Travelling or other expenses such as books or examination fees are borne by the nurses.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these nurses are generously treated in being assisted to acquire a qualification for promotion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under present circumstances the arrangement is satisfactory. The fee is £92 per year.  The nurses concerned are being paid £1,140 to £1,480 and the ward sisters are being paid £1,480 to £1,750.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health what steps his Department are taking to alleviate the acute nursing shortage, particularly of staff nurses, in Irish hospitals; and if he is aware that many wards are closed due to the shortage of nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>While the employment pattern of trained nurses in Irish hospitals is marked by a high degree of mobility and consequently much activity by way of recruitment, there is no evidence of an acute nursing shortage, particularly of staff nurses, as suggested by the Deputy.  I am not aware that any wards are now closed due to a shortage of nurses even though the staffing problem in three or four Dublin hospitals may be difficult at times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that certain wards in Dublin hospitals are closed down in the guise of being redecorated while the real reason for this is that there is a shortage of nurses and the wards cannot be kept open?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>While a number of bodies concerned, including the Irish Nurses Organisation, have recommended that staff nurses and student nurses should be relieved of non-nursing duties by the employment of ward assistants or orderlies there are no general plans in hand in my Department to achieve this.  My Department have over the past few years encouraged health authorities who expressed an interest in this question to try out pilot schemes.  So far as this idea has been taken up, it has not met with much success because most of those recruited went on to take up nursing as soon as they had the opportunity.</P>
      <P>One of the many reasons for establishing health boards and later the regional hospital boards is in order to provide modern management and introduce work study so as to review the whole problem of nursing duties.</P>
      <P>In recommending all hospitals to appoint nursing committees, I had in mind productive recommendations not requiring in-depth studies where obviously needed changes could be made relieving nurses of unnecessary duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>There are 90 beds at Vergemount Hospital, Clonskeagh, and 266 beds at Cherry Orchard Hospital for patients suffering from infectious diseases.  At present the position is that nursing staff shortage is not a cause of non-use of any of these beds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that the Deputy has nurse tutors in mind, the following is the position with regard to them:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Clinical Tutors</i>.  This is a relatively new grade and formal training is not yet available here.  Some tutors who qualified as clinical tutors abroad are employed in Dublin hospitals.  An Bord Altranais are at present considering the introduction of a formal course here to meet needs.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Registered Tutors</i>.  There is some shortage of such tutors due mainly to the decision by An Bord Altranais to increase from 1/80 to 1/40 th the ratio of registered tutors to trainee nurses and to some difficulties in attracting a sufficient number of suitable candidates to take the course. University College, Dublin and An Bord Altranais, with my encouragement, have been and are taking steps to secure a greater number of suitable candidates for the course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is a shortage, would the Minister not think it might be advantageous to provide a greater incentive by paying the full fees and the educational expenses?  The total educational expenses of any nurse who wants to go on to tutor level or gain a diploma are pretty heavy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>The recruitment of permanent dispensary doctors has been terminated in view of the approaching commencement of the choice of doctor scheme.</P>
      <P>The new scheme will eliminate dispensary boundaries with the result that present dispensary doctors may serve a wider area than under the dispensary system.  Private general practitioners will also be eligible to participate in the scheme and thus patients in general will have a wider choice of doctor. Eligible persons in Ballinlough dispensary district will be able to apply for registration with any doctor residing within seven miles who participates in the scheme.</P>

This complaint will be dealt with shortly.  If the Deputy will let me have details of any specific complaints which he has in mind I will have them investigated.</P>

      <P>A claim for a retirement pension from the person is under examination in my Department at present and a decision will be given as soon as possible.  In December, 1971, he applied for home assistance and was refused by the local assistance authority which, after investigation, was not satisfied that the person's means are as stated in the Deputy's question.  As the Deputy is aware, the granting or refusal of home assistance is a matter entirely for the local public assistance authority and I am precluded by law from directing the giving of home assistance in a particular case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what steps have been <Col N="1829" /> taken by him to release money from the 1972-73 Budget to improve the employment position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In October, 1971, the Government took a number of measures aimed at boosting the level of employment and output.  These measures included the allocation of an extra £20 million for spending under the public capital programme in the present financial year.  In January last, following a review of the position by the Government, the Taoiseach announced certain further measures to stimulate economic activity, including an indication that the public capital programme for next year would show a further substantial increase and that capital allocations for that year could be drawn upon by Departments and other public bodies during the remainder of the present year ending on 31st March in order to get works going and stimulate activity in the economy right away.</P>
      <P>It is not yet possible to indicate the extent to which money from next year's capital programme will be needed under this arrangement to supplement the revised level of the 1971-72 capital programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that after the £20 million was allocated the unemployment position got worse and since the allocation of a second injection over a month ago the employment position is still getting worse, would it be fair to suggest that nothing has been done to put the money into circulation in order to relieve unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it certainly would not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is the unemployment situation would have got considerably worse if action had not been taken.  The rate of increase in unemployment has certainly slowed down considerably and, while I have not got the precise information the Deputy is seeking available, I can give him one example.  Out of the <Col N="1830" /> additional capital made available in October £1 million, as the Deputy will recall, was made available for houses and that enabled another 800 local authority houses to be started straight away in the current year throughout the country.  That is one example.</P>

      <P>With the Chair's permission I should like to reply to Deputy Murphy's suggestion that new factories be established in areas where he seems to think they are warranted. This seems also to carry the implication that existing factories in other areas such as Cork city would be closed down so that the pigs from his area now being handled in Cork city could be handled in his area.  I do not think this suggestion would be looked <Col N="1838" /> on favourably by anybody.  We want to reduce redundancies in the pig industry to a minimum and in order to do this a certain rationalisation in the industry is inescapable even though it is most unpalatable.</P>

      <P>Some time last year the Minister gave me a somewhat similar answer but the review never took place.  Will the Minister not now agree that the subsidy on milk has been increased quite recently and is it not only fair that the increase should be passed on to the island producers?  The amount involved would be relatively small.  Could the Minister say when this extra few pence will be provided for the island people, the smallest group of our farmers?</P>

      <P>I accept that the conditions under which the review is taking place this year varies somewhat from those of last year.  It is a continuing fact that the disposal of this island butter has been somewhat difficult and it has to be sold at a loss, but I accept Deputy Murphy's assertion also that this situation has altered somewhat in recent months and that this would argue for sympathetic consideration of his request.</P>

      <P>The soft drinks industry is at present excluded from the re-equipment and modernisation grant scheme administered by the IDA.  The industry was also excluded from the adaptation grant scheme formerly administered by An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason for the exclusion of the industry is that there was strong evidence at the time the decision was taken that the industry would not be susceptible to import competition.  It had been decided that capital grants for adaptation and modernisation of industry should be concentrated on the industrial sectors which were likely <Col N="1841" /> to meet import competition in free trade conditions.</P>
    <P>The Soft Drink and Beer Bottlers' Association have made representations to the IDA to the effect that changes in the soft drinks industry, particularly in regard to distribution methods, leave the industry open to import competition and these representations are at present under active consideration by the IDA.</P>

      <P>The only observation I can make is that the figure covers the last six-month period with which we can deal, July to December of last year. The finalisation of projects has depended to a large extent on our satisfactory negotiations for entry to the EEC.  This has accounted for the falling off in the actual finalisation of projects in recent times.  This situation depended to a great extent on the capacity of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to negotiate for the maintenance of the tax free incentive.</P>

      <P>One of the attractive features about Irish location for foreign industrial promoters is the fact that we have duty-free access to the British market.  With Britain a member of the European Economic Community the six existing members will gain duty-free access to the British market for their industrial goods and to that extent this country will not have the same attraction for investors from <Col N="1845" /> these countries that it has at present. On the other hand, if Ireland becomes a member we will gain duty-free access to the much larger European market and this will provide an attraction for investors from all countries, both within the enlarged Community and elsewhere looking for a base for factory and industrial development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I said that in replying to the debate I found it most convenient to go down through the contributions made by the various Deputies and to try to deal specifically with them.  I had dealt with the contribution made by Deputy Donegan speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. Deputy O'Leary opened his remarks by quoting from paragraph 4, page 7, of the first monthly report of the National Prices Commission, November, 1971, the following sentence: &ldquo;In the field of price control there are no miracles.&rdquo; The Deputy said he agreed with this. Had he quoted the whole paragraph he would have been saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the field of price control, there are no miracles.  Prices must bear some relation to the costs of production. Of the main items of costs, the prices of imported materials and indirect taxes lie wholly beyond our influence as a Commission.  The same is true of wages and salaries. When an application for a price increase reaches us, increases in these have already occurred and are <Col N="1872" /> generally a main reason for the application.  To the extent that we succeed in moderating the rise in prices, we will help to moderate the rate of inflation in future.</P>
    <P>This is a straightforward statement of fact made by this commission which I appointed, and which I appointed on the recommendation of the trade unions, of the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Federation of Trade Associations and the Irish Housewives' Association.  This commission is headed by Professor Ryan as an independent chairman.  That indicates the present position in relation to the effectiveness of price control.  Deputy O'Connell also quoted from that paragraph and read into it something that certainly was not intended:</P>
    <P>When an application for a price increase reaches us increases in these have already occurred.</P>
    <P>From reading that paragraph he was under the impression that at the stage when the application was made to the Prices Commission, the commission conceded that the price increase had already taken place.  Of course this is not the case when one reads the sentence in the context of the paragraph. I have to assume that Deputy O'Leary read the paragraph in its entirely and, therefore, despite being mindful of all the constituent factors involved in the submission of a recommendation from the National Prices Commission for the conceding of a price increase to a manufacturer, he went on to say at column 1464, volume 258, of the Official Report for 9th February, 1972:</P>
    <P>There is a mystery as to why this Government and the Minister remain utterly inactive in the face of price increases which are eating up wage gains.  No effort was made to stem the tide of rising prices and it would take a great deal of effort now to correct the situation and to damp down prices.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the paragraph in question was subscribed to by the trade union movement itself. Further on, in paragraph 11 of that report, the National Prices Commission say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1873" /> Each notice of intention to increase prices is passed to us and we must indicate whether the increase proposed should be accepted in whole or in part, or subjected to detailed examination.  Unless the increase proposed is to be subjected to detailed examination, it may be put into effect one month after the date upon which all the particulars required in the notice of intent are received by the Prices Division of the Department.  In any case where we recommend an increase less than that proposed, we think it desirable that the firm concerned should have the right to ask that its case be submitted to detailed examination.  If a detailed examination is made, the Commission may recommend to the Minister that a report should be published.</P>
    <P>This indicates the rounds to which the National Prices Commission go, on the one hand, to investigate the application and, on the other hand, to endeavour to do justice to the manufacturer who is making the application.  I found that before the National Prices Commission were created the Prices Section of my Department came in for a great deal of abuse from both sides, from the manufacturer who was making the application for an increase&mdash;being critical of the delay and of the detailed way in which the Prices Section of the Department entered into each application and the extremely thorough manner in which they investigated all aspects of it&mdash;and from the public for allowing the increase to take place. The same type of criticism has been levelled at this Bill in relation to the question of the Executive taking over functions and interfering too much in the application of control.</P>
    <P>The impression all through any debate on price control is that on the one hand, spokesmen here in the House almost invariably, naturally, follow the popular line of insisting that there are not sufficient price controls and that prices are allowed to increase without sufficient justification.  The blame for this is placed on the inefficiency of the Establishment, on the inefficiency of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Minister.  On the other hand, when we <Col N="1874" /> have speeches made by people who are endeavouring to oppose something in this Bill which proposes to give power to the Department to control service charges and professional fees, the attack is made on those bureaucrats, those faceless members of the Executive who are interfering with the lawful operation of the professional organisations.  I have to suggest that this is completely unjustified criticism.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his contribution Deputy O'Leary summarised in a few words the purpose of the exercise from his point of view.  He knows that, if one bangs away and criticises the Government and the Minister in regard to inflation, and the apparently ineffective measures to control inflation and, if one hits at it strongly enough and often enough, one can undermine confidence in the Government and in the Minister concerned.  Deputy M. O'Leary gave the whole show away when he said, as reported at column 1468, volume 258 of the Official Report for Wednesday, 9th February, 1972:</P>
    <P>...the Minister would do well to recall the last general election in Britain when a Conservative Premier won an election that was to become known as the shopping-bag election. That was the approach which proved effective for that Premier when he succeeded in beating a superior government.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that Deputy M. O'Leary should be now trying to emulate the Tory Party in Britain in endeavouring to bring down a superior government by his attack on this Bill.</P>

      <P>In fairness to him, Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan said he was speaking as a person with a vested interest in the legal profession.  He started his contribution by saying, and again I am quoting from column 1469 of the same volume:</P>
      <P>It is a Bill that will operate to effect justice as between one section of the community and another.</P>
      <P>He made that straightforward statement of fact.  That is what I believe the Bill will do.  He said it before going on to object to one specific section of the Bill.  His objection was to the power I propose to take to control charges for professional services.  He said he did not believe that the legal profession in general should be at liberty to charge any fees they wished. Deputy Enright and Deputy Cooney made pretty much the same contribution to the debate as Deputy Fitzpatrick, and my remarks can be taken as covering their contributions also.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said that the changes which will be brought about if this Bill is enacted will have the effect of putting the legal profession completely in the claws of the Executive. He felt this was what this Bill proposes to do.  This is a Bill which he described earlier as operating to effect justice as between one section of the community and another.  He said he would prefer to see the present system operating under which the charges of the legal profession are controlled and regulated by various committees on which the Judiciary and the legal profession are represented and in respect of which the Minister for Justice has a very substantial say.  He went on to say that, if this Bill were enacted, the legal profession would cease to be independent and would find themselves under the control of the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that it is far-fetched for the Deputy to imply that, because power is given to a Government Minister to control legal fees, the Government and the Minister are thereby in <Col N="1876" /> a position to influence the opinions or the behaviour of the legal profession. I would go so far as to say that it is a reflection on the legal profession as a whole to assume that their opinions or their behaviour could be influenced in any way by the granting or withholding of an increase in their fees. To say that they are a buffer between the Executive and the ordinary citizen seems to me to exaggerate the position, considering the large area of legal business transacted by the profession to which the State is not a party.</P>
    <P>It may be all right for members of the legal profession such as Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy Cooney and Deputy Enright to make this claim and to suggest that, if the Executive endeavoured to interfere with the fees being paid, the repercussions on the general public could be most undesirable. If I were to say that by assuming control for the influencing of the rate of fees charged by the legal profession I would, therefore, be able to take control of the legal profession and dictate the manner in which they pursue their cases, the first people to rise and challenge this statement would be the Deputies who spoke the other way yesterday.  I would go further and say that if I were to make that statement they would be fully justified in making such an attack on me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said that justice will be administered in the courts with the dice loaded in favour of the Executive and against the citizen because, as he said, the Executive were going to interfere with the fees payable to members of the legal profession. We should not blame the legal profession for endeavouring to hold on to the situation of voluntary control that is at present exercised by their various committees.  I understand there are as many as five different committees.  There is the statutory committee under the 1881 Act which comprises the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, a senior judge of the Supreme Court and the President of the Incorporated Law Society.  They fix certain of the fees chargeable in most non-contentious matters.  There are other similar groupings such as the Superior Courts Rules <Col N="1877" /> Committee, the Registration of Title Rules Committee, the District Courts Rules Committee and the Circuit Court Rules Committee.  All of these committees are committees in respect of which the Incorporated Law Society are represented.  It is a bit too farfetched to suggest that by interfering with the fixing of the charges by any or all of these committees we would interfere with the independence of the Judiciary functioning in this State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde felt that charges by the medical profession should not be interfered with or that it might be almost impossible to interfere with the charges in the medical profession.  He said he was always of the opinion that in regard to fees the solicitors have always had a much easier passage than the other professions in so far as they handle the money.  I know there was an interruption at that stage from Deputy Cooney to say that was a rather sinister implication.  Deputy Esmonde said that in the peculiar circumstances in which the legal profession operate there must be a great temptation on their part to overcharge.  He also said that he failed to see how legislation of this nature could control professional charges.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed by the legal profession that they were, perhaps, the first group of people to introduce voluntary restraint on their charges.  I do not think the case made by any of the Deputies yesterday was sufficient to justify the exclusion of the legal profession from this Bill.  The contributions made had the effect of making me more convinced that there was something here which should be looked into.</P>
    <P>In backing up Deputy Fitzpatrick's case, Deputy Cooney criticised section 7 of the Bill, the section that gives me the power to transfer by order the function of control to other Ministers.  He said that this was an arrangement which was often overlooked by the House even though the House, in fact, has the control.  In this case the Deputy was referring to the possible use of this power by me as Minister for Industry and Commerce to pass over to the Minister for Justice the power of controlling legal charges.  He attacked that <Col N="1878" /> whereas he had already defended the present situation, for which he was speaking.  In fairness to him, he said there were certain aspects of the charges for transfer of house property, deeds, referred to by Deputy Tunney, where it was quite possible improvements could be effected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney criticised me for taking power under section 7 of this Bill and at the same time he defended the arrangement whereby the statutory body under the Solicitors Remuneration Act, 1881, had power to make orders for presentation to the Oireachtas in relation to the increase in legal fees, to which I have already referred.  That statutory body is comprised of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, a senior judge of the Supreme Court and the President of the Incorporated Law Society. The Deputy defended the right of that statutory body to make an order increasing fees but, on the other hand, criticised my assumption of the right under section 7 of the Bill.  The case made by spokesmen here on behalf of the legal profession certainly did not change my belief that the power that I propose to assume in this regard should be assumed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde, having reiterated what had been said by so many other Deputies in, if you like, welcoming the Bill, went on to say that he was glad that the Government had seen fit to accept in a small way the advice that they had been getting from those benches in the last 15 years.  This is merely an echo of what Deputy Donegan nearly always says about anything that I introduce, which almost invariably is good.  We have this sort of statement made and reiterated on the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>Apart from the discussion on legal fees, the main debate was on section 3 dealing with the control of prices of new houses.  Over all, there was general welcome for this.  This is understandable because of the opinion generally held that too much money is made in some cases from dealings in house property.  Deputy Cooney made the point that he was disappointed that the Bill did not cover secondhand houses, as he described them.  It is very difficult to know how to describe houses that are not newly-built houses. Deputy Cooney found fault with the Bill because it did not contain power whereby the Minister could effectively control houses other than new houses Deputy Belton, who was the last to speak before I got in last night, in his own way dealt with this matter effectively in suggesting that it would be quite impracticable to bring secondhand houses within the scope of the Prices Acts because of the vast differences from the point of view of age, size, condition, location, <i>et cetera</i> and because of the fact that a house could pass through a number of hands in a relatively short time.  In addition, as I see it, the control of the price of secondhand houses would also interfere with the principle of sale by auction <Col N="1880" /> of such houses and this would be undesirable.</P>
      <P>In order to control the price of houses it would be desirable to have some idea of what the price should be and in the case of secondhand houses there would be no base to work from to establish such a price.  In relation to new houses there is a specific base to work from.  It would be impossible to operate price control in relation to secondhand houses.</P>
      <P>There were comments made in the House in relation to previous prices legislation and criticism was expressed in relation to the non-operation of previous prices legislation.  I would be against introducing legislation that would prove to be non-effective.  This is one of the reasons why I looked seriously at the possibility of assuming control over other than new houses in this Bill before excluding it from section 3.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the necessity where price increases are sought of publishing a notice in the press.  He inferred that most manufacturing companies continuously hive off huge lumps of profit and suggested that there was no reason why the increases could not be taken out of profits.  Again I quote from the January report of the National Prices Commission, paragraphs 8 and 9, in this regard because it is rather important that people should not be allowed to think that an effort has not been made in the past by the Prices Section of my Department and is not being made at present by the National Prices Commission to prevail upon manufacturers to carry increased overheads out of profits.  Paragraph 8 of the report reads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the cases on which we have made recommendations, it was relatively seldom that cost increases were disallowed because they could not be substantiated.  The proportion disallowed was generally greatest with wages and salaries, mainly because price increases could be granted only to compensate for increases in money incomes that conformed to the Government guidelines.  The cost increases that were disallowed must <Col N="1881" /> be covered by increases in productivity or met from profits.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell never suggested that increases might be covered by productivity but he did refer to the profits aspect.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>Given the circumstances of the applicant firms, we believe that this is as much as can reasonably be expected in the year or so ahead. Cost increases which are not met from higher productivity and efficiency must be met from higher prices; it was only in a small minority of the cases that came before us that it would have been economically justifiable (or even possible) to meet these cost increases from profits.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 reads:</P>
    <P>In blunt terms, increases in money incomes that are matched by higher productivity in the firms that pay them are in a real sense earned. Higher money incomes that cannot be (or are not) matched by higher productivity mean higher prices, if the firms are to survive and if employment is to be maintained.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that that is a report of the National Prices Commission which is made up of six people of whom two are members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and one is nominated by the Irish Housewives' Association.  That brings out quite clearly that there are not unjustified increases in prices conceded by me as Minister following the recommendations of the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>Another thing I should like to reiterate is that if one examines the three reports of the National Prices Commission that have already been issued, and all the increases that have been conceded over the past number of years, one can see that very seldom do the increases that are conceded measure up to what was originally applied for and which was seen by the manufacturer as justified at the time of application.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney welcomed the effort to control house prices and dealt specifically with house prices in Dublin <Col N="1882" /> city and its environs.  He attacked the legal charges on the sale of houses on newly developed land.  He most effectively established the necessity for the introduction of this legislation.  I hope the trade union movement will take cognisance of his recommendations to them in regard to what they might consider as their contribution to the house building programme.  As against that it is not specifically relevant to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright found something to be recommended in every section of the Bill.  He made specific reference to the necessity for taking power to control charges for services rendered in connection with insurance.  He was not aware at the time that power was being taken in this Bill to do so.  With the exception of my taking power to control services of a professional character he found something to recommend in every section and then finished up by saying that the powers I was taking were too sweeping.  I wish he had elaborated a little on what he meant by this because the only thing he criticised was the power to control professional fees and the power to transfer that, under section 7, to the appropriate Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating said that the Bill was a window-dressing operation and that it could only be compared with the Minister using a fig-leaf to cover his nakedness.  That indicated that he did not take the Bill too seriously.  He gave lip service to the prevention of inflation but continued to speak encouragingly about unlimited wage demands.  One of the messages that will have to be brought home, and it is brought home month after month by the National Prices Commission, is that if there are increased costs there will be increased prices.  It suits some speakers to say, as Deputy O'Connell did, that we should have a price freeze for three months or six months and see whether the demands for increased wages and salaries would stay put, but this, of necessity, must be a two-way arrangement.  Deputy Keating, in looking at this fig-leaf, claimed that I was not taking a number of powers which, in fact, I am taking.  He claimed that some firms and importers are taking <Col N="1883" /> far too much profit and that I had no power under the Bill to interfere in any way with the rate of profit being taken by those people.  I would refer him to section 4 (1) (a) where I am taking power to do this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton welcomed the Bill on the one hand and criticised it from the point of view of handing over all the power to the Civil Service.  This is not the case because in the case of prices which I control at present I am guided by the recommendations made to me by the National Prices Commission. This same commission can continue to act in this capacity for any other Minister to whom powers under this Bill, when enacted, may be transferred. So far as I am aware all the commission's recommendations have been accepted.  Usually their recommendations are acceptable to me.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Belton asked whether I propose to control hotel prices and the additional charges made in hotels. I refer the Deputy to section 2 (1) (b) of the Bill.  The Deputy also referred to insurance loans and felt that I had not power to control them.  I refer the Deputy also to section 2 (1) (d).  The Deputy also referred to some ideal system followed by Mussolini in Italy. I am not sure whether the Deputy was recommending that I should follow Mussolini's example in this regard.  The idea does not appeal to me.  The Deputy did, in effect, reply to Deputy Cooney with his observations in relation to the control of secondhand houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Belton also suggested as an alternative to price control an equalisation profit tax on businesses.  He felt it would be a penal taxation which the Minister for Finance could operate. If I or the Minister for Finance endeavoured to introduce legislation for such a tax there would be opposition from both sides of the House.  Such extra profit would have been extorted from the public, and while it would be an ideal way for the Minister for Finance to collect money it would not seem to be a suitable way to do so.  It might prove a buffer for a bad manager who could increase prices without increasing his profits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1884" /> The Bill has been welcomed generally in this House.  I recommend it as being effective.  It gives the Minister for Industry and Commerce greater power to control prices.  I cannot say that with the passage of this Bill there will not be further increases in prices, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have greater control over sectors over which he had no power previously.  It is up to the Minister to endeavour to prevent further price increases. There have not been many objections from any part of the House to the powers being taken but some exception has been taken to the control of professional fees.  Deputy Donegan felt that such control might even backfire and result in increased rather than decreased professional fees. I do not accept that point.  It is necessary to have power to control all prices and professional fees.  Methods of control will be determined in consultation with the interested parties.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week in discussing this Estimate I spoke of the manner in which the Government had dealt with the development and encouragement <Col N="1885" /> of our commercial fisheries, of our inshore fisheries and deep-sea fisheries.  I indicated that we need very substantial boosts if fisheries on a commercial basis are to survive and, indeed, increase in the future.</P>
      <P>It is all too easy to say that we require three very definite things if this is to be done.  We need fishery training in a proper and adequate manner; we need boats and gear available to the fishermen on terms they can afford and are able to meet; we need landing points, shelters and harbours available to our fishermen.  These are elementary ingredients.  There is a further real necessity for adequate and profitable marketing.  I do not intend to discuss the point here but merely underline that, if we are to join the Common Market, with all the advantages which we are told about, we may have to meet new and serious competition. We will have to move swiftly and faster than we have been prone to do over the years in which we have been tinkering with the fishing industry as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts have been made to provide boats, craft and gear.  They may be the easiest to supply of the three factors I have mentioned.  We have been doing our best about the training of fishermen. We appear to have made some breakthrough by the establishment of the special marine school we are now about to start building in Donegal.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he would clarify in his reply whether the manner in which he adverted to this school and its utilisation was rather understating its value for the future. In his introductory speech the Parliamentary Secretary did not seem to give any great importance to this in the scheme of things. That would appear to be what I described last week as a one-year course operation.  I hope this will not be the case.  I rather expect it will not be.  I hope there will be greater opportunities for education in this respect.  The Greencastle school is in course of erection and now is the time to co-ordinate all the facilities available in the regional college of technology in Letterkenny with Greencastle. There should be discussion <Col N="1886" /> between the Department of Education, the Fisheries Branch and the authorities in the Letterkenny college with the object of co-ordinating all the facilities. These discussions should take place before the two institutions get set in their ways.  They are in close proximity to one another and it should be possible to have the fullest co-operation and co-ordination between the two.  I know that the college in Letterkenny is very anxious for this.  The two schools should complement one another.</P>
    <P>There is rumour of a very big development in this direction in Cork.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to be particularly alert to what the Department of Education is thinking about lest we might finish up with a school in Greencastle which would really be nothing more nor less than a skipper's ticket issuing operation. That would negative the whole idea of Greencastle as the forerunner of other such institutions.  If there is to be a second school of the type envisaged in Greencastle, Cork would probably be the best centre.  There is no reason why such a school should not be established in Galway.  As far as my recollection goes, there was talk of Cork and/or Galway being developed as further centres.  We would all welcome further opportunities for the education and training of our fishermen but I believe the Department of Education has quite enough on its hands in other directions without taking on this kind of education as well.  Up to this the Department of Education never did anything about this particular type of training and I doubt if it would be sufficiently well equipped to provide such training.</P>
    <P>I said something the last day about the lack of harbour and shelter facilities around the coast.  As I said then, I do not know which of three things should come first&mdash;training for the fishermen, availability of harbours or availability of boats.  Actually, all three should move ahead simultaneously. Where there is a concentration of boats and fishermen on our very exposed west coast the first priority would be the improvement of harbours, shelters and landing facilities. <Col N="1887" /> I did not mention anything like all the places mentioned by the survey team where facilities were promised by me on behalf of the Government away back in 1968.  That is a promise on which the Government subsequently welshed.  I had reached Ballybay in the north west.  I had not referred to Gweedore, Corransport and Inishboffin.  There has been some activity in Burtonport but the rock on which a coaster sat a week ago is still there.  That obstruction will have to be removed and all the other works planned will have to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Further down the coast the only important development has been that carried out at Killala.  That of course has a history of its own, a unique history within the general framework of the Department of Finance sanctions. They are not drawn out of the hat, but it is certainly the nearest thing to it that Killala should have got away at the time it did, while other places, which got promises at the same time, have not since been even mentioned. However it got away; it is a pity that more did not do so at that time so that we would have had a little more activity, a little more safety and encouragement to our fishermen and to our potential fishermen to get into the fishing business or to extend the activities in which they are already engaged.  It would help our off-shore fisheries and do a better job for them all around the country.</P>
    <P>The same sad story works, in conjunction with the non-carrying out of the survey team's recommendations, right down along into the west Cork coast.  Without appearing, as I may have done last week, to talk solely in this regard in relation to my own constituency coast, I would again emphasise that the survey team's proposals and recommendations as they apply to all the west coast are urgently needed and cannot and should not in any circumstances be allowed to be put off any longer, that the Government should either get on with this job of putting up these shelters and carrying out the improvement of smaller harbours or give up the ghost altogether and tell the fishermen that there <Col N="1888" /> is no future for them, that they do not believe in their operations and are not going to back them in respect of harbour facilities, boats, gear or anything else.  We would be only honest in doing that if that is what we have in mind rather than codding them along that we have a high regard for them, for the potential of their industry and for the future there is for it.  We are preaching this and giving lip service to it but doing next to nothing about making possible its achievement.  In the interim, while we can show an improvement and an increase in our landings and our fishing activities, this is not likely to continue unless there is a real input financially by the Government under all the various heads of boats, gear, harbours and the education of the fishermen of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the protection of our fisheries within our limits.  Whether they be the limits of today or the limits of tomorrow in EEC conditions, we still have a job of work to do which we have not been doing over the years, that is, the job of protecting that which we regard as our own fishery waters.  There have been some purchases made recently by way of replacement of ships or protection vessels and this I regard as an encouragement.  On the other hand, having got what we have at the moment, new craft, and even allowing that we get what is now promised, we still will have got only to the stage at which we were perhaps 20 years ago in the number of craft available and really small cover that small number of three or four craft can give.  We need much more if we seriously believe that protection is part of our operations at all.  We are not doing anything other than a hit or miss job at its very best, even with four vessels, when and if they are afloat and if they are capable of being manned, about which very serious doubt is being expressed.  Even if that were so, we cannot by any stretch of the imagination hold this out as a really serious attempt to protect our inshore fisheries. I know that the Department go along with me in the idea that we need much more protection if we are to do it seriously at all.  I would advocate that they continue their pressure <Col N="1889" /> on the Government to go in a bigger and better way into this protection of our fisheries, because all the other things which I and they advocate and have been seeking over the years in relation to increasing our fishing fleet will only tend to highlight the lack of protection and indeed will only be defeating our efforts in extending, on the one hand, and failing to provide protection, on the other.  This is something which must be continually pressed on the Government as an absolute necessity.</P>
    <P>There is then this very serious matter of the pollution of our rivers and lakes, which is getting away somewhat from the commercial sea fishing which I have been talking about.  While we talk about the laws we have not got in relation to the protection of rivers, there are laws and regulations in various ways which, if operated to the fullest extent, would go a long way towards preventing a deterioration of the situation in regard to pollution of these waters.  It is not good enough to sit around and bemoan the fact that we need new laws or regulations because we cannot do this or that when there is so much we can do that is not being done and when our waters are being further polluted in various ways by various agencies, all no doubt in the name of progress but of a very doubtful kind.</P>
    <P>Our inland fisheries, and particularly our salmon fisheries, bring me to the situation of the Foyle Fisheries.  This matter has been rather a bone of contention down the years which was to some degree abated by the establishment of the Foyle Fisheries Commission, but I am sure that nobody realises better than the Department that it is not a perfect answer and indeed perhaps no perfect answer may ever be found for the whole problem of the Foyle Fisheries and its administration. I would, however, commend them to continue along the way they have been going, of trying to weed out the people holding licences in other people's names, people holding licences who in fact do not need them and who do not themselves participate in fishing salmon in the Foyle and who do not need the revenue they may be earning <Col N="1890" /> from salmon fishing in the Foyle.  We have this situation of the duplication and multiplication of licences that are still operating there under false names.</P>
    <P>I know the difficulties of finding out who they are and weeding out those that are not really in the category which could be regarded as fishermen&mdash;but at the same time there are still a number there year in and year out&mdash;and finding the few and getting rid of them and replacing them with people who genuinely have been and are fishing as crew members for a good number of years, on whose family circumstances the income they can derive from the short season on the Foyle can have a very great impact. I suggest that we pursue this line as vigorously as we can, continuing to do it year in and year out and perhaps we will weed out the multiple licence owners, the faceless people, who have been doing this hogging of the fisheries there and on the sweat of the fishermen who operate the boats and carry the licence in name in many cases but do not own the gear or the boat or get a revenue from it other than a wage or a percentage of the catch.  This is something which I would urge on the Department and on their representative on the commission, that they would pursue that with the greatest of vigour.  While it might not mean a great deal to a great number of people, there are many of our fishermen along the Foyle who would benefit if this course were pursued and licences were distributed to a greater degree than they have been up to now.</P>
    <P>On the subject of pollution, when an industry is about to be established there may be ten sites on which it could be located but we often find that, for some perverse reason, it is eventually located near a stream which, perhaps, feed into a very valuable salmon fishery or a good fishing river or lake. Anybody who raises a voice in protest at that stage will be branded by some people, no doubt for their own purposes, as a sort of traitor to the locality for doing so.  People who stand up to this sort of thing are apt to be regarded as traitors or cranks and this has been a feature of a number of cases in the past.  This is a pity because we are not <Col N="1891" /> so overburdened with new industrial developments involving a great quantity of damaging effluent that we are short of sites to cater adequately for such industry without polluting valuable fisheries which, once destroyed, may be capable of restoration only at extremely high cost, if at all.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should endeavour to keep himself and his Department informed, even unofficially, of the development and establishment or proposed establishment of any industry, particularly any industry that might produce damaging effluent and, in the long-term interest of fisheries, he should take his stand and see to it that those who can take action locally are properly informed of their rights in the matter and in regard to what anybody can do to prevent damage before it takes place.  The Parliamentary Secretary could fulfil a very useful role in this matter if he helped to advise the local people who are fighting the cause of anti-pollution by giving them information and perhaps the results of research that may be available to him but not to the local people interested in preserving waters and fisheries.  In his own way he could be usefully engaged in encouraging watchfulness in regard to damage that could be avoided even in circumstances where the establishment of an industry is imminent.  We are not overburdened with industries of this type nor have we a lack of suitable alternative sites.  If it comes to a point where an industry can only be so located that it will interfere with fisheries and will pollute waters we must then carefully weigh the immediate profit to us and to the economy against the long-term damage that may be caused to fisheries or water resources and ultimately to the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not hold with those who think that any industry must be accommodated regardless of the damage it may cause to fisheries or water resources. If it must do damage and if that damage is great such an industry should not be considered because the industry may be of short duration but the water resources are there for all time provided we take care of them <Col N="1892" /> and we must do this if we are to survive. The fish life and the benefits associated with it can also exist indefinitely compared with, perhaps, the short-term advantage of having an industry which may be promising at present but which nobody can say will be there in five years time.  In considering any such crux we must bear in mind the long-term advantages of clean water and fisheries; these cannot be set aside in any circumstances for what may be merely a short-term economic advantage.  The balance must always lie in favour of the certainty of the benefit of preserving and conserving water resources and fish life.</P>
    <P>While some potential industrialists are as concerned as any of us may be regarding the possible damage the siting of an industry might have on fisheries or in regard to pollution, there are others who are not so concerned. They will use the argument that the prevention of pollution by purifying the effluent will be very costly and this cost will be boosted beyond all reason by such people, who may be our nextdoor neighbour, may be black, white or red or come from the other side of the world.  You get some who are concerned to do no damage and others who will use their supposed better knowledge of the industry which they propose to set up to boost the cost if plant to deal with the effluent is mentioned or insisted on, and will use their arguments in a blackmailing manner to suggest that if this is insisted on there will be no factory or industry.</P>
    <P>I am sure many of us have met such people.  We should beware of them and be careful that they do not stampede us into accepting harmful industry which would have an output of damaging effluent into our watercourses.  We must protect ourselves against them and if necessary tell them that if they do not like things as they are here they can take themselves and their potential industry wherever they wish.  In most cases you will probably find at that stage that they will go to the extent of taking the necessary steps to combat any damage the effluent might cause if discharged untreated.</P>
    <P>Now that our accession to the EEC is imminent we must ensure that the necessary finances be made available <Col N="1893" /> for urgent operations in regard to the development of fisheries.  There must be provision for fleets and gear.  Potential fishermen must be made aware of the attractions of the fisherman's life. Above all, better landing facilities at smaller harbours and inlets along the west coast must be provided, while, at the same time, extensions to our major fishery harbours must be accelerated. These improvements must be carried out before the existing facilities become overtaxed.  A massive job must be undertaken.  For far too long not enough has been done in regard to the development of this industry.  There must be positive thinking on the matter now and there must be a realisation of the vast potential of the industry. We have an extensive coast line and some of the best fishing grounds in the world, but action must be taken now to exploit these facilities to the full because others who we now purport to join in Europe will have access to fisheries that up to now we regarded as being exclusively ours.  These other people will not have much regard for preservation or conservation, as has been shown by the manner in which they have denuded their own coastal waters.  Time for us has practically run out in so far as the exploitation of commercial sea fishing is concerned. But if we are really enthusiastic and believe in the vast potential of the industry and if we only devoted a fraction of the energy and money that we provide rather freely for the attraction of other employment-providing enterprises to fishing, the benefits we could reap would far outweigh anything that we have reaped from other types of industry.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are many other Deputies who share my sentiments in this regard and I promise the Parliamentary Secretary that anything he tries to do to extend the industry will have abundant support in the House. This should strengthen his resolve and his opportunity to impress on the Government and particularly on the Minister for Finance, the need for the immediate development of the industry.  Money must be provided now; otherwise it may be too late.  Either we grasp the opportunities now or we tell the fishermen <Col N="1894" /> that the industry will not be expanded and that there will be no break through to this kind of fishing.  I hope there will be a positive approach to this question.  The development of this industry will be of benefit to the nation as a whole but, in particular, it will be of benefit to the west coast. In this way we could revitalise those areas from which there has been much emigration down through the years and in which there is so much unemployment.</P>
    <P>This particular industry could be the saviour of our country.  If we continue to allow opportunities of revitalising the West to pass, slowly but surely the paralysis that results from lack of employment and the depression that results from emigration will extend and we will finish up as one big semi-suburban area covering about the area of the old Pale.  The day that we reach that stage we will have ceased not only to be a country with any future but we will have ceased to be a nation at all.  Scarce as are our opportunities, if we continue to neglect them while at the same time we continue to overbuild, overdevelop and haphazardly develop the east coast by denuding the west coast, we will pay the price in the end. As I see it, neither coast can have any future without the other.  Our greatest opportunity lies in the fishing industry, an industry that we can build up without having to go to any part of the world for help.  The development of this industry could do more to revitalise the west coast than anything else we have been fiddling at down through the years.  Our real hope for that area lies in the development of fishing and also in the development of the tourist industry.  Very often the words &ldquo;Save the West&rdquo; are trotted out glibly, more as an aspiration rather than an ambition.</P>
    <P>I know from experience that the Parliamentary Secretary will have the help, the vast knowledge and the dedication of the staff of the fisheries section in any efforts he may make in this respect.  No doubt, also, within this House he will have ample evidence of support to urge the powers that be in the Government to <Col N="1895" /> provide the aid that is required urgently.  We must think of the development of fisheries as being something greater than we have ever tackled before.  The Parliamentary Secretary has the opportunity of becoming the one person to do more than any other towards creating a future for the population along the western seaboard.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of Deputy Blaney's speech but it surprises me that when he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries he did not give the fishing industry the capital injection that it required.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to see the Deputy is leaving the House.  However, it is good to see that he is now converted to the idea that the fishing industry is a vital part of our heritage. The Government have done nothing to improve that industry during the years. So far as the Estimate for this year is concerned, it shows a decrease over the Estimate for last year.  That will give us an idea of the amount of money the Government are injecting into the industry although we will face all kinds of competition in the near future.</P>
      <P>While we are discussing competition, it is proper to discuss how and why the Minister for Foreign Affairs sold out our fishery rights to the Europeans at Brussels last month.  The House is due an explanation.  It has now come to light that Norway has got special terms. Who was to blame for the sell-out of the Irish fisheries?  Was it the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the fishermen who accompanied him on his trip to Brussels?  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us whether the Minister sold out the fishing industry on the advice of the two fishermen with him or whether they advised him to be firm on the matter.  The public are entitled to know the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1896" /> On that fateful Sunday when our fisheries were sold out, one of those fishermen said on Radio Éireann that the Minister did a great day's work so far as they were concerned.  According to this man the Minister did the best he could.  I should like to know how Norway got special terms for her fishing industry.</P>
    <P>In this month's issue of the <i>Irish Skipper</i>, under the heading &ldquo;The Veto&rdquo;, the leading article states:</P>
    <P>On page 13 of this issue we print the section on fisheries from the Government's White Paper on Common Market membership.</P>
    <P>Like the official explanation of the negotiations which appeared in the January issue it is important reading.</P>
    <P>But amidst all the political speeches and handouts on the subject of our entry, very little has been said about the veto which the Six will continue to possess after actual membership.</P>
    <P>It is strange that the Parlamentary Secretary did not mention the word &ldquo;veto&rdquo; when he introduced his Estimate. The article continues:</P>
    <P>This veto virtually makes the new entrants second-class members, despite the impression we had been given.  For instance, when the review clause comes up before 1982, if a proposal is put forward by Ireland to preserve 12 miles for a further number of years, any of the Six original members can veto it.  This makes nonsense of the terms of the review clause as accepted by Ireland, Britain and Denmark.</P>
    <P>But Norway, which did not allow itself to be rushed in willy-nilly, has been promised special consideration.</P>
    <P>What was our hurry?</P>
    <P>This is a newspaper published by the fishermen and the leading article condemns utterly the Irish negotiators.  In order to clarify the matter we should know who sold out the industry&mdash;was it the Minister or the two officials who accompanied him?  I hope we will get a clear explanation on this point. Deputy Keating was quite correct when he said that the House is being <Col N="1897" /> deliberately misled.  The word &ldquo;veto&rdquo; was not mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary when he introduced the Estimate.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a general criticism regarding the delay in the publication of the annual report of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  This report is important so far as this debate is concerned because it contains the facts and figures of the operations of last year.  I hope I am not out of order in making the point that if every semi-State body adopted the line that reports would not be available to Deputies until after the Dáil debates we should not have any reliable information on which to base our discussions. It is time the House decided to set up an all-party committee to examine semi-State bodies if they are not prepared to make their reports available before a discussion in this House.  It would be most undesirable if other State bodies should deliberately withhold their reports so that Members of this House cannot debate them.  An all-Party committee should be set up to ensure that reports are available in adequate time before discussions take place in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not think that agriculture and fisheries should be together in one Department; the fisheries section should be incorporated within the Department of the Gaeltacht.  A number of years ago fisheries was amalgamated with the Department of Lands.  That Department passed fisheries to the Department of Agriculture.  Today we had a former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries speaking for 45 minutes, in addition to making a speech of 2½ hours duration last Thursday, but when he was Minister he did little or nothing for fisheries.  He confiscated boats from the unfortunate fishermen who could not keep up with their payments.  This is hypocrisy at its worst and Deputy Blaney should be honest enough to acknowledge that more boats were confiscated when he was Minister than at any other time.  I would make a serious suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary that fisheries should be amalgamated with the Department of the Gaeltacht.  The fishing port of Killybegs is in the Gaeltacht.  Galway and <Col N="1898" /> Dingle are Gaeltacht areas and there are fishing ports there.  In Castletownbere the vast majority of the people have a good knowledge of the Irish language.  Dungarvan is another port which is in the Gaeltacht.  I hope it is not too late for the Parliamentary Secretary to come back to this House with a Supplementary Estimate giving much more capital for fisheries so that we can compete with the foreigners when they come in ten years time.</P>
    <P>The value of any new industry is judged by the number of men who are working in it.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary how many new men we have attracted to the fishing industry over the last 12 months, how many new crew men and new skippers. How many new skippers are there who are getting a boat for the first time? Admittedly, we have seen photographs in different newspapers of new trawlers arriving from Norway or of the new Dutch-built stern trawlers.  I want to know whether the people who are managing those trawlers are new skippers or old skippers getting a new boat.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not mentioned that at all in his report. I am beginning to think that a concerted effort is being made by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to squeeze the small man out of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy here knows that a new boat costs between £80,000 and £90,000 and that the fishermen must put down a 5 per cent deposit.  That is the approximate price of the new Dutch-built stern trawlers; the boats that are sold for £70,000 are only 60-foot trawlers.  Nevertheless, taking £70,000, if a new skipper wishes to acquire a boat he will have to find a deposit of £3,500?  It is man of 21, 22 or 23 years of age with a vocation for fishing find £3,500?  It is just not on as far as he is concerned. But it is on for the big businessmen, the new companies that are springing up around the coast, the new companies that are beginning to come in because of the generous grant allocation that is being made available because they can provide the initial deposit.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to mention names, but the Parliamentary Secretary knows <Col N="1899" /> the companies, and the directors of those companies are strong supporters of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Some of them are defeated candidates of the Fianna Fáil Party and some of them are big Taca men of the Fianna Fáil Party.  This is their golden handshake; they are getting a boat valued at £92,000 for a deposit of £4,500.</P>

      <P>I was speaking on the general problem of cigarette smoking when the debate was adjourned, and I suppose I ought to say a little bit more on this general subject although Deputy Dr. Browne's comments were most useful.  In examining the whole problem of smoking when we look at the various <Col N="1901" /> reports that have been published by the Royal College of Physicians, and in America, we see that those who smoke very few cigarettes a day are less liable to contract lung cancer, or the other diseases that have been mentioned in this House, than those who smoke a great many cigarettes. Of course, equally, keeping the cigarette in the mouth, inhaling all of the smoke, and the amount of the cigarette that is smoked from one end to the other, also vary the medical effects of cigarette smoking.</P>
      <P>Members of the House may not know that research is being done into growing tobacco with a lower tar and nicotine content.  I met a tobacco grower the other day who told me of the demand being made on him for tobacco leaf, and that he had been asked to specialise more in growing tobacco in such a way that in its maturity it will have less tar and nicotine. Long-term research is being done on this and experiments are being carried out on mixing a harmless compound with tobacco to see what the results will be.</P>
      <P>In the United States arrangements have been made for publication of the content of tar and nicotine in each of the well-known brands of cigarettes. That would be very difficult to do in this country at the moment because the tobacco in the cigarettes sold here may not necessarily have the same tar and nicotine content as in the brands of cigarettes sold under the same name in Great Britain.  Of course, many of them are corresponding, and then we have our own brands as well.  I merely mention this to show that there is continuing research into this whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some other research has been done which has now been published by the Royal College of Physicians but which is a warning to the very heavy cigarette smoker who, according to the statistics, is very likely to contract one of the other diseases, or to suffer from the disabilities of what might be described as chain smoking.  It has now been pretty well proved that to smoke cigarettes over the level of 40 to 60 a day&mdash; which is not very common, and I do not think it makes many profits for the <Col N="1902" /> tobacco companies&mdash;is to become addicted.  In other words, the body demands the cigarettes and the person has virtually no self-control.</P>
    <P>The experiment that was conducted was that of collecting a group of heavy smokers, who were also motor car drivers, and putting them in a motor simulator where they had to drive a vehicle indoors, watch television screens, avoid accidents, turn corners, and so forth.  One half of them were injected with nicotine and the other half with saline solution.  They were given packets of cigarettes and matches.  Those who were injected with saline solution smoked, I think, twice as many cigarettes during a period of an hour and a half as those who were injected with a nicotinic preparation. Of course, they were not told with which preparation they were injected. They were quite unconscious of whether they had received a shot of nicotine before the operation.  It seems to be quite clear from that experiment, that the very heavy smoker, like the alcoholic, has lost control of his consumption. Obviously there are exceptions to that.  I mention this in passing.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have tried to look at this whole problem as objectively as I can.  I have also to look at the problem of cigarettes in relation to other forms of drugs.  I still think it is better to begin with young people and ask them to grow up as healthy as they can, to avoid excessive alcohol drinking, to avoid taking drugs, and to avoid smoking.  In respect of older people, where it has been found extraordinarily difficult to get them to give up cigarette smoking, there is the alternative of alcohol which produces hallucinogenic effects and is a frightening scourge in this country, far the worst scourge we have.  We and the French have the worst record of alcoholism in Europe.  Another alternative is dangerous drugs concerning which we have taken as much action as we can.  The remainder of the steps to be taken are well advanced.</P>
    <P>There is also the enormous consumption of mild psychotrophic drugs of which Deputy Dr. Browne is well aware and about which there has been very little research as to their ultimate <Col N="1903" /> long-term effects.  I suppose I can illustrate this by quoting from Sir Derek Dunlop's Report for the Royal College of Surgeons in which he said that one hour out of every ten of sleep in Great Britain is now drug induced and that there were delivered to the population of England and Wales, some 50 million odd people, 14 million prescriptions of a well-known mild psychotrophic drug in a single year.  I think I had better not name it; it is well known to everybody.</P>
    <P>We will be able to get the figures for the induction of the milder psychotrophic drugs in this country arising from the medical card, choice of doctor, system and the computerised prescription list.  That is not to say we will know who is taking what drug. We will know the number of prescriptions for these mild psychotrophic drugs.  I already know reputable chemists who tell me that half of their prescriptions consist of two mild psychotrophic drugs which are now taken by large sections of the population almost like sweets, and passed to and fro from one person to another in a block of houses, as though they were &ldquo;Smarties&rdquo; to be consumed like sweets.</P>
    <P>This is all due to the problem of the growth of insecurity and a feeling of resentment against the continuing adversities of life which are occasioned not only in the socially deprived society which we still have but also even more among the affluent population. This feeling of resenting adversity in life, which is inevitable to everyone because we are imperfect human beings, can be found in every country in Europe.  People seem to be unable to accept the strains and stresses of existence to which people were accustomed 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>I suppose one of the reasons is that 50 years ago a very high percentage of the population were entirely fatalistic in their attitude as to what sorrows and miseries were likely to come to them, and to what strains and stresses they would have to endure, particularly those who were then on a very low economic scale of existence.  Now, with the growth of wages and the <Col N="1904" /> growth of affluence, I suppose, the figure is almost reversed.  A very high percentage of the population expect growing standards of living and growing opportunities for a full life, and are constantly increasing the number of consumer goods they buy.  Indeed, there has been a lot of research into this subject.</P>
    <P>We have to look at tobacco, dangerous as it may be, dangerous as the Report of the Royal College of Physicians has said it is, as a drug which is liable to reduce quite definitely the life of those who indulge in it but at least it has no hallucinogenic effects of note and does not cause abject misery to the family of the person who is a consistent smoker.  One has to look at it in a balanced way particularly in regard to adults who smoke cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne and other speakers are quite correct in saying that there is simply no justification for suppressing the use of tobacco any more than the use of alcohol.  I am advised by three of the leading psychiatrists in the country that alcohol, taken in reasonable quantities, is a most valuable drug for the community and that it is only when taken in excess that it becomes dangerous.  That is not to say that in this country, with our high rate of alcoholism, I do not welcome the very large numbers of persons who belong to the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association and the other temperance associations, and who set a good example and demonstrate to people that one can live a happy, contented and exhilarating life without having to consume alcohol.  I would find it very difficult to do so.  I enjoy a drink as much as anybody else.  I want to make that very clear.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I next should say a little bit more about the difficulties to be faced in trying to persuade adults to give up cigarettes.  If you look at a table on page 12 of the Report of the Royal College of Physicians you will see the percentage of women and men who smoked in 1961 and 1968.  The two graphs follow a pattern indicating there were moments when there was a reduction in consumption.  In regard to consumption, comparing 1961 and <Col N="1905" /> 1968, the graphs tend to meet showing quite definitely that it is very difficult to persuade adults to give up smoking.</P>
    <P>The general consumption of tobacco in the United States, for example, has shown spasmodic falls and then appears to have slowly risen again.  It appears to have risen again recently after the ending of advertising of cigarettes showing again that the advertising of cigarettes, as claimed by some of the tobacco companies, is almost more a method of selling rival brands of cigarettes than it is of increasing the consumption of cigarettes. I think that is an overstated claim.  I would not accept that statement without a great deal more research.  At least one can say that the consumption of tobacco, while it has levelled off in a number of countries, has not shown signs of any great decline when steps have been taken to cease advertising.</P>
    <P>I come back again to a progressive form of education for young people.  I admit that the campaign we have for young people will not be sufficient by itself.  We have to engage in far more studies on youth education in preparation for life in general.  The Christian churches are aware of the necessity of appealing to young people and, perhaps, adopting newer and more modern approaches to their attitude to life, their hobbies, their personal interests, their recreation and sport.  More recreational facilities will have to be provided for young people, both physical and intellectual, especially in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I recognise that expenditure on health education here is at a very low level.  I am relieved, but not complacent, that it is at an extremely low level in every country because there has been a cumulative tradition, which is quite natural, that you must cure the sick.  I have managed to increase the total vote.  I managed to multiply by five in the last two years the total amount of my vote for health education of all kinds.  I should like to tell the House that I intend, if I have the privilege of being Minister for Health long enough, to found a health education centre.  Health education simply cannot be done completely by the individual societies, who are doing splendid work, such as the Irish Heart Foundation, <Col N="1906" /> the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Dental Health Education Association and it certainly cannot be done by my Department.  It will require a professional health education centre.</P>
    <P>At the same time, in connection with my effort to expand the work of the social service councils, the work of the National Council for Social Service, which I have appointed, we have to have a greater recognition of the need for youth recreation, the development of youth recreation and the provision of community centres, particularly in new housing estates.  Then, the kind of propaganda we have in order to encourage young people not to smoke will be more effective because they will be enlivened by a number of opportunities for an interesting existence outside their work or outside their school which they did not have before.</P>
    <P>I should pay tribute to all those people who are already engaged in developing youth recreation.  There are many social service councils, voluntary organisations, the Federation of Boy Scouts who are doing splendid work in this regard.  I am not suggesting for a moment that there is not a great deal of this activity, but it has to be expanded.</P>
    <P>I have taken Deputy Cooney's point about diversifying the appeal for anti-cigarette smoking among young people. We have not entirely concentrated on personalities of sport.  We are, for example, using Charles Mitchel, the well-known newscaster in the current example factor series where we take an individual, who is not necessarily well known for sport.  Our first series of filmlets &ldquo;Smoking kills your taste for life&rdquo; was aimed at what are called familiarly in the newspapers &ldquo;Swinging Teenagers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Finally, I believe the main intent of Tobacco (Control of Sale and Advertisement) Bill, 1971 which was I assume to provide for a warning notice on cigarette packets has been met by the provisions of the voluntary agreement to which I have referred.  I must, therefore, oppose further consideration of the Bill.  I should add to what I have said that I would also oppose the Bill on the grounds that I do not see the <Col N="1907" /> virtue of statuorily imposing obligations in an area in which we are doing extremely well by voluntary agreement. In this connection I would point to the voluntary code of standards in advertising cigarettes and drink and to the voluntary phasing out of cigarette advertising on television by RTE as well as the voluntary agreement as to the warning notices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not smoked cigarettes or tobacco for the last 35 years so, therefore, I can approach this Bill with an open mind.  I must say at the outset that I know how strongly Deputy Dr. Browne feels on this particular point.  Indeed, there are many people who think the same as he does.  I cannot help feeling that it is a moderate Bill.  It does not seem to me to go to any great extreme.  I was disappointed to hear the Minister say that he was not prepared to accept the Bill, that he had to oppose it on certain grounds.  If I may say so, with respect to the Minister, the grounds of his opposition are somewhat flimsy.</P>
      <P>I recognise the fact, having been a good many years in this House, that Bills introduced by private members never meet with success.  I suppose the Minister for Health would be creating a precedent if he accepted this Bill. Deputy Dr. Browne based his arguments in favour of the total abolition, if such was possible, of cigarette smoking on three grounds.  The principal one and the one which put the wind up the general public more than anything was the fact that it was an inciter of cancer.  In fact, some medical authorities tried to prove by statistics that it is a complete progenitor of cancer.</P>
      <P>The second argument that Deputy Dr. Browne used was on the basis of coronary thrombosis and other heart conditions.  I am all the way with him on that.  Thirdly, he referred to chronic lung conditions, such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that lung cancer is on the increase.  Statistics show that the incidence has increased considererably over the years.  There is evidence to show that tobacco smoking has increased, that cigarette smoking has <Col N="1908" /> increased.  That is pretty obvious.  That is not to say that tobacco smoking or cigarette smoking are of themselves responsible for lung cancer.  I could not go all the way with Deputy Dr. Browne on that.  In fact, I do not think he made that point.  He attempted to prove that cigarette smoking is largely responsible for lung cancer.</P>
    <P>Statistics can prove anything but one very interesting statistic has been produced by the British Navy, namely that the incidence of lung cancer is higher among those who work between decks, that is, stokers, engine room artificers and those who work in an oily or fume laden atmosphere.  Undoubtedly such an atmosphere is as strong a predisposing cause of lung cancer as tobacco smoking.  I do not think either can be accused of being directly responsible for cancer but both can definitely be accused of being predisposing causes.  A cancerous condition, such as skin cancer, is much more likely to take place if there is inflammation in the particular area.  My medical colleague Deputy Dr. Browne would agree with me on that point.</P>
    <P>Another predisposing cause of lung cancer which perhaps has not been sufficiently considered is the polluted atmosphere that we live in today. Twenty-five or 30 years ago diesel driven machines were not as prevalent as they are today.  The atmosphere, 25 to 40 years ago, was much purer in the built-up areas than it is today.  Pollution has been contained to a certain extent by the use of smokeless fuel.</P>
    <P>If we are to control lung cancer we can suggest or, in fact, make it mandatory, that tobacco manufacturers should show on the article they sell the inherent risks and dangers to those who use it.  However, we must also accept the fact that there are definitely other predisposing causes of lung cancer, for instance, polluted atmosphere. It is suggested that tobacco smoking is responsible for chronic lung conditions such as emphysema and bronchitis.  These conditions are very much affected by polluted atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, unrestricted smoking in public places is extremely undesirable. If the Minister does not wish to introduce legislation, there is no reason <Col N="1909" /> why he should not make an approach to the managements of theatres, cinemas, concert halls and so on and suggest that smoking should not be permitted during hours of entertainment.</P>
    <P>Another place where one nearly always finds the atmosphere polluted is a public house.  On a cold evening one could almost cut the atmosphere with a knife.  That brings me to the next point in regard to coronary ailments. Anything that induces extra pressure or an extra burden on the heart produces coronary trouble. Coronary disease breeds well in a foul atmosphere or where there is extra pressure.  We have to go to America for most of our information on this subject.  It has been discovered in America that one deleterious effect of smoking is a raising of the blood pressure.  Increased blood pressure is a prelude to heart trouble.  Therefore, we should not try to scare the public. We went through a period of almost mass hysteria in regard to the ill effects of smoking.  People gave up cigarettes, as perhaps they would at the beginning of Lent, and stayed off them for about a week.  Sometimes people would give up smoking when extra taxation was imposed on tobacco in the annual Budget.  There was a reduction in cigarette smoking when the lung cancer scare started but after a while the danger was forgotten. Any attempt to scare the people out of tobacco smoking is not likely to be successful.</P>
    <P>I will vote for this Bill.  There is nothing in it which would prevent me from voting for it.  I am one of those who would oppose any restriction of individual liberty, which ultimately means bureaucratic control.  I see nothing in this Bill which would prevent me from voting for it but the Minister has said &ldquo;no&rdquo; and that means, in the Dáil as presently constituted, the defeat of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should consider approaching all those responsible for public entertainment with a view to having smoking restricted as much as possible.  A &ldquo;No Smoking&rdquo; notice is very effective.  There is now no <Col N="1910" /> danger that anyone would smoke in a non-smoking carriage on the British railways.  The British people are sticklers for the law.  They abide by the law except in matters associated with Ireland.  I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should use his influence, and he must have considerable influence as Minister for Health, to see that all public places are kept free of smoking.  Anybody can do without his smoke for a certain period.  I think concerts are free from smoking.  I do not think picture houses are although I hardly ever go to a film.  Music hall shows are not.</P>
    <P>I do not think having famous footballers and such people telling young people not to smoke makes the slightest difference.  This must come from official level.  It is a pity the Minister is not accepting this Bill because it seems to me to be quite harmless.  It does not go very far and I do not think it restricts liberty in any way.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the heaviest loss of life from tobacco smoking or the polluted atmosphere would lie in the emphysematous group.  Nobody is supposed to have died of emphysema yet but people die from the effects of it, in other words, heart disease.  The second group is the heart disease group.  I think the incidence of heart disease, which is one of the major killers in the modern world, is largely due to tobacco smoking.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not accepting this Bill but I suppose he is only following a principle which has been followed by most Governments&mdash;that no legislation is good legislation unless it is introduced by the party in power.</P>

      <P>This is a controversial subject.  It is controversial in regard to the reason why people smoke and also in regard to what should be done about it.  Most young people start smoking because they wish to be grown up but <Col N="1911" /> the vast majority of adults continue to smoke because they are under some tension and they find some solace in the cigarette which takes them through particular crises.  Those are the people who will find it hardest to give up smoking.  No appeals made to them will convince them that they should do so.</P>
      <P>Our controversy today is what should be done about smoking.  There seems to be no disagreement as to the harm smoking causes.  I was surprised that cheroots, tobacco and other substances were excluded from the terms of the Bill.  This would not appeal to me at all.  I work in an area where dust is a problem for industrial workers.  I am surprised at times how frightened and upset people are when they are told that they have a small amount of dust on their lungs and still they continue to smoke.  I believe that any dust, in small or large amounts, must be harmful to people's lungs.  I do not go very far with the idea that because one does not inhale one does not suffer any ill effects.  I believe that anything you put in your mouth and from which you extract smoke must harm your lungs.  I did not smoke until I was about 25 years of age.  I smoked for a number of years until I realised I was getting bronchitis.  Cigarettes were the only things that ever gave me bronchitis.  I took the message and stopped smoking. I have not smoked for 15 or 20 years. I feel so strongly about this that when I meet somebody with chest trouble I ask him whether he smokes and advise him never to smoke again.</P>
      <P>For publicity purposes much has been made of the cancer resulting from smoking and from time to time the literature seems to throw a doubt on this.  I am certain that most people who suffer from bronchitis do so as a result of smoking and the damage done in this line is much greater than the damage done by cancer.  Granted cancer is much more frightening and probably impresses itself more on people, but Deputy Dr. Browne told us the number of man days lost and the dangers, disadvantages and economic losses should impress themselves on people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1912" /> What should we do about smoking? The fact that parents do not smoke must have the most compelling effect on children.  Most children whose parents do not smoke will eventually give up smoking even if they do start. The schools can be used to a certain extent but the success of the nonsmoking campaign depends, to a large extent, on us, the medical people.</P>
    <P>Dusty atmospheres have been mentioned and I agree with Deputy Esmonde that a dusty atmosphere has a deleterious effect on people's lungs, even on those who do not smoke. Many people who go out on Friday or Saturday night to such an atmosphere are able to relate cause and effect when it is pointed out to them. I do not know how we can deal with this in legislation.  One of the biggest problems in regard to both alcohol and cigarettes is the practice of standing a round in the case of alcohol and passing around cigarettes in company. If those two customs could be discontinued it would go a long way towards reducing alcoholism and the amount of cigarette smoking that takes place. The crowd provides the occasion for the extra smoke.  A person who, on his own would only smoke one cigarette, will smoke five or six when he is in a group of five or six people.  If each one does not pass around cigarettes he is considered mean.  We are not discussing alcohol but this is my strong contention about alcohol, too. If there is one thing the Minister could do it is to prohibit the standing of a round in the publichouse.  There is nothing very wrong in people going in to enjoy a drink but I can see no point in smoking.  A person might get a lesson from seeing someone suffering from lung cancer or in the final stages of chest disease.  If people saw the suffering of such victims the lesson would get home to them.</P>
    <P>The Bill suggests the printing of warnings on cigarette packets and the prohibition of advertising.  It is doubtful whether results would come from such measures.  Such measures have been taken in the US and other countries. The US are the leading advertisers and they seem to have the greatest idea of the value of money.  If <Col N="1913" /> the cigarette manufacturers or retailers in America felt that they were suffering as a result of campaigns against smoking they would have taken steps by now to produce a cigarette which would not harm health.  There have been advertisement campaigns from time to time but there do not seem to have been sustained efforts to discourage people from smoking.  Whatever has been done in the US obviously has not cut in to any great extent on the cigarette market.  Because of this the business people involved are not prepared to adopt any particular course.  If we pass this Bill we will find ourselves in the same position.  In the long run we will not cut in on the consumption of cigarettes.  We will fail to achieve that objective.  If I thought there was some other way of forcing tobacco and cigarette companies to spend money on the production of a harmless cigarette I would support such a measure.  As the position is at the moment I do not think such action would be acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that Deputy Dr. Browne has been pressing for this measure over a number of years.  He was alone in his attempt to do this.  Since I came into this House some time ago I have been pressing the Minister to highlight the hazards of cigarette smoking.  I have been astounded that he was unable to do so despite the overwhelming evidence from the Royal Colleges of Surgeons in Britain and the US to the effect that there is a direct link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Blanchardstown Hospital was a TB centre.  Cases are now being sent out there following mass X-ray when it is found that many people have lung cancer.  I know of one man who went in for an overnight test ten months ago and he finds it depressing now to realise that he can just lie and watch the trees.  A little gland was removed and it was found that he had massive cancer in one lung with an extension to the other lung.  Dr. Eoin O'Malley of the Mater Hospital has published figures recently concerning this disease. It has been found that of 100 cases of lung cancer discovered 50 were incurable. Of the remaining 50, 25 had <Col N="1914" /> gone beyond treatment and of the remaining 25, ten lasted three years. These are very depressing figures. These figures were released by the Mater Hospital two months ago.  If we cannot accept such evidence we might as well give up.  There is a direct link between a substance in the cigarette tobacco and lung cancer.  This substance is not in normal cigar or pipe tobacco.  This is thought to be due to the fact that cigarette tobacco is dried by a very fast process which destroys the enzymes leaving an irritant substance in the cigarette.</P>
      <P>There has been a big increase in lung cancer in Ireland and the disease occurs at a younger age.  Any doctor in general practice sees large numbers of chronic bronchitis cases and a large number of people suffering from emphysema and bronchial asthma. Invariably there is a history of cigarette smoking.  Bronchitis and emphysema are crippling diseases.  They account for more working days lost than, perhaps, flu.  It would be interesting to get figures from the Department of Social Welfare as to the numbers incapacitated as a result of these diseases.  When I was in active practice over 70 per cent of my patients suffered from bronchitis or emphysema.  One could offer only palliative treatment.  One could not cure them.  One had to help them over the winter months and hope they would survive.  Such patients were subject to all sorts of infections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Knowing these facts it is galling to see advertisements on television up to recently identifying smoking with major athletics and associating smoking with athletes and their performance in the physical field.  Such advertising is still seen in theatres and cinemas. Younger age groups go to cinemas and see these advertisements.  The advertising of something which we know is harmful should be stopped.  Manufacturers have an obligation not to sell something which is known to be harmful. Surely people have a case for compensation. There were claims for compensation for cancer and other conditions which developed following smoking in the US.  It has been proved conclusively that coronary heart disease results from smoking cigarettes as well <Col N="1915" /> as other ailments such as gastric and duodenal ulcers.</P>
    <P>When television cigarette advertising ceased I took it for granted that cigarette advertising on radio would also cease.  To my surprise, that has not been the evolution.  Cigarette advertising on radio continues.  Now the radio is on all day long and anyone trying to quit smoking must find it very difficult faced with the barrage of advertising. The advertising stipulates that quality is guaranteed.  What exactly does &ldquo;Quality guaranteed&rdquo; mean?</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that this is a voluntary effort on the part of the manufacturers and they have set their own standards.  Is it right that this kind of advertising should continue? Quality guaranteed!  Even at the risk of losing revenue we must honour our obligations and we must eliminate this advertising on radio, on the cinema screen and in the newspapers.  Whether we like it or not there is a marked increase in cigarette smoking.  The returns published by the tobacco companies clearly prove that.</P>
    <P>The campaign against cigarette smoking is nullified by the radio advertising and by cinema and newspaper advertising.  We must step in and take action.  Cigarette imports have increased, especially imports from France, and there is no warning on these that they may constitute a hazard to health.  These imports are not complying even with the standards of the manufactuers here.  They bear no label warning the public.  I was a very heavy smoker, 60 cigarettes a day, until I realised the dangers.  I gave them up. Anyone can give them up if he or she makes a determined effort.  People should realise that they can set an example to the young.  Above all, the young should not be exposed to the impact of this massive advertising.</P>
    <P>Tobacco companies do no research. They spend enormous sums on advertising but practically nothing on research.  The amount spent on research is ludicrous.  Their profits are massive and surely some of these profits could be devoted to removing the noxious, carcinogenic substance <Col N="1916" /> which causes all the harm.  But they will not do that.  The workers are, of course, concerned in case they lose their jobs as a result of people ceasing to smoke.  Surely there could be diversification to ensure that the employees will not lose their jobs.  The attitude would seem to be that they do not care how many die of cancer so long as their jobs are secure.  That is a wrong attitude to adopt.</P>
    <P>I suggest that these cigarette manufacturers should turn over to the manufacture of cheroots.  They are not without their dangers, but they are certainly less dangerous than cigarettes. Cheroots are very cheap in the United States.  Here, because there is not a big demand for them, they are quite expensive. It should be possible to manufacture them and sell them cheaper than they are at the moment.  That might encourage cigarette smokers to switch to cheroots.</P>
    <P>Again, in the United States, smoking is not permitted in public places, such as cinemas and stores.  We might follow that example.  I do not like to interfere with personal liberty but, if something causes damage to health, surely interference is legitimate.  Those who contract tuberculosis are sent to sanatoria to safeguard their own health and the health of the community.  Why should we not restrict smoking in public places?</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister should depend altogether on the manufacturers to do the right thing where advertising is concerned.  I think there should be an independent body.  At the moment it is on a voluntary basis. Even if we cannot restrict advertising we could ensure that they do not make false claims about quality and so on. Because of all the different diseases which resulted from cigarette smoking there is ample justification for our Bill.</P>

One of the things which surprised me as an outsider, as a newly-qualified doctor and, indeed, even as a student was the type of hypocrisy which prevailed right through society at large. On the one hand, we were educating people to attempt to deal with serious illnesses and on the other, promoting the sale of substances which caused chronic illnesses which required long-term treatment and involved a great deal of hardship for the patient.  That is one of the anomalies one comes across in life and I could never fully understand it, until such time as I made a very brief study of the economics involved.

He was praised by people in every walk of life for the great work he had done in countering the TB problem in this country.  Here now, many years later, he is introducing a Bill which should have been introduced years ago, years of continuous rule by the Fianna Fáil Government who were more interested in the economics, the £ s d, of politics than in the true health of the people.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but many members of the profession in this House have come into close contact with the hardships caused to families, members of which have been taken away at a very young age, an age well below the average age of death, and the unfortunate thing is that many of these people could have had a far longer productive life had there been greater control of the sale of tobacco and had the ill effects of tobacco been advertised and made public years ago.  It is tragic to see a young father leaving a family behind when he dies of lung cancer. There are many other things involved &mdash;I agree with Deputy O'Connell on this&mdash;such as the chronic types of diseases which cigarette smoking particularly causes such as bronchitis.  We all know the disability which patients suffer as a result of bronchitis.  They are alive, but they cannot move very far and cannot participate in life to any great extent.  Hardening of the arteries is another, resulting in hardening of the cerebral arteries which produces premature senility, or narrowing of the arteries of the legs, limiting movement, and, perhaps, resulting in a transplant of the artery of the leg, or as we see nowadays, in a very large degree, the venous transplant of the coronary artery which is being done in the Mater Hospital and for which the Department of Health have not provided the necessary funds to make available to <Col N="1919" /> each patient the Pacemaker which renders the job successful, so that the person suffering from a specific ailment such as that, and there are many, cannot afford to have the operation.</P>
      <P>If we move on to two of the greatest killers we have, lung cancer and coronary thrombosis, we find that in both cigarette smoking is the major contributory factor and we also see, looking at it as sensible people objectively, that cigarette smoking is the one major avoidable factor in these diseases.  Because of the severity and importance of these illnesses in our society, I want to say that while the dangers, the ill effects, are apparent from the ten or 12 years of research that went into the statistics to try to ascertain the carcinogenetic effects of cigarette smoking, many people, after the report came out and proved, as well as statistics can prove, that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer, even today still doubt whether it does. This Bill should not just provide for the simple advertisement or sticker being put on the package stating that cigarette smoking is dangerous.  It should provide information as to what the smoking of cigarettes can cause and should list the commonest illnesses which it causes.</P>
      <P>One can see that when fools spend their money on cigarettes, the bulk of that money goes to the Government in the form of tax levied on them and one can see how important the part which the sale of cigarettes plays in the budgeting of a government and, whereas figures vary from country to country, it is known that in one country in Europe the revenue from cigarette sales goes halfway towards paying the total national health bill.  The ads we see at present in newspapers and the cinema, on TV and on posters along the road are all aimed at the new section of our population who have more money in their pockets than they had in past generations, the teenager and the person in his early twenties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think that a government which allows the uncontrolled advertising of cigarettes, the uncontrolled sale of cigarettes and the quantity production of cigarettes, coupled with the uncontrolled sale of alcohol, against which I should like to see provision in this Bill, is lacking in a social conscience and in responsibility towards the youth of the country.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell that as in other countries cigarette smoking should be banned in public places, such as cinemas, dancehalls and other public gatherings in enclosed spaces.  I fully agree with the Bill.

If people want to smoke cigarettes they know the effects.  If you are at an Irish funeral you may hear them say: &ldquo;Johnny was a nice fellow but he killed himself drinking, the poor fellow.&rdquo;  You go to another funeral and you hear: &ldquo;Michael was a real old miser.

They should be encouraged not to do it in a democratic way, not by saying: &ldquo;You cannot do this or that and if you do it, you will be penalised.&rdquo;  Instead of trying to enforce restrictions on cigarette smoking our aim should be to educate people to the dangers of the habit.  No doubt, if a Bill such as this were to be enacted, it would not be very long until there would be calls for amendments to it for the purpose of enforcing greater restrictions.  I do not go along with that method of dealing with the problem.</P>

As a young man, I knew a man of 55 who died within a couple of weeks of becoming ill, presumably from the results of having smoked 50 cigarettes a day.

      <P>When I reported progress I was speaking about a company known as Shannon Atlantic Fisheries Limited.  During the course of the debate I said Mr. P.

    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to let us know if An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are making a concerted effort to squeeze out the small skippers.  The average fisherman, aged from 20 to 25 years, has no hope of getting the £3,500 or £4,000 necessary for a deposit for a trawler.  It would be a worthwhile scheme if An Bord Iascaigh Mhara could arrange to deduct a certain amount of money from the weekly wages of the young apprentices so that when they reached the age of 25 years they could qualify for boats.  It would be a tremendous incentive to young people to know that at the age of 25 years they could own their own boats.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain the reason for the delay in construction of the school it was proposed to build in Donegal.  Last year we were told that the school would be built then but so far nothing has been done.  Also, would the Parliamentary Secretary please tell us the drop-out rate among the trainee fishermen? I have been told that the rate is as high as 50 per cent and if this is correct there must be something wrong with the scheme.</P>
    <P>An allowance of £4 per week is given to the young trainees but this amount is completely inadequate.  A more realistic sum would be £7 or £8 per week. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that it is ridiculous to expect young boys to make do with £4 a week, especially when they are living away from home.  I would ask him to do everything possible to increase this allowance.</P>
    <P>Some one and a half years ago I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if his Department had a conservation policy for fisheries and I was told that this policy was in course of preparation.  So far it has not materialised and it is long overdue.  Some of the fishermen on the south-west coast have grave misgivings about the new type of trawler An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have introduced, namely, the stern trawler.  The fishermen object to the type of net being used in this trawler; they claim it will rake the bottom of the ocean and destroy the <Col N="1928" /> spawning grounds.  These are genuine fears and the Parliamentary Secretary should try to allay the fears of the fishermen in this regard.  If these trawlers arrive at the ports there will be an even more drastic type of agitation than was used by the Dublin Housing Action Committee.  Whether they are right or not, the fishermen are convinced that these trawlers will destroy the fishing grounds.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with this matter in detail in his reply.</P>
    <P>Much play was made by the Parliamentary Secretary about the two research ships but it is well known that these two ships are tied to the piers for most of the year.  It would be enlightening if the Parliamentary Secretary told us how many hours fishing those trawlers spent in the last year and how many different crews were engaged during that time.  The conditions on board these boats are disgraceful.  This is why the crew do not rejoin the boats and the skippers are obliged to look for new crew frequently.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us about conditions on board those trawlers.</P>
    <P>Another matter causing concern is pollution and Deputy Blaney referred to this in his speech.  It is well known that effluent from silos is flowing on to some of our strands and this type of pollution is particularly severe.  I saw a stretch of coast in Dingle where effluent from a silo pit flowed into the tide. Within a radius of two miles all the shellfish had died.  Inspectors from the Department should inspect the various harbours, particularly checking if effluent from silo pits is contaminating the areas.  This could be a tremendous problem in the future and we should take action now.  The strand I have mentioned in County Kerry was famous for razor fish, scallops and many other types of fish but there is no live fish in this area now.  If this kind of pollution is not prevented it is possible that it may get out of control.</P>
    <P>With regard to Dingle Harbour, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should have given a cash grant to provide a deep freeze for the fishermen in the co-op at Dingle.  When a certain property <Col N="1929" /> came on the market some time ago, the fishermen were prepared to put up £31,000 to buy the property.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should have stepped in and helped them to buy the property but the Shannon Atlantic Fisheries bought the property and squeezed out the local fishermen.  It is possible that there will be conflict in the area in the future.  The company will be able to store fish in their deep-freeze and put it on the market in opposition to the fishermen in the co-op.  In this way there will be local friction which could have been avoided.  I was at a meeting when it became known that the property, which was owned by the Blasket Sea Foods, was being put on the market.  At that meeting the fishermen subscribed approximately £8,000, they received money from local businessmen, and were able to gather £31,000.  It was good to see local fishermen invest their savings in further development for themselves but it was wrong that a company should come along and, with the aid of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, squeeze out the local fishermen.  It would be very wrong if that type of thing developed.  It has started at Dingle and it could happen at other ports as well.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take note of my remarks.</P>
    <P>At the moment dredging is supposed to be in operation at Dingle Harbour. An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Roinn na Gaeltachta had a great deal to do with getting the dredging started, but it is now at a full stop.  The dredger there seems to be obsolete.  Alternative proposals have been put up by the local fishermen and the local chamber of commerce.  The contractor must have run into difficulties; otherwise the work would be going on.  This may be more a matter for the Board of Works, but An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should consult with the Board of Works in order to get this work under way again, because we were long enough waiting for it to start.</P>
    <P>If young people realised what a fine life fishing was and what a prosperous living it could provide if they were prepared to work, many of them would take up fishing as a career.  There are a number of young boys who have no <Col N="1930" /> hope of becoming academics and who would make very good fishermen.  As I suggested the last time this Estimate was being discussed here, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should appoint a public relations officer to visit the secondary and vocational schools with the object of promoting fishing as a career.</P>
    <P>On 24th August, 1970, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara published a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> which indicated that there was a target of £15 million for the fishing industry by 1974.  How can we reach that in view of the small token Estimate which is before us here today?  In that report the chairman of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara said that he expected to have 350 new boats by 1974.  I am sure An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are doing the best they can but if the money is not provided they cannot make boats available.  I am quite sure there has not been an increase of 50 trawlers in Irish coastal waters in the last 12 months.  There may be 50 extra trawlers but they would be replacements; there would not be 50 new skippers.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not stated how much fish was imported during the past 12 months.  Around the country it is being said that something in the region of £2,500,000 worth of fish was being imported.  I do not know whether that figure is correct because I have not got the report of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give us that information.  If that is so, it is disgraceful that the Government should still be neglecting the fishing industry which is right at our doorstep.  No investment is needed in it.  All that is required is that people go out and catch the fish.  Young people are there to fish if the necessary incentives are provided.  In 1971 the Parliamentary Secretary said in his report:</P>
    <P>Improvement works have been approved for Dingle, Cuas (Baile Mór Thoir) and Bealtra, County Kerry; Rossaveel, Cleggan, Emlaghmore, Roundstone, Furnais North, Coolacloy, Renvyle, Sruffaun, Sruthán Buí, Garafin and Glinsk, County Galway.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> Those are only a few of a long list of projected improvements which the Parliamentary Secretary read out. Could he tell us how many of those works were actually carried out?  I would say that not even 30 per cent have been carried out.  I know that from my own area.  What is the point of announcing that schemes have been approved when the money is not provided? It is not fair that the hopes of the fishermen in those localities should be raised by being told that their pier or harbour is to be improved when nothing is done about it.  Is it that the Minister for Finance has not provided the necessary money to effect those improvements?  These are questions that should be answered.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, got a report from the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and representatives of the different Gaeltacht areas stating that there was a future in fishing in those areas.  I had hoped that the Minister would accept that report in principle and give the necessary incentives to fishermen and would-be fishermen, if the Government are serious about saving the West.</P>
    <P>I understand An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is making an all-out effort to revise the insurance rates for trawlers. The insurance on a 75-foot trawler is between £600 and £700 a year.  This is a colossal figure.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that trawlers cannot go out at all times during the year.  It depends very much on the weather, but whether the trawler is tied to the pier or engaged in fishing, the fishermen still must pay the insurance which represents an overhead of something like £12 per week.  If they have a breakdown and they are tied to the pier for two or three weeks, they still have to pay this insurance. I would ask An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to take a very close look at the insurance of these trawlers because the figure of £650 is much too high.  They may be able to do something about it.</P>
    <P>An Bórd Iascaigh Mhara should approach CIE for a special rate&mdash;like the Great Train Robbery&mdash;for the <Col N="1932" /> transport of fish from far away districts to Dublin.  CIE fish transport costs are exorbitant.  This should be a form of subsidy for the fisherman. CIE should give a special rate for the carriage of fish from Killybegs, Galway, Castletownbere, Dingle, Cahirciveen and Dungarvan to the Dublin market.</P>
    <P>In 1964 an American survey team were invited to this country by the late Deputy Seán Lemass.  They made a fantastic report on fisheries under a number of headings.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us if the board accepted any of the recommendations of that survey team.  Recommendation No. 7 recommended re-organising the fish market and establishing a State-supervised auction in Dublin.  Everyone knows that there is a fish ring in the Dublin market.  This ring should be smashed.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will let us know if An Bord Iascaigh Mhara intend to get back into the marketing of fish.  It was a retrograde step by the board to opt out of the marketing of fish.</P>
    <P>When we enter the EEC we will have to have better landing facilities. Foreigners will be able to land here. There is no question about that.  These facilities must be provided under the Treaty of Rome.  We are making no effort whatsoever to gear ourselves for the intensive competition which we will have to face in ten years time.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Parliamentary Secretary to go round meeting the fishermen and saying &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; to them.  He will be judged on what he can accomplish.  I know he has the ability. He should go to the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;I cannot work on that budget.&rdquo; I hope he will come to the House at a later stage with a Supplementary Estimate for an injection of capital, which is long overdue, for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara or the fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking back over the 12 months, roughly, that have passed since I spoke here on this Estimate I find it amazing that we are still without any projected fishery policy, particularly now that we are fast approaching entry into the EEC.  About <Col N="1933" /> 12 months ago I gave the figures for the various countries of our size throughout Europe that are engaged in fishing.  Norway was up to £200 million. Denmark was up to £100 million.  The Faroe Islands with a population of a few thousand only had an export sale of £10 million worth of fish.  I believe that their export figure reached £15 million in 1970.</P>
      <P>It was not too much to have expected that a scheme would have been laid before us by now which would increase fishing extensively over the next ten years.  We should be aiming at an export figure of £50 million worth of fish.  There will be big opportunities in the Common Market.  In the booklet which was laid before us it is stated:</P>
      <P>On the marketing side, it is estimated that the enlarged Community will be a net importer of fish for human consumption.  This will ensure a continuing firm demand for all types of fish.  In 1970, Irish exports of fish and fishery products were worth £4.6 million of which £2.2 million was consigned to the EEC and some £1.9 million to the UK.  The present EEC is already a promising market for our fishery exports and the improved conditions for trade following membership&mdash;abolition of quantitative restrictions and dismantlement of tariffs&mdash;should lead to a considerable expansion in these exports.  In equipping itself to take full advantage of the market opportunities in the enlarged Community, the Irish fishing industry will be assisted through participating in the development and improvement aspects of the common fisheries policy.  Community funds will be available to aid such projects as the improvement of fishing fleets, the modernisation of storage and processing facilities and fisheries research.  Financial aid towards the cost of forming and running producer groups will also be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that opportunities are facing us.  We are informed that in the European Bank set up by the Community funds will be available, but at this stage we appear to have no projected scheme.  Having spent seven years trying to get into the Common Market it should be available by now.  We should reach for the figure of £50 million.  Surely the money can be made available.  An export target of £50 million would give employment to 20,000 extra people with a wage capacity of £18 million.  This would be deployed mainly along our west coast where it is most needed.  If that type of money were made available we would get further employment and we could solve our population problem and our emigration problem in those counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a target worth reaching for.  We could reap the benefits of this vast field which lies off our coast which all too often fleets of other countries use to their advantage.  I spent two years in Europe and I was a member of the fishing committee there.  I know that with very little effort we could force half of the fleets which come in here to remain at home because when I was in Europe their catches were being reduced all the time and many trawlers were pulling out of fishing along the Irish coast.  The more we fish our fishing grounds the less opportunity there is for foreigners to fish off our shores.  The necessity for having protection vessels would not arise if more of our own trawlers were fishing off our coast.  We have a natural advantage over many other countries in that we can land our fish quickly and have them processed. Fish deteriorate when they have to remain on boats for any length of time.  If we had many of our own trawlers landing their fish and then having the fish put on ice immediately the quality would be up to European standards.  We have several good processing plants and we should invite <Col N="1935" /> outside people who have the technique and the knowledge to set up more of those plants here.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago many boats which could fish around this country were tied up around our coasts.  Skippers of many of those boats, if they can get the necessary help, are quite prepared to base themselves here and to fish around our coasts.  If we aimed at this type of thing we would stop the marauders who are trying to get into our coastal waters to pick up the stocks of fish which they destroy far too often.</P>
    <P>We are at the bottom of the list in regard to fishing compared with other European countries.  We have practically 12 months fishing weather unlike some European countries, especially the northern countries which are very often icebound.  They cannot get out of harbour for long periods during each winter.  We have fishing grounds which are practically free of ice all during the winter so that our fishermen could fish all the time.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Department and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have not had some projected scheme for fishing before this.  Our fishermen in Dingle and Cahirciveen, because of the policy of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, find the boats have to be tied up for repairs for long periods.  There are no proper repair facilities available for those boats. Nothing has been done to standardise the engines in them.  The fishermen find they have to wait for three, four and six months for a small part, which a person could carry in his pocket, to repair the engine of a fishing boat. This type of policy has put many of our fishermen out of business.  Many young men decided not to go into fishing when they saw their fathers had to wait so long for repairs to their boats.</P>
    <P>I referred to the case, on a previous Estimate, of a fisherman who tried to keep on fishing because he had several sons and he hoped that they would follow him into the business.  He had a boat with an engine which was never capable of fishing off the Blaskets or the Skelligs.  During a period of 18 <Col N="1936" /> months the engine had to be repaired several times.  It was even repaired by engineers sent down by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  At one time it broke down between Dingle and Cahirciveen and had to be towed to Portmagee.  A Bord Iascaigh Mhara engineer was sent down to repair it and it was found that the swabs which were used on the engine had been left inside it.  The boat never left the pier after that.  This man had repair bills for approximately £7,000.  If there were standardised engines in certain ports this type of thing would not take place.  There should be one spare set of parts for every type of boat so that when one needs repairs it will only have to be tied up for perhaps a day.  Several times when I approached An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to fight the fishermen's case I was told if they got off their backsides they would not have a problem.  This is the type of argument which is usually trotted out to us despite the fact that it is because of the policy of those people sitting in offices in Dublin that the fishermen cannot earn enough to keep themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>Our fishing industry could be as great as it was in years gone by when fishermen went out in currachs and caught enough fish to maintain themselves and their families in reasonable comfort.  Before we get into the EEC there is still time to do something about this industry but it will take a massive organisation which I do not believe is within An Bord Iascaigh Mhara's capabilities.  The Government will have to try to get some body together to put a projected scheme into operation to save our fishing industry. Provision should be made for a vast number of boats and for personnel to man them.  Personnel can be obtained if people see prospects for the future in this industry.  Up to now there have been only small efforts made to improve the position.</P>
    <P>There is a new boat coming to Cahirciveen next month which is costing nearly £90,000.  For the past ten years we have been trying to get the necessary grants for improvement of the pier.  Two years ago a start was supposed to be made.  Borings were <Col N="1937" /> taken.  Nothing has been done although the boat is due to be tied up there some time next month.  At least, it is being launched in Donegal.</P>
    <P>The same type of thing arises in Dingle.  Grants were made available for the development of the harbour. There was to be some development along the old pier.  Recently it was considered advisable to change the position. It was suggested that they should build a face at the east side and as a result of dredging behind the pier, at an extra cost of £30,000, four or five acres of ground could be made available to the fishermen while at the same time an equally good or better pier face could be provided and the necessary storage sheds could be accommodated on the reclaimed ground.  This would make Dingle harbour a useful and viable proposition. Efforts were made to get the authorities to make the necessary change in the plan but so far no progress has been made.  One would have thought that the engineers concerned would have seen the advantages of the suggested alteration of plan which, at reasonable extra cost, would have provided four or five acres of ground. It may not be the fault of the engineers concerned.  They are restricted to a certain amount of money.  The importance of big thinking in regard to planning for this very important industry is apparent.</P>
    <P>I do hope that what we say here will be noted and that the necessary development will take place so that the wealth that is in the seas around us can be developed for the benefit of the country.  This will give employment along the west coast, which is so badly needed.  The money that can be earned from fisheries will benefit not only the west but the entire country.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member of the House I have made repeated claims for the development of the shell fish industry, particularly in Cromane. There is an industry there which could be worth £¼ million if there were proper propagation.  There are plenty of sea mussels being carried out on the tide.  We have never been able to get the necessary development of the harbour. This is one of the best mussel-breeding <Col N="1938" /> stations in Europe.  With pollution in the Dutch fields arising from the discharge of the Rhone and other rivers, this type of development in Ireland can be all the more important. It would appear that we are taking our ease and awaiting the natural outcrop that has been developing.  There are vast acres there for planting and plenty of seeds.  On occasions I have seen 50 or 60 acres of seed mussels two and three feet high.  I have seen the fishery people rigging up poles and attaching little bits of nets to catch the mussels. The poles and the nets and the mussels were all swept away on the tide and yet there were acres of seeds left.  This is the kind of experimentation to which the money is devoted.  With proper development of the seed beds the supply of mussels could be increased and our exports could be expanded.</P>
    <P>Claims have been made for nationalisation of fresh water fishing.  Any nationalisation that might be considered should not envisage interference with the rights of the estuarine fishermen. A big number of people earn their living by taking salmon by way of nets in the estuaries.  I would be opposed to any attempt to remove those people from the fishing grounds. They have been engaged in this work down the years, as have their fathers before them.  They have a right to live there just as a landowner has a right to his land.  The use of nets is not allowed on fresh water now.  Any suggestion of nationalisation aimed at the estuarine fishermen would meet with the maximum resistance because these people claim a God-given right. Any hotelier or other person who thinks that he can promote the business in a better way if the rights to the existing fishermen are cancelled should realise that this would not work.  While I am in this House or while I am on the earth.  I do not want to see that type of thing happening.  Every man has the right to follow the way of life of his father before him.  As I interpret it, there is no question of compensation. I could not allow this opportunity to pass without making this comment. I hope the rights of the estuarine fishermen will always be maintained.</P>
    <P>My colleague in Kerry, Deputy <Col N="1939" /> Begley, referred to somebody or other, in some company.  All too often people like this are hammered when they put money into the type of development that we are all looking for.  It is often remarked that Irish people invest their money in every and any enterprise except local development.  Anybody who puts money into boats&mdash;I do not know the people concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think it can be at the expense of the fishermen. We are looking for development and there are skippers and fishermen on the European coasts who have boats laid up and are prepared to come here.  I would much prefer to see them here than to see trawlers come in and taking the fish away.  I would prefer to see European skippers employing Irish personnel on the boats, as they are prepared to do, landing fish here for processing, where it would give employment, and flying the Irish flag in the process.  This is a good thing.  It is the quickest way we can develop.  I hope we will get the money from the World Bank but if we do not there is no way in which we can get the vast investment in boats that we need.  This would be one way of improving our fleet. Anybody in this country who is putting money into a boat and employing men on it is not interfering with the fishermen as such.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1940" /> I should like to again impress on the Government and on the people who are directing our fisheries that they should try to bring in a development scheme.  It must be over a ten-year period, it must be vast and we must have the money.  If we succeed in bringing about this type of development our worries about fishermen and foreign trawlers coming in will be over because it will not be worth their while to come here if we are able to put a boat or two boats to each one of theirs.  I hope a scheme will be devised so that we can reach a target of about £50 million in exports by 1982.</P>

We believe there is an opening there for them.  We believe that the industry is capable of expansion and we want people to invest in it and provide employment in it.  Deputy Begley asked me if I heard of such a company.

      <P>I should like to deal with the charge that by giving grants and loans to companies the small fisherman is being squeezed out.  This is not so.  Deputy Begley criticised the fact that a skipper has to put down a 5 per cent deposit on a boat costing £70,000, £80,000 or £90,000.  Five per cent is a very reasonable amount to <Col N="1942" /> expect a person to put down.  In what other branch of industry or activity in the country could a person put down only 5 per cent of the cost of the operation whether it is a factory, farm or anything else?  It could not be done. The terms offered by BIM are the best that could be got anywhere in the world to aid fishermen.  I have not heard of any scheme anywhere that is better than the one they operate and I am very satisfied with the results that have come about.</P>
      <P>Deputy Begley mentioned the school at Greencastle.  What I said in my Estimate speech last year was that work would commence within the present financial year.  I am glad to be able to say that work has commenced.</P>

      <P>We sincerely hope the work will be completed, perhaps, within this financial year.  Work would have commenced much earlier but for the fact that we had unforeseeable difficulties for which I was not in any way responsible.  We have succeeded in getting work started.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the progress that has been made in the industry. Some Deputies have said that we have made little or no progress over the years.  I can only conclude that a Deputy who makes such a statement has not shown the interest in fisheries that he should have shown.</P>

      <P>The value of landings of sea fish and shellfish reached almost £4 million in 1970, which represents an increase of £1 million on the 1969 record figure.

The total value of landings, including shellfish, amounted to £2,404,000 in 1968 and increased by 25 per cent to £2,996,000 <Col N="1944" /> in 1969 and by a further 31 per cent to £3,911,000 in 1970.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would listen I could enlighten him somewhat with regard to the prospects of the fishing industry.  There has been much talk with regard to the EEC policy of common access of fishing vessels of EEC countries to each other's waters, right up to the coast.  It has been said that what has been negotiated was a sell-out so far as the fisheries were concerned. What has been negotiated is anything but a sell-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can imagine Deputies being worried about the common access.  In the House over the last 12 months, since the common fisheries policy was <Col N="1945" /> adopted by the EEC countries, numerous questions were asked week after week in connection with this policy. These questions came at a very difficult time for our negotiating team. They came at a time when the EEC countries which had then, little more than a year ago, adopted the common fisheries policy which contained the common access clause were saying to our negotiators and other applicant countries that they were not prepared to discuss their common fisheries policy with us.  Our negotiators, led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dr. Hillery, brought about the position where the Community were willing to talk about that policy which had been adopted.  They succeeded eventually by diligent negotiation and following many hours of talks, including two all-night sessions, in getting what we have at present.  At that stage people both inside and outside this House were implying that our fisheries were being sold out in payment for the benefits to agriculture, that the Government had no interest in fisheries. Our negotiators showed their interest and successfully obtained for us what we have at the present time, which is a very good deal so far as our fisheries are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a tremendous achievement by our negotiating team. On behalf of the fishing industry I would like to pay a tribute in the House to Deputy Dr. Hillery and his team for what they have negotiated on our behalf.  I can understand people who are anti-Common Market and see that we are facing difficulties in our fishing industry, asking, when they see what has been negotiated: &ldquo;What is going to happen at the end of ten <Col N="1946" /> years?&rdquo; and saying that the death knell of our fisheries has been postponed for only ten years.  That is the argument. Of course, it will not be the death knell of our fisheries because speculation as to what will happen in ten years time is based on a faulty interpretation of what is now known as the &ldquo;review clause&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was said here that I was telling an untruth and that what was contained in the White Paper was untrue. This is not so.  In order to clarify the position let me make clear now a number of points about the review clause.  The agreement with the Communities specifies the arrangements on access which will apply in the initial ten-year period.  These are not simply transitional arrangements which will automatically lapse at the end of this period.  There is provision for a fair and open-minded review before the expiry of the ten-year period.  Under this review clause we have agreed with the Community that, before the expiry of the ten-year period, the Commission shall present a report concerning the economic and social development of the coastal areas of the member States and the state of fish stocks.  On the basis of that report and on the basis of the objectives of the common fisheries policy the council will examine the arrangements which will apply after the ten-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In agreeing to this provision, we received the categorical assurance of the Community that one of the major factors which will have to be taken into account in the Commission's report will be the state of development of the inshore fishing industry in each member State.  Moreover, we agreed that the council's examination will take particular account of the problems of those regions whose population, because of their special geographical situation, will continue to depend basically on inshore fishing.  These considerations are of specific importance and relevance to our fishing interests. The arrangement to apply after the initial ten-year period will be agreed by the council, taking full account of all these factors, and these arrangements will certainly include the maintenance of special limits where the <Col N="1947" /> fishing situation in a member State and, particularly, the position of coastal populations depending mainly on fisheries and the state of development of the inshore fishing industry so demand.</P>
    <P>We shall be a member of the council at this time, as will the other applicant countries, with a full voice and a vote in its deliberations.  We shall certainly be in a position to ensure that our national interest in the fishery sector will be fully provided for by all the necessary arrangements, including the maintenance of special limits.  The protocol to the Accession Treaty on the fisheries regime for Norway recognises explicitly that the derogations from the common access provisions may extend beyond 31st December, 1982.  We have been assured by the Community that the terms of the Norwegian protocol do not in any way affect the agreement reached by us in regard to the access regime and the arrangements in our regard which could follow those in force until the end of 1982.  I thought it necessary to make that point because of what some speakers have said here on the matter.  I hope the position is now clear.</P>

I cannot go along with that because up to 1964 we had only a three-mile limit and, as a result of the London convention, another nine miles were added to the limit, making it a total of 12 miles.  I think the people who negotiated that convention deserve our thanks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>This was confined to certain species of fish.  These countries were allowed to fish for certain species. As far as the west coast of Britain was <Col N="1950" /> concerned we were allowed to go on fishing there because we had habitually fished there.  I regard the extension of the limit from three miles to 12 miles as a very good achievement. If we did not allow this fishing to go on where people had been doing it over a long period of time, it would have been impossible to secure such an agreement.  I do not think we should belittle that here at this point in time, because it is true to say that since then we have benefited greatly from the extension of our limits to 12 miles and I say further that there is no reason why we should not continue to benefit.</P>
      <P>In my opening remarks, I mentioned that under the EEC arrangements, we still have the same measure of safeguard as we have at present for the sea areas from which our fishermen land over 90 per cent of their catch. Even as regards the remaining areas from which we land less than 10 per cent, it must not be overlooked that a degree of access is already afforded to certain States under the 1964 convention which I have dealt with, but on the positive side, our fishermen will have greatly increased access to the six to 12 mile belt along most of the west coast of Britain which is readily within our present reach.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed in this debate, I think, by Deputy Collins about the future of the herring industry. I think I am right in saying that he described what was achieved in Brussels, even in the last few moments, as a sell-out.  I should like to say that this criticism bears no relation whatsoever to the facts.  The true position is that the 12 miles exclusive fishery limit will still cover the whole of our northern and western coasts, giving the same protection for the north-west herring fishing as has existed heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the 50 per cent in Dunmore East is concerned, the catching power of the Irish fleet, as I referred to earlier, is continuing to increase and from what was a minimal part of the total catch, we have now got to 50 per cent and we are on the up and up all the time.  The trend is in the right direction and we sincerely hope it will continue in the right direction, and we have the facts to prove it.  I want to get back to deal with the Dunmore herrings because the herring stock there has been mentioned on at least three or four occasions.  This is the matter described by Deputy Collins as a sell-out in the EEC negotiations.</P>

      <P>The position, as I have stated already, is that six members of the EEC and four applicant countries, namely, Luxembourg, Italy, Denmark and Norway, enjoy fishing rights in the six to 12 miles belt on that part of the coast.  Of these four countries, Luxembourg has no fishing fleet and Italy does not engage in herring fishing anywhere near our exclusive fishery limits.  This leaves Denmark and Norway, and unless there is a complete collapse of the North Sea herring, I do not foresee any greater activity by Denmark or Norway in Dunmore East.</P>

This is because it is so adjacent to me.  Nevertheless, there is a matter in regard to Dunmore East which is worrying us a bit and it is not the one mentioned by Deputy Collins.  It is the conservation of the herring stocks and this has been engaging the attention of my Department for many years and has nothing at all to do with our entry to the EEC. This has been a problem for quite some time.  We are concerned about the survival of the stocks and I had discussions with the fishermen on this in Dunmore East and elsewhere many times.

      <P>I want to get back to the problem of Dunmore East because I know that even with his lack of understanding of the problems there, the Deputy will be very interested in regard to the conservation of stock because this is very important.  We have reached agreement on it, as I said, with the fishermen to raise this matter at the NorthEast Atlantic Fisheries Commission, which is the international organisation charged with the function of devising measures, where necessary, for the conservation of fish stocks in this part of the world.  The commission consists of 14 countries and a special study group of the commission met in Dublin in December, 1970 and reported on the position to the main body.  The commission is now considering adopting powers to introduce measures for regulating the amount of total catch, or the amount of fishing effort, or any other measure we can find to deal with this problem, the problem of the conservation of this very important Dunmore East stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very hard to get points home here.  Deputies seem to find it hard to understand.  There is something lacking: perhaps it is in myself.  What has been negotiated for the Irish fishing industry is well worth while and something which, as I said already, is appreciated and will be appreciated by the fishing industry. I should like to refer again to the <i>Irish Skipper</i> as regards what it contained in regard to Norway.  This was mentioned by Deputy Begley.  Deputy Keating and I agree that they have gained nothing more than we have. What faces us in regard to the EEC is a very important question.  If we are outside the EEC the industry which will suffer most, I would say, is fisheries. There is no future for our fisheries outside the EEC.  They would become a very doubtful proposition because 90 per cent of our fish exports go to Britain and the EEC countries. With Britain in, the levies, tariffs and restrictions that now apply to us in our exports to the EEC countries would then apply to our exports to Britain.  This would put us in a very difficult position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An enlarged EEC with Norway and Denmark in, would be an entirely different proposition as far as we are concerned.  It could well be, in these <Col N="1956" /> circumstances, that the EEC would become self-sufficient in regard to the species of fish we are interested in exporting to them.  We must consider this because this is the alternative the fishing industry would face.  Therefore, I say that a magazine like the <i>Irish Skipper</i> which is the only magazine of which I know circulating among fishermen in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

I ask them to ascertain the facts before they produce headings like that because even in this House they succeeded in misleading Deputy Begley.  I do not know about Deputy Kavanagh but evidently Deputy Keating was not taken in by it.  He does not agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe this is so because a magazine like this can mould their views and feelings.  It can get them to think along a particular line and if it does succeed in making them think along the wrong lines we must hold it responsible.  I have the responsibility, which I do not take lightly, of refuting this and saying that it bears no relation to the facts.  I ask <Col N="1957" /> all concerned with the future of the fishing industry to refrain from publishing articles like this.</P>
      <P>I must say I got co-operation in the House in the past 12 months when some Deputies, as I have already mentioned, were asking questions regarding the common access clause at a very difficult time for our negotiators and those responsible in Fisheries.  They were asking, as I said already&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, is it permissible for the Parliamentary Secretary to say again what he has already said five times?  Surely those in this House have some intelligence and do not require to have it repeated for the sixth time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the co-operation I got in this House and in order to do so I am going back to the type of question that was asked, in order to illustrate my point.  Those were questions in regard to the common access clause and I may say that if our negotiating team had not been successful in preventing common access from coming about it would have a detrimental effect on our fishing industry. At that time I asked some Deputies not to do anything that would break the confidence of those in the fishing industry because confidence was necessary if we were to continue building up the industry.  I must acknowledge that I got that co-operation from certain Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, they were on the Opposition benches. This co-operation was necessary and it came from Deputies who realised their responsibility.  I hope, therefore, that a magazine such as the <i>Irish Skipper</i> will realise its responsibilities. The confidence of the fishermen was not undermined by anything that happened in the past 12 months.  Perhaps that was because of the co-operation we sought and which was forthcoming. People were helpful and we had tremendous expansion in the past 12 months in the fishing industry.  There is evidence, if any were needed, of the <Col N="1958" /> confidence of the fishermen in their own industry.  They are the people who best know the industry and they had to put their hands in their pockets. They are the ones who would have to borrow to invest in a new boat. The expansion that we had in the number of boats which have comprised our fishing fleet during the past 12 months has been very gratifying and, better still, the amount of investment in the purchase of new and more up-to-date gear has been enormous.  Such investment is an indication of the confidence of the people involved in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Deputy will not be here to hear them. They are increasing and there might well be 70 by now.  Some queries have been raised regarding the two main regulations.  Apart from the matter of access, which I think I have dealt with fully, it was argued that the provisions in the EEC regulations about the freedom of vessels of all member states to land fish for sale here and to process it would cause a breakdown of the market for Irish fishermen.  I think Deputy Collins made this point.  I have <Col N="1961" /> denied those allegations before.  It is a different matter to say that we will not have power to prevent their landing fish here.  Deputy Begley mentioned the provision of facilities for foreign fishermen.  There is no obligation on us under EEC regulations to provide facilities for foreign fishermen to land here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to provide the same facilities for them as we provide for Irish fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>One aspect that appears to trouble some Deputies is the landing of fish by foreign vessels.  I should like to explain the position in as much detail as I can.  The idea behind the marketing concept in the EEC is that there is a single large market, not a series of different markets.  It is obvious that some Deputies did not fully realise what this regulation was about and I should like to explain it to them.  The responsibility for organising the marketing of one country's catch wherever it is landed will continue to rest on the producers' organisation in that country.  If in times of glut prices of the main species should fall to the withdrawal price level, the fishermen's organisation is required to withdraw the fish from the market and to bear a share of the cost of withdrawal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What percentage will they have to bear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>That detail will have to be worked out.  If the market guide prices are realistic the need to operate the withdrawal mechanism should not occur except in rare cases.  I want to make this point clear so that Deputy Collins can inform the fishermen in Dunmore East and around the coast. If the prices are good on the continent there will be no incentive for any continental fishermen to land fish in Ireland because this would mean a loss for him.  There should be no possibility anywhere in the Community of fish being sold on the <Col N="1962" /> market at less than the withdrawal price, even in the most adverse circumstances. If this should not prove to be the case the entire marketing procedures would break down and a new system would have to be devised.</P>
      <P>During the five-year transition period, any fish landed here by vessels of other member countries will be subject to an import duty commencing at the level of the present Common Market customs tariffs in operation against non-member countries and reducing each year during the five-year period. This should dispel any fears Deputies might have with regard to marketing arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that trawlers could land second-grade fish and cause a glut on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not possible. In addition, there will be amounts to be levied or paid based on the difference between the guide prices here and in the Community until, by the end of the transition period, the guide prices will be gradually adjusted to the same level.  No injury to our fishermen could arise if unsold fish were landed here from vessels of other member states of the Community for transport to European markets where a first sale would take place.  This operation would be merely a transport matter, not a marketing one.  Our transport industry would benefit from such extra business. I hope this has allayed the doubts of the Deputies with regard to the marketing regulations.  I should not like to think that they felt uneasy about this. Because of the future prospects for this industry in the EEC it is important that all Deputies should know what is involved.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins.  The answer is that the fish withdrawn from the market must be disposed of only for the following purposes as set out in one of the subsidiary marketing regulations:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1964" /> (1)  Free distribution of fish in the natural state to benevolent organisations or to charitable foundations or to people who have a right to receive public assistance because of insufficient means of subsistence;</P>
    <P>(2)  To use fresh or preserved for animal feeding;</P>

      <P>Again I want to point out that Deputies are confused; they do not appear to be listening.  If Deputy Begley was listening, he would know I had not said this before.  This question of the common customs tariff is very important no matter what Deputies may think.  This matter was referred to in the debate.  We have already imposed the common customs tariff by order made by the Government on 23rd December, 1971.  Heretofore there was no import duty on fresh, chilled or frozen fish other than a small duty on fish fillets and such like.  The adoption of the new duty was necessary because we shall have to abandon our quantitative restrictions on imports when the EEC fisheries regulations become applicable to us from 1st February, 1973, one month after we become members of the EEC.</P>

      <P>BIM were in the marketing of fish but, at the request of the fishermen themselves, they withdrew from the market.  With the setting up of the co-operatives around the countryside&mdash;and there are 17 registered co-ops at the moment&mdash;BIM undertook to assist the fishermen in handling and selling their own produce. Now when they have got the industry on its feet, they have handed over the selling to fishery people themselves, and I maintain that that was the right thing to do.  No one can look after their produce like the people themselves, <Col N="1967" /> and in this case the people are the fishermen.  They are glad to have the assistance of BIM which is readily available to them.  I am glad that is the position.  I am glad BIM are in close touch with the fishermen.  I am satisfied that they are doing a very good job.  We have no intention of turning back the clock.  It is progress we want to make.</P>

      <P>Even if we wanted to turn back the clock, even if we wanted to hand back the marketing to BIM, as it was in the sixties, the EEC marketing regulations are based on the first sale of fish by the fishermen themselves or by their own voluntary organisations on their behalf.  We could not turn back the clock.  The withdrawal mechanism must be operated by producers' organisations and these organisations must be established on the producers' own initiative.  This bears out what I have been saying. The producers are the best people to handle their own product.  They will handle it in the best interests of themselves and the consumers.</P>
      <P>It would not be acceptable for the State or a semi-State body to perform the function of withdrawing fish from the market except in the case of sardines and anchovies where it was not feasible for various local reasons to establish producers' organisations. We are not interested in the catching of the sardines.  So far as the species we do catch are concerned, the fishermen must come together to form their own producers' organisation if they are to benefit from the EEC price support system.  The fishermen will have all the advice and guidance we can give them in setting up these organisations or in adapting existing organisations. We are willing and anxious to give this assistance.  I know it will be appreciated by the people involved in the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to Article 4 (1) of the EEC main marketing regulations. Deputies do not appear to be paying the attention they should pay to such an important matter as this. It was suggested that BIM should <Col N="1968" /> operate the inspection scheme to determine whether fish offered for sale comply with the common marketing standards.  The grading of fish must be done by experts appointed by the producers or their organisations under Article 4 (1) of the EEC main marketing regulations.  The inspection to see that this work is accurately carried out must be performed by, to quote the regulation, member states.  We interpret this to mean in our case my Department.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the Government's policy with regard to the development and the expansion of the fishing industry.  All our actions in regard to fisheries over the past ten years since the White Paper to which I have referred was issued have been geared to this main objective.  We will continue to promote this policy.  One aspect of sea fishing policy that was advocated by a number of Deputies was that we should have a deep sea fleet.  Deputy Collins was interested in this.  The Deputies who referred to this did not elaborate on what precisely they had in mind.  It is appropriate that I should quote from a reply I gave to the House in answer to a question on this subject on 17th June, 1971.  The reply was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sea fishing in this country has developed on traditional lines based on inshore fishing, but for a number of years past, the addition to the <Col N="1972" /> fleet of larger fishing vessels, ranging in size up to 90 feet long and equipped with the most modern electronic and other fishing aids, has been encouraged by State grant and loan incentives.  With these vessels it will be feasible not only to fish intensively as hitherto inside our own exclusive fishery limits but also, if necessary, to exploit the fish stocks on the Continental Shelf outside those limits.  If the Deputy's reference to deep water fishing relates to fishing by much larger vessels in distant waters, I should say that there are no plans for immediate expansion in this direction, as the economics of the operation would seem to be relatively unattractive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to enlighten the Deputies further I should add, however, that the whole subject of the relative merits of inshore and deep sea fishing is watched from time to time in case circumstances should change and thus warrant a change of policy. We are keeping this constantly under review.  At all times the best interests of our fishing industry and the welfare of our fishermen will be served and we will not adopt what would be for us a new fishing system merely because other countries not so well endowed with inshore fishing as we are have been forced by circumstances to practise fishing far distant from their landing places and markets.  I should like to elaborate on this a little further.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but if the Deputy would listen I might be able to get across to him and to the other Deputies the truth about this matter.  Some Deputies simply ask why we did not go in for the long distance fishing, deep sea fishing, in other words.  You would have to ask yourself why should we do this because we have right around our shores this very valuable resource which I might say we have never fully exploited.  We are moving a long way towards it but until we have fully exploited this resource <Col N="1973" /> around our shores why should we travel off to some distant waters to catch fish of which we have a plentiful supply here at home?  The Deputies who follow this line of thinking say that the Danes, the Norwegians, the Poles and the French have long distance fleets.  Some Deputies mentioned the catching power of Norway and other countries.  They have to come almost half way across the world to fish in the waters outside our fishing limits because, as somebody said, the waters around the coast of the countries mentioned do not contain the same valuable fish stocks as the waters around our coasts.  Why, therefore, should we go chasing off to waters which have not got the valuable stocks we have here?  Our policy is, then, to continue to develop this short distance fishing, this inshore fishing.  This is what our fishermen are seeking.  They are not asking for the bigger trawlers for long distance fishing.  The fishermen, who are the best judges of their own interests and of their own industry, know what they want.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor complained about the lack of fish processing facilities in County Clare.  At least we have gone from Kerry to Clare.  I should like to say that the provision of State grants for fish processing facilities is dealt with by the Industrial Development Authority and no worthwhile project is turned down.  My Department are always willing to support any viable projects.  It must be borne in mind, however, that the initiative for any project is a matter for private enterprise in the first instance.  The State cannot force private enterprise to set up processing factories in any particular areas.  Generous State grants are available to them to encourage investment, particularly in the western counties such as County Clare.  I assure Deputy Taylor that if he finds any private investors who are willing to go into this type of processing in that county we will give them all the assistance we possibly can and I know the IDA will look on it favourably if it is a viable project.</P>

      <P>Deputies seem to be anxious that I should deal only with all the points raised during the debate. It would be unfair to Deputies who raised matters during the debate to deal with the question now asked by the Deputy.  Some other time when I have more time available to me I will deal with the Deputy's question. There are Deputies here since early tonight waiting for answers and for information with regard to aspects of the fishing industry they are interested in. In regard to Deputy Taylor's complaint about processing facilities for County Clare, I think I have made the position perfectly clear to him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Begley mentioned fishery harbours.  The funny thing is that he stated here last year that I read out a lot of harbours around our coasts which we proposed to develop and which had been inspected and were about to be inspected by our survey team. The funny thing about it is that a colleague of his, in the debate last year, said it was ridiculous going into all those places with the queer names, which he himself said he found difficulty in pronouncing&mdash;indeed, I had great trouble in my introductory speech in reading 25 or 26 place names. When a colleague of Deputy Begley objected to this, I decided that it was better to omit such detail on this occasion, so as not to hurt anybody's feelings.</P>
      <P>That does not mean that the development of the harbours has stopped, that it is not progressing.  It is progressing.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with this very important matter that has come up with regard to the development of our fishery harbours.  I think it was Deputy Begley who said that the Government were not putting the money into it that they should put into it.  I want to point out that the Government are providing more money each year than is being spent on harbours.  It is not possible to spend all this money quickly in a short period of time.  It is not possible to spend money in that manner.</P>

      <P>Seeing that the Deputies do not understand my remark or, if they understand it, are certainly misinterpreting it, I want to say that the fact that more money is being provided by the Government than we are able to spend arises in many ways.  There are only certain times in the year when work can be carried out on development of harbours.  During wet weather it is not possible to carry out the work. There is another cause of delay.  Deputy Coogan mentioned Rossaveel.  This is typical of what happens in many harbour developments.  A development may be ready to take place; the scheme has been designed by the OPW; the money has been provided and then the local people say, as they have said in Rossaveel, that they are not satisfied with what we were doing and with the way it was being done by the Board of Works and wanted changes made.  This happened specifically in the case of Rossaveel.</P>

      <P>There is a vast difference. I shall now give the facts of the case, just for the record, in order to avoid any more woolly thinking in connection with the matter.  The facts are that the detailed scheme which was prepared in the Office of Public Works and which would implement fully the recommendations that had been made by the survey team in February, 1969, was approved and submitted by my Department to Donegal County Council in July, 1970, for acceptance by them and by the Harbour Commissioners in the normal manner.  Before it could be cleared locally between the county council and the Harbour Commissioners the fishermen made representations to me at a meeting that I had with them in Moville on 8th October, 1970&mdash;proof again that I get around to all parts of the country and to the fishermen.</P>

      <P>Let me continue.  At that meeting the fishermen asked me&mdash; I should like to emphasise this&mdash;to make a number of changes in the scheme already approved.  They also asked that some additional work be <Col N="1978" /> included.  As a result of this request, the Office of Public Works made a complete resurvey of the harbour and designed a new scheme.  These are the things that I mentioned earlier that happen.  I am now giving the facts with regard to Moville.  This new scheme was designed specifically to meet the fishermen's wishes.  The scheme was put to the fishermen at a meeting held in Moville on 8th June, 1971, and they accepted it unanimously.</P>

It is a very fine publication and worthy of a body such as BIM.  But they did not know, and we did not give them any information nor were we in a position to give them information, when this Estimate would come before this House so that they could get their report out before then.

I want to refer again to Dunmore East. Deputy E. Collins suggested that a protection vessel and a helicopter should be based at Dunmore East.

So far as helicopters are concerned their work in this vital field is confined to spotting vessels.

      <P>I want to read this item on the veto.  We have had much comment on what will happen after ten years.  On page 3 of this issue there is an article on fisheries.  It reads:</P>
      <P>On page 13 of this issue we print the section on fisheries from the Government's White Paper on Common Market membership.</P>
      <P>Like the official explanation of the negotiations which appeared in the January issue, it is important reading.</P>
      <P>But amidst all the political speeches and handouts on the subject of our entry very little has been said about the veto which the Six will continue to possess after actual membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This veto virtually makes the new entrants second-class members, despite <Col N="1985" /> the impression we have been given.</P>
    <P>For instance, when the review clause comes up before 1982, if a proposal is put forward by Ireland to preserve 12 miles for a further number of years, any of the Six original members can veto it.</P>
    <P>This makes nonsense of the terms of the review clause as accepted by Ireland, Britain and Denmark.</P>
    <P>But Norway, which did not allow itself to be rushed in willy-nilly, has been promised special consideration.</P>
    <P>This comment bears no relation to facts.  It can do nothing but harm. We are trying to expand and develop. The people who write this type of stuff should show responsibility to the industry they are supposed to have an interest in.  This can do nothing but harm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Today, at Question Time, I asked the Minister for Finance &ldquo;what steps have been taken by him to release money from the 1972-73 Budget to improve the employment position&rdquo; and the Minister's reply was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October, 1971, the Government took a number of measures aimed at boosting the level of employment and output.  These measures included the allocation of an extra £20 million for spending under the public capital programme in the present financial year.  In January last, following a review of the position by the Government, the Taoiseach announced certain further measures to stimulate economic activity including an indication that the public capital programme for next year would show a further substantial increase and that capital allocations for the year could be drawn upon by Departments and other public bodies during the remainder of the present year ending <Col N="1986" /> on 31st March in order to get works going and stimulate activity in the economy right away.</P>
    <P>It is not yet possible to indicate the extent to which money from next year's capital programme will be needed under this arrangement to supplement the revised level of the 1971-72 capital programme.</P>
    <P>In a supplementary question I asked him if he could say what had happened so far and could he tell me what money had been released and eventually he said that £1 million had been given to the building industry.  He seemed to think that this £1 million which came out of the first £20 million had, in fact, saved the building industry.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the unemployment position since the £20 million was given has been deteriorating rapidly: on 8th October, 1971, there were 56,912 signing as unemployed; on 4th February, 1972, the figure had reached 79,556 and I am quite sure the next figure will be over 80,000. More interesting still is the fact that in mid-October there were 119 building workers and 248 maintenance workers added to the register and in mid-November a further 173 building workers and 502 maintenance workers; in mid-December 1,256 building workers and 616 maintenance workers were added to the register.  That is the answer to the Minister's claim today that the £1 million given to the building industry had, in fact, kept people in employment.  I have quoted the figures now and I should like him to try to refute them, if he can.</P>
    <P>A number of questions were not reached today and Deputy Barry Desmond had one down to which he asked for a written reply.  It was Question No. 138.  He got a written reply. The question was addressed to the Minister for Local Government:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government (a) the housing schemes and (b) the sanitary schemes sanctioned by his Department arising from the recent revision of the State capital programme; and if he will state in respect of each scheme the date it was first submitted to his Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1987" /> The reply was:</P>
    <P>As the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The list is given of housing and sanitary schemes sanctioned by the Department of Local Government.  It is interesting to note that some of the schemes were referred to the Department as far back as 1968.  They have now been sanctioned.  In my own county a housing scheme for Athboy was submitted on 30th October, 1968; the Minister says it is now sanctioned. With regard to sanitary services schemes, he says that, as far as Meath is concerned, the Ashborne water sewerage extension to Nine Mile Stone, which was submitted on 8th February, 1971, has now been sanctioned.  This is the sort of codology that the Government and the Department of Local Government have been carrying on. Not one penny has been made available for these schemes.  They have been sanctioned&mdash;full stop.  There has been no permission to borrow from the Local Loans Fund and the result is that, while the schemes have been sanctioned on paper, nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to some interesting sidelights on this whole matter.  On 28th April, 1971, in Volume 253, when introducing the Budget, Deputy Colley, Minister for Finance, said that the Government were determined to keep down costs and had cut the proposals put to the Department of Finance by the various Departments by roughly £75 million.  This was an effort to keep down costs and the Minister was apparently very happy.  At column 697 he said:</P>
    <P>We decided that the rise in Government spending would have to be moderated and the original current and capital expenditure programme of £797 million for 1971-72 has been reduced to the total of £721 million &mdash;an increase of 9½ per cent on last year's outturn.  This very substantial reduction, which was not achieved without difficulty, represents the main effort of my budgetary policy <Col N="1988" /> for 1971-72 and is of much greater significance for our economic wellbeing than the charges I shall announce today.</P>
    <P>On 27th October, 1971, in Volume 256, he had a different story to tell.  At column 331 he said he was increasing the capital programme by £20 million.</P>
    <P>The increase of some £20 million brings the public capital programme total to £213 million for the current year and should serve as a useful and immediate stimulus to the economy.  The financing of the extra £15 million draw on the Exchequer can be achieved without recourse to sources of finance other than those foreshadowed in the April Budget.</P>
    <P>In April the Minister for Finance reduces the amount required to run the capital programme by £75 million and says that, on the advice of his experts, this is the right thing to do.  He comes along in October and has to produce out of the hat £20 million more than he had budgeted for in April for the purpose of ensuring something will be done, according to himself, to relieve unemployment.  I suggest that either the advice is bad or the Minister is bad. He makes a cut in April and in a few months time he comes along and says that he was wrong in doing that.  He did not ask the question the Taoiseach asked when he was Minister for Finance: &ldquo;What went wrong?&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance might well have asked last October: &ldquo;What went wrong?&rdquo;  He found the country in a very bad position because he had pared off £75 million in April and, in October, he has to find another £20 million.  I suggest this whole thing was a trick.  Either the £20 million worth of work had been done and the money expended and this was designed to give the impression that the Government were putting money in or else the money was not there and was not injected into the economy because, with the exception of the £1 million for housing mentioned by the Minister, no other scheme has been mentioned into which any money has been put.  I am sure the Minister knows that unemployment has been growing steadily, as indicated by the figures I have given.</P>
    <P>On 19th January of this year the <Col N="1989" /> Taoiseach decided to take a hand in the game.  At column 59 of Volume 258 he said:</P>
    <P>An extra £20 million was allocated for capital spending in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>At column 60 he said:</P>
    <P>To maintain the atmosphere of confidence which these measures represent, the Government have reviewed their investment plans for the period ahead and have now fixed the 1972-73 public capital programme at a level which is substantially higher than the revised level of the 1971-72 programme.  The result of this is that something of the order of £240 million will be spent in 1972-73.  This is about £50 million more than the initial figure announced for 1971-72 and represents a further increase of over £20 million on the higher revised figures for that year.  Most of the extra spending relates to activities in which the employment content is relatively short, so that this will make the maximum possible contribution towards reducing unemployment and redundancy.</P>
    <P>The decision to increase the 1972-73 programme will take effect immediately.  Departments and other public bodies may draw immediately on their 1972-73 allocations in order to get works going and stimulate activity in the economy right away.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister today would he tell me what programme had been put forward and what works were being dealt with in this way and the Minister could not do so.  In fact, those of us who are involved in trying to find employment for people who are unemployed and trying to safeguard jobs for those in employment find that nowhere can we get any evidence that any effort in this direction has been made by the Government or by any Department, with the possible exception of the building trade where the Minister says they have been notified that an extra £1 million is being made available.  I cannot even find evidence of that being notified as being available for spending.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1990" /> We find that no local authority have been notified that they can reemploy people whom they have laid off and that the moneys will be backed up by State funds on any job.  No public works have been started which will employ people who are out of a job.  The Department of Lands have not been notified that they can reemploy the forestry and Land Commission workers whom they had to lay off because of shortage of money.  The Board of Works have not been informed that they can give employment to people whom they had to lay off because of shortage of money.  Would the Minister, in the time he gets tonight, give me the answer to my question which he could not give me today as to where the money has gone? Is this just a confidence trick being played on the unemployed because the money that we thought, and they thought, would be there to give them a job in order to put a few pounds in their pockets which they require to feed themselves and their wives and families does not appear to have been made available?</P>
    <P>There is no use whatever in the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government, trying to give the impression that sanctioning schemes is all he has to do.  He must make the money available.  In my own area I notice that he has sanctioned a small scheme to the Nine Mile Stone in Ashbourne and it went in in April, 1971.  That scheme will cost, perhaps, £9,000 or £10,000, but he has not made the money available to do it, nor has he sanctioned the working drawings for a £250,000 sewerage scheme for Mornington which has been in his Department for the best part of 12 months.  He has not sanctioned isolated cottages&mdash;45 cottages&mdash;urgently required in County Meath and hundreds of such houses all over the country. They have been held up by the Department for months and when sanction comes, no sanction is given for the borrowing of the money.  If this is a breakdown in communications between the Minister for Finance and the other Ministers.  I am sure the Minister will do something about it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this thing has been happening and does appear to be <Col N="1991" /> something planned for the purpose of giving the impression of doing something that is not being done.  We hear a lot about the &ldquo;Great Train Robbery&rdquo;, but I suggest that a great Cabinet robbery is going on.  I believe that the Department of Finance are working a confidence trick on the public, with the assistance of the Taoiseach and every member of the Government, giving the impression that they are doing things which they are not doing.  These are harsh words and I am sorry to have to say them to the Minister whom I regard as a personal friend of mine, but I believe that unless he is prepared to take this in hand, not one shilling, old or new, will be spent until after the next Budget is brought in.</P>
    <P>The gentlemen who handle the financial affairs of the State are very good at giving the impression that certain figures can be written in and that that, fed out to the public, is sufficient, but it will not feed hungry children. The Minister might as well make up his mind here and now that this sort of codology being carried on, not for the first time, by this Government is not going to be accepted any longer.  We want to know where the money has gone if it has been spent; we want to know if it was allocated at all or if it ever existed.  When Deputy Corish was speaking in the debate and when I was speaking, both of us made the one point&mdash;would the money be made available immediately for schemes which were ready for sanction and could be put into operation at once? While we were not assured categorically that that would be so, the impression was given that we were stupid to suggest that it would not be done; but we are not that stupid and I want to know now from the Minister what exactly has been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister may, perhaps, say that it is unfair to throw the question at him when he has not had an opportunity of checking back with his Department and that he will be able to give me better information in a few days time. I would accept that, provided I do get the information, but I want to point out that the question has been down for several weeks.  Because of the way <Col N="1992" /> questions have been tied up, it has not been possible to get replies, so therefore there should have been an adequate opportunity for the Minister to get the information he requires.</P>
    <P>I would finally say that one thing I regret here tonight is having to keep the staff of the House, and you, Sir, back half an hour after normal time to have this debate, but I felt, and so did my colleagues, that it should be done because of the fact that the reply we got today from the Minister was so ludicrous in the circumstances that if we let it pass, we would not be doing our duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to a certain amount of oratory from Deputy Tully but we have not heard very many facts.  Just as a minor example of how disregarding of the facts he is, he said that this question was down for weeks but could not be reached because of the backlog of questions.  That statement simply is not correct.  My questions were cleared yesterday and the ones I dealt with today were the ones down for today.  I merely mention it as an example of the way he is playing fast and loose with facts.</P>
      <P>Let me deal first with the point he raised, which I think is a fair one, of contrasting the statement I made in connection with the Budget with the pumping in of additional capital later.  The fact of the matter is that if the Budget had not taken the line it did&mdash;and incidentally it did not cut back expenditure; it allowed for increased expenditure but it cut it back in relation to what was proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that if that stance had not been taken in the Budget, in the context of our whole economic situation, we would today be in a far worse position than we are in, but the economic circumstances which have developed since, and, in particular, the economic recession which is taking <Col N="1993" /> place abroad, in export markets, and in Britain, and which is directly affecting us&mdash;leaving aside any effect of political developments and speaking only in economic terms&mdash;have been such as to create the economic difficulties with which we are all familiar and its consequent effect on unemployment. If the Government had failed to respond to those adverse economic developments for doctrinaire reasons, Deputy Tully would have a great deal of complaint to make, and he would be right if he did.  I will never, as long as I am Minister for Finance, adopt a doctrinaire approach in regard to matters of this kind.  That is the background and one has to look at the context in which these decisions are made.</P>
      <P>It may appear, and I think it is a fair debating point, that this is simply a question of going one way and not going the other.  I should prefer to think it is a question of reacting quickly to economic developments and economic developments today are taking place at a very fast rate.  Changes are taking place at a fast rate and if the Government fail to respond we would be in serious difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We would be in much more serious difficulties.  In October, I announced details of an additional £20 million State capital expenditure. Deputy Tully quoted unemployment figures and particularly unemployment figures in the building industry.  I must point out that we said when we were discussing the unemployment problem that we expected further increases in unemployment although, incidentally, the seasonal increase over Christmas was less this year than last year.  If we had not taken the action we took those increases would be substantially greater, particularly in relation to the figures quoted for unemployment in the building industry by Deputy Tully. These do not prove what he seems to think they prove.  They prove there is difficulty in the building industry but he forgets that a large part of the building industry is related to the private sector and substantially what <Col N="1994" /> the Government have been doing is putting more money into the public sector where the expenditure in the private sector has been falling.</P>
      <P>I must mention the October situation as well as the recent announcement by the Taoiseach.  If one is to put the matter in perspective one must have regard to this and that is why I referred to it in the reply and why it was referred to in the supplementary questions.  The major items involved in that were announced.  Deputy Tully asked again what they were and, briefly, they covered such items as agricultural credit, industrial grants, other agricultural grant schemes, money for An Taiscí Stáit, which was investment in industry, telephones, housing and schools.  These were the main items.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>I am coming to that. I am absolutely certain, as certain as one can be of anything of this nature in my position without personally standing over the actual expenditure money, that when the accounts are made up at 31st March it will be quite clear that this additional £20 million over and above the capital programme has been spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy appreciates the position.  A public capital programme is planned, as the Deputy knows, for the year and in the normal way in such things as housing and all the other items I have mentioned, you do not just put in additional money and there and then get results.  It takes a little time to spend this kind of money.  In fact what was done in the case of the Department of Local Government was to pick out the schemes which virtually there and then could go ahead and create employment almost immediately.  Schemes which did not come into that category had to await their turn but schemes were picked out all over the country and I know quite a number of schemes that have proceeded and the money has been made available for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1995" /> Deputy Tully referred to some schemes in his own constituency and said: &ldquo;Some schemes were sanctioned but that does not mean anything.&rdquo; Does the Deputy really mean that? For instance, if the sanctions that have been given in respect of schemes in the Deputy's constituency were withdrawn would the Deputy be concerned?</P>

I cannot tell him precisely at this stage because I have not the figures but I can say that a substantial portion of it has been spent and all of it will have been spent by the end of the financial year, which is what was proposed and announced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with the effect of the further decisions announced by the Taoiseach about bringing forward schemes for the 1972-73 programme. The real effect is to cut red tape in many of these schemes.  The actual expenditure in this financial year may not be very substantial but the effect of the immediate sanctioning of cases which would have gone back into the next financial year is to bring schemes forward by a period of at least two <Col N="1997" /> months, or perhaps more, and get them going at least two months or more earlier.  These are schemes on which people will be employed and on which they would not be employed for at least two, or perhaps more, months if this was not done.  That is the practical effect of it.</P>

      <P>One of the results of the decision to bring forward schemes of that nature in relation to local government was the immediate release of £2.2 million worth of sanitary services £2.5 million in respect of housing loans.  The immediate release of those sums, although the expenditure may not take place in this financial year, is that the schemes will start that much sooner. <Col N="1998" /> Deputies opposite know that this is so. They know the mechanics of the business but they are playing to the gallery in suggesting what they have suggested.  The fact is that the £20 million is being expended.  Other schemes have been brought forward that much earlier and if Deputy Tully is really serious he will stand up now when I finish and say: &ldquo;Withdraw the sanctions in my constituency; they are not worth the paper they are written on.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Virtually all telephone subscribers, including those in Dame Street, Templeogue and Terenure areas, received their copies of the 1972 directories before the end of January.  A few subscribers may not have received their directories owing to, for example, inability to gain access to the premises, isolated failures by delivery staff, <i>et cetera</i>.  Directories will be delivered immediately on request in any such cases.</P>
