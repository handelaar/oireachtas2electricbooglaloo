      <P>It is proposed to take Business in the following order: Nos. 1, 2, 7, inclusive, and No. 24. Questions will be taken at 3 p.m.  It is agreed to take all stages of the Value-Added Tax Bill and to sit, if necessary, until midnight.  There will be a luncheon break at 1.30 p.m. until 3 p.m.  It is proposed to take the Ministers and Secretaries Bill, to conclude, immediately after Questions.</P>

      <P>I think there was a misunderstanding. An indication was given of the desire to have the Ministers and Secretaries Bill and it was suggested by the Leader of the Opposition that it might be appropriate to take it during lunchtime in order to give those involved a break in the sequence of Business but, if the Taoiseach agrees that the House will continue until midnight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government Whips office got in touch with me at about 10.27 last night suggesting there would be a break between 1.30 p.m. and 3 p.m. this afternoon.  I said I personally had no objection to that <Col N="1247" /> but let it be brought up on the Order of Business.  As far as I and my party are concerned, we agree to a luncheon break.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That deals with the Mid-Cork by-election.  The Leader of the Deputy's party raised this matter here last Thursday morning, asking a <Col N="1248" /> direct question: When was it proposed to move the writ?  Since then, the Fine Gael Party have decided to move the writ themselves.  Ever since last Thursday and, indeed, long before last Thursday, they knew that such a writ would require four days notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They also knew that the House was due to adjourn next Friday for the summer recess.  They could have moved that writ, or submitted the motion for the writ, any time between Thursday last and Monday, knowing they would be within the rules and within Standing Orders in doing so.  I suggest they deliberately delayed putting down that motion until yesterday and I suggest, too, that there is a little bit of gamesmanship involved.  Obviously they anticipate that we will oppose the motion under Standing Orders.  However, if the Fine Gael Party wish to move the motion, this party will have no objection to their moving it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 21 and 22 and to substitute the following: &ldquo;&lsquo;body of persons&rsquo; means any body politic, corporate, or collegiate, and any company, partnership, fraternity, fellowship and society of persons, whether corporate or not corporate;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The House may recall that the definition here was amended in Committee. That amended definition was criticised during the debate on Committee Stage as being complicated and confusing. It was suggested that it would be better to set out the definition in full.  I am endeavouring to do this here.  The amended definition is that contained in section 1 of the Income Tax Act of 1967 with the addition of the word &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; after &ldquo;company&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 33, after &ldquo;extension&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;material&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the discussion on Committee Stage I was proposing that there should be a modification of the word &ldquo;alteration&rdquo; because an alteration can be something relatively unimportant. It can involve very little work. Certainly it could be something that could not be described reasonably as being a development.  At the time the Minister suggested that my amendment was not phrased happily and there was some suggestion that the phrase &ldquo;material alteration&rdquo; would improve the matter.  The phrase &ldquo;materially altered&rdquo; is used in subsection (b) of this particular definition.  Therefore, I propose that the definition should read</P>
      <P>&ldquo;development&rdquo;, in relation to any land, means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the construction, demolition, extension, material alteration or reconstruction of any building on the land or...</P>
      <P>This is necessary because I do not think it is the intention that if somebody makes a minor alteration, possibly inside a house which involves, perhaps, putting in a different type of window or changing a door, that should represent a development.  It is clear that some restriction is required on the word &ldquo;alteration&rdquo; to make it unnecessary for the Revenue Commissioners to insist that any change in the house is development and to enable them to tolerate as not being development modifications inside the house which are not of material importance. Perhaps the Minister will agree that this amendment will help in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition here reproduces exactly the definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo; in section 16 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, in regard to income tax.  A development which is not material would be ruled out by the general rule of law which provides that <i>de minimis non curat lex.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1253" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Revenue Commissioners sufficiently &ldquo;<i>lex</i>&rdquo; for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They must observe the law like anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the experience that they &ldquo;<i>curat</i>&rdquo; very small things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In these circumstances the amendment would not assist in clarifying the definition.  Indeed, if it were to be inserted at all, it would be more appropriate that it ought qualify &ldquo;extension&rdquo; also.  It is true that the word &ldquo;materially&rdquo; is used in paragraph 3 but it may well be true that its use there is superfluous, at least it qualifies only the single phrase &ldquo;altered-use&rdquo;.  In general my attitude to this amendment is that while it is aimed at clarifying the position it does not do so.  Therefore, since it does not help, I do not propose to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister is correct in that?  It is all right to say that <i>de minimis non curat lex</i> is a sound legal principle but as I understand it, when the Revenue Commissioners are collecting tax they do not ignore a sum because it is less than, say, £5.  They are required to collect any sum that is outstanding.  The principle which may be applied by the courts is one that cannot be applied by the Revenue Commissioners.  Therefore, I do not see how it is relevant here when we are talking of a law to be applied by the Revenue Commissioners. I suppose somebody could appeal to the courts and the courts might reverse the ruling of the Revenue Commissioners on a particular point but we are concerned here with devising the law in such a way as to facilitate its operation by the Revenue Commissioners. If it is necessary to talk of &ldquo;materially altered use&rdquo; it is logical that the alteration which gives rise to that should also have to be a material alteration.  If I understood the Minister correctly, he seemed worried lest my use of the adjective &ldquo;material&rdquo; might be held to govern the word &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo; as well as the word <Col N="1254" />&ldquo;alteration&rdquo;.  If that is his concern it seems to me to be a rather poor point.</P>
      <P>He made the point that at least under (b) the word &ldquo;materially&rdquo; only doubles the one phrase &ldquo;altered use&rdquo;.  The implication seems to be that in the other case it might double the second as well as the first words. I cannot feel that it would do any harm if a reconstruction had to be material to be recognised as a development. If the Minister feels he has a point one could alter the order of words to say &ldquo;reconstruction or material alteration of any building&rdquo;. It might be a more logical order of words in the circumstances.  &ldquo;Construction&rdquo;, &ldquo;demolition&rdquo; and &ldquo;extension&rdquo; are all fairly substantial activities, as is &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo;.  It is &ldquo;alteration&rdquo; which gives rise to the difficulty.  And it would be more logical to put it at the end and to be preceded by the word &ldquo;material&rdquo;.  I wonder if the Minister, on reflection, would consider that it would be a worthwhile change to accept, if necessary, changing the order of words to meet what may have been his point.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 4, to delete lines 20 and 21. This was discussed on Committee <Col N="1255" /> Stage and out of the discussion there emerged from the Minister, I think, an indication that he might consider the definition of the word &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; for special purposes in this Bill by actually using the words &ldquo;making or assembling&rdquo; as they only arose at one or two points.  I think he said they arose at only two points in the Bill.  I can only find them at two points.  I looked where he said and found them there, both relating to the Fourth Schedule.  In view of the fact that the nett number of words in the Bill will not be materially altered by using &ldquo;making or assembling&rdquo; for &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; and as he conceded on Committee Stage there could be some merit in avoiding a definition of the word &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; here which is more narrow and restrictive than the normal meaning of the word, I had hoped he would come forward with an amendment.  On the assumption that he has overlooked it, hopefully, and with a view to helping him I put it down myself as it seemed to be in tune with the general spirit of the debate on Committee Stage and in line with what he was then thinking he might do.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in sections 12, 15 and 27.  I appreciate Deputy FitzGerald's concern to be of assistance but it may be somewhat misdirected. Because of its appearance in three sections it was considered desirable to have the definition which is included in section 1.  It is given a restrictive meaning so as to ensure that only those persons who make or assemble goods of a kind specified in the Fourth Schedule, such as motor cars, radios, television sets, <i>et cetera</i>, would be accountable for tax at the 30.26 rate.  I do not think it would be appropriate if a person who carried out some subsidiary process, such as painting or polishing work, were to be regarded as a manufacturer and be liable at the 30.26 per cent rate.  For these <Col N="1256" /> reasons I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I may not have paid sufficient attention but I did not understand the Minister to give reasons for not accepting the amendment.  He seemed to give reasons for defining &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; in this way in the Bill, for having to limit the concept of &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; in the Bill in this way, but I do not think he gave reasons, if I heard him correctly, for doing it by definition rather than by using the words of the definition in what we now understand to be the three places in which it arises.  Surely the Minister will agree that in the absence of any reason for proceeding by this method in the definition section the other procedure of saying what we mean at the particular points instead of importing a definition of &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; into the Bill which does not correspond with the normal usage of the word or with usage in other legislation, would be a better procedure.  I would urge the Minister in the absence of any reason for doing otherwise to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 4, after line 43, to add &ldquo;provided that this day shall not be earlier than 1st March, 1973&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises the whole question of the date of introduction of this new tax. Even since our debate on Committee Stage I have had further representations on this point.  It is evident that 1st November is a singularly unfortunate date to choose as there seems to be almost universal opposition to it.  From the point of view of the people concerned in industry any date <Col N="1257" /> after Christmas becomes acceptable from the point of view of the level of stocks although it does seem desirable to leave more time for people to become accustomed to the new concept in the Bill and educate them into it. The Minister said in the Special Committee that if 1st November were not to be the date it would have to be 1st March.  I do not recall the reason he gave, if he gave one.</P>
    <P>Let me say at this point that we are in considerable difficulty because, although I asked at the very outset of the Special Committee that steps be taken that the reports of that committee would be available promptly they have not become available promptly.  I received this morning the report of session No. 5 which occurred a fortnight ago.  I have not yet received reports of certain sessions of the Special Committee.  It is very difficult, in fact, impossible, properly to amend this Bill on Report Stage if one has no record of what was said and agreed in the Special Committee.  It puts a very great onus on Deputies if in a Special Committee they must not merely argue their points but must also make a record simultaneously for their own purposes of what the Minister said in reply so that they can act appropriately in putting down amendments for the Report Stage.  If we are to have Special Committees or any committees of the House operating successfully we must overcome this problem.  The Minister is the Minister responsible.  I urge him to consider this matter further.  In this House we operate under an extraordinary constraint, which I personally regard as intolerable, in that the House has no power to order its own affairs but that the provision of staff or equipment of any kind must be authorised by the Minister for Finance.  That a parliament should be in the undignified position of being incapable of making provision for its own efficient operation and that a Government Minister has power to veto that seems to be contrary to the very principle of parliamentary democracy.  So long as that system exists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The case for such a postponement is very strong.  It is clear from the work which was done on this Bill that in this House itself we have difficulties in coming to grips fully with this new system of taxation though we have a special function in the matter, a special duty to be familiar with it and a special opportunity to be familiar with it.  Yet we found it extremely difficult.  The Minister himself frequently throughout this debate has had to consult with his officials to explain complex points. I do not fault him on that.  I am sure that if I were in the same position I would have to engage in a similar process of consultation.

      <P>Any of us who have been dealing with the retail and wholesale trades people and manufacturers recognise the work they have done on the Bill.  The people who are expert on it and are concerned with it in these organisations have a grasp of the problems involved.  For that grasp to percolate to all the people in these sectors will take time.  I had not appreciated when we began to consider this matter just how complex the Bill was.  Until I studied it myself I had the rather naïve view that this did not involve any very radical change in the system of taxation and that, therefore, it was something that should not be too difficult to implement.  It is only in coming to grips with it that I have realised how difficult it will be for people in the different sectors of trade and in every walk of life to grasp the method of operation and to adjust their working to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One feature of this legislation is <Col N="1262" /> the way it shifts the liquidity position between different stages of the trade. There is a significant shift occurring between the retail trade and wholesalers and manufacturers.  From the manufacturers viewpoint the period of liquidity is affected adversely by some weeks, whereas on the retailer's side there is a beneficial effect.  It seems that the wholesalers, retailers and manufacturers will have to put considerable work into an adjustment in their credit arrangements to ensure that the shift in the liquidity position of these different sectors does not operate detrimentally.  There will be a strong case for manufacturers to make for shortening the period of credit to retailers so that they are not put in a disadvantageous position and that retailers do not have a net gain in their credit period which they do not really need and which would be unfair to manufacturers.  The negotiations involved in arranging even that would be quite prolonged and that is only one point in the Bill.  When you come to the technical operation of the Bill, the question of invoicing, the question of what is and what is not covered, the technical points dealing with things like immovable property, it will take a lot of teasing out.  It will not be practicable for all this work to be done in time for a 1st November implementation. Decimalisation is child's play compared with this Bill and yet a very prolonged campaign was undertaken before it was introduced.</P>
    <P>I put down this amendment and Deputy Tully has a very similar one. The only difference is that mine makes it possible for the Minister to determine an even later date than 1st March. Deputy Tully's amendment suggests 1st March as a fixed date.  I would accept Deputy Tully's amendment instead of mine.  I notice, by the way, that it is seconded by Deputy O'Donovan so I look forward to hearing him on this.</P>

The second reason is that since the press were not present reports did appear in the papers which were entirely contrary to what actually happened at the committee.</P>

The impression was given that there were two people on the committee&mdash;the Minister and Deputy FitzGerald. Deputy FitzGerald's higher intelligence naturally put him on a plane far above everybody else.  This was unfair not alone to those of our party <Col N="1264" /> and the Fianna Fáil Party who made constructive comments but also to his colleagues of Fine Gael, one of whom in particular made a comment which I thought was the best suggestion made at the committee meetings.  For that reason it is terribly unfortunate that we should have been put in this position.  Even when supplied statements were given about this and other matters, the statements referred to the fact that I confined my comments to taxes on school books.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in the habit of straying from amendments but I want to make this point.  We debated at length the question of the date and Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy Collins and I put forward arguments very much in favour of a later date than the one suggested by the Minister. At one stage I thought the Minister was prepared to accept that he had made a mistake but he said: &ldquo;We cannot have it on 1st January because of the two monthly period.&rdquo;  Apart from other amendments it is impossible to introduce VAT on 1st November because it is within the Christmas period.  It will be almost impossible for traders to regulate their trade in such a way that they can deal with their Christmas purchases and prices and introduce a new system at the same time.  This will add considerably to the confusion and to the prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will not be in the EEC until after 1st January.  If Britain considers that it is time enough to introduce it several months later, why must our Minister rush it through?  What is the compelling reason?  I do not want to have a Committee Stage discussion on the Bill because that would mean it was a complete waste of time sending it to the special committee but because of what happened at that committee it is possible that we will have to elaborate on the amendments.  We are not trying to be awkward but we think a later date would be in the interests of the people who will be selling the goods and those who will be buying <Col N="1265" /> them.  I am quite sure the Minister has researched this matter and that he will repeat a number of the arguments which he used on Committee Stage.  In spite of that, I appeal to him to change the date.</P>
    <P>There is another reason.  From 1st November to the end of the year people spend money rather foolishly. Coming into the Christmas period people buy things without counting the cost but when the Christmas period is over they count the cost.  In the Christmas period there is a danger that people who want to raise prices, on the excuse that the VAT has increased prices, will use that argument and people will be robbed by some of those smart alecks.  The prices will then have been established and on that basis next year's prices will be fixed.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter because I believe he has made a mistake.  I think 1st March is the earliest date he can hope to introduce VAT.</P>
    <P>The people who are supposed to assist in familiarising the traders with VAT will find it absolutely impossible to do that, taking holidays into consideration and everything else, between the passing of this Bill and 1st November.  The amendment we have put down is reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly in favour of this amendment.  We will not be in the EEC until 1st January.  One of the main arguments advanced at the special committee was that this was required by the EEC regulations, but we are not obliged to introduce this tax on 1st November.  Some manufacturing firms, particularly some manufacturing pharmaceutical firms, have only now got their accounting systems into order for the turnover tax.  It will be another three or four years before they put their accounting systems into order for this tax.  As Deputy Tully said, we are dead against the change in the system.  I believe that the EEC would raise no objection to our continuing with the present system which would comply with their taxation requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the Minister's attitude at the special committee I am inclined to think he will not accept this amendment. <Col N="1266" /> It has been argued that the Bill is so complex that people will not be able to understand it.  The Bill was first introduced 18 months or two years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been White Papers on a few occasions apart from the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two White Papers, not that they were not logically at odds with each other. However, I will let that go.  The Minister would not lose any revenue worth talking about if he changed the date.  I suspect that the real reason why he will not agree to 1st March is that he feels there will be a period when taxation receipts will not be coming in because people will not know how to handle the system.  In any event, nobody pays tax until he has to. The Revenue Commissioners will be at their wits end to get the taxation in on a smooth basis.  There will be a period of difficulty but, no matter when VAT is introduced, that period of difficulty will arise.  It is inherent in the nature of its administration as anybody who has had anything to do with administration knows.  This has nothing to do with the complexity of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners hope that if it is introduced on 1st November the necessary pressures will be on to get in their money in the last month of the financial year so that they can maintain their financial position.  There will be grave administrative difficulties which will have nothing to do with whether the Bill comes into operation on 1st November or 1st March.  There is no use in suggesting to any sensible person that you can change the system of taxation completely and get a new system to work smoothly in a week or two.  Therefore.  I believe the amendment is reasonable and that the Minister should accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these two amendments.  November 1st is not a suitable date.  Wholesalers and retailers of consumable goods will be in the middle of stocking up for the Christmas period and, therefore, it will be very difficult for them to change from <Col N="1267" /> one taxation system to another in that period.  A date after Christmas would be more suitable.  I would prefer if the introduction of this tax could be put off until the beginning of the next financial year, that is, April 1st.  It has been said that it must be introduced in an odd month but that would not arise if it were changed to a three monthly period.  I do not see any unsurmountable objection to that.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that traders, retailers and wholesalers, especially, are not <i>au fait</i> with the proposals in this Bill; they are not familiar with the documentation they will require to have under this tax system; they are not familiar with the returns they will have to make or the records they will have to keep in order to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners.  Therefore, the Revenue Commissioners must start immediately a campaign directed at the retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers in order to explain to them what must be done.  That has not been done. There may have been White Papers but White Papers are not always read. The Revenue Commissioners must immediately set about providing information to the retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers.  This is of vital importance if the value-added tax system is to succeed.</P>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister insists on 1st November.  It is a wrong date.  A date after Christmas would be much more helpful to retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers and, indeed, to the consumers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully has referred, quite rightly, to a possible price increase due to the value-added tax system.  I agree with him.  There will be a price increase when this system comes into operation. This was our experience when the turnover tax was introduced and when decimalisation was introduced.</P>

There will be a tremendous, unnecessary and unjustifiable price increase when the value-added tax comes into effect.  This statement will be justified when the day comes.</P>

It is really not good enough to have the kind of case made that we heard from <Col N="1269" /> Deputy FitzGerald&mdash;whether it was relevant or irrelevant, it is not based on the facts&mdash;that the reports on this matter were not available.  In fact, the reports are available and have been available since shortly after the discussion in this House.  I shall not pursue that because it would appear not to be relevant but I do think I am entitled to make that reply to Deputy FitzGerald.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Was he thinking?  I want to make it clear, first, that in my view there appears to be a misunderstanding about this in so far as there is comparison between the educational programme involved in relation to decimalisation, for instance.  The educational programme that is involved in regard to value-added tax has to be directed at retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers but not at the public. As far as the public are concerned the changeover to value-added tax does not make any difference to how they go about their shopping.  There is a completely different situation involved here.  The main reason&mdash;we will be coming to this point later&mdash;I have insisted on adhering to these apparently odd rates of tax has been precisely to ensure as far as is humanly possible that the incidence of taxation is precisely the same before and after value-added tax; so that the public are not involved as far as the changeover is concerned.  They are not involved in such a way that they have to be educated on how the tax works.  The rates of tax will be the same.  What are involved are traders, retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as they are concerned, there have been two White Papers on this matter.  As Deputy O'Donovan has pointed out, the Bill has been around for quite a long time and, of course, there have been communications from the Revenue Commissioners; there have been meetings with the Revenue Commissioners, not just the normal meetings but regional meetings of retailers where representatives of the Revenue Commissioners attended and <Col N="1270" /> answered questions, produced specimen forms, and so on.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the proposed date of introduction of this tax has already been postponed on, I think, two occasions.  So, nobody can say that the traders are being taken unawares in regard to the value-added tax.  As Deputy O'Donovan said, there can be no disputing the fact that on the introduction of a system of taxation such as this there are bound to be teething troubles at the beginning.  It does not matter when it is introduced, this will happen.  The Deputy is perfectly right when he says that.</P>
    <P>On the basis proposed now in the Bill, the introduction of the tax as from 1st November would mean that, with the extended accounting period being provided for, the first accounting date will be 19th January, 1973. This period, together with the minimum preparatory three-months period which I have promised from the passing of the Bill to the operation of the tax, together with the operation of the advisory committee, representative of the various groups of traders, should go as far as anybody can go to smooth out the teething troubles which we know will arise.  Therefore, by putting it back one is not avoiding those points at all.  All one can do is to try to ensure that the machinery provided is as adequate as we can make it to get over those teething troubles which, as I say will occur whenever the tax is introduced.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that there are people who, if they had their way, would never introduce the value-added tax and one must allow for this attitude.  However, on the basis that we are going to have it, then the question of whether we should have it on the 1st of November or the 1st of March seems to me to boil down to questions, on the one hand, of whether it is unduly inconvenient for traders and, on the other, the effect as regards the Exchequer.  I believe as far as traders are concerned, as I have indicated, with the long notice that has been given and the various steps that have been taken, which I have outlined, they will be no better off on next March than they will be <Col N="1271" /> next November as far as preparations are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What about stocks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also believe that the date of the 1st November is reasonable in relation to stocking up and problems that shopkeepers may have. If we were to go beyond that, there are two reasons why we would have to go to the 1st of March.  The first is that we would be getting so close to the Christmas shopping season that it would be impossible for traders to operate this new system of taxation during that period.  Secondly, with the two-monthly accounting period there is a fairly substantial loss of revenue unless we operate on the basis of odd months.  The earliest date, taking these factors into account, one could have as an alternative to the 1st of November is the 1st of March.</P>
      <P>There are some other things which should be borne in mind.  Perhaps it may be that certain aspects of this have been lost sight of.  I said in the past on a few occasions, and I am now saying it again, that if we were not going into the EEC we should still introduce the VAT because we require it urgently as a reform of the existing sales taxes.  The structure of the present taxes was designed for a much lower set of rates than now obtains and the possibilities of evasion are much greater than they are under a VAT system of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister intends to get a lot more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is not what I said.  I am talking about the question of evasion.  I dealt with this matter before in the House but a further postponement at this time would certainly lead to confusion among a lot of trade interests.  I do not think Deputies have paid much attention to the fact that quite a number of traders&mdash;I am including here retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers &mdash;have been making preparations for this within their own businesses.  They have been in consultation with their <Col N="1272" /> accountants.  They have evolved the system by which they will operate it. Indeed, I had complaints, when I announced the last postponement, on the grounds that these people had been making these arrangements and that a further postponement was making life particularly difficult for them.  There is that side of the coin as against those who have made no preparations. We know there are some people who have made no preparation.</P>
      <P>There is the further point that the provisions of this Bill contain a number of reliefs.  Firstly, there are reliefs for newspapers involved.  Secondly, there are reliefs in respect of the sale of caravans and mobile homes.  There are benefits for registered persons who under the VAT will be able to recover elements of tax which under the present system they cannot recover and are involved, therefore, in a form of double taxation.  There is also substantial relief for most, if not all retailers in the way of additional liquidity.</P>
      <P>It is being proposed in these amendments that all of these benefits be put back further and further.  I think there is no doubt that, weighing up all the factors involved and recognising the fact that there are some people who, if they could, would ensure that the tax never came in, there is no worthwhile reason for going back from the 1st of November to the 1st of March other than that expressed by the person who would say: &ldquo;Well, if I had my way I would never have it at all&rdquo;. I cannot accept that view and, that being so, it seems to me that the factors that arise as between the 1st of November and the 1st of March certainly do not add up to anything like a compelling case for a further postponement, whereas there are quite a number of cogent reasons why we should not postpone it from the 1st of November.  For these reasons I do not propose to accept these amendments.</P>

If there is going to be a tightening up, would the Minister say if, in <Col N="1273" /> fact, he means by that that because there is a tightening up a lot more people will be brought into it, that a lot more revenue must accrue?  Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will bear with me I will put it very briefly again. I am saying that the opportunities for evasion under VAT are far less than they are under the present system. I have also said that the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that despite this they do not believe that there will be substantial additional revenue as a result because there is the difficulty that where there is evasion it is very difficult to put a figure on it.  If they are evading, by definition you do not know how much is being got away with.</P>
      <P>I have also said that although that is the advice available to me I personally have a hunch that the effect of tightening up may be more substantial than the Revenue Commissioners estimate but nobody can be sure.  I will say that, whether it is a relatively small amount or a relatively large amount, we have an obligation in this House to ensure that as far as we can we do not allow these people to get away with this kind of evasion.  It is unfair to the vast majority of honest traders who are doing their duty under the existing sales taxes.  One of the methods by which the sharp operators can be caught much more easily is by introducing the VAT system.  That is an obligation not only to the honest traders but to all the taxpayers whose burden to that extent would be reduced if the loopholes are closed and people who are at present evading their liability for tax are caught under the VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If many people who are evading are brought into the net, would it not follow that very substantial extra revenue in addition to the £3.7 million will accrue even though a figure cannot be put on it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To pursue that particular point I can accept that a reason for having the tax as soon as possible is to get hold of the evasion as soon as possible.  One has to weigh the advantages and the disadvantages here and I can accept that there are people who will benefit through repayments. I think that the balance of advantage lies with the later date but I can see that the Minister has arguments on the other side and I can see it is a question of balancing advantages. When you weigh up the possible disadvantages of letting people get away with some evasion for an extra four months, the possible advantages for certain people of getting money back rather than paying money, against the disadvantages of a rushed job of introduction, of introducing it at a bad time of the year which poses problems for a vast number of people, manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, the net advantage lies with a postponement.  The Minister seems, in a speech today, to have hardened his attitude on this.  As time goes on he seems to be more determined to bring it in on 1st November.  Earlier on he seemed not to be quite so sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is mistaken.  Indeed, Deputy O'Donovan had a different impression, and I think Deputy O'Donovan's impression would be far more accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is entirely possible.  I have the impression the Minister did not totally exclude the later date originally.  Certainly to that extent his attitude seems to have hardened, but whether it is harder than it was, it is a hard attitude in the sense that there is no indication from what he said of any willingness to give in on this point.  That is something we have to take into account in considering how to treat this amendment. <Col N="1275" /> Had the Minister indicated he still had the matter under review, that he was prepared to consider further representations, then the question of pressing this amendment might not have arisen, but in the light of the attitude he has taken we have no alternative but to press it.</P>
      <P>On the question of evasion the Minister seemed to be saying to Deputy Tully in the end that the amount of money involved was quite small.  Is it?  I have been told the contrary. I was told very recently by a professional man, who would have more reason to know than I would, that he estimated the total additional revenue that would come in as a result of evasion being stopped would be about £6 million a year on about £90 million at the moment.  I must say I thought the figure high and it may well be he was exaggerating somewhat, but certainly his experience in these matters is such as to convince me that there is a significant amount of evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says we have an obligation to ensure that we do not allow people to get away with, I think he said, the non-payment of tax&mdash;I missed the last couple of words&mdash;that it is unfair to honest traders.  If that is the Minister's attitude, could we have an assurance that that is the way taxation is being operated at present? I was approached some months ago by a trader who felt he was at a disadvantage because he was trading in goods which another large firm were selling at prices which seemed impossible if that firm were paying their tax.  I found it hard to believe that a firm of the magnitude of the firm of whom he spoke could be evading taxation on that scale.  Perhaps I should have pursued the matter further but pressure of other affairs led me not to pursue it because it just did not seem possible that the thing could have happened.  I have since been informed that the firm in question have, in fact, been found to be evading tax.  The sum involved is £300,000 and a State financial agency under the jurisdiction of the Minister made it a condition of helping this <Col N="1276" /> firm to survive that the Revenue Commissioners would not proceed against them.  If there is that kind of conniving at an evasion of the law, how can we take seriously the Minister's statement about an obligation to ensure that we do not allow people to get away with non-payment of tax and about being unfair to honest traders?  Perhaps the Minister would take some opportunity to ensure me that the information I was given was incorrect and I shall certainly accept his assurance.  I think it is as well to air this allegation and have it disposed of once and for all.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I did not advert to the question of evasion until later in the debate.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to refer to it on the Fifth Stage of the Bill.  I had no intention of preventing the Minister replying to it.  It only occurred to me when Deputy Tully raised the point about evasion.  I think the case we have made has not been rebutted by the Minister.  He has not adverted to the problems that firms have.  I have a letter here from a firm on the following basis:</P>
      <P>We deliver goods for the Christmas trade in September, October and November.  It is necessary to get these goods out early to avoid a desperate rush and it also helps to be &ldquo;first in&rdquo;.  Under the present system, of turnover and wholesale taxes, many of our customers are liable, and so they will not be anxious to buy goods on a large scale before November 1st, because if they do, they will have to count these goods in on stocktaking, work out the tax element on them and reclaim it on the transition to value-added tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot overcome this reluctance to buy early by agreeing to charge for the goods in November because, (1) we are supposed to invoice within ten days of delivery, and (2) it would leave the retailer in a position where he could reclaim tax because he has the goods <Col N="1277" /> in stock on November 1st and later could take credit for the tax charged to him on a November invoice.  It would be physically impossible for us to deliver all Christmas goods after November 1st and in time for Christmas displays.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to have the knowledge to know whether there is some way round that firm's problem that they have not discovered, but they clearly have a problem.  Another large chain in the retail trade, in the course of a submission on this subject&mdash;I think it has probably gone to the Minister also, but it is not clear on the face of it&mdash;says:</P>
    <P>... the marking of individual products into their different tax categories will increase handling costs in the Cash and Carry warehouse. In addition, the check-out operator in the Cash and Carry will have to charge up separate sub-totals for goods into each tax category.  The time involved in doing this will result in increased queuing time at the check-out point and thus less efficient use of labour.  Our investigations show that the only efficient way of handling this situation is through the purchase of electronic equipment at the check-out point. A number of manufacturers are currently developing equipment to handle this problem (equipment which will not be available till 1973)...</P>
    <P>Has the Minister gone into this?  Is he satisfied that firms will be able to get the equipment in time for November 1st?  If not, surely there is a case for postponing the tax.  Surely he does not propose to introduce it when it is physically impossible for firms to get the equipment necessary to handle the tax.  I am not satisfied the Minister has considered all these implications, or that he has considered adequately the representations made to him in this House and by the interests concerned. I still hope, despite what he has said here, that when he does consider the matter further he will take a different position.</P>
    <P>I want finally to refer to the points made by Deputy Tully.  There is some <Col N="1278" /> confusion here.  Deputy Tully referred to statements made to the press and suggested they were in some way disadvantageous to the Labour Party, and, indeed, even to my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party.  He could by definition be referring only to two statements because only two statements were made.  I have examined both of these since he spoke.  One of them was the statement which appeared in the Sunday papers and in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday which did not deal with anything but the Fine Gael proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made myself clear.  When I say the Fine Gael proposals I mean the document which we produced and published in the newspapers last week.  It is entirely a Fine Gael document setting out in detail exactly how we thought the tax might be raised, what the cost would be, with tabular statements at the end.  I am saying the statement in last Sunday's paper to which I have referred related only to replying to the Minister's attack&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The other document is this proposal which we issued, and it contains the following statement which I think must be what Deputy Tully is referring to.  I want to assure him that far from intending in any way to reflect on the Labour Party, the drafting of it involved particular care.  What it said was:</P>
      <P>In the Value-Added Tax Committee of the Dáil which completed the Committee Stage of the Value-Added Tax Bill last week, Deputies Garret FitzGerald, Fine Fael spokesman on Finance, and Deputy James Tully, Labour spokesman on Finance, put forward amendments to eliminate tax on food, non-alcoholic drink, newspapers and books.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that one of the problems in taking two amendments together is that there is the right of only one reply.  We should take note of that and in future ask the Ceann Comhairle, if there are amendments from different parties, to take them separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is important. I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 47 and 48, to delete all words after &ldquo;period of&rdquo; in line 47 and to insert &ldquo;three months, beginning on the specified day, and at three monthly intervals thereafter, provided that a firm engaged wholly or partly in the export of goods and services may opt for a monthly taxable period&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is required because, as I pointed out in Committee, the impact of the two-month period on manufacturers is to cut their liquidity period significantly. I have made some inquiries since and have been informed of a study carried out by the Federation of Irish Industry.  The comparable period of credit extended by manufacturers, if I recall it correctly, is 11 weeks.  On average, I think it is ten weeks but, of course, there would be longer and shorter periods in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period which the Bill provides is significantly shorter.  If we take a two-month period, there remain 19 days to settle and if we take a midpoint of the two-month period we get an average of 50 days, that is 30 or 31 days in the second month plus the 19 days before settlement.  In other words, the tax Bill has to be settled within a period which can range from about two months and 19 days, which is 80 days, down to a period of 19 or 20 days.  The average of those two is about 50 days.  Therefore, the average period required for settlement is 50 days, or seven weeks.  But the average period of credit extended by manufacturers is ten weeks and in many instances and for particular trades it is 11 or 12 weeks and for individual <Col N="1281" /> firms in the building trade it is as long as 16 weeks.  These are authoritative figures.  Of course, individual trades are above and below ten weeks.  That is how an average is arrived at.</P>
    <P>Given that situation, the effect of the Bill will be to involve on average a three-week disadvantage for manufacturers in regard to liquidity, and for the Minister to say that this is offset by improved liquidity for retailers is not sufficient because, as I said earlier, though one would expect manufacturers to seek to negotiate some adjustment of credit periods, and they will need a good deal of time to do this, but it can be done easily, it may not be easy for manufacturers to persuade retailers to accept the significance of the change in their credit periods.  Even to make a retailer understand that he will benefit in terms of liquidity because of VAT will itself be a difficult enough task, and judging by the time we spent on it in this House in the earlier parts of Committee Stage, and the utter confusion which all of us fell into in trying to understand what are the credit periods, one can hardly expect that every retailer in the country will be able easily to understand what this House and even the Minister have had such difficulty in comprehending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be first to substitute a general taxable period of three months except in the case of the people who are engaged wholly or partly in the export trade and who could opt for a taxable period of one month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I forgot to mention that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If a three-month taxable period were adopted, it would be necessary to commence on 1st March, 1st June, 1st September or 1st December because if this were not done there would be a once for all loss of £15 million in the first year. But even if the tax were to commence on one of those dates, there would be an additional once for all loss of £2 million as compared with the two-monthly <Col N="1282" /> taxable period, and a continuing annual interest loss of £750,000.  The two-monthly taxable period which has been introduced by me by way of amendment is an effort to strike a reasonable balance between all the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald has acknowledged that there is a question of balance involved and what we are trying to do is to strike the balance not only in regard to achieving equity for traders but also for the taxpayers, because the impact of this on the Exchequer is not an impact on the Minister for Finance but on every taxpayer in the country.  It has an impact, perhaps, on people who because of their weak economic position are very much more dependent on the Exchequer than others.</P>
      <P>All those factors have to be taken into account.  It is my view, for reasons I have given in more detail in the past, that the taxable period of two months, having regard to all these factors, is a reasonable balance and I do not propose to extend it by accepting this amendment.  The indications we have had are that the two-month period is acceptable to trade as a whole.  Inevitably, as Deputy FitzGerald said when he was quoting the figures concerned, there will be people above and below the average. Therefore, whatever figure we strike will be unacceptable to some groups, but taking trade as a whole the indications to us are that the two-month period is acceptable.  The great majority of exporters will have sufficient home sales to absorb the whole of their input tax so that regular repayment claims are not likely to arise, but in so far as the title to repayment is concerned, it could arise from causes other than exports.  For instance, if there was heavy capital expenditure in a particular period you could have a claim for a refund or repayment arising from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it would be virtually impossible to frame a provision which would prescribe a special accounting period for all the various circumstances in which the title to repayment would arise.  I should, however, add that the <Col N="1283" /> Revenue Commissioners in exercising their functions under the care and management provisions will be prepared to accept the repayment claims at monthly intervals from taxpayers who can show that they will be entitled to repayment at the end of the taxable period.  There is already a similar arrangement in operation for income tax in regard to claims for losses and that system is working satisfactorily. There does not seem to be any reason why the same system should not operate satisfactorily in regard to value-added tax so that, as far as that portion of the amendment is concerned, that will in fact be covered in the way I have indicated.</P>

      <P>No. I am talking of the Minister's reference to the fixing of the date on 1st March.  On the basis of his £2 million and a continuing interest loss of £750,000, it seems to me that the order of magnitude of those figures is something that could easily correspond to £750,000, for example, and the result of shortening its liquidity by three weeks and by transferring that liquidity to the Exchequer means the Exchequer gets the benefit.  That is taking money away from industry and giving the Exchequer the credit.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I never suggested the retailer got all the benefit and, if that was the impression I gave, then I was not clear in what I said.  I said there were gains alleged to the retailer and losses to the manufacturer and wholesaler but, in fact, presumably if the Exchequer gets the money sooner under the new system than it does at present, there is a gain to the Exchequer, and what the Minister is saying is that he does not want to give up the gain to the Exchequer.  To describe that as a loss to the Exchequer <Col N="1286" /> is a use of words which might confuse some people.  It is worth clarifying that point.  The Minister has not really answered the point.  He has not contested the figures I have given as to the credit period of manufacturers; he has not dealt with the impact on manufacturing at this particular moment of time of a disimprovement in liquidity, when profit margins are under great pressure and our whole industrial structure is, in varying degrees throughout the country, threatened by the prolonged economic stagnation of the last three years and by other factors, including the freeing of trade under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. To impose a further burden by reducing the liquidity on manufacturing at this stage to the benefit of the Exchequer does not seem to me to be a good thing and I do not see any particular value in doing it either for the benefit of the retailers.  It would be much better if we did not attempt that and if we had the three month period as is the case in Britain. The idea the Minister is putting forward, implicity in his remarks, that our industry is in such a strong position that it can stand the loss of liquidity which industry in Britain in the view of the British Government cannot withstand does not hold water.  Industry here is not in that strong position and for the Minister to suggest that by implication and to be willing to tax Irish industry additionally at this stage by foreshortening the period is, to say the least of it, irresponsible. It is irresponsible in the same way as was the original increase in company taxation to 58 per cent and, just as that had to be reversed very quickly when the effect of the Minister's mistake was understood, so I hope this also will be reversed very quickly when the effects of this mistake are understood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 59, after &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that any such acquisition shall be at a market value equal to that which the property would have enjoyed if it had been sold to a registered trader&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This point arose on Committee Stage when we were querying the phraseology of this paragraph of subsection (1) of section 3.  The point is that if you are going to apply VAT to compulsory acquisition the problem arises because, as between registered and non-registered purchasers of property, the local authority being a non-registered purchaser will not be able to get tax refunded if my assumption is right and a registered purchaser would. Consequently, you are now creating two separate markets in property and the whole compulsory acquisition principle of getting a price which is the market price would be endangered. With a view to clarifying the point and meeting the difficulties that arose on Committee Stage while not fundamentally altering the approach to compulsory purchase outlined here and for which the Minister gave reasons in the debate, I have proposed this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister in speaking on Committee Stage seemed to think this, in fact, was how it would operate but he did not succeed in convincing me that he was certain of this or that he had good legal grounds for it.  When there is any uncertainty on a point like this and when it is important to ensure fair treatment is meted out and that somebody whose property is compulsorily purchased will not in future be at a disadvantage as against having his land purchased by a registered trader, the amendment seems necessary to clarify the point on which the Minister did not seem to be able to give a complete and absolute reassurance backed by suitable legal opinion.  If, at this stage, the Minister can reassure the House that the amendment is unnecessary very well, but I think there is sufficient doubt to justify the amendment being included to cover the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals <Col N="1290" /> with the compulsory acquisition of property by the State or a local authority. In any such circumstances the amount on which tax is chargeable is, in accordance with the provisions of section 10 (1) the actual compensation receivable.  Deputy FitzGerald's proposal in this amendment seems to be that the tax would be imposed in such circumstances by reference to the market value of the property if sold to a registered trader.  This seems to me to be unnecessary because the figure of actual compensation would be available and on the face of it this is the right amount to tax.</P>
      <P>There was in the previous debate a good deal of discussion and I think some confusion as to whether the price charged to a registered trader would differ from the price charged to another person.  I had hoped that when further thought had been given to this it would be seen that there is no reason to believe that the price in these circumstances would be different.  To me this seems quite clear and, if so, I cannot see any necessity for this proposal. This, of course, is an anti-avoidance provision and seems to me to be reasonably suitable for its purpose and does not seem to present any problems.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite follow the Minister's reply.  The amendment is designed to clarify something and make sure that what the Minister says should happen does happen.  From some of his remarks it seems as if he thought in some way that this amendment weakened the effect of his provision or somehow prevented the tax operating as he intended.  That is certainly not the intention of the amendment.  It seems to me that in future when any property comes on the market, in the ordinary way, leaving aside compulsory purchase for the moment, if a man is a registered trader he may be in a position to get a refund of tax which a non-trader cannot get.  If that is so then by definition there will be two prices for all property in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of Report Stage is to debate only matters we have had before.  Deputy O'Donovan's intervention reassures me that we are in order but I am not sure that it otherwise affects the position. If you have a man who, if he buys a certain property, will be able to get a tax refund and a man who, if he buys it, does not get a tax refund, the former will be able to pay more for that property because it will be worth more to him and possibly will to him have a higher price.  We are now creating two markets in property as a result.  I would have thought that proposition was reasonably self-evident. I am not sure why the Minister feels it necessary to reject it when among the non-registered traders can be local authorities buying on a compulsory purchase basis.</P>
      <P>The compulsory purchase price would quite logically, unless this amendment were accepted, be equated to the price payable by another non-registered trader which would be lower than the price that could be secured from a registered trader and in any case where the property is one which might have been purchased by a registered trader surely account must be taken of that in fixing the price?  As it stands, this will not happen.  The Minister must face the fact that one consequence of VAT and the system of registered and non-registered traders is to create a dual system of property values.  Failure to face that will give rise to more difficulties than this amendment is attempting to deal with. I am rather bothered he does not see fit to accept that this is a consequence of this legislation and that a logical corollary of that is that it creates problems in regard to compulsory purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is fully justified. The Minister has not given any reason for not accepting it.  He has not said with any firmness that this is not necessary, <Col N="1292" /> that inevitably by some legal process the man will be required to pay not the price which another non-registered trader would pay but the price a registered trader would pay. That proposition is far from self-evident. The more probable assumption to work on would be that the arbitrator concerned with the compulsory purchase would say: &ldquo;Here is a non-registered trader buying property compulsorily.  What would a non-registered trader not buying it compulsorily pay?&rdquo; I think without this amendment he would be likely to say that and to calculate the value accordingly. In order to prevent that happening and to prevent a man losing out where he could have got a better price from a registered trader, this amendment seems to be necessary.  The Minister has offered less reassurance to the contrary than on Committee Stage and the amendment is needed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, after line 2, to add &ldquo;provided that the goods in question are goods included in the Fourth Schedule&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to confine the operation of this provision to the particular areas the Minister said it was needed for.  On the face of it, the idea that somebody should have to pay VAT on goods seized from him by the sheriff seems very inequitable, but the Minister explained that there was a special problem where a dealer in motor cars might acquire new cars purportedly with a view to selling them and then go out of business and have the cars seized and in this way avoid paying tax.  I am not sure I understood the mechanism of evasion which the Minister so ingeniously contrived but in so far as there is a problem of this kind it is clear that it is confined to goods covered by the Fourth Schedule. Therefore, this provision should surely be confined to that area where it is necessary for the reasons given by the Minister and should not be extended more widely.  My amendment would confine it to the areas the Minister referred <Col N="1293" /> to.  I do not think any reason he gave for the need for this provision was related to anything not covered by the Fourth Schedule.  Therefore, he should be in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not propose to take part in debate on matters which we feel have already been well debated except in exceptional circumstances. This is one of them.  Deputy FitzGerald is correct.  It is ludicrous to suggest that what we used to call the &ldquo;grippers sale&rdquo;, where somebody goes in and takes goods for non-payment of debt, a court order or something, should be subject to VAT.  If these things come to be sold subsequently in most cases they would be sold for a lesser price.  It is ludicrous to suggest that the sheriff should say to a man: &ldquo;I am going to seize your goods but unless you pay VAT on them I will not take them.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Why put it in the Bill at all?  If somebody is not to be stuck for VAT for goods seized there is no point in including such goods in this Bill.  The Minister's case was not the same as Deputy Fitzpatrick's.  He said he envisaged where new motor cars might be seized and in that case we agreed that there should be VAT. Perhaps the Minister will have a reply which will show that I do not understand this as he does but if it simply means putting tax on something which is seized or sold as a result of a sheriff's seizure I think it is ludicrous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point I want to make.  I agree that on the face of it it seems a very peculiar provision.  It was only an instance I gave and, in fact, the same kind of situation can arise in relation to goods other than those in the Fourth Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;We are talking about people having cars seized who have a refund of duty and who, in fact, have not paid any value-added tax.  We are not talking about the ordinary person who has paid.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks at the whole discussion he will find that I certainly did not say it was confined to motor cars.  The fact is that it can apply to other matters and, for that reason.  I cannot accept this amendment.  I want to refer to the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  As I see it, the position would be that the person whose goods are seized would be responsible for payment of the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case visualised by Deputy Fitzpatrick where goods are seized for payment of debt and the person has no assets and no money, the tax would be levied on the money received.  The person whose goods are seized is liable to account for the tax.  The kind <Col N="1295" /> of situation visualised here is different from that visualised by Deputy Fitzpatrick. We are getting at the use, or the possible use, of the seizure of goods as a method of avoiding liability for tax.  In those circumstances it is most unlikely that the person trying to avoid tax would be a person who had no money, which is the normal case one thinks of in the event of a seizure of goods.  For the reason I have indicated I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 7, after line 15, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this section shall apply to the purchase of immovable goods by a person who is not a registered person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We might take amendments Nos. 10 and 11 together as they cover the same area.  These amendments are designed to meet a difficulty which arose on Committee Stage and at which the Minister said he would look.  The point which concerned us is that the general effect of section 4 is that a man who builds for letting is forced to opt to pay tax on the letting in order to avoid paying tax on the capital value of the building which he has built for letting.  As this is not really understood to be the intention it seems necessary to make some amendment. It is clear that that is the effect of it as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether the amendments we have proposed are the best way to meet this difficulty I am far from sure.  The complexity of this section leaves me in considerable doubt as to how best to tackle the problem.  I am prepared to be told that the amendments are not the best way to deal with it.  I had hoped that the Minister would have come up with some solution to it.  He did not contest that a problem exists. Perhaps on further study he has found that the operation of this section will not be as I suggested on the last day. If he can offer me reassurance on this <Col N="1296" /> point I will withdraw the amendment. Alternatively, if he feels that my amendments are not the best way to tackle the problem, and if he has any alternative solution, I would be more than prepared to accept it.  I will leave it to the Minister to explain whether I am right in thinking there is such a problem.  If I am not right I hope he will tell me why or, if my method of coping with the problem is defective, I hope he will suggest how best the problem may be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we are discussing both amendments together I hope that what I have to say will explain the point raised by Deputy FitzGerald. First, with regard to amendment No. 10, if it were accepted it would exclude entirely the operation of section 4 in regard to the purchase of immovable goods by an unregistered person.  It is not entirely clear to me what the implications of this are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes two of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it would seem that there could be one of two possible results: (a) that no tax would in any circumstances be chargeable on the delivery of immovable goods to an unregistered person; or (b) that the ordinary rules applicable to the delivery of immovable goods to an unregistered person would apply.  If the first interpretation is correct the delivery would presumably be an exempted activity and the builder or other seller would not be entitled to any credit for the input tax.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the arrangements contained in section 10 (4) whereby the charge of tax on the delivery of immovable goods is confined to 60 per cent of the consideration, the amendment could have the effect of increasing the tax if that interpretation is correct.  If, on the other hand, the second interpretation is correct, I am afraid the situation would be impossible because the ordinary rules for delivery of movable goods are simply inappropriate and not applicable to the delivery of immovable goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this provision is to achieve neutrality in the incidence of <Col N="1297" /> VAT between different persons who may let property.  The necessity for this arises because rents are exempt from tax unless a landlord specifically elects to be taxable.  A landlord who has not elected to be taxable on his rents will not be a registered person and will not be entitled to any tax credit for the tax element included in the price of any property purchased by him or the charge made by a builder for any property constructed for him.  Thus, all property which he acquires, and which was constructed after VAT commenced, will have a VAT element of 3.16 per cent, that is the 60 per cent of a cost charged at the 5.26 per cent rate, included in the cost.  This arrangement continues almost exactly the present system under which the element of turnover tax and wholesale tax represents approximately 3 per cent of the cost price of a house.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, a registered person who buys property or who has premises constructed for him for the purpose of his business will be entitled to full credit for the VAT included in the price.  When he has obtained this credit he will be in the same position as if he had acquired the property tax free, and this is fully within the intention of the Bill, so long as the property continues to be used for those business activities which are taxable.  But, a difficulty arises if a person who has got a full tax credit in respect of property subsequently decides to let the property but does not elect to be taxable on the rent received.  If no adjustment were made in these circumstances he would have the advantage over the unregistered person because the capital cost of property let by the unregistered landlord would include a tax of 3.16 per cent, whereas the capital cost of the property let by the registered landlord would not include any tax element and, in order to restore neutrality between them, it is necessary to withdraw the tax credit which the registered person obtained in respect of the property. Section 4 (3) does this by making a surrender of possession of the property in the circumstances indicated a taxable delivery for which the consideration chargeable is, in accordance <Col N="1298" /> with subsection (4) and subsection (8) of section 10, 60 per cent of the cost price excluding tax.</P>
    <P>Any landlord may elect to be accountable for tax on rents receivable but there would be no advantage for him in making such an election unless, first, he had been charged for value-added tax for which he could claim credit and, second, his tenant was a registered person who could obtain credit for the tax element in the rent.</P>
    <P>If a person who was obtaining credit for the tax element in property lets the property and elects to be taxable on the rent receivable it would be pointless to charge tax on the basis that he had made a taxable delivery because any tax so charged would have to be allowed in full against his liability on rents receivable.  Accordingly, it is provided in subsection (3) (b) (i) that the special treatment prescribed by subsection (3) (a) will not apply to a surrender of possession in such circumstances. Tax is not charged on the transfer of the business, or part of a business, from one registered person to another.  The reason for this is that any tax charged on a transfer or in respect of such a transaction, would qualify as a tax credit to the transferee and, in these circumstances, it is provided in subsection (3) (b) (ii) that the special treatment prescribed by subsection (3) (a) will not apply to such a transaction.</P>
    <P>The option to elect for accountability on rent receivable as provided for in section 7 (1) is designed to preserve neutrality between selling and letting property.  It enables a landlord who does not wish to make a taxable delivery to a registered tenant to pass on a tax credit to him in respect of the rents payable.  This provision would be quite inappropriate in regard to residential lettings.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances that I have outlined it would seem&mdash;and I accept the advice given to me on this score&mdash; that this subsection is essential for the proper administration of the tax.  I do not know if I have dealt with the point the Deputy wanted me to deal with. Have I?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that <Col N="1299" /> is, I am afraid, I do not quite know.  If the Minister could sum up a very complex but very useful illustration which I and others would read with interest but which is very difficult to take in straight off, is it the case, summarised, that because a non-registered person will not get the benefit of the credit of 3 per cent, he will be required to charge higher rent on that account than he would otherwise do and to put the registered person on a par with him he too would be required to do so?  So that the effect would be that there would be a tax on rents?  That is what I got from the earlier part of what the Minister said.  It may be that something he said after, which I have not followed thoroughly, modifies that.  What seems to emerge is that there will have to be a tax on rents where the landlord is non-registered, because he cannot get a refund of 3 per cent and, therefore, the Minister's idea of achieving neutrality is not to remove that situation by giving him the benefit of the credit but to impose the same burden on the registered trader who is a landlord and who builds for letting. So that in both cases, in fact, the rent would be taxed.  That is a way of achieving neutrality and if that is what the Minister has done it is a way which I would not approve of.  Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle would allow the Minister to elucidate that point.</P>

      <P>I will have another &ldquo;go&rdquo; at this, to clarify it.  First, it is extremely unlikely that a landlord of residential property would waive his right to exemption since by doing so he would incur more tax and this tax would not rank for credit at a later stage.

      <P>No.  We are talking about a man building a block of flats to rent.  He is a registered trader in doing that because it is better for him to register than not to register. That is the position we are talking about.  As I understand it, the effect of it is that this man will have to pay the tax or not get a refund to put him on a par with a mythical non-registered trader in the same position that the Minister says would not exist. That is what is bothering me.  In order to avoid paying tax on rent a registered trader who builds for residential letting will have to pay tax on the capital value.  If that is wrong, the Minister could simply say it is wrong and we could end the discussion.  If it is right, there is a point to be debated.</P>

However, the fact is that the person visualised by Deputy FitzGerald has an option.

My understanding was that we wanted in this case as in the case of other people who were registered traders who build, to ensure that they got the tax back and in that way to exempt rents from taxation.  The effect of this is that the man will be forced to pay tax on rents and to raise the rents in order to avoid having to pay tax on the capital value.  That is why we put the amendment down.

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1305" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as I understand it, although I may not have explained it clearly, is that at the moment anybody who builds a block of flats to let them has to pay turnover tax and wholesale tax on the materials and consequently the cost is higher by 3 per cent and the rents have to be higher by 3 per cent.  This is true of anybody who builds anything else.  Any registered trader building a factory, building a shop or building offices is in the same position. The Minister has at some length in other parts of the Bill made it clear that this benefit, which is so important that he wishes this Bill to go into effect on the 1st November and not the 1st March in order to help the people concerned, will enable tax refunds to be paid to people, in particular those who have been engaged in building activities of this kind so that they get back the 3 per cent tax which they have paid.</P>
      <P>Part of the aim of this Bill is to achieve that.  The Minister has set aside £3½ million for this purpose and has levied an extra £3½ million by raising the rate of wholesale tax to a level above that necessary to provide him with the money coming from wholesale tax now, a yield of an extra £3½ million to give back to people who build and who at the moment have to pay this tax which he now wants to remit.  That is the background to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite accept the Deputy's version of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to give a fair account but the Minister can correct me if I am wrong in any detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to follow those hares.  I want to keep to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that background we have a builder, who is one of the people the Minister seeks to benefit by giving back this tax element which he now has to pay and he is building flats for renting, a laudable objective and one which we wish more builders would engage in.  The failure <Col N="1306" /> of builders to build for letting is one of the weaknesses of our whole housing effort.  This particular form of building is one which is beyond all other kinds of building.  It is a form of building we want to encourage.  One would have thought in those circumstances that the Minister would be most anxious that in this case the full benefit of 3 per cent should go to any builder in this position.  Yet, as I understand it, what he is saying here is that because there might be a man so foolish as to build for letting as an unregistered trader&mdash;an unlikely event, he says&mdash;and pay a higher rate of tax on his rents, the Minister finds it necessary to place the registered trader on a par with such an improbable unregistered trader.</P>
      <P>What I am seeking to do and what I am willing to believe the amendments do not achieve is to modify the position so that in so far as it is necessary, in order to ensure neutrality between the registered and non-registered trader the registered trader will get the full remission of the tax if he is building flats for renting just as he would get if he was building anything else.  What I am trying to achieve is that the non-registered trader is put on a par with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember that.  On the contrary, what concerns me is that the Bill, as drafted, makes it inevitable that they will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am agreeing with the Minister that the man who will not register will pay tax.  That is very unlikely to happen.  However, I understand the Bill, as drafted, means that when that man does register he will fail to get the remission of tax on building materials and will, therefore, have to charge higher rents to <Col N="1307" /> cover what is in the Bill.  What I am trying to do is to ensure that, just because a man tries to do something useful when he goes to build and builds flats instead of office blocks or factories or hotels, he will not be penalised and put in the position of not getting the remission of tax that any other builder would get and, therefore, be forced to pay tax on the rent.  I am glad to have the opportunity of explaining more fully, as I have not obviously explained well at the beginning, what I fear.  If that is not the position, well and good; there is no need to go any further.  If I have got the position right, the Minister should consider some method of ensuring he does not penalise this kind of building but makes the necessary adjustment in respect of the tax position of this unlikely character, the unregistered builder of flats for renting, so that neutrality is achieved by putting him on a par with the registered trader who is exempted from this 3 per cent tax, rather than doing it the other way round which ensures that everybody has to pay the 3 per cent tax.</P>

      <P>The ultimate effect is precisely the same as in the present situation in that the tax on the elements that go into the building under value-added tax will be recovered as a claim against liability for tax, but tax will be levied on the contract price, 60 per cent at 5.26.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the point is that the tax which is levied at present on the elements that go into the house and which amount to approximately 3 per cent of the cost will now be levied but will also be paid back by the Revenue Commissioners or allowed as a credit by the builders providers, the builder himself and so on.  Therefore, as far as the Revenue are concerned, they will collect no tax on the elements going into the house, but in lieu of that they will collect precisely the same amount of tax on the cost price of the house.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but in the course of business.  This is where the double taxation element arises under our present system.  Take a shopkeeper who builds an extension on to his shop.  At the moment he will pay tax amounting to approximately 3 per cent on the cost of that extension.  At the moment he will not recover that under the wholesale and turnover tax, but under the value-added tax system he can recover it because it is an expenditure in the course of his business. The whole basis of the value-added tax is that although it goes through the various stages, ultimately the tax is paid by the consumer at the rate laid down and it is the rate the consumer is paying at the moment.  This is the element of double taxation that is in the present system and which will be taken out by the VAT system, and this is where the £3½ million comes into it.  It will be going back to the people who are at present subject to double taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we get to the question of tax on houses or residential flats we are talking about the consumer, and the consumer at the moment is paying tax which is approximately 3 per cent of the purchase tax.  This is what the tax is about because, of course, if you impose it at the earlier stage it is simply added on and the consumer is paying it ultimately.  What we are doing is maintaining the present position whereby the consumer will continue to pay the same tax as he is paying <Col N="1311" /> at present, not more, but to say that we ought to take this tax off residential flats is saying that we would have to take it off houses as well, because there is no logical reason why you would not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that, if Deputy FitzGerald thought we were taking it off houses, he thought the figure could be as small as that.  It covers more than houses as well.  However, we have been endeavouring to maintain the position.  We do not decrease the tax but we are making the incidence as near as possible to wholesale and turnover taxes.  On that basis we should not take the tax off houses and flats.</P>
      <P>One of the elements involved, of course, is the cost; but if you are to do that, an equally good or perhaps a better case could be made for taking it off other commodities.  The basic principle we have gone on is to try to maintain the position as it is and for that reason I would not propose to accede to this request.  All I can say is that it may have been worth recommitting this because I did not understand what Deputy FitzGerald had in mind and I understand now why I did not understand.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House longer except to say that I think it is wrong to provide the £3½ million for exemption of other types of capital goods and construction activity but not houses.  The Minister said he could not afford £8½ million but I would prefer if he would use the £3½ million for housing, to reduce the 3 per cent to 2 per cent, rather than to do it for other goods and not for houses.  We should be most concerned about bringing the price of housing down.  I do not therefore understand why the Minister has taken housing <Col N="1312" /> out when he is giving this benefit, tax remission at a cost of £3½ million to other kinds of construction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12.</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 17 and 18, to delete all words after &ldquo;performance&rdquo; in line 17, and insert &ldquo;of any act other than the delivery of goods or the discharge for consideration of an obligation not to practise in whole or in part a professional activity or assign a patent, trade mark or other right&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The difference in amendment No. 13 is that there is a parenthesis in that amendment subjecting it to subsection (5).  I do not know if this was necessary because subsection (5) begins with the words &ldquo;notwithstanding anything in subsection (1)&rdquo;.  In case I should be faulted I put it in as an alternative to cover the point.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to deal with the point made by the Minister on another amendment when he said there is a requirement in the EEC VAT legislation on this point and that therefore he was bound to deal with it.  This seemed to me to have some potential validity and I got the relevant document which is Annex B of Directive 67.228.  I have read it carefully and it seems to me the problem it raises is a restricted one.  As it is clearly undesirable as a general principle to exact people for not doing something for which they are not paid a consideration, in so far as we adopt this peculiar procedure of doing anything of the kind, it seems to me we should limit it to cases where it is absolutely essential. Annex B of the directive refers to services listed in Article 6.  That states:</P>
      <P>The provision of services means any transaction which does not cover the supply of goods within the meaning of Article 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> Subsection (2) of the article states that rules laid down in that directive as regards taxation of the provision of services shall be compulsorily applicable only to services listed in Annex B.  The point is, therefore, that services shall be charged to VAT. The list of services which shall be so charged are to be found in Annex B.  I read through Annex B to discover what is involved and I found a variety of services, only one of which involves a right, and what we are concerned with here is the question of people agreeing not to perform an act.  The Minister raised this question of the directive and of rights, and the very first item in the annex refers to assignments of patents, trade marks and other similar rights and the grant of licences of such rights.  Where somebody waives such a right&mdash;this is the point the Minister is making&mdash; that can have value for taxation purposes, and the only rights that can be waived are the particular rights mentioned in the annex because other sections of the annex deal with other matters such as:</P>
    <P>work on tangible movable property carried out for taxable purposes, the provision of services to prepare or to co-ordinate the carrying out of works of construction, commercial advertising services, transport and storage of goods and ancillary services, hiring of tangible movable goods for taxable purposes, the provision of staff for a taxable purpose, services provided by consultants, engineers, planning officers, and so on, the carrying out of an obligation to refrain from exercising in whole or in part a builder's activity or a right included in this list.</P>
    <P>There is only one right included in this list and that is item No. 1.  Therefore if it is a question of refraining from exercising a right, as the Minister mentioned, it seems to me that one could limit it to section 1 of Annex B.  My amendment is designed to limit us to this.  If the Minister does not feel this adequately covers the point in the directive, and he may make that case, it may be necessary to amend my amendment.  I think the wording I <Col N="1314" /> have covers, in fact, all the cases in Annex B, although it may require some modification and the Minister may not be satisfied with it as it stands.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we do not give the Revenue Commissioners general power to tax omissions of acts or toleration of situations and we tie it down to cases where there is a specific obligation to tolerate the situation or to omit the act.  Where the act omitted is, in fact, something that can properly be described as a business or professional activity, on the one hand, or a right, on the other, and the only rights the EEC refers to are these patent and trade marks and rights of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;discussion we had in the Special Committee on this matter. These are substantially the same amendments.  Amendment No. 12, if it <Col N="1315" /> were accepted, would have the effect of excluding from the definition of rendering in relation to a service the toleration of an act.  That would be excluded.  The interpretation in relation then to the omission of an act would be restricted to certain specified restrictive arrangements entered into for consideration.  The first thing I want to say about that is that it is necessary that the toleration of a service should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Toleration of a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant of a situation. The toleration of a situation should be included in order to ensure that tax may be charged on such activities as the granting of rights of patent or copyright, the hiring of goods, with or without a formal contract of hire, the letting of premises, such as an hotel permitting someone to display an advertisement or goods on its premises. Secondly, it is not possible specifically to provide for all the restrictive arrangements which it may be necessary to bring within the scope of the tax.  Consequently, I consider it is better that the provision should be drafted in general terms.  Thirdly, if something is done in the course of business&mdash;if it is not done in the course of business there is, of course, no liability to tax&mdash; then it is, by definition, done for consideration of some kind, though not necessarily a money consideration and the words &ldquo;for consideration&rdquo; in the amendment do not therefore appear to me to be necessary.</P>

      <P>I am not at all satisfied with the reply given by the Minister. The Minister may have a point about the use of the words &ldquo;for consideration&rdquo; and I am prepared to contemplate that possibility, but I do not fully understand in what circumstances there would be no consideration and yet something to tax.  The Minister may have a technical legal point there.  What I am clear on is that, in so far as this arises out of an EEC obligation I do not think we should go beyond what is necessary in this respect; when it comes to such a dubious area as taxing people for not doing things, with or without consideration, we seem to confine ourselves to the requirement of the EEC. The EEC says nothing about tolerating a situation.  There is no requirement whatever in that respect.  It is the carrying out of an obligation to refrain from exercising in whole or in part a business activity or right included in this list.  Now, tolerating a situation is not specified there.  It is included here and it should not be included. Secondly, I do not think the omission of an act is sufficient.  There must be an obligation of some kind.  If you leave out the words &ldquo;for consideration&rdquo;, as the Minister wishes to do, all our lives we spend not doing the various things we could do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is nothing in it to say that the omission of the act must be something which has led to a benefit accruing to the person.  There are no words such as &ldquo;for consideration, for benefit or reward&rdquo;.  Nothing of that kind is included.  The Minister, in fact, has rejected a proposal to include any such words.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering it, but it is difficult with all the interruptions. The pork butcher across the road might be passing chops, or something, and the Revenue Commissioners believe there is a reward of some kind, which they cannot trace, and they say: &ldquo;We believe the omission to sell pork here is not a mere accident but that, in the course of business, this man is receiving a benefit which we cannot track down because of his not carrying on his business fully.  We believe that that benefit is such that he will be taxed on it.&rdquo;  The amendment is designed to meet that kind of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made it clear that very often the consideration is not one <Col N="1319" /> that can be traced, not one that can be identified but that there may be such consideration.  He insisted that the words &ldquo;for consideration&rdquo; be omitted in order to enable us to deal with this kind of situation.  I am unhappy about the situation which leaves the Revenue Commissioners such wide discretion that the omission of any act in the course of business can lead to taxation although there is no evidence of consideration.  They can say simply that they believe the omission of the act in the case concerned is so strange and inexplicable that it must be attributable to somebody having in some way persuaded him to do so because of some benefit such as a free holiday in the south of France.  What is involved here is the power of the Revenue Commissioners to tax somebody for the omission of an act in respect of which there is no evidence that any consideration has passed, and I object to that.  It is giving them too great a power.  In so far as we wish to any degree to enable them to deal with these kinds of situations we should confine ourselves to a situation which the EEC have decided needed to be dealt with, that is, where somebody has an obligation, there must be evidence of the existence of an obligation.  That is the crucial point.  Would Deputy Tully not agree?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made the case that the Revenue Commissioners should not have to prove a consideration, that in respect of the omission of an act they should be entitled to tax people on what they regard as the value of that omission even if they cannot show that any such value accrued to the person concerned. That is why amendment No. 1 on section 5 was rejected in Special Committee. Given that that is the Minister's position, I do not accept it as being desirable that the Revenue Commissioners should have such extensive power as to levy taxation, not merely for something done, where there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that in the course of business a man will not undertake to do something unless he gets value for it but also where he omits an act.  This is so vague and runs so far beyond the EEC directive as to give indefinite power to the Revenue Commissioners.  This is objectionable. In the EEC directive the point was appreciated that, although the word &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; is not used, that this could arise only when the carrying out of an obligation to refrain from exercising some business activity or right, the obligation implies that there is an agreement with somebody else and <Col N="1322" /> there can only be an obligation on somebody by virtue of an agreement with somebody else.  We are talking now about transactions between individuals.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in the EEC directive there is a situation where there must be an obligation imposed on a person not to do something and that this must be imposed by some form of agreement and that that agreement can have imputed to it some value.  Nobody will enter into an agreement not to do something in the course of business and to accept an obligation not to do something unless he receives some value for that.  If the words &ldquo;to carry out an obligation&rdquo; are used it can be argued that the words &ldquo;for consideration&rdquo; are not necessary.  If the Minister would be prepared to accept my amendment I would be prepared to drop the words &ldquo;for consideration&rdquo; because I have here the discharge of an obligation.  If the Minister argued with me that it would be tautologous to introduce the words &ldquo;for consideration&rdquo; I would be prepared to hear him but he has not argued that.  He has not been prepared to accept that the concept of an obligation should be imported into the Bill at all.  He has sought very greatly to widen the whole effect of the EEC requirement so that instead of it being confined to cases where there is an obligation to be established, he wants the Revenue Commissioners to be in a position to tax someone for not doing something although there is no evidence that that is as a result of an obligation through a contract entered into and that no evidence of consideration has passed. That is not reasonable and this House should not consider adopting a provision in legislation that would give such power to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether he is prepared to introduce into this at least the concept of obligation.  In the Bill it is stated that &ldquo;rendering&rdquo; means the performance or omission of any act or toleration of any situation but could not some wording be introduced such as &ldquo;means the performance or, the carrying out of an obligation to omit an act or to tolerate a situation&rdquo;?  I would be prepared to <Col N="1323" /> abandon the rest of my amendment if the Minister would be prepared to consider that.  It seems to me that on reflection the Minister will appreciate that this is too wide and that some limitation should be imposed on the power of the Revenue Commissioners to tax people for not doing something and that except where this arises from an obligation in some kind of contract for which, impliedly, some value must be given, there should not be such power of taxation.  I ask the Minister to accept a variation of the amendment on the lines I have suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 7, after &ldquo;transaction&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and not including hire purchase charges&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises the question discussed in the committee on taxation of hire purchase obligations.  The Minister argued that the reason for some complexity was that it was necessary to exempt banking services and insurance services from VAT.  The point was made that logically the principle of neutrality which he has employed in many other places in the Bill should apply to ensure that hire purchase transactions are also exempt from VAT.  The majority of less well off people must buy goods for which they have not ready cash on hire purchase rather than by getting a bank loan.  The system under which the method of finance used by better-off people is to be exempted from VAT but hire purchase, the method employed by less well off <Col N="1324" /> people, is to be subject to VAT seems inherently objectionable and discriminatory on a class basis.  Therefore, it seems important that hire purchase should be put on a basis of neutrality with banking transactions.  The matter is self-evident and I thought that on this issue the Minister might reconsider his position and that the Labour Party might support me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a bit much that we should have a situation where if somebody has money to buy an article he can do so and pay ordinary VAT.  If they have credit in a bank they can borrow the money to pay for the article and again pay only ordinary VAT but if the person is poor or one of the ordinary working people depending on an ordinary wage or salary and cannot rise to the first or second proposition, he then buys something on hire purchase and if he does so he not only pays VAT on the article purchased but he will also pay VAT on the interest or the additional sums he has to pay on hire purchase. This is wrong and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.  This is a useful amendment which should be very seriously considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a basic requirement of the neutral operation of the tax that the rate which applied to the delivery of goods of any kind will also apply to the hire of goods of the same kind.  If the rate on hire were lower, there would be a bias in favour of hire with consequent disturbance of existing trading patterns.  Similarly, if hire goods chargeable with the element of hire in a hire purchase agreement were not, there would be a bias in favour of hire purchase with consequential undesirable results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister develop that point?  I do not understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I developed this at considerable length in the special committee. It is true that if one were to obtain a personal loan in a bank with which the goods were purchased for <Col N="1325" /> cash one would avoid tax on the hire purchase charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the interest charged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the interest charges on the loan, but one is avoiding VAT on the hire purchase charges in a comparable situation.  In other words, if you do not get the loan and have to go on hire purchase you become liable to VAT on the hire purchase charges, the point of this amendment. This is true but approximately the same result would follow in regard to a purchase other than under hire purchase, for instance, if by virtue of getting a personal loan you were able to avail of favourable discount rates because of payment for cash or payment within a certain time.  This is another advantage one could get in this context by virtue of getting a personal loan.  The lesser lack of neutrality involved in this area is in no way confined to hire purchase.  This should be clearly understood.  It arises directly from the impracticability of bringing banking within the scope of VAT.  I gave some indication of the reasons for this in the special committee and I shall not go over them again.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make is that the difficulty arises not in relation to hire purchase only; it arises in other areas also because of the impracticability of bringing banking charges under VAT.  Of the EEC countries operating VAT, Germany, France and Luxembourg charge the full hire purchase price at the rate applicable to the goods.  The Netherlands and Belgium exempt the hire purchase charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained that if you do this you will give an advantage to hire purchase as <Col N="1326" /> against other forms of purchase and upset the existing trading pattern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister suggest that by accepting this amendment it will interfere with the trade as against buying through hire purchase and hiring?  This is the essence of the Minister's claim as I understand it.  It may be that what is in mind is industrial hire purchase, but what we are interested in, particularly in the Labour Party, are ordinary household goods, the ordinary articles an ordinary person buys on hire purchase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Quotations for electricity supply are based on the cost of making supply available and are calculated in accordance with fixed rules which are applied uniformly throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Government have always been concerned to ensure that within practical limits electricity is available at reasonable charges to all those desiring to take it.  A comprehensive review of rural electricity charges was carried out in 1968 as a result of which the Government arranged for a reduction in the higher special service charges, in some cases by as much as one-half to two-thirds.  The reductions then arranged applied to existing as well as future consumers. The present position is that any rural householder who is asked to pay a special service charge is in fact paying only about one-quarter of the recurring cost of keeping electricity available to him at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of rural electrification was again examined last year following which the Government approved a programme of expenditure of £18 million on rural electrification during the four years ending 31st March, 1975, towards which the State is making available a subsidy of £10 million. This is the maximum that can be made available in present circumstances and compares with a subsidy of £17 million paid towards expenditure of £49 million on rural electrification <Col N="1332" /> in the 25 years to 31st March, 1971.</P>
    <P>I dealt very fully with the question of rural electrification in my Second Reading speech on the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1971, which gave statutory authority to the Government's proposal.  I might add that the reduced terms arranged in 1968 are being continued in the new programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the charges for rural electrification connections and the special service charges put this service out of the range of poor people who just cannot pay these charges?  That is a fact. Poor people in isolated areas cannot afford to have electricity supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the problem but there is the very realistic fact to be taken into account of the annual loss on rural electrification of £3¼ million to the ESB.</P>

      <P>The answer is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that the actual level of prizes being paid does not represent interest at 8 per cent, which is a very moderate rate of interest in present terms and that, as the inducement to investors to buy prize bonds is the number and level of prizes, would the Minister not consider increasing the prize fund?  Remuneration would be considerably less than in the case of an ordinary national loan and it would make it more attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of interest is equivalent to 6 per cent gross, standard rate of income tax, and this compares with three months Exchequer bills, which is around 6 per cent, subject to tax, and the fund is repayable on demand.  In the opinion of the Minister for Finance, the recent improvements, which commenced in March, 1971, have been reasonably successful in their operation&mdash;the increase in the value of prizes, the increase in the rate of interest from 4 to 4½ per cent, net, and draws being held each month, prize bonds on sale all the year round and the fact that a bond may win a prize up to 24 calendar <Col N="1339" /> months after the death of a holder.  He is of the opinion that these improvements in the scheme are adequate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state the number of people who applied to his Department to take up a grant for the year 1971-72 under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, and who gained such a grant in any year prior to 1971.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There could be no question of operating a higher education grants scheme on the basis of giving those who have qualified for such grants liberty to divorce themselves completely <Col N="1343" /> from study over an indefinite period and then be allowed to enter an institution of higher education and take up the grant.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the higher education grants scheme being operated by the local authorities for the postponement of grants where circumstances made it difficult or impossible for the student to enter higher education immediately, each application being considered on its merits.</P>
    <P>Applications for grants or the postponement of grants are not made to my Department but to the local authority concerned in each case.  It would be a matter for the local authority to decide whether the submission of the application to my Department was either necessary or warranted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not at all agree with the Minister's attitude in relation to this matter.  Is he not aware that the Department rules on such matters as late applications and on the reasons given by an applicant as to why he could not pursue a course in the year in which he gets the scholarship, and that furthermore the Department's ruling in these matters is unnecessarily strict and narrow? If we are to provide education for people with high academic standards should we not endeavour to provide it at all times and ensure that a liberal ruling will always be given by the Department?  This is not so at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

Would he not agree that the attitude of the Department is unreasonable, bureaucratic and contrary to the spirit and intent of the scheme which is to help people to get to university and not to hinder them?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Systematic progeny testing of AI beef bulls has only recently been introduced and as the main basis for selection will be performance testing, the scope of the progeny testing will be limited.  The first progeny test results are not expected until 1974.  From time to time AI beef bulls have been culled on the basis of field assessment of progeny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any exhaustive tests done in the past, but the current practice is to do performance testing on the stud bulls. This, of course, takes into account consideration of the animal's general formation. In the case of beef bulls, it is not nearly so necessary to do progeny testing as it would be in the case of dairy cattle because the physical characteristics, like daily weight gain and so forth, are more transmissible in beef cattle than they are in other cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Creamed rice is not recorded separately in the import statistics and I am not aware of any project to manufacture the product in Limerick.  Creamed rice imports are subject to customs duty and package duty but a general quantitative import restriction thereon would not be consonant with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement or the position that will obtain on accession to the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that all our creamed rice is imported? Is he not aware also that in Limerick there is an organisation who are capable of producing creamed rice that would be as good as, if not better than, the imported quality?  We are concerned with the creation of employment in the Condensed Milk Company and it is on behalf of the workers of that company that I speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be aware of the increased output of milk that has taken place in the last year or so and of the greater employment that arises from it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that this company is another <Col N="1356" /> Dairy Disposal Company organisation. The Dairy Disposal Company have been so inept and lackadaisical in their approach that we are being deprived of further employment in Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his somewhat similar question on 2nd December last.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Industrial <Col N="1362" /> Development Authority that during 1970, one new grant-aided industry commenced production in the area with an estimated employment at full production of 100; in 1971, six new grant-aided industries commenced production with an estimated employment at full production of 650 persons, and during the first half of 1972 one project commenced production with an estimated employment at full production of 160 persons.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the industrial situation in the Cork city area and my Department and the IDA are doing everything possible to attract industry there.  I am informed that at present, there are three new industry projects under construction in the area and that a further three have been approved for grant assistance but are not yet under construction; employment at full production in these projects is estimated at more than 1,000 people.

      <P>I am not aware of an increase in the number of fatal accidents due to faulty electric wiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Electro-Technical Council of Ireland, a body representative of technical and commercial electrical interests, has been working in close consultation with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards on the preparation of standards and codes of practice for wiring rules.  This work will take some time to complete and I understand that as an interim measure an arrangement will shortly be put into operation whereby electrical contractors will be required to complete a certificate, drawn up by the Electro-Technical Council, to the effect that any work done has been carried out in accordance with the National Wiring Regulations of 1968.  I understand, when this arrangement is put into <Col N="1367" /> operation, the Electricity Supply Board will require such a certificate before connecting the electrical supply.  The national wiring rules to which I have referred were prepared in 1968 by the National Wiring Rules Committee. This committee was representative of the ESB and a number of electrical contractors' and consultants' associations.</P>
    <P>While official bodies such as the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the ESB and voluntary bodies such as the Electro-Technical Council are doing very valuable work in establishing standards of safety, the prevention of accidents is ultimately a matter for the consumer.  It is important that all consumers should realise their responsibility for insisting on good workmanship in all electrical work undertaken for them and avoiding any dangerous improvisations.</P>

    <Title>Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Bill, 1972: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Pensions in respect of ministerial and parliamentary offices were initiated by the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, which was largely based on the recommendations of a committee of inquiry into ministerial and other salaries in 1937. While the committee accepted that the offices of Minister and Ceann Comhairle should be pensionable they considered that a gratuity only should be payable to former Parliamentary Secretaries and that no provision should be made for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The Government accepted the committee's recommendations, except that they decided to make the office of Parliamentary Secretary pensionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> It is clear, however, that there was support for equating the benefits for Parliamentary Secretary and Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as it was only after considerable discussion that the committee decided that the latter would not qualify for a gratuity.  Furthermore, the committee found that the duties devolving on the Leas-Cheann Comhairle were onerous and for all practical purposes demanded his whole-time attention, if the essential requirements of the office were to be fulfilled.  This remains true today and warrants making the office pensionable, especially when account is taken of the widespread extension of pensionability to employments in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, makes the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle pensionable on the same basis as applies to the office of Parliamentary Secretary. It also covers any past holders of the office still alive, or their widows, and pensions will be payable as from a date not earlier than the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a reasonable proposal.  As the Minister remarked, the matter was considered many years ago by the committee which inquired into it and a strong view was expressed in the minutes of the committee that this office should be pensionable. Finally a slightly different arrangement was recommended and this was not proceeded with.  Experience has shown that the occupant of the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle spends almost the same time in the Chair as the Ceann Comhairle, with very minor variations.  For that reason there is a good deal to be said for treating the two positions on a similar basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to one other aspect of the Bill.  When this measure was originally introduced it provided pensions for the first time for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries as well as for the Ceann Comhairle.  Experience has shown since that the minimum qualification period laid down can operate unfairly in a number of ways.  The minimum period is three <Col N="1370" /> years and it operates unfairly in that certain holders of offices, if they are engaged in business or a professional or any other activity which claims their personal attention and requires their personal presence at all times, have been obliged to cease that activity on attaining office.  That was the practice.</P>
    <P>Other persons filling ministerial positions and operating a different type of business, or possibly owning a farm, can have that undertaking continued while ceasing to operate it directly themselves.  Therefore, the question of reducing the minimum period should be considered so that people who are obliged to give up a professional or business undertaking would be in the same position as other office holders who can have extra service added in order to qualify for a minimum pension.  I mention this for consideration.  It is not in the Bill but it is a matter that might be considered in future.  This Bill meets our approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle of this House or, indeed, Speaker or Deputy Speaker of any democratic Parliament, is a very high office indeed. We have been lucky in that down through the years the persons who held either office were men of the highest integrity.  Therefore we have pleasure in supporting the proposals put before the House by the Minister.</P>
      <P>There are one or two questions I should like to ask.  The Minister says this is retrospective.  In what way will it affect the position of a Ceann Comhairle who has held office as Leas-Cheann Comhairle while the office was not pensionable?  Will that be covered?  Secondly, when the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle is being equated to a certain extent with that of Ceann Comhairle for pension purposes, is there any reason why the holder of this office should not be supplied with transport like Parliamentary Secretaries, Ministers and the Ceann Comhairle?  The Labour Party welcome the decision to make this office pensionable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the question by Deputy Tully, retrospection does not arise here in the sense that no right to pension can accrue until after the Bill is passed.  It does arise in the sense that service as a Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the past would count as to half its value for the purpose of assessing eligibility for pension as Ceann Comhairle. The same principle operates in regard to a Parliamentary Secretary if he becomes Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of reasons.  The Deputy may be aware that in recent times a decision was taken to provide the Leas-Cheann Comhairle with official transport when the Ceann Comhairle is ill and he is acting as Ceann Comhairle.  There is that change in the position.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave, again I think he admitted that it was not directly relevant on this but it is relevant, of course, under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938. This point has been raised before and, having gone into it, I have been obliged to reject the suggestion made by Deputy Cosgrave.  As he is aware, I have recently undertaken, at his request, to have another look at it.  I am in the process of doing that.  All I can say about it at the moment is that I see enormous difficulties involved in it if only from the point of view of <Col N="1372" /> deciding, once one departs from the existing procedure, where one draws the line.  Subject to that, I am examining this matter again and I have not completed my examination of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can either.  The basic issue here is the lack of neutrality, to use the Minister's words, between hire purchase and interest.  The Minister suggested in some obscure way that if you exempt hire purchase charges, as you exempt bank interest charges, in some way you will be disturbing the neutrality between a purchase that is on hire purchase and a purchase that is not.  That is not the issue.  The goods in all cases pay the tax.  The question at issue is whether the interest charges, which are exempt from value-added tax if it is a bank loan, should or should not be payable when it is a hire purchase arrangement.  The Minister has given no reason, other than an assertion that this will affect the neutrality as between goods purchased on hire purchase and goods purchased by cash, for wanting to depart from the principle of neutrality in this respect.  While one could make a case on the grounds of the different kinds of people who use these different facilities for departing from neutrality in favour of hire purchase charges, on the grounds that people who use hire purchase are generally less well off than those who use bank loans, you certainly cannot make a case the other way round.  To suggest that bank loans must for some reason be exempt, that the interest charges on bank loans must be exempt, but not hire purchase charges, is a movement in the wrong direction, against the poorer person.  The Minister has given no reason for this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not developed that point where I said there are complications about taxing bank loans.  Given that that is the situation, there are three ways of buying goods.  You can borrow from the bank, you hire purchase or you pay cash. Hiring and leasing has nothing to do with it.  That is a different transaction altogether.  You could not achieve neutrality between activities so different in kind as leasing something and buying something.  In so far as the Minister made that point, it is irrelevant to the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned with people who are buying something.  The man who has not got cash has to get a loan, normally <Col N="1376" /> through a bank, or he hire purchases. If he is well-off he will tend to go to the bank for the money or increase his overdraft.  If he is not, he will tend to hire purchase.  No doubt there are people who cross the borderline. There is a broad distinction between hire purchase and a bank loan.</P>
    <P>The neutrality we seek is as between people buying goods.  As between those people, bank loans are exempt; hire purchase is not; and there is, therefore, lack of neutrality which the Minister has not justified.  I have not heard any reason.  I have heard a reason on a different point which does not arise on this issue.  As he has not given a reason, we have no alternative to pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>They form an alternative in so far as they involve a somewhat different system of rounding but do not deal at all with the question of the single rate of tax at retail level because some of the rounding refers to the very tax which we are trying to eliminate in amendment No. 16.

      <P>I do not mind very much but the single rate of tax and <Col N="1379" /> rounding are totally different issues. However, we can take them together.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In pages 14 and 15, to delete subsections (1) and (2) and to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Tax shall, subject to subsection (2) be charged at whichever of the following rates is appropriate in any particular case&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  11 per cent of the appropriate amount of any consideration which relates to the promotion of dances and the delivery (if any) of goods and the rendering (if any) of services other than those specified in the First, Second and Third Schedules, in connection with dances, where payment of the consideration for such delivery or rendering is included in the consideration in respect of admission to the dance or is a condition of admission.</P>
      <P>(b)  30 per cent of the appropriate amount of any consideration which relates to the delivery of goods specified in the Third Schedule.</P>
      <P>(c)  5 per cent on the appropriate amount of any consideration which relates to the delivery of goods or the rendering of services other than those specified in the First, Second and Third Schedules.</P>
      <P>(d)  zero per cent of the appropriate amount of any consideration which relates to the delivery of any goods in the circumstances specified in paragraph (i) or (c) of the Second Schedule or the delivery of goods of a kind specified in paragraphs (vi) to (viii) of that Schedule or the rendering of services of a kind specified in that Schedule.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where goods which are of a kind specified in the Third Schedule and which&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  were imported, or sold in the State, before the specified day in such circumstances that wholesale tax was chargeable or would have been chargeable if that tax <Col N="1380" /> had been in force on the date of the importation or sale, or</P>
    <P>(b)  were imported or delivered on any previous occasion on or after that date in such circumstances that tax at the rate of 30 per cent was chargeable in relation to such importation or delivery.</P>
    <P>are delivered within the State on or after the specified day by a person other than a manufacturer of goods of the kind so delivered, tax shall be charged at the rate of 5 per cent of the appropriate amount of the consideration for such delivery.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As these amendments are being discussed together, I shall have to deal with both the single rate of tax and the rounding of the amounts.  I shall not dwell on the latter because Deputy Collins will want to speak on that in relation to his amendment and discuss the issue and principle of rounding more fully than I would wish to do. I am concerned with the single rate of tax.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be to eliminate the present wholesale tax rate of 10 per cent which, in conjunction with turnover tax, means a 16.37 per cent tax rate, although, as I pointed out earlier that, in fact, involves a higher figure and more money than is involved in the present wholesale tax.  A system that imposes two separate rates of tax is, we believe, something to be avoided.  We also believe&mdash;I shall not dwell on this&mdash; that products like food should be excluded or derated.  As this would cause some difficulties for retailers&mdash;though, by no means, the same difficulties as having two tax rates&mdash;we feel this is an added reason for having a simpler tax rate.  To achieve this in accordance with the amendment set down would involve a loss of revenue to the Exchequer because it would involve charging goods that are now charged at 10 per cent wholesale tax at the turnover tax rate only.  That is a strong reason against the amendment, but I would point out that the reason why the amendment takes this form, and why it does not make any provision to cope with the problem which would undoubtedly be posed for the <Col N="1381" /> Exchequer in losing this tax revenue, is that the Rules of the House and, indeed, I believe the Constitution do not permit us to make proposals involving an increase in taxation and we would, therefore, be ruled out of order if we put down an amendment in that form.  I am, I think, permitted to say however that, as far as we are concerned, we recognise the need to maintain revenue and, were the principle in this amendment to be accepted with a view to securing a single rate of tax at retail level, we would be sympathetic to an appropriate proposal to secure additional revenue by other means.  This would clearly involve some adjustment in tax rates so I would like the House not to take this amendment too literally but to recognise that the rules have necessitated our putting down an amendment which is really not in the form in which we would like it to be, and which involves an adverse impact on the Exchequer, whereas we fully recognise, as a responsible Opposition, that if you are going to have a single rate of tax and if you are going to have also, as we will propose in a later amendment, a zero rate on food and other products, adjustments would need to be made in tax rates to obviate any loss.  What I would like to discuss, therefore, on this amendment is the principle of the single rate of tax and not the literal wording of the amendment.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, if retailers and wholesalers have two rates of tax proposals, very severe problems will be posed for them indeed, especially because the borderline between the two is by no means clear.  We have had representations from one organisation, the Irish Drug Association, setting out some of the products in question.  I think these came up at the special committee where the point was made by us that, on the basis of that list, it becomes extremely difficult for anyone running any kind of business to make the necessary distinction.  The whole business would need to be organised in a different way to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The products that were mentioned were baby cream, which would have a tax of 5.26 per cent, baby powder which would have a tax of 16.37 per cent, baby food which would have a <Col N="1382" /> tax of 5.26 per cent and baby bottles and teats would have a tax of 16.37 per cent, nappy-liners, 5.26 per cent, but nappy-pins 16.37 per cent, magnesia 5.26 per cent and baby toilet utensils, not unconnected, 16.37 per cent.  A system which requires a chemist to segregate all these articles on the basis of distinctions which are certainly not clear to me and not, I think, to the chemist, never mind the baby, is one which introduces unnecessary complexity into the system and the desirability of having a single rate of tax is immediately evident.  One can take that position and, at the same time, believing that food should be zero-rated, a clearcut division in regard to food and things like newspapers and books should be easy enough to operate.  Even if our other proposal in relation to certain other goods other than food sold by grocers is accepted the purpose of that is, in fact, to make it simpler for the average grocer's shop which deals in other articles like soap and detergents to operate, drawing a line roughly where the grocer's shop ends and another type of shop begins.  We could argue the merits of that and I can see a case being made against extending the zero rate on food to other products.  However, we can discuss that later.</P>
    <P>Any lines drawn must be clear and simple.  Where it is between zero-rating and two rates of tax it must be clear and simple for the retailer and wholesaler to be able to operate it simply. The rationale of distinguishing baby food from baby powder, nappy-liners from nappy-pins and baby powder from baby bottles and teats is something which is lost on me and I defy the Minister to produce a rationale which would come readily to the mind of the retail chemist so that, as he deals with these goods, he instinctively knows which one falls into which category.  No such clearcut distinctions exist at the present time.</P>
    <P>For these reasons it seems to me vital that there should be a single rate of tax and the demand for this from both the retail and the wholesale trade is overwhelming.  There are, of course, problems involved.  Of course, our system at present, involved in both a <Col N="1383" /> wholesale and a retail tax, does not easily lend itself to this without loss of revenue but we have put forward proposals, which I shall dwell on at greater length later, designed to meet this particular point.  It is our view that this could best be met by having a single rate of retail tax which would need to be marginally higher than the present rate to bring in additional revenue and to compensate for the loss of zero-rating food and the single rate of wholesale tax which would merge the present two rates of wholesale tax into something like an average of the two.  Such an arrangement could then be operated on the basis of trapping that wholesale tax at the manufacturing level and this would then reduce the number of taxes at retail level to a single rate of tax, plus, if our proposal in relation to food and other products is accepted, the zero-rating of these articles.  From the retailers' point of view and the wholesalers' point of view this would be very much simpler and it seems to us that, although this involves signiticant changes in the incidence of tax, as these charges can be secured in such a manner as to benefit the poorer consumer and place the burden on the better off, the only valid objection to the changes in the incidence of tax connected with the question of a single rate of tax disappears.  For these reasons we would press the Minister to accept the principles of the amendment by recognising that the amendment itself would need to be varied somewhat to ensure that acceptance of this principle would not lead to a loss of revenue to the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree in principle with what Deputy FitzGerald has said.  I am, however, more interested in my own amendments, Nos. 17 to 24, 28, 30, 31, 32, 48, 50 and 51.  These are concerned with the rounding of the rates of taxation under the value-added tax system.  Under the latter system our tax system will become more complicated.  I do not think this is fully appreciated in commercial and industrial circles.  I have been considering the structure which will emerge. <Col N="1384" /> We will have a zero rate of tax for some goods, a 5.26 per cent rate of tax for other goods and services, an 11.11 per cent rate of tax for certain activities, a 16.37 per cent rate of tax on goods not classified as luxuries and a rate of 30.26 per cent on certain luxury goods?  This will cause traders a great deal of trouble.</P>
      <P>There is a very good case for rounding off all these figures.  I refer the House to the proposals for a value-added tax system in a paper laid before this House in March, 1971.  On the section dealing with the manner in which value-added tax works it was stated that each taxpayer arrives at his liability by taking first the full amount invoiced by him for a chargeable period for taxable goods sold or taxable services rendered and by applying the rate or rates of tax appropriate thereto.  From the resulting sum he deducts the value-added tax invoiced to him on his purchases of goods or services or borne on goods imported by him in the same period.  This will necessitate a tremendous amount of accounting and accountability right along the line from the point of manufacture through the wholesale and retail levels.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that each business unit will have to have an invoice for each distinct purchase, setting out the prices of the goods to which will be added the appropriate rate of taxes for the various commodities.  In the case of some firms working on a two-monthly period, there would be thousands of transactions involved.  On the sales side the trader would have to keep separate accounts of the selling prices and would have to show also the appropriate rate or rates of tax charged on the selling prices of the goods.  These would all have to be compiled every two months and the tax paid would have to be substracted from the tax received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the figure should be rounded off if only for practical purposes.  By rounding them off as I have suggested, that is, from 5.26 to 5 per cent, from 11.11 to 10 per cent, from 30.26 to 30 per cent and from 16.37 to 10 per cent, a certain amount of simplicity would be introduced into the system <Col N="1385" /> in relation to invoicing.  This would help in no small way to alleviate the administrative difficulties which this system will involve for traders.  It will be difficult for a clerk in an office to make out invoices which will have columns for the various tax rates. Looking at the suggested invoices published by the Department it will be seen that this will lead to an expensive set of documentation.  I know that part of the exercise of this system is to make it unprofitable for people to evade taxation.  Under the value-added tax system each trader will be forced to keep proper accounts if he is to get the full value for tax he has to pay. He can do this only by offsetting the tax he has paid against the tax he has collected.  This will force a certain amount of proper accountability.  We in this party would not favour the evasion of taxes by anyone as was suggested by the Minister this morning. Such evasion would be very unfair to those traders who account for tax under the present systems.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House on this point but I wish to emphasise again the logic of rounding up the figures.  Admittedly the adoption of the figures I have mentioned would result in a loss of revenue to the Revenue Commissioners.  I am aware that a reduction in the rate from 16.37 to 10 per cent, for instance, would involve a substantial loss of revenue but I merely wish to make it clear to the House that the principle I am advocating is one of rounding off figures for the purpose of facilitating traders in compiling their daily invoices. I do not think anyone can argue against the validity of that principle. It is not a matter of a trader having to pay 5 per cent to the Revenue Commissioners and, therefore, having to charge 5.26 per cent on his turnover in order to bring in this amount.  This is the system operating at present under the turnover tax system which is a sales tax, whereas value-added tax is not a sales tax. Under the value-added tax system there will be a deduction from a gross receipt of tax.  I do not know why these fractional figures were suggested in the first place.  At the special committee it was suggested that the reason <Col N="1386" /> for them was to maintain the present structure of taxation.  I do not think that the present structure can be brought to the second decimal place. That is going beyond what is reasonable or necessary.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am speaking for every trader when I say that they would wish to have figures which could be ascertained easily at the point of making out invoices.  Instead of a 30.26 per cent rate I would not be against having a 33? per cent rate but, of course, I could not suggest that by way of amendment because it would be ruled out of order.  A figure of 33? per cent would be easy to calculate. Again, in relation to the 16.37 per cent rate I have suggested a rate of 10 per cent.  Perhaps a more realistic figure in this instance would be 15 per cent which would not be difficult to calculate either.  The point is that it should be possible to incorporate a system of simple figures which would reduce the task of calculation for the traders at all levels and in particular at retail level.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this question.  During the sittings of the special committee, he gave no indication of being sympathetic in relation to the practical administration of this new system at the commercial and industrial levels. I am asking him now to appreciate the obvious difficulties and unnecessary complications which these figures will involve for traders and to accept rounded off figures.</P>

      <P>This group of amendments, I think, provides a suitable opportunity to say a few words I want to say about the conduct of one of the members of the special committee. The Minister, at the end of the last ordinary meeting suggested that we should have a private meeting.  Next day there appeared in the newspapers, obviously from a particular Deputy whom the Minister identified for us at a subsequent meeting, a notice that this private meeting had been arranged, and not alone that, but a statement as to what was to be discussed at it.  I consider that conduct contemptible. Democracy cannot work if people behave like that.  Democracy is at present <Col N="1387" /> being subverted and here we have a Deputy who pretends to be a great upholder of democracy and he behaves like this.

      <P>If the word is required to be withdrawn I withdraw the word but I want to keep on my point.  This was a special committee set up for a very good reason which we all know.  They worked quite well and when they were finishing their ordinary sittings where a report was being taken, the Minister said: &ldquo;Let us have a special meeting about the taxation of food, a private meeting.&rdquo; That private meeting was held last Thursday and there were no reporters at it but before it was held, a member of the committee dashes off, gets in contact with the newspapers, saying the Minister made that suggestion and it all appeared the next day that the Fine Gael Party had proposed that taxation be taken off food.</P>

It was dishonourable and discreditable conduct and the result was&mdash;and this is what I am concerned about; I do not give a fig about Deputy FitzGerald scoring petty points&mdash;that when we met the Minister last Thursday his whole attitude had changed, perfectly correctly because his confidence had been disclosed in public and violated.  It was a most dishonourable and disgraceful business.  I do not care who did it: the Minister knows well that if anybody in the Minister's party did it I would say the very same things about him.

The whole atmosphere changed and rightly so; I think the Minister was quite right; if it had happened to me I should not have been as quiet about it as the Minister was.  He did not lose his temper but he certainly dug in his heels and he was not even going to consider our amendment.  I shall deal with that afterwards.  I can give very cogent reasons as to why we put it down.  I think the Minister appreciates those reasons.  The behaviour of Deputy FitzGerald on that occasion was not in accordance with ordinary common decency in political life.  Nobody does that kind of thing.

It was the action of a crazy coot individual to dash around to the newspapers and tell them we were going to have a private meeting, and what it was about.

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the proceedings of the committee which have already been published the Minister said that an evening-off of the tax would not achieve what we wanted.  He also said that what appears to be the case on the surface very often is the case if sufficient people come to believe it.  I discussed this matter with a professional accountant yesterday, a man of some standing in the city, and he told me there is no question but that the rounded figures are the ones.  I am not a professional accountant but I know a good deal about figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ordinary trader will be appalled by a figure like 16.37, for example. The Minister raised great objection to having more than two rates.  He said it would make it very complicated for the traders.  There are many people who go back like a snail into a shell at the sight of figures like these.  If the figure is 5 or 10 or 20 per cent they feel they know what it is about but the bulk of the people are horrified at a figure like 16.37.  Therefore I am strongly in favour of these amendments to get the system on an even keel.  I appreciate that computers and machines can be set to tick this thing out but there are many traders who not only could not afford a computer but could not afford any machine.  These unfortunate people, having started early in the morning and done their day's work, will have to spend at least one evening every <Col N="1396" /> week, probably until 2 o'clock in the morning, trying to make their returns to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officials may be right.  I want to make a comment. We did not see a Revenue Commissioner during all of these meetings. This is of some importance.  It is on the same topic as what I said about Deputy FitzGerald.  It does not do the standing of a special committee of this House any good if no Revenue Commissioner appears before it.  When I was a member of the Civil Service, during the budget debate the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners was always here and so was the secretary of the Department of Finance. Nowadays I notice they are here on the day of the big show, the day the Minister reads his budget speech, and then they &ldquo;vamoose&rdquo; and some juniors are put in instead of them.  I do not mean any disrespect to those men.  I simply mean that the senior men disappear.  I do not think they even wait for the motions to put the taxes into operation to be dealt with. They go immediately the Minister finishes speaking.  What I am doing is trying to defend democracy.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald was suspicious of the Prisons Bill and then he voted for it.  I have no use for lip-service democracy.  I believe in democracy and I have always believed in it.  If the private proceedings of a special committee are to be reported in advance to the newspapers they cannot function.  The special committee did not function that day.  That may appear to be a reflection on the Minister but it is not intended that way.  I do not blame the Minister for making up his mind that he had enough of that kind of thing and that he would not put up with it.  You cannot have a discussion in private and in public at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are all being taken together, I am glad to say.  There is a plethora of them.  It seems to me that they are reasonable from the point of view of how they will appear to the public.  You work this thing in fives: 5, 15, 30, something like that. <Col N="1397" /> I will leave what I was going to say in relation to the scheme which got so much publicity for Deputy FitzGerald and the Fine Gael Party to be dealt with on the amendment relating to tax on food.  I have said what I want to say on these amendments and I am strongly in favour of them.</P>

      <P>In that case it is only fair to the Minister that I should make my comment, which will be brief.  Like Deputy O'Donovan, I feel that there should be a rounded off figure.  I have been looking through the report of the debate in an effort to find the relevant portion where the Minister referred to the countries which were already charging value-added tax.  I am afraid there was a difference of opinion in the special committee about some of the rates of tax.  Eventually we ironed out what exactly was happening in the countries referred to.  I mentioned in the early part of the afternoon that while the Minister quoted The Netherlands as being the country on which we were basing our tax system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>Not copying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Basing&rdquo; is the word I used &mdash; he seemed to think that in Sweden there was also something worth following.  I found going through the report that somebody had done a pretty good job of selecting the tough systems and trying to incorporate them in ours.  This was a wrong idea.  As to the number of rates of taxes being used, the Minister said that in one country there were four rates being used.  It turned out that only two were in operation, the other two did not count very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been insisting that it is necessary to go to two places of decimals for the purpose of having an accurate tax here.  Of the countries on which he has been basing his system none has done so.  With one exception, all European countries have a rounded off system of tax.  There is <Col N="1398" /> one country using one system only. That is, of course, a high rate.  I do not think any of us would be satisfied if we chose that one, because the rate is too high.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the ground so well covered by Deputy O'Donovan and I do not want to quarrel with Deputy FitzGerald in this House or any where else.  Perhaps it does not do us any good.  I also believed that a mistake was made.  When the Minister asked for a private meeting to discuss a matter which was mentioned to members of the committee, it was a pity that meeting did not remain a private meeting until the matter was discussed.  Afterwards the press and the general public would have had available to them what we had decided to do.  In the early days I could see no reason why the press were not allowed to be present at our meetings. It was pointed out that we would have more freedom to express views.  This was agreed.  In those circumstances I do not think it is fair that a slanted version of what happened should have appeared.  I have great respect for the gentlemen of the press.  We have to when we are in public life.  Perhaps if I had put in a version I would have slanted it towards myself although I do not think I would.  A slanted version was given to the press.  It appeared as if nobody took part in the discussions&mdash;there was one reference to the Labour Party&mdash;except Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and Deputy FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>One of the things that I had been referring to on a later amendment which Deputy Collins asked about was, perhaps, the most important matter raised at any of the meetings.  I believe that he and a number of other Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil members, possibly because the press were not present, were prepared to express the view held by the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners at the committee meeting.  This was done.  I do fear for the future of special committees.  If I take part in future committees either the press will be present or a statement will be issued.  It is most unfair to those who work so hard to get things done to find that the general public were given the impression that <Col N="1399" /> nobody except the Minister and Deputy FitzGerald took part in the debate. We would not be raising the matter here but for the fact that it has been brought to our notice by the general public.  In fact, I was given credit for a little point, that I was interested in taking the tax off school books, but he added &ldquo;only&rdquo;.  Having regard to the fact that Deputy O'Donovan's and my amendment dealt with the tax on food, that was a little bit thick, even for Deputy FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument, that it is necessary in order to have the amount of tax which is to be collected as even as possible to what is being collected at present under existing taxes, two decimal points must be used, is an argument that I am not prepared to accept. At a special committee meeting on 21st June the Minister said:</P>
    <P>By taking 5 per cent. of 105.26, we collect precisely the same amount as is collected under turnover tax at the moment, which is 5 per cent on a tax inclusive basis.  The VAT is on a tax exclusive basis.  That means that if goods are sold at 105.26 and if you take 5 per cent as being the amount of the tax, that works out at 5.26, which is the amount of the tax.</P>
    <P>What the Minister was saying is that 5 per cent is what is being collected under the turnover tax.  Can the Minister find anything wrong with the system under which the turnover tax is being collected?  If it is all right to collect it at the even 5 per cent now, why is it necessary to change to 5.26? The same applies to the other rates of tax.  If the effect is the same, why not leave it as people understand it?  There are persons in the Revenue Commissioners office and in this House who cannot visualise the position of a small shopkeeper trying to estimate what a 5.26 tax on 35p or 36p comes to.  There are people, even in the House, who would have difficulty.  I do not know how the customers will find out whether or not they are being treated fairly.  In a craze to have things absolutely right and because the Revenue Commissioners want to prove that they are doing what they feel should be done, they have introduced these little refinements <Col N="1400" /> which have caused so much trouble.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with Deputy FitzGerald that a single rate of tax would be ideal. The Minister said it could not be done. He also says that if we have zero tax rating this is, in fact, another tax.  We disagreed on that before.  We will disagree again.  Would the Minister not agree that it will be extremely difficult for somebody going to the supermarket where there will be a little girl at the check-out point who must calculate the price of the commodities bought and decide whether the tax is at 5.26 per cent or 16.37 per cent, in addition to the price?</P>
    <P>When I asked the Minister did he think this difficulty could be got over the Minister came back with the rather pat answer, which does not fit in, and his suggestion was that possibly something that had been suggested to the RGDATA earlier could be adopted, that the tax could be put on at shelf prices for the 5.26 and, therefore, there would be only one rate of tax to be watched by the girl at the check-out.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that if you attempt to put on tax at shelf prices&mdash; and I know it is done already by those who put up a sign in the window saying: &ldquo;No turnover tax collected here,&rdquo; because they must get it in some way&mdash;the item which costs only a few pence will have added on to it the lowest amount of tax that can be put on, that is, the new half penny.  If you put a new half penny on to something which costs two, three, four, five or six pennies, does the Minister not realise that that is far in excess of the amount of tax? Therefore, the obvious way to put on the tax is to do it at the check-out where the entire bill can be put together.</P>
    <P>However, if that is done, how do you get over the two rates of tax?  I am quite sure the Minister will, some time before the Bill finishes, come back with the story that he used when the decimal currency was being introduced: &ldquo;It is all right.  The traders can take the tax off one item and add it on to another and the average will work out all right.&rdquo;  There are two things wrong with that: No. 1, it will <Col N="1401" /> not work on a small item being bought and on which a half new penny will be much higher than the proper rate of tax; and, secondly, what happened when decimal currency was being introduced and when there was talk of reducing the price of one item and increasing the price of the other? Our friends, the traders, in many cases reduced the price on the slow-selling item and increased the price on the fast-selling item, and we know who made the money then.  This is a problem which I do not think it is easy to deal with, and I am not asking the Minister just to wave a wand and decide it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  If it is, why have the other European countries that are operating VAT gone for the rounded tax rather than for tax running to two decimal places?  Or are we the smartest race?  If so, we should have been in Europe long ago and taken over.  There must have been some reason for it, and I believe the reason for it is that the Revenue Commissioners believe they are smarter than anyone else in Europe and are going to show the rest of Europe how things should be done.  They may be very clever people but I think they are making a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the introduction of 5.26 is a mistake, and, as regards the introduction of a second rate of tax, 16.37, to suggest that anybody can easily work that out is a mistake for the Minister.  I know quite well the Minister will say: &ldquo;It is the <Col N="1402" /> same thing except that it is the difference between tax exclusive and tax inclusive,&rdquo; but you cannot tell that to the country grocer, because he is the man who will have to operate it.  I believe that eventually it will show a higher rate of tax all round, that when the goods are being finally bought they will be bought at an excessive price, that there will be a small extra cost added on.  In addition to that, the customer is the person who will have to pay the tax anyway, because all the people who have handled the goods before him will collect it from him. For that reason, if for no other, the arrangements should be as simple as possible.  It should be a single rate of tax or, if that is not possible, it should be rounded off so that those who are handling it would be able to understand what exactly they are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do.  If I may get to the other main matters I have to deal with, the question of rounding, on the one hand, and, in effect, the concept of trapping tax at wholesale level which is inherent in the first amendment proposed by Deputy FitzGerald. On the question of rounding, there seems to me to be still a good deal of misconception.  The first misconception is this: Deputy Tully still believes that in the other countries which apply value-added tax they do not have these odd rates, but he is not right in this.  If I may burden the House for a moment with some examaples: France has rates of 7.5, 17.6, 23 and 33.3; Belgium has whole numbers; Germany has 5.5 and 12 per cent; The Netherlands has whole numbers, 4 and 14 per cent; Luxembourg has 5 and 10 per cent; Sweden has 17.65 per cent, which is to two decimal places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that.  I am merely dealing with what I regard as a very minor point.  What is a major point in all this is that Deputy Tully, despite all the discussion we have had on this&mdash;and they have been lengthy &mdash;does not seem yet to have grasped why we have these peculiar-looking rates here, because he asked whether the Revenue Commissioners think they are smarter than anybody else in Europe.  The real point as to why we have these odd-looking rates is that they are as close as we can get to the existing rates.  For instance, the 5 per cent turnover tax is exactly the same as the 5.26 value-added tax.  Therefore, when Deputy Tully talks about the problem, and it is a problem, of applying tax to a small item and where the smallest amount you can add is half a new penny, he is talking about what is a genuine problem but he is not talking about a new problem or about a problem arising under VAT.  This is a problem arising at the moment under turnover tax because it is precisely the same level of tax as will be charged under VAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not completed my argument.  The point I am making, and it is a very important point and relevant to this whole discussion, is that the rates which are proposed are arrived at on the basis of existing sales taxes.  This means that, in the case of <Col N="1405" /> a customer going into a shop to purchase something which is subject to turnover tax at the moment, but not subject to wholesale tax, he should pay precisely the same price after VAT as before because the tax will be exactly the same.  The amount of tax collected by the Revenue Commissioners on the particular item is exactly the same.  Unless one grasps that basic fact, one can go completely wrong and can certainly say that having rates which go to two decimal points does not make sense.  We would not have contemplated these very strange-looking rates but for the fact that I was determined that we were not, by introducing VAT, going to provide an excuse for increases in prices because, in so far as the consumer was concerned, the consumer who goes in, after VAT comes into force, to buy £1 worth of groceries should get, other things being equal, exactly the same as before because the tax will be exactly the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us say that we took 5 per cent instead of 5.26 per cent. What we would be doing then is, first of all, reducing the amount of tax collected on particular items and then finding ourselves faced with raising that amount somewhere else&mdash;that is problem No. 1, where do you raise it? &mdash;and secondly, from the point of view of the customer going into a shop, does Deputy O'Donovan or any other Deputy believe that by reducing the rate to 5 per cent the cost is going to go down?  I do not believe it.</P>

      <P>I will come to the shopkeeper in a moment.  I am speaking now from the point of view of the customer, the man-in-the-street, going into a shop.  If we reduce the rate from 5.26 to 5 per cent do you think he is going to pay a lower price?  I do not. As it is, with 5.26 per cent he will pay exactly the same as under turnover tax now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how much clearer I can make this point but I think it is essential to grasp it, that we are proposing 5.26 per cent VAT because it is the precise equivalent of 5 per cent turnover tax.  To the man-in-the-street, the important thing is that he is paying exactly the same, not more or less tax nor more or less for the goods, so that there is no disturbance in the price of the goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another point, but on the question of rounding, which is what we are discussing on these amendments the fact is that if the man-in-the-street finds that as a result of changing to VAT the price of the commodities he buys in a grocery shop are the same, that the tax is not changed even though it looks different, he is not concerned in working out 5 per cent or 5.26 per cent.  If the price does not change, that is what he is concerned about. This is unanswerable from the point of view of the customer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is.  I think that from the point of view of somebody paying in a shop, it is very real. If the price of his goods goes up or alternatively, there is a reduction in tax but the price does not go down, that is very real from the point of view of the man-in-the-street&mdash;the customer.  I am quite convinced that <Col N="1407" /> from his point of view the case for having a 5.26 rate instead of 5 per cent as suggested is unanswerable but from the point of view of the shopkeeper the situation is different.  The argument is made that this is going to present enormous problems from the shopkeeper's point of view because calculating on the basis of 5.26 per cent is very difficult, compared with 5 per cent.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that so far as the shopkeeper is concerned, it may look as though the thing is going to be far more difficult for him, but let us examine what is involved.  First of all, if you take 5 per cent instead of 5.26 per cent, this involves a more simple calculation but, conversely, it produces a figure for him in calculating his actual tax liability to the Revenue Commissioners of something like 4.762 per cent on a tax-exclusive base, so that whatever you do&mdash;if you round the rates in the Bill&mdash;you produce uneven rates for the shopkeeper in calculating his liability to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy and perhaps he would let me put my arguments.  What I am trying to put across is not so complex but the Deputy seems to think it is and perhaps the Deputy might give me the opportunity to do it.  He will have an opportunity to reply.  It is very important that this should be understood by Deputies as to what this involves. So far as the shopkeeper is concerned &mdash;and as I said, this is the negative side of it&mdash;if he has an even figure of 5 per cent to charge, he has to do a calculation with a very odd number to calculate his tax, some figure running to three decimal points.  That is the first point.  The second point is that, when you analyse what is involved for the shopkeeper, you find, first of all, that he will be issued by the Revenue Commissioners with a ready reckoner which will show at a glance in regard to all the figures he will be dealing with what the tax is. He does not have to calculate.  He just has to look up the ready reckoner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, any shopkeeper in the course of time becomes very used to the items he is selling.  Even with a fairly wide range he knows what the goods cost him, what he sells them for and what his profit is.  He knows this by force of habit.  He is ordering the same goods month after month and, for the vast bulk of his range of goods, he is very familiar with all this.  The result is that, in the course of time, for <Col N="1409" /> the vast bulk of his goods he will not even have to look at his ready reckoner. These arguments are equally true of the wholesaler and the manufacturer. I am just adding that in.  I am describing it from the point of view of the retailer who seems to me to be the person most likely to have these problems of calculation.</P>
    <P>For those who are in a bigger way of business and for whom the thing could be complex, most of them, if not all, will in fact use machines to do this calculation and there will virtually be no difference for them what ever rate you make or how many decimal points there are because the machine will be set to do the calculation.  I do not think we need worry about these people.  The people we need to think about are those who have no machines and who will have to make their own calculation.  I suggest people will not have to calculate a rate of 5.26 per cent on something; they will just look at a ready reckoner.  When you look at this, and when you analyse it, you realise that the suggestion of a shopkeeper sitting up until 2 o'clock in the morning doing all these calculations just does not stand up.  The arguments for altering these odd figures&mdash;the 5.26, the 11.11, the 16.37 and so on&mdash;based on the difficulties involved for people in making calculations just do not stand up.</P>
    <P>We come back then to the question: why have these rates?  Why not have even numbers?  I come back now to the first point I made.  It is a point I should like everyone to understand. We have them because they are the closest mathematical equivalent we can get to the present taxes.  I want to ensure that, when value-added tax comes in, there will not be a change in the rate of tax so that a person going into a shop will not be faced with the situation in which, if the price is increased, the shopkeeper can say the increase is due to value-added tax. I want customers to be in a position to know that, if anyone increases prices and says the increases are due to value-added tax, the customer can say that is not so and it can be investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just say about the £3½ million mentioned by Deputy FitzGerald that he knows this is going back to the taxpayer and not to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is for these reasons that I am opposed to the <Col N="1411" /> amendments which suggest the rounding of the figures.  I believe that the alleged advantages are illusory and the practical effect would be to provide an excuse for changes in prices, whether up or down, but mainly up, and the customer would not know what was right and what was wrong.  Under this system the customer will know that the value-added tax system is not providing an excuse for increasing prices and it can, therefore, be much more easily checked on.</P>
      <P>On the other main issue raised in Deputy FitzGerald's amendment, what is involved here is, of course, tied in with a later amendment and the proposals which got publicity in the newspapers, to which the Labour Deputies referred; the principle involved in this is involved in that too.  This is the principle of trapping part of the tax at the wholesale level.  There are a number of objections to this approach.  It emerged this morning in discussion on another amendment that Deputy FitzGerald was under the impression that the value-added tax on building materials, and so forth, would, in fact, be paid back to the traders.  It will not. I think that misconception of his is built in to this proposal also but, leaving that aside and accepting that the loss of £3 million revenue on motor cars, radios, televisions, <i>et cetera</i>, would not be made up within the value-added tax system and would have to be made up somewhere else, even allowing for all that, we find that the rates suggested by Deputy FitzGerald are not sufficient.  I am in some difficulty here in that I am in danger of spilling over into a discussion on the other proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No more than is trapped at present, but the basic idea of the single rate at retail level does involve trapping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to have a single rate at retail level without trapping.  My difficulty is that, if I do not deal with it now, I will not, in fact, be dealing properly with Deputy FitzGerald's amendment.  On the other hand, if I do deal with it, it will come up again later and I do not want to be repeating myself.  Perhaps it would be better to say simply that there are a number of possible, cogent, detailed objections to this concept of trapping and that I will elaborate on them on a later amendment.  Perhaps it would be better to say at this stage that that is so and, for that reason, I am opposed to this amendment which involves this concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate the thoroughness of the Minister's replies in many respects but he has not dealt with the basic question of the desirability of having a single rate of tax at retail level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody will agree that one rate is desirable if that is attainable but the real argument is not whether it is desirable but whether it is feasible and that is the item that I did not go into again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but I am afraid that we have reached the situation where, however we discuss this, we will divide the arguments in half so that the argument is bound to be incomplete.  While the Minister has been inhibited, and rightly so, from dealing with that point I would have thought that he would have argued more on the issue of this desirability and how important it is to have a single rate.  However cogent the Minister may believe the arguments to be regarding the difficulties of alternatives, this is of such importance that a solution to it must be found.  Clearly the Minister must not attribute the same importance to it because he has not got the same determination to overcome the obstacles as we have on this side of the House.  Therefore, there is a difference in attitude on this point of the importance of the single rate tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Minister developed at great length his thoughts on rounding off figures the basic fact remains that <Col N="1413" /> so far as the retailer is concerned, it is only necessary to calculate once every two months and having arrived at his turnover he must calculate what tax he has to pay.  That means that once every two months he must multiply his turnover by 5.26 per cent or, under the Minister's proposal of having two tax rates, he would have to segregate his sales and apply two percentages. On the Minister's proposal which involves rounding off from the point of view of the consumer, but not from the point of view of the wholesaler or manufacturer, every wholesaler and manufacturer would have to do this calculation on every invoice in order to establish how much tax is on the goods at that point so that tax can be recovered at the next stage.  The enormous amount of work involved, which will require the installation of special machines which cost £1,600 each but which will not be available until next year, exceeds thousands of times over the work that retailers will have to do once every two months in their double calculations.  This point does not seem to have got across to the Minister.  It is obvious that the operation must be simplified for the wholesaler and the manufacturer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  If the wholesaler must do all this work, the retailer will not have to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always willing to be put right.  I am aware that I have been wrong on several points but my understanding is that under the Minister's proposal, every time anything is sold to a retailer by a manufacturer or wholesaler, the invoice must show what tax is levied up to that point.  That involves taking the values of the goods at that point and multiplying them by 5.26 per cent, by 16.37 or 30.26 per cent but always multiplying them to two decimal places.  That having been done, the retailer has a series of invoices with the tax shown on each.  He sends these in with a single calculation once every two months or, under the Minister's proposal, two calculations.  I would much prefer the retailer to have to go <Col N="1414" /> two decimal places once or twice every two months than for every wholesaler and manufacturer to have to go to two decimal places on each invoice.  All the Minister's arguments about not wishing to disturb by even .26 per cent the level of tax lest somebody should increase prices is unconvincing. On special committee the Minister went so far as to argue that if he reduced the 5.26 per cent rate to 5 per cent, it would be taken by people as an excuse to increase prices. I found that argument astonishing. The Minister may convince some people that if he did that the benefit might not always be passed on but I do not think that anybody will accept that a reduction in taxation would lead to an increase in prices.  The Minister's emphasis on this question of the importance of maintaining the tax rate is not convincing in any case. When I raised the point by way of question he dodged away hastily and went on to repeat something that he had said earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In all fairness to myself I must say I did not dodge away from the question.  I referred to the fact that I had gone into the details on special committee.  I have some concept of the mood of the House which I think would be that we ought not to go on repeating what we said on special committee.  One must make certain cases but it is not necessary to repeat <i>ad nauseum</i> everything that was said before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating a very important principle and the Minister is asserting it is his determination that the tax rates will be as near as possible mathematically to the existing rates.  However, I have pointed out that in respect of a range of goods representing 15 per cent of consumption&mdash;these are goods which at the moment bear 10 per cent wholesale tax as well as 5 per cent turnover tax &mdash; the Minister proposes to up the taxation by a number of full percentage points to vield £3,500,000 extra because he needs that money in order to pay money back.  He cannot argue simultaneously that he needs the money and, consequently, must increase <Col N="1415" /> tax, and then go on to say that at all costs tax must not be increased even by the slightest degree and that throughout this Bill he has endeavoured to remain as near as possible mathematically to the present tax level. He has departed widely from the present level in the case of 15 per cent of goods.  He said it is very important that the customer should know there was no increase in tax yet he is increasing tax on those goods.  Therefore, he cannot claim that there will be no change in prices because he is raising the £3,500,000 in order to repay money to different people in different amounts.</P>
      <P>There is no question of one offsetting the other for the same person. There is no question of a trader who is selling furniture now being taxed more heavily but getting back an equal amount through the repayments system. Anybody who is selling furniture or any of the goods that bear the 10 per cent wholesale tax will have the tax increased and must, consequently, increase prices.  The position will be that the Minister is expecting the customer to know that the price of baby cream should not be affected while the price of baby powder will be increased, or that nappy liner prices will remain the same while nappy pin prices will be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, for a range of goods that are in no way distinguishable from other goods, there is to be an increase in taxation.  In that respect the Minister is, perhaps unintentionally, liable to mislead the House and that is why I am trying, in so far as I can, to inform the House on this point.  The Minister departs from the principle of maintaining the present tax rate and for a heterogeneous group of goods indistinguishable from other goods by any principle known to man he intends increasing the price so that the customer cannot know whether the price ought to be going up.  He must remember that in respect of nappy pins, for instance, prices will increase, whereas for nappy liners there will be no increase. Once that confusion has been introduced there is no point in us trying to hang on to the principle to the <Col N="1416" /> tune of 0.26 per cent in other cases. There is no point in the Minister trying to say that he cannot reduce the tax rate of 5.26 per cent to 5 per cent because in some way this would confuse the customer.  On the one hand he cannot justify an increase of about three full percentage points in taxation on 15 per cent of consumption and then say that because he is tied so tightly he cannot vary tax rates at all and cannot agree to reduce the tax rate by 0.26 per cent in another case.</P>
    <P>That case has no logic whatever and the Minister knows it, and he should not attempt to put across to the House something which is not, in fact, the case.  From that point of view his argument on rounding is cockeyed and carries no conviction.  It would have carried no conviction if he had held to this principle on the wholesale tax and if he had not decided to raise £3.5 million extra by increasing tax rates on this range of goods with a view to providing money to pay for these repayments of tax to different people in different circumstances.  So much for that argument.  I do not wish to be repetious although I am accused of it at times.  I am not conscious of being repetitious and I try to minimise it as much as possible whether the Minister and Deputy O'Donovan believe me or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>I am glad that in that respect at least my honesty of purpose is recognised.  Let me come to the area where I am accused of being dishonourable.  I should like to defend myself for a shorter time than that taken by Deputy O'Donovan to make these accusations.  Deputy O'Donovan refers to the special committee which at its first meeting, in fact, set out the procedure to be followed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not started yet.  When this committee first met and the question of the admission of <Col N="1417" /> the public and the Press was discussed, there was never any discussion or mention of the proceedings of the committee being kept secret or not being published or not being communicable to anybody either then or later.  The question of the admission of public and Press was raised by the Chairman and Deputy Tully said:</P>
      <P>I would have no objection to either the public or the Press being present.  I do not think they would be very interested in what we are trying to do here.  They would be interested in the end result; I do not think they would want to sit here for hours.</P>
      <P>The discussion went on; the Minister intervened and discussed the matter further and said it was a workmanlike session and that, perhaps, we might be tempted to be a little less workmanlike when we are in the presence of the Press and public.  For that reason he said he would favour not having the Press or the public at sessions of the committee.  There was no question there or anywhere else of the proceedings of the committee being secret.  They are, of course, published. Not alone that, but I myself raised in the committee at the end of the second session the question of the delay in publication which was a problem causing great concern to all of us.</P>

There would be no value in this if, after the discussion we were, by virtue of the proceedings not being published for a fortnight or more&mdash;and there is a delay of over a fortnight in publication now&mdash;we were not able to go and consult various interests concerned with the Bill, tell them what happened at the committee and discuss with them what should be done on Report Stage.

The references in <i>The Irish Press</i> are as follows:</P>

      <P>I never told anybody that but in so far as it is there the two names are linked.  Similarly, in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> I am going to nail this misrepresentation&mdash;I cannot use the word untruth although Deputy O'Donovan has no qualms about it&mdash;once and for all.

I have never done so at any stage and, in any reference I have made, I have linked the Labour Party to it both publicly and privately.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 17, after line 19, to add a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) an amount equivalent to the amount by which the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the accountable person's costs have been increased as a result of the application of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 suggest alternative ways of trying to achieve the objective of giving traders some compensation for the work of tax collection imposed on them by the Revenue Commissioners under the provisions of this Bill.  The amendment in my name is one which, perhaps with more confidence than one sometimes feels, leaves it to the Revenue Commissioners to decide what compensation will be appropriate.  The other amendment, No. 26, proposes an amount equivalent to 0.5 per cent of the net amount payable to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the taxable period, with a maximum of £1,000 in a taxable period.</P>
      <P>The Minister met the point that a straight percentage of the net amount of tax payable should be given by saying that he believed it would give a bigger benefit to the larger firm than to the smaller firm and that therefore scaling would be required.  To meet this point Deputy Collins approached it by putting a maximum on the figure.  I considered the maximum but wondered whether an alternative might not be to leave it to the Revenue Commissioners to satisfy themselves as to the amount.  The Minister could accept either amendment. Deputy Collins and I would not fall out as to which is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I moved an amendment similar to amendment No. 26 in the special committee.  This is an attempt to allow all traders a certain amount of money as an expense for collecting the tax for the Government. Since the introduction of <Col N="1426" /> PAYE and of the turnover and wholesale taxes the trader at various levels has become an unpaid tax gatherer. This should not be so.  The cost to any one trader of administering PAYE and the turnover and wholesale taxes has become substantial, and the introduction of the value-added tax system will further increase his costs in this respect.</P>
      <P>My amendment allows a trader to subtract 0.5 per cent of the net amount payable to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the taxable period, provided that this amount does not exceed £1,000 in the taxable period, which is the equivalent of £6,000 per annum.  The reason I have put down this amendment is the reply given to me in the special committee by the Minister who said that an open-ended figure of 0.5 per cent would, first, be in favour of the larger trader and, second, in favour of the trader who collects the higher percentages such as 16.37 and 30.26 per cent.  This was a valid argument and I accept it. With a view to satisfying the Minister's argument on this point I introduced the maximum amount by which a trader could benefit under this amendment, that is, £6,000 in any one year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow that.  I have been trying to work out from the amendment what the Deputy had in mind.  Did he say that the maximum benefit a taxpayer would get would be £6,000 in any one year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the £1,000 relate to the amount which would be refunded, the saving to the shopkeeper, or does it relate to the amount of tax to which he was liable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is equivalent to deducting a maximum of £6,000 per annum.  This, of course, would not be allowed to all traders. Those at the maximum would only be the very large traders, wholesalers, most likely, and the large-scale retailers, who would be giving quite an amount to the Revenue Commissioners in the taxable period.  There are costs which every trader would have to meet under this Bill, and the Revenue Commissioners ought to recognise that traders have to bear these costs of collection.  Heretofore no recognition has been given to the trader in respect of collecting this tax for the Government.  By accepting this amendment the Minister would be showing goodwill in respect of the introduction of a new and complicated system, and this would be welcomed by wholesalers, retailers and manufacturers in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like briefly to support the principle behind the amendments.  It is quite true to say that traders have become accustomed to calling themselves unpaid tax collectors, and, perhaps, all of us are in a certain way unpaid tax collectors for the State.  Would the Minister state, when he is replying, whether or not it is correct that under the present system there is a certain amount of compensation allowed in certain cases for the collection of taxes?  Does he not agree that this new system should have built into it something which would compensate the person who has to employ additional help?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a discussion with a group of traders, and possibly the man who was giving me the particulars might not be the best example at all, but he told me he had under his control&mdash;not owned by him but under his control &mdash;100 retail outlets.  He said that each of them would have to provide a new cash register.  The average cash register of the type he required he estimated would cost around £300, buying them in bulk.  That is 300 times 100.  Add on to that the training of someone to handle it and the cost of working it right through because of the complicated system which the <Col N="1428" /> Minister insists on introducing, and you can see an additional argument in favour of some compensation.</P>
    <P>The small traders, with whom we discussed this matter, seem to be scared to death of all the extra work they will have to do for nothing.  Some of them said they would have to go out of business completely, particularly the older ones who felt they would have to depend on the State for subsistence, that it would not be possible to run their business with this extra impost on them.  I do not know whether the figure suggested by Deputy Collins is correct or not.  It might be a little high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway I do not think we will get anything out of this by arguing about it here, but I think the amendments are worth while and I would suggest the Minister should have a look at it to see if something could be done.  I do not believe anybody in the Civil Service or in any other business would do this sort of thing for nothing.  Why should it be expected of the traders of this country?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I have expressed a certain amount of sympathy for this type of amendment before but, as I have said in Committee, I do not think an amendment giving a percentage is suitable, even though Deputy Collins has amended it to some extent.  As we know, already, there is this concession on the first £100 of 2.27 pence.  This concession was given to traders to encourage them to submit their accounts.  There is no doubt that, by and large, retailers have a considerable amount of work to do. First, they have to deduct PAYE from their employees.  They are also responsible for national health insurance stamps and for the turnover tax which has to be submitted every two months to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Now they will have to deal with VAT.  These things are the responsibility of the retail traders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Therefore, a case could be made that they are doing a considerable amount of work voluntarily, work that it would take many civil servants to account for. However, there is one snag here.  Up to now this concesion was only allowed at retail level, but I am not altogether sure that wholesalers or manufacturers would not claim the same concession. Seeing that manufacturers and wholesalers will also be accountable persons and will keep accounts, they probably would be in the same position to claim it as retailers, so that how this would effect revenue might be a different question.  That is a complication I see in it.  I agree with the spirit of the amendment, but there is no doubt that retail outlets and owners of shops have a considerable amount of work to do, and I sympathise with them, and I know that a certain amount of additional work will be involved in this value-added tax system.  There is this difficulty I see that probably the wholesaler and manufacturer could say that they are entitled to it now because they have to make out invoices at various percentages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking amendment No. 25 first, this is designed to give some compensation to the taxpayer for the additional cost of operating value-added tax.  It would impose on the Revenue Commissioners the obligation of ascertaining the additional cost, if any, to the taxpayer of operating value-added tax and allowing that cost as a deduction from the taxpayers' VAT liability.  Of course, the taxpayer will already have got a deduction in computing his tax liability in respect of the tax on his purchases, but that is not what is in question here.  What is in question, apparently, is to relieve the taxpayer of the balance of the cost of VAT to him.  Deputy FitzGerald did say when moving the amendment, quite unusually for him, that he was proposing to leave the matter entirely in the hands of the Revenue Commisioners. He did hint, without actually saying it, that this was not because he had absolute faith in the Revenue Commissioners. The real reason is that it is a question of passing the buck. He knows that it is impossible to make <Col N="1430" /> this kind of calculation, that it would be quite unworkable, and for this reason I could not accept amendment No. 25 at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins's amendment No. 26 seems at least to be designed, if one accepts the concept of it, on a workable basis, because there are figures quoted and one can operate on that basis.  However, there are a number of reasons why I do not think this is really an acceptable or feasible arrangement. I think the point raised by Deputy Tully has been answered by Deputy Fitzpatrick but, perhaps, I should say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that there is at the moment under the turnover tax system an allowance, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, on the first £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will accept that I knew that, but what I asked was why this is being taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. I can say that I did understand that the Deputy knew it.  The first reason which I feel should be advanced against the amendment is that it would be inequitable as between different classes of traders.  I know Deputy Collins endeavoured to cover the point but I do not think he has done so.  It is true that in the setting up of the VAT system, there would, I suppose, be certain transitional expenditure arising out of the procedures being set up to deal with it, but once this has been done the continuing cost of the operation would probably not be appreciably higher for larger firms than for medium or even small firms.  A continuing compensation which would be based on net liability is, therefore, likely to favour the bigger firms, and in addition, while the cost of operating the tax in relation to goods liable at the 16.37 per cent rate is not likely to be higher than the cost of operating the scheme in relation to goods at the 5.26 per cent rate, nevertheless, the net tax payable would be higher and, therefore, the suggested basis of compensation would be higher, and would, therefore, favour people dealing in <Col N="1431" /> goods at the higher rate.  As a consequence of that, jewellers and furniture dealers would receive relatively more compensation than grocers or drapers, and, of course, those traders who are accountable at the 30.26 per cent rate would be the most favoured of all.</P>
      <P>Another factor in this is that the method proposed would favour traders who imported their stock because, since no tax would be chargeable on imports, their net liability for each taxable period would be higher than the net liability of the corresponding traders who purchase their stock in this country from accountable persons. Another factor is that firms who are engaged solely in exporting would have no net liability and, therefore, would not get any relief at all under this provision.  We did discuss the matter in the special committee and Deputy Collins, I think in an effort to meet some of the points I have been talking about, did include in this amendment a limitation&mdash;&ldquo;not to exceed £1,000 in a taxable period.&rdquo;  I have not got an exact calculation on this and I suppose it is not possible to have one, because it depends on the rates at which the goods being sold are liable, but it is certainly not unreasonable to assume that under the proposal, there would be relief available to firms having a turnover up to £500,000 a year.  It could well be higher than that but it would seem that that is not an unreasonable figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, as far as the amendment on the face of it is concerned, it would seem to be designed to give relief to people in quite a big way of business.  I would have thought that the main concern in this regard would be in respect of retail traders, and particularly smaller retail traders, and this is where Deputy Tully's point comes in, because at the moment they have this benefit under the turnover tax system.  It is true that that benefit is disappearing under VAT, but, on the other hand, they are getting benefits which I believe will more than compensate them for any additional cost they will have in operating VAT. <Col N="1432" /> Those benefits are primarily the right to claim refunds of tax on their inputs which they cannot do at the moment.  There is a form of double taxation at the moment under the present system.  Everything they will purchase in the course of business, for their business, under VAT, including even building of premises, extensions, counters, cash registers, fitments of all kinds&mdash; all these contain an element of tax under the present system&mdash;under VAT they will be able to recover that amount of tax in full, which they cannot do at the moment.  This is one benefit.</P>
    <P>The other benefit they get is that, because of the taxable period now being made two months, retailers, many of them to a substantial extent, will benefit by improved liquidity.  It is for this reason that I am satisfied that, for retailers, the benefits will more than compensate them for any additional costs they may have in operating the value-added tax system as compared with the present system.  While I do not want to get involved in an argument as to what additional cost they will have&mdash;it is difficult to be precise since it depends to a great extent on the particular case&mdash;I do not believe the additional cost involved will be anything like what has been alleged by some people, both inside and outside the House.  I think the difficulties encountered will be far less than has been thought.  I might also mention that no other member or applicant member of the EEC gives compensation of the type referred to in this amendment and it is possible&mdash;I do not put it any stronger than that&mdash;that an amendment of this kind might not be acceptable to the EEC.</P>

      <P>The case made on both these amendments is that the collection of this value-added tax will involve traders in the expenditure of money.  The Minister has stated that there will be costs involved in equipment and in setting up a system of collection and he argues that there is no cause for complaint really because the traders can claim a tax rebate.  That may be so, but they cannot claim back the actual cost of the equipment.</P>

      <P>It was to be inferred. The Minister also accepts that there will be a continuing cost, and he makes the case that the continuing cost, when the system gets going, will be quite small.  He does admit that there will be a continuing cost and he admits there will be an initial outlay.  Accepting that, he should not criticise the people who put down these amendments for failing to meet the cost exactly in their proposals.  It is the Minister's job to find the right way equitably to recoup people for losses sustained as a result of the collection of tax.  All of us have some experience of PAYE and what is involved in that system.  There is absolutely no compensation.  There is the case where semi-State bodies involved in this type of collection are not allowed to employ extra staff, but they must collect the tax.  The Minister should really consider this very seriously.  There is no doubt in anyone's mind but that this will cost traders money.  If the Minister accepts that&mdash;I think he must accept it&mdash;it is up to him to devise the means of compensating traders fairly and equitably, whether they be small traders or large traders, or whether they are involved in the sale of items in which there are many or merely a few transactions.  It should be possible to find a way to compensate people.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not go even part of the way to meeting my amendment. It is a constructive amendment.  I <Col N="1434" /> prefer my amendment to that of Deputy FitzGerald.  His would involve the Revenue Commissioners in estimating expenses.  Mine would not involve that. To get £1,000 deduction in a taxable period a trader will have to return £1,200,000 in tax to the Revenue Commissioners. That would mean £6,000 in a taxable year.  I am satisfied that the work which would have to be put into returning £1,200,000 to the Revenue Commissioners would cost a trader more than £6,000 per annum.  That is a valid point.  I accept that exporters will not benefit under this scheme.  This is unfortunate and I did not realise that would be the situation until the Minister explained it.  Some positive effort, expressed in terms of money rather than in terms of allowances in relation to inputs and capital costs, should be made in favour of traders.  I am open to reducing the £1,000 taxable period if this will mitigate the advantages in favour of a large trader.  I am sorry the Minister is not in favour of this amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to include patent and copyright agents with barristers from the point of view of exemption and in respect of this there has been representation on this point.  I raised this matter in respect of patent agents in the special committee but since then it has been suggested to me that it should be widened to include patent and copyright agents.  It had not struck me that copyright agents should be included but they are in a similar position.  Both groups feel they could be in the position which the Minister feels certain professional people could be in, where it would be to their advantage to be exempted.  It seems reasonable that they should be included in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>The decision as to whether or not certain services should <Col N="1437" /> be exempted is governed by the budgetary considerations and partly by the requirements of the directive of the EEC.  There would not be any significant loss of tax in an exemption for patent agents but the general requirement of the EEC directives is that those services ought not be exempted which enter directly into the cost of taxable goods or taxable services. Article 6 of the EEC second directive requires the transfer of patents, trade marks or other similar rights as well as the granting of licences in regard to these rights, to be brought within the scope of the tax.  My recollection is that I read this out at the special committee.  The point is that this is the provision in relation to the transfer of patents, trade marks and other similar rights as well as the granting of licences in regard to these rights.  The services of copyright and patent agents are directly related to such activities which are required to be brought in. Consequently, it would seem contrary to the spirit of the directive to exempt them and, therefore, I do not find it possible to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might walk back again some day.  As I understand the Minister, he is referring me to article 6 of the second directive.  I think he is referring to article 6.2.  I want to tease this out and make sure I have understood it correctly.  The directive says that the rules laid down with regard to the taxation of the provision of services shall be compulsorily applicable only to services listed in Annex B which refers in the first item to assignments of patents, trade marks and other similar rights, and the granting of licences in respect of such rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that, as far as the EEC is concerned, those references <Col N="1439" /> bring compulsorily within the framework of the Bill copyright and patent agents as distinct from the activities of assigning patents and trade marks? I would have thought that they perform a function of an agency kind.  I would not have thought that they assign patents or trade marks or other similar rights.  Would I be permitted to ask the Minister whether it is his view that this provision in regard to assignments of patents, trade maks and other similar rights, necessarily brings copyright and patent agencies within the framework of the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that since these services and transfers in relation to such rights are specifically brought in, the services of patent and copyright agents are directly related to these activities which are clearly in, and consequently it would seem to be contrary to the spirit of the directive to exempt them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister is referring to section 10 of Annex B: the services of forwarding agents, brokers, business agents and other independent intermediaries in so far as they relate to the supply or importation of goods or the provision of services included in the list.  Is the Minister suggesting that a copyright or patent agent is a business agent whose work relates to the provision of the service of assignment of patents and trade marks and other similar rights? Is that the Minister's line of argument?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is not accepting my line of argument I am in a bit of a difficulty.  The mere fact that the assignment of patents is included in the directive does not of itself require that the activities of copyright and patent agents should be included.  It is arguable that section 10 of Annex B brings them within it but, as against that, there is no mention whatever of copyright.  In our law the assignment of patents, trade marks and other similar rights would not necessarily extend patents and trade marks <Col N="1440" /> to copyright.  Could the Minister indicate where, if anywhere, the question of copyright agents is brought within the framework of the directive?  I submit that it is not.  For some reason the Minister does not wish to press his line of argument which could be quite convincing on the question of patent agents.  He has not got a case on the question of copyright.  For that reason there is a case for not feeling bound by the EEC directive because it does not seem that it directly involves copyright agents.  I wonder if the Minister would be permitted to comment on that?</P>

      <P>Since the reports of the special committee are not published for some time afterwards they do not receive any press publicity. While I recognise the undesirability of extended repetition here on matters dealt with by the committee, in the public interest it is desirable that the case should be stated for the various points which, after the special committee, are still considered to be at issue, and that the Minister should reply briefly and indicate his reasons for rejecting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that in the interests of Parliament and, indeed, of the Minister. I do not lose anything by the Minister not answering a point I have made. While not wishing to extend the debate and understanding the Minister's desire not to do so, I think it might have been better for him to say a few words as to the reason for deciding to tax car hire.  Not to give the House a reason for his decision is a bit unsatisfactory, all the more so, because, may I point out, despite the <Col N="1443" /> Minister having referred a few minutes ago to the fact that he said something in the special committee, I am unable to verify that fact because we have now reached the stage where the reports of the special committee have not yet been published. I raised this at the second session of the special committee with the Minister and I asked him to make sure, because this House has no power to make sure, that the reports would be published quickly and promptly.</P>

The report has been published only up to volume 5 to date.  That brings you to one of the sections of the Bill towards the end. We are now dealing with the First Schedule.  The proceedings of the special committee in respect of the First Schedule have not yet been published. I understand that one is not entitled to refer to the proceedings that have not been published.  Are we at a stage in the Bill, therefore, where neither I nor the Minister can refer to what happened at the special committee?

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, may I make a point of order? Deputy FitzGerald knows, following the Minister's statement, that we have reached the stage where the Minister has decided to refuse to accept the amendment.  There are a number of very important amendments which have to be debated here.  We have only until midnight.  I would suggest to Deputy FitzGerald that there is no point in attempting to get a ruling on whether or not the proceedings of the private session should be discussed in this House at this stage.  I hate to say this, but I think we are wasting time on something that is not relevant.  I am not trying to rush away, as was suggested in some of the newspapers.  I stay here as long as anybody else.  I do not mind how long it takes to finish this.  We should be reasonable.  Either we vote on it or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is not evident to the Chair is that earlier on in the debate, on another section, it was suggested that in disclosing outside the House what happened at a special committee before the reports were published. I had acted dishonourably.  I sought private guidance on this from the Chair and was informed that there was no ruling whatever on that particular point and I was entitled to do so but I was not entitled to refer to these points in the special committee in the House until the debates were published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 41, after line 18, to add &ldquo;( ) second-hand movable goods&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The point here is that goods that have been taxed should not be taxed a second time, I understood it was a basic principle of value-added tax. Yet, if this amendment is rejected, we are in the position that goods will be taxed each time they are sold.  This seems against the basic principle of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be that all sales and importations of secondhand goods would be exempt from tax.  There are a number of reasons why I could not accept this amendment.  First, it would be contrary to the principle that value-added tax is designed as a general tax on consumer expenditure. Secondly, it would be contrary to the basic purpose of this Bill which is a changeover from the present system to value-added tax.  Under the present system, secondhand goods are charged at the effective rate of 5.26 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> The acceptance of this amendment would weaken the control of the tax by opening areas up at the retail stage where no tax would be chargeable. In addition, it would affect the situation in regard to traders who deal partly in new and partly in second-hand goods because an apportionment of the tax between taxable and exempt transactions would be necessary.  Finally, it would disturb the neutrality in that second-hand goods could be imported tax free from abroad and sold in competition with home goods which had at some stage borne tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point the Minister made is reasonable, but I would not agree the other points he made are reasonable.  I think there could be an arrangement made whereby imported second-hand goods could be taxed.  We would all accept that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did give other reasons but I doubt if he feels they were very compelling.  It does seem wrong that second-hand goods should be taxed, but apart from that the Minister has not put forward very convincing reasons on this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 41, line 40, to delete all words after &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This involves the deletion of the following words: &ldquo;going to places outside the State; and the repairing and <Col N="1449" /> servicing of ships and aircraft engaged in international commercial transport of passengers and goods&rdquo;.  The reason for my amendment is not that it is particularly important to secure that this applies to ships and aircraft engaged in internal transport.  In fact, the volume of transport in Ireland which is internal and carried out by ships and aircraft is fairly small.  There is a certain amount of coastal shipping and, of course, air services between Dublin and Shannon and Cork.  It must be remembered that planes going to Shannon and Cork from Dublin are also, with few exceptions, going outside the country.  There is no such thing as aircraft of the Aer Lingus fleet which is confined to domestic air transport. There is possibly only a helicopter or light aircraft so engaged and light aircraft would probably also be engaged outside the country as well as on domestic work.  Therefore, it does not seem to me to be feasible to have a provision of this kind, which would mean, for example, that, if Aer Lingus stocked their aircraft with food and drink at Dublin en route to Shannon and New York, because the goods are going to a place inside the State, in the first instance, these goods carry 5 per cent tax, but if the aircraft were stocked up at Shannon the goods would be zero rated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I must not forget that.  I cannot recall&mdash;it is some years since I was in Aer Lingus&mdash;what the practice was then in that respect, but in those days, in any event, they were hired aircraft and the whole position was different.  However, it could well be that Aer Lingus at the moment or in the future would wish to be in a position to be able to victual its aircraft in Dublin and not have to make a prolonged stop at Shannon en route to New York, to the disadvantage of the passengers, during which it would load up food and drink in order to avoid the value-added tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that this is quite unsatisfactory.  I do not know if he has received representations from Aer Lingus on this point.  I have not myself, despite my former association <Col N="1450" /> with them, but I would be surprised if the company would be satisfied to be so constrained that they must either pay value-added tax in this particular instance on trans-atlantic travel, on all goods embarked, or, alternatively, have a prolonged turn around at Shannon to embark food and drink there at the expense of losing passenger traffic by extending the length of the journey from Dublin to New York.  I do not see that this will help the competitiveness of Aer Lingus in its operations against American carriers with whom, I gather, the Government intend that we should be competing in the very near future when they have finally got around to admitting what they have settled in this particular matter.</P>

Nobody has any idea as to whether the Government are going to reach agreement on this matter and permit competition into Dublin, and this is still something the Government have yet to decide.  We cannot, therefore, give any view on this, but the Minister will allow me to say that the fact that the negotiations are going on suggests this possibility.  In the light of this possibility it would seem, even if it is only a possibility, undesirable to worsen the competitive position of Aer Lingus either by imposing a tax on the goods which it lifts at Dublin, if that is the significance of the section as at present drafted, as I believe it to be, or, alternatively, having to spend extra time uploading drink and food at Shannon, <Col N="1452" /> thereby prolonging the whole journey and making it less competitive. I shall not dwell on that, but it is an important point.</P>
      <P>Even where this is not the case, even where it is not a question of aircraft carrying passengers through Shannon or, indeed, through Cork to the Continent or to Britain, even if it was only a question of an Aer Lingus aircraft undertaking domestic flights on the same day or other days as well as undertaking international flights, the problem arises: how is a clear distinction going to be made in this matter?  As regards the repairing and servicing of ships and aircraft, how is the Minister to determine whether an aircraft of Aer Lingus which is being repaired is an aircraft engaged in international commercial transport?</P>
      <P>Is it necessary for the company to state or to establish that on its first trip after the repair and maintenance activity, it went to Shannon or to Cork or did not go there but went abroad? Is that what is required, or is it the intention to look at the whole fleet of aircraft and say: &ldquo;They spend so much of their time outside the country that we will regard them as engaged in international commercial transport of passengers and goods, even though occasionally they undertake domestic trips?  Is that the way it is to be undertaken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that that is the answer on that point and I will be satisfied if the Minister gives that answer, but I am not satisfied and will not be satisfied until the Minister clarifies the issue on the question of aircraft travelling from a point in the State to another point in the State in transit for an international destination.  It seems to me that the wording here is explicit &mdash;&ldquo;goods delivered on board ships or aircraft going to places outside the State&rdquo;.  This aircraft is not going to places outside the State; it is going to Shannon.  It will later be continuing on beyond Shannon.  That is another question. Its initial destination is inside the State.  Is it that the Minister's interpretation of this is wide enough to allow that if the aircraft is intended to go <Col N="1453" /> ultimately outside the State and although it is going to stop inside the State in the first instance, the tax is not payable?  Is it the intention of the Minister that if it is a BAC 111 or a Boeing 737, undertaking a purely domestic trip to Shannon the goods will have to pay the 5.26 per cent rate but if the aircraft operating to Shannon is going on across the Atlantic, the food will be at the zero rate?  Is this not going to create very great complications for Aer Lingus?  I wonder if the Minister has thought this out and whether, on reflection, he may not agree that he is attempting the impossible in this matter and that in the nature of things aircraft are so interchangeable and the work they do, domestically and internationally, so closely inter-related that to attempt to distinguish between them is not practicable.</P>
    <P>In the case of shipping, it may be somewhat easier.  There are probably vessels engaged more or less exclusively in coastal activities&mdash;there used to be a tanker which went from Dublin to Cork exclusively&mdash;but even many coasting vessels operate fairly freely either along the coast or, perhaps, to Britain and is it going to be the case that if a coastal vessel is moving goods to Belfast, it is in one position and to Cork, in another position?  I wonder whether the Minister has thought out the implications of the section.  I do not want to waste time and having developed the point to that stage, I will leave it to the Minister to reply. It may well be that he can satisfy us that he has given adequate thought to this and that the problems I am fearful of may not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression that even though the Minister at the special committee did not appear to be very receptive to our ideas on this but the points having been made. I felt possibly he would decide to have another look at it.  Like Deputy FitzGerald, I feel that a mistake has been made here and while Deputy FitzGerald has been accused of being dogmatic, I would say that the Minister is being dogmatic about a matter which he should easily recognise as being something on which he should <Col N="1454" /> give way.  I do not propose to follow the line followed by Deputy FitzGerald because he has fairly well explained it several times, except to say that a few years ago we had in this House numerous complaints about a certain shipbuilding company here that was supposed to have been stocking up with vegetables, fruit and so on from Holland.  We all raised our hands in horror and said: &ldquo;Surely this does not happen,&rdquo; but, in fact, this sort of thing would encourage them to do it because if they stock up from Ireland with the necessary goods, they will have to pay value-added tax.  In addition to that, in the case of boats going from Drogheda to Whitehaven, Cork to Whitehaven, Dublin to Whitehaven, this sort of thing happens quite often. They would be outside this; they must pay VAT on stores because they are not exclusively within the waters.  The same thing applies with regard to repairs. With regard to aircraft, I think it is ludicrous to suggest that an aircraft which is flying through Ireland should not pick up any food particularly here because if they do, they will have to pay tax on it, whereas if they are going outside, the matter can be dealt with in a different way.  This applies also in the case of repairs.</P>
      <P>The Minister is, perhaps, being very dogmatic about this and I think he should have another look at it.  There is no point in trying to force it here because the Minister says &ldquo;No&rdquo; and his cohorts will come in and vote us down&mdash;that is a certainty&mdash;but I appeal to him to show a little commonsense. This is not a matter over which we should have a lot of disputes.</P>

      <P>I do not know where Deputy Tully dredged up this idea that I am being dogmatic about this.  The situation is that we discussed this in the special committee and I agreed to have another look at it.  What was involved was the choice of the best wording to achieve what we all agreed should be achieved.  I find it difficult to understand how, in those circumstances, my attitude can be described as dogmatic.  I have not even replied yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not even heard what is the result of my having looked at it and yet he says my attitude is dogmatic.  As it stands, this amendment would apply the zero rate to all goods delivered on board a ship or aircraft, irrespective of whether the ship was engaged in transport within the State or outside the State.  It would also exclude from the zero rate the repairing and servicing of ships and aircraft engaged in international commercial transport.  I do not know if that was what Deputy FitzGerald intended, but it is not a proposition I would accept.</P>

      <P>With regard to the fact that I said I would have a look at this position, I intended when replying to tell the House what the result of that looking at it was.  The position is that the main purpose of this provision is to ensure that foreign ships and aircraft can be bunkered and serviced at Irish ports without any tax complications. If we do not do that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy let me develop this, please?  If we failed to make this kind of provision, there would be a danger that shipping or air companies would take their business elsewhere.  As I understood it, Deputy FitzGerald's objection was that the persons carrying out the servicing would not know whether or not the ship or aircraft was engaged in international commercial transport and, consequently, would not know whether or not tax should be charged. On full consideration of this position, the best advice I can get is that there is very little force in the objection. The kind of ship or aircraft which is designed for international transport is well known to the traders who engage in the bunkering or servicing of such vessels.  Furthermore, the identity of the owners will also normally identify the kind of activity in which the ship or aircraft is engaged.  A foreign ship or an air company is exempt from tax on any service rendered within the State under section 5 (4).  Secondly, it may safely be assumed that paragraph V of the Second Schedule will be interpreted as authorising a zero rate on the servicing of all ships or aircraft on behalf of such companies.  If that is so, then the only area of doubt which could arise would be in relation to Irish transport companies, such as Irish Shipping or Aer Lingus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy let me finish and then put his question and I shall try to answer it?  On the basis of what I have said, the only real area of doubt would be in relation to an Irish transport company, like Irish Shipping or Aer Lingus.  In fact, it makes relatively little difference whether or not they are charged the tax because, since most of their business is outside the State, they would in any event be entitled to be repaid practically the whole of the tax they have suffered.</P>
      <P>We have looked at this matter to see if we could devise a better wording to meet the situation we are trying to meet.  We have not been able to produce anything better.  The present wording seems to be reasonably suitable. It is clear, of course, that the whole problem of the treatment of transport under the value-added tax system presents considerable difficulties. This is so particularly where a single consideration covers transport which is partly within the State and partly outside it.  This is one of the problems which is being considered by a special study group of the EEC and it is likely that a uniform system for dealing with this problem will be suggested in the near future to the member States.  In the meantime, the wording in the Bill is the best we have been able to produce, having given considerable thought to it, and that wording will be interpreted administratively as meaning that, in relation to a contract for passenger transport, excluding any idea of a tour, from a place within the State to a place outside the State and <i>vice versa</i>, the whole of the consideration will qualify for a zero rating.  In the case of, say, Aer Lingus, on a flight from Dublin to New York, the hop to Shannon will be ignored.</P>

      <P>First of all, the Minister is perfectly right in saying my amendment is defective.  In drafting 33 amendments my eyes slipped and I deleted more than I intended to delete. I should have left in the last three lines of the original section and, if the Minister were prepared to consider the amendment, I would, of course, amend it to correct the defect in the drafting.  The Minister asks how can this be done.  In the British Act, as regards repairing and servicing ships and aircraft, ships and aircraft are defined according to their size by a rough and ready rule which more or less differentiates between foreign-going ships and aircraft. If a ship is over 1500 tons it is capable of going abroad and, if it is under 1500, it is not.  In the case of aircraft differentiation is based on a weight of 18,000 lbs.  If the aircraft is over 18,000 lbs it is treated as an aircraft likely to go abroad and, if it is not over that figure, it is treated as less likely to go abroad.  A ship or aircraft designed or adapted for recreation or pleasure, such as a steam or motor yacht, is not covered.  It is done on the basis of size.  What has the Minister against that?  He challenges us to produce a solution.  I ask him what is wrong with the British Act and he will not answer me.  I put it to the Minister there is an answer there.  I am not saying it is the best answer, but it is an answer.</P>

      <P>It is absolutely possible that that happened.  I am not <Col N="1461" /> objecting to either the Minister or any Deputy saying that I am wasting time.  They are entitled to say so if they wish but I am impervious to the suggestion that because I pursue a legitimate point beyond the point that the Minister finds acceptable, I should then sit down.  This is not my idea of opposition and never will be. I try to be courteous and I try also not to press an issue beyond the point of no return and where discussion will not lead any further I try not to be repetitious.  Perhaps I fail on all these counts but I continue trying and I am sorry if the Minister finds me so trying.</P>
      <P>On the particular point I will ask the Minister to consider the simple solution to the problem of the latter part which has been found in the British Act on the basis of the size of the vehicle.  This is an obvious solution and one that has been used for other purposes in other Acts.  On the first question of goods delivered on board a ship or aircraft, I think I can take it that what the Minister is saying is that if the ship or aircraft is going to a place outside the State even if it is to stop en route, he will interpret it in that way.  It seems a fair interpretation and I am prepared to accept it.  It could be turned over in court but I do not think it likely that that would happen. However, in the latter part, in respect of aircraft or ships engaged in international commercial transport of passengers and goods, the definition is vague and impracticable.  The Minister's hesitant reply indicates that is his opinion also.  He has admitted that he has sought a solution but failed to find one.  Therefore, I ask him simply to do what was done in the British Act which in this case seems sensible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 42, after line 24, to add a new paragraph as follows: &ldquo;() food of a kind used for human consumption and non-alcoholic drink.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Chairman decides to permit two speakers from Labour and one from Fine Gael, we can be tolerant about such matters.  The question of food here is a major issue.  It is our belief that social justice requires that food should not be taxed.  This is a point which can be argued best by reference to the facts of the situation. When one examines such evidence as we have, which is fairly extensive and, with some limitations is valid information on household budgets, one finds that food as a proportion of household <Col N="1464" /> budgets varies greatly according to the incomes of the families concerned.  It would be difficult, perhaps impossible to find any other range of articles which looms so much larger proportionately in the budgets of poor and large families than food.  Therefore, in specifying food for zero-rating we are picking on something that would have the maximum social impact.  It might be thought that at this stage in the history of the country with its relative affluence, this would not be true to such an extent but it is true and the large variation in respect of foods generally in the household budget inquiry of 1965-66 was that from about 43 per cent of the family budgets of the poorer families were constituted by food down to 21 per cent in the case of the better-off families.  In other words the proportion was twice as large in respect of the poorer families.</P>
    <P>If one takes a narrower range of food&mdash;the range discussed at the special committee which I shall not go into because there seems to be some doubts as to whether we are entitled to refer to it because of the failure to have the report published, that is, that range of foods which constitutes 75 per cent of total food consumption&mdash;the difference in ratio was more marked. These foods are described commonly as necessary foods.  The range of foods left for consideration by the special committee, representing three-quarters of all foods, are even more skewed in this way than the total food consumption. So much so that for these foods which one can describe loosely as necessities, the proportion of the budget was 31 per cent in respect of poor families and 10 per cent in respect of better-off families.  As the foods mentioned in the Labour Party amendment are drawn from this list I suspect that these foods are ones on which the expenditure is very much larger in the poorer families than in the richer families. To that extent the Labour amendment is well judged in terms of seeking to achieve the maximum benefit possible for the poorer families within certain limits of cost to the Exchequer of about £4 million.  I was not of the opinion that one should limit oneself to such a figure but in imposing such limits one would choose foods that <Col N="1465" /> would be on the lines of those mentioned in the Labour amendment.  To that extent I support the amendment but I would like to press my own amendment first before adverting to the Labour amendment.</P>
    <P>All food should be exempt because if we take the range of goods which were not covered by the suggestions made in the special committee there is one-quarter of foods which are regarded as less necessary.  Even in that range of foods which represented 14 per cent of the budgets of poorer families and 10 per cent of the budgets of richer families, although the disparity there is much less than in the case of necessities it is still marked.  In other words, by including the whole range of foods rather than the conventional necessities one increases the social impact by benefiting poorer families more at the expense of richer families.  Given that and given the technical complications for retailers of distinguishing different foods it seems to me better that the whole of foods should be zero rated and that the necessary arrangements should be made to find the tax revenue from other sources and it is on that basis that this proposal is put forward.</P>
    <P>If the amendment were accepted there would be a loss of revenue estimated at about £15 million.  I think that estimate is common ground.  In preparing any estimates which I shall be submitting I had the opportunity, through the courtesy of the Minister, of consultation with the Revenue Commissioners who were immensely helpful in checking out my calculations and in bringing me through many complications in the calculations which I would not have got through successfully myself, although this particular figure is one which I calculated myself and which I validated by reference to them.  The money would have to be found from another source.  In fact, in formal discusions proposals were put forward by this party which we have since published indicating how that money might be found.  The total sum we would be seeking would be somewhat larger because we were also including some other articles which, as they are not referred to in this amendment, <Col N="1466" /> I shall not mention.  That led to a need to find, not £15 million but over £17 million and any figures I give about finding money are related to that slightly larger figure going beyond the amount required to compensate for the zero rating of food.</P>
    <P>The proposals which we put forward after considerable thought for finding the money were, first, that the present turnover tax&mdash;we can talk for the moment in these terms although that tax is, of course, being absorbed in the value-added system&mdash; should be increased by 1 per cent from 5 per cent to 6 per cent.  In other words, you would have a value-added tax of about 6.4 per cent which we rounded up for the Minister's benefit to 6.5 per cent in lieu of the 5.26 per cent which is proposed in the Bill.  Such a change would mean an additional £8.5 million, only half of the sum required. Therefore, it was also proposed that the present 10 per cent wholesale tax rate applying to about one-seventh of consumer expenditure should be increased to 15 per cent. This would be achieved by having for the goods in question a VAT rating of about 24 per cent in lieu of the proposed 16.37 per cent.  The effect of such a change in VAT would be the equivalent within the present system of having a 5 per cent turnover tax and a 15 per cent wholesale tax instead of the present 10 per cent. This would yield a further £8.05 million.</P>
    <P>Another feature of our proposal, which I shall not dwell on because we have dealt with it, was that this higher rate of wholesale tax turned into VAT at a rate of 24 per cent, would be trapped at the wholesale level and would not pass on to the retail level.  As a result, through this scheme we achieve a single rate of tax at the retail level.  I mention that merely to link these together.</P>
    <P>The effect of these proposals, therefore, would be to yield an extra £16.5 million replacing the £17 million lost through zero rating of food and certain other commodities we shall discuss later.  In other words, we replaced virtually all that money.  It <Col N="1467" /> was also proposed, although this is not an integral part of the proposal here, that the proposed 30.26 per cent rate on cars, radio sets, records and record-players should be brought down to the 24 per cent rate and so have a single rate of wholesale tax. This would mean a certain cost to the Exchequer which would be more than met, we felt, by the extra revenue which the Minister proposes to get by his proposal to have the 16.37 per cent rate bringing in an extra £3.5 million.</P>
    <P>If these tax changes were to be effective and satisfactory it would be necessary that the benefits of the tax reductions on food and the proposed other items should be passed on to the consumer.  It would be necessary to ensure that where taxes are reduced as proposed in our amendment, and over a narrow range of goods proposed in the Labour amendment, that the retailers would pass this on to the consumer. One might think forces of competition would achieve this and very generally I think this would be the case but some doubt has been cast on the local effectiveness of the forces of competition by some recent figures and there are local problems in this respect.  We recognise that it would be necessary for the National Prices Commission to keep an eye on this situation but we cannot accept the Minister's suggestion, repeatedly made in the special committee and I think earlier today here in another context, that we may no longer reduce taxes because in his view any tax reduction will not be passed on to the consumer.  He went so far in the special committee as to suggest that a marginal reduction in tax from 5.26 per cent to 5 per cent would, by virtue of being a change in tax, so confuse people that retailers would put up prices.  The proposition that we cannot reduce taxes without people putting up prices in response to it is one which I found curious and very unconvincing.</P>
    <P>Neither am I convinced that we are in a position, where the mismanagement of the country's affairs and the failure to control cartel monopolies has been so total that the Government <Col N="1468" /> are now impotent to reduce taxes on expenditure lest these not be passed on to the public.  To suggest that is to condemn the policy of the Government, and particularly of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in regard to prices so utterly that such a suggestion would come better, though not very convincingly, from the Opposition than from the Minister for Finance.  That he should have so little confidence in his Government's prices policy as to believe that he dare not reduce taxes because the benefits would not be passed on because the cartel-monopoly situation and the failure of price surveillance is such that he could not guarantee the benefits would be passed on, is an utter condemnation of the Government's prices policy which I was surprised to hear from the Minister. Even a member of the Opposition might be slow to make such an accusation.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced; I do not think he really believes his Government are as inept and as incompetent as that.  I believe he is making an excuse not to do what in our view should be done. The price surveillance machinery is, or can be made sufficiently effective to secure this result.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this which is another complication that must be dealt with.  If our proposal for the trapping of the new rate of VAT of 24 per cent at the wholesale stage were to be accepted to achieve a single tax at the retail stage one consequence would be that the base for the calculation of the tax would be increased and as a result retail margins, if calculated on a percentage basis on a wholesale tax base, would rise in absolute terms. The Minister made this point in the special committee; he suggested this was a difficulty to be faced and that there was a danger that because retailers' margins are calculated in percentage terms in many instances and because he felt they would not agree to modify these, the effect of a proposal involving the trapping of more tax than is now trapped&mdash;at present only the tax at the higher rate of wholesale tax is trapped&mdash;the trapping of all wholesale tax, if that were done, would create a problem by increasing the <Col N="1469" /> absolute amount of retailers' margin by their applying the same percentages as at present to a larger wholesale tax base.</P>
    <P>Recognising this as a point I took the opportunity of consulting with various retail groups.  I sought public assurances from them which they would have to stand over and on which they could be policed&mdash;if that is the right word&mdash;by the National Prices Commission, should the occasion arise, that they would reduce their percentage margins by the appropriate amounts which would be a reduction of about one-eighteenth in the present percentage margin.</P>
    <P>I received such assurances willingly from the RGDATA Group representing the VG, Spar and Mace groups as well as supermarket chains like Williams, Liptons and Five Star, and also from the Association of Voluntary Groups representing the MNC and the Londis organisations.  Since these groups did not cover two major supermarket groups, Dunnes' Stores and Quinnsworth.  I approached them and sought and got similar assurances from them.  These were assurances given in public and they would, therefore, be open to supervision by an adequate prices surveillance mechanism if we had one, and I hope we have or can have one.  Therefore, the only objection put forward by the Minister was overcome. On that basis we put forward our proposal at an informal meeting of members of the special committee.</P>

      <P>The statement issued by Fine Gael dealt only with our own position.  We left it to the Minister to clarify his position which he did about 24 hours later.  There was a certain informal briefing that night of the <Col N="1470" /> Press through the Government Information Bureau.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Acting as a responsible Opposition we devised a proposal which would meet the problem of maintaining the revenue.  We went laboriously into the calculations.  We checked them out with the Revenue Commissioners to make sure that we had not gone wrong, and that we would not be misleading the special committee or the House.  We satisfied ourselves that our proposal was realistic in terms of replacement of revenue that might be lost if this amendment were accepted.</P>
      <P>We also sought to ensure that the difficulty put forward by the Minister would be fully met by the necessary assurances from these organisations. We did everything we could to ensure that the zero-rating of food could be undertaken and that no valid excuse could be put forward to prevent this being done in the interests of the lower income group whose consumption of food represents such a high proportion of their budget, and whose living standards would be improved if this proposal went through.</P>
      <P>The effect of this proposal would be roughly as follows on the price of the various goods: On food and other goods which we propose to zero-rate, a reduction of 5 per cent; on other goods, which we also proposed should be zero-rated, a reduction of about 7 per cent&mdash;certain goods which are sold by grocers which are not actually foodstuffs. The effect of our proposal to standardise the rate of value-added tax, other than the 5.26 per cent rate, at 24 per cent would be to reduce the price of cars and other goods like TV and radio sets by 5 per cent.  Increases in prices would occur also; for the great majority of goods now liable to turnover tax only, representing a high proportion, something like two-fifths of total consumption, A 1 per cent increase in price; and for goods which at present involve one-seventh of household consumption an increase of 7 per cent in price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect would be to switch the burden of taxation to a significant <Col N="1471" /> and perceptible degree from the lower income group to the higher income group which can afford, on a large scale, the kind of goods on which wholesale tax is paid.  Virtually all groups in the community must buy some goods on which wholesale tax is payable but, when you come to the kind of goods which represent only one-seventh of total consumption, and which are in the upper bracket, and which together with cars and TV and radio sets represent one-fifth of consumption, obviously poor families can buy very little and richer families buy more.  The shifting of the burden is quite perceptible.</P>
    <P>We examined a great number of alternatives.  We considered one proposal which was the doubling of the turnover tax on goods not zero-rated but, having examined its social consequences, we found they were not as beneficial as the proposal we put forward and accordingly we did not put it forward.  In a statement to the papers, which I found disturbing in its degree of dishonesty, the Minister said that we have not referred to our proposal for the doubling of turnover tax which we intended to put into effect if our first scheme was found to be defective or inoperable.  It was not our proposal at any stage.  I do not know whether I am now entitled to disclose what the Minister said.  I think I am.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I was deflected from my purpose.  I am coming to the end of what I want to say on this point.  At the committee, after I put forward our proposal which does not involve the doubling of turnover tax, the Minister put forward a number of what he described as possible solutions including the doubling of turnover tax or, to be more precise, the raising of the value-added tax rate from 5.26 per cent to 11½ per cent which he described as equivalent to doubling turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us commented on this proposal at the time.  The discussion was deflected into a different area, the area which lies between the Fine Gael and Labour amendments as to whether we should zero-rate all food or some food.  The chairman, Deputy Healy, will confirm this because he was interested <Col N="1473" /> in that part of the discussion. The Minister then said he would like to revert&mdash;and the word used was &ldquo;revert&rdquo;&mdash;to the suggestion he put forward, or the point he made, or the proposal he put forward, in relation to increasing the turnover tax rate to 11½ per cent. I cannot quote verbatim.  He said he would like to have Deputy FitzGerald's views on it.</P>
    <P>Again I cannot quote verbatim but I said something to the effect that we thought our proposal was better from the point of view of social justice and that, while the debate had been going on, I had been doing some calculations because it seemed to me that the Minister had not done any calculations on the question of the social impact on different social groups.  My calculations showed that the Minister's suggestion of doubling turnover tax would have some socially beneficial effects but nothing like as many as ours and therefore we rejected it.  To find that after that history in the committee the Minister could be so lacking in regard for the truth as to say that this was our proposal was below the standards which we have generally expected from the Minister in question. If he were here I would suggest politely that he might like to withdraw it.  He is not here at the moment and I cannot blame him because it has been a long day.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the net effect of our proposal would be gains for the lower income group and, roughly speaking, families with less than about £1,250 would benefit from these proposals and only families with about £2,000 a year or more would lose perceptibly. This seems to me to be a good proposal from the social point of view. The Minister tried to suggest to the committee that the problem could be met by provisions in the social welfare code and children's allowances.  That seemed an extraordinary suggestion because the kind of people this is designed to help would include, for example, unmarried women living alone&mdash;a group, as I have said before in this House, we pay too little attention to&mdash;and such unmarried women living alone in Dublin, anyway, have no chance whatever of getting a house in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> They would have to acquire a husband and two children before they would get a house.  Not being able to get a house from the corporation, they must pay private rents.  If they want to live anywhere but in a tenement, this involves at least £5 or £6 a week, in many cases much more.  The typical pay of such a woman is about £12 a week.  We take £1 a week in income tax from her.  We refuse to provide her with public accommodation and force her into private accommodation which will be at least £5 or £6 a week.  We provide no social benefits.  Unless she is an unmarried mother she gets no children's allowances.  The Minister says that people like that who would benefit significantly by our proposals, because a very high percentage of their budget is on food, would be benefited by increased social welfare benefits which do not apply to them, or by children's allowances, which do not apply to them.  The Minister has no understanding of the problem if he thinks in these terms and it is unfortunate that he holds the purse strings, if that is the level of his interest and concern.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest groups in need of assistance here, more than any other single group, are the pensioners whose expenditure on food is an exceptionally high proportion of their total expenditure. One thing about old age pensioners is that they rarely have children.  To talk about increasing the children's allowance to help old age pensioners is an absurd proposal.  The Minister attempts to get out of his obligation to deal with this problem by trying to suggest that he is going to deal with it, perhaps, in the next budget by increasing social welfare benefits and the spending of the EEC money. We all know what they will try to do with that and how they will try to fob off the elections until then in order to get maximum electoral benefit from it.  His suggestion that that will solve the problem of the social groups I have mentioned is nonsensical because, of its nature, in regard to some of these groups, it cannot do that.  The Minister knows that and he is misleading the House and the country in putting forward that suggestion.  The only way that people like the unmarried women <Col N="1475" /> can be helped is, in fact, to accept a proposal of this kind.  The Minister knows that and should have regard to that when he comes to reply to this debate.  I shall not speak any longer because there are other Deputies who wish to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks to Deputy FitzGerald for being so brief.  We have a number of amendments which must be discussed and we have only up to 12 midnight.  Deputy FitzGerald has made a case for his amendment and he stated what he considered preferable to ours.  If you go back to the special committee on which this matter was discussed, the first item under consideration was selected foods and Deputy E. Collins, who so far has got no credit from anybody, is the person who named the foods which he asked to be costed.  It is only fair to say that.  The special committee consisted of more than Deputy FitzGerald and the Minister for Finance.  There were a number of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Deputies on it and there were Deputy O'Donovan and myself.  Everybody took part in the debate and there were some very constructive comments made by members of the three parties.  Everybody was anxious to provide some kind of solution and to tease it out so that in this House we would not have lengthy speeches on matters already explained to us.  I understood that that was the whole idea.  I am rather disappointed that that has not been the end product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having discussed the question of selected foods, the Minister then said that if we were able to list what we wanted and Deputy Collins gave a list which was costed and also a list of items where we thought the increases should come from, he would consider it.  The foods were to be listed and costed.  The Minister said we should do it.  My suggestion, which was accepted by the special committee, was that since the Minister had the Civil Service at his disposal he was in a better position to get both sides of the story than we were.  The Minister produced certain figures to us and we discussed them.  The Minister's argument was that the main reason why he did <Col N="1476" /> not want to exempt selected foods&mdash; what we call essential foods&mdash;the essential foods listed in our amendment&mdash; bread, tea, sugar, butter, milk, margarine and oranges&mdash;was that the cost to the Exchequer of exempting these would be £4.11 million.  In view of the fact that the Minister admitted that the excess of revenue to the State as a result of the changeover would be £3.70 million, we felt that these items could, in fact, be covered easily without any upset.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the argument that the retailers would not take kindly to those foods being exempted, that, if they were zero-rated, it would be a third rate of tax and that they would object to this.  We could not see that point.  We told him that we thought that to call a zero-rating a separate tax was ridiculous.  The Minister eventually persuaded Deputy FitzGerald that it was so.  He also stated that it would be better to try to cost the exemption of all foods, and this also Deputy FitzGerald accepted.  Hence the amendment here this evening.  The Minister having succeeded at the special committee in persuading Deputy FitzGerald that it was better to discuss the zero-rating of all foods, he then, in answer to a question from me, said he had no intention of zero-rating any foods.  In fact, he had taken the ball completely out of our court simply by giving the impression that he proposed to consider zero-rating of foods and then saying that it would cost too much, that it would mean doubling turnover tax and it would mean paying double tax&mdash;10.5 per cent it was eventually&mdash;on essential items other than foods.  Having reached that stage, it was agreed that nothing further could be done about the matter and so we come here today.</P>
    <P>We have suggested again that essential foods should be exempted. We do so because we are concerned for the old age pensioner living alone, the widow living alone, the man and wife with a young family on a small wage, persons living on small fixed incomes.</P>
    <P>So many people talk about the affluent society and about how people live.  The people I have mentioned live mainly on bread and spread&mdash;tea, <Col N="1477" /> bread and margarine.  They use some milk.  When I go into houses in country districts where the occupants have not got a very high standard of living, I am appalled to find so many people who would laugh at the mention of the price of meat.  They do not buy meat because they cannot afford it.  If value-added tax is added on to essential foods they will have to reduce still further the food they eat and the food they give their children.</P>
    <P>We talk a great deal about the great Christian country this is, how different we are from pagan England. In England they have excluded all foods from the value-added tax and have been able to do it.  Here we are simply asking that essential foods be left out and we are pointing out that the amount of money involved, £4.11 million on the Minister's own figures, is almost counterbalanced by the amount which the Minister says the Revenue Commissioners say will be collected in excess, £3.70 million.  The Minister today admitted that he himself felt there would be very much more than that collected but that he was not prepared to put an exact figure on it.  He agreed that because of a new system of taxation which it is proposed to introduce and the double or treble check which can be carried out it would be almost impossible for those who should pay value-added tax to avoid it.  The result will be that there will be additional revenue. Various figures have been bandied around the country and one can choose any figure one likes from £20 million down to £9 million or £10 million extra, but it is pretty clear that there will be a substantial amount of extra revenue coming in from value-added tax.  We are merely asking that the small sum of £410,000 should be used for the purpose of subsidising, if necessary, even if no extra revenue comes in, the food which is used admittedly by almost everybody but is absolutely essential for people who have not enough of this world's goods.</P>
    <P>For this reason we did not go for all foods.  We know quite well the Minister will prove conclusively, if not to <Col N="1478" /> us on this side of the House, to his own Government and his own backbenchers that it should not be done, and he will get their voting strength behind him in the lobby, and therefore we cannot carry it.  Nevertheless we feel that, in fairness, the Minister should accept the second alternative.</P>
    <P>Briefly to deal with the suggestion that zero taxation is an additional tax, I should like to know how the Minister makes this out.  Our biggest problem in regard to taxation is that when the person buys an article in a shop or supermarket&mdash;and we have been giving the example of the supermarket, which perhaps is not typical of the country district but it is the simplest way of giving the example&mdash;and then goes to the check-out system, the girl on the check-out system has to take two things into account at the present time, the price of the article and, if tax has to be added, what it is.  Under the new system, she will have to take into account whether the commodity is taxed at the lower rate of 5.26 or the higher rate of 16.37.  If there are certain items of essential food that are not taxed, surely it is unreasonable to suggest that it is an extra burden for anybody to say: &ldquo;There is no tax on this, how much is that?&rdquo; They do not have to add it on; they simply take the price as it is.</P>
    <P>I dealt earlier with the Minister's suggestion that this question of the two rates of tax could be got over by putting on the 5.26 at shelf level.  I disagree entirely with this suggestion because it means that lower-priced articles will be heavily over-taxed if that happens.  However, no matter what is done I suggest there are only two rates of tax involved, not three.  If the zero-rate is put on the essential foods, then there should be no difficulty. I do not think any trader would object to extra work being put on him because there is no question of having to estimate the tax; there is no tax. Therefore I suggest to the Minister that he should accept the amendment which Deputy O'Donovan and myself have put down on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be allowed to speak on this occasion before the <Col N="1479" /> next member of the Fine Gael Party; it is not because my name is to the amendment but because I have to go away.  It was Deputy Tully who first drew up this subject of bread and butter, tea and sugar at the Special Committee and Deputy Eddie Collins added red meats to it.  It is all a matter of opinion.  I think there should be no tax on any food, but I had to take what I thought we might get, and of course that was destroyed by the very bad behaviour of Deputy FitzGerald. I wrote to the Minister about this matter.  I notice Deputy FitzGerald pretended it did not happen at all.  He is quite entitled to behave like that if he likes.  I wrote long before the private meeting; as a matter of fact the Minister's reply to me was sent to the various Deputies and rightly so.  I have not disclosed what I said to the Minister or what the Minister said to me, and I have no intention of disclosing it.  That is my standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we came to deal with the matter I understood from what the Minister had said when he asked for the private meeting of the committee that he really wanted to do something, but naturally enough when the thing was blown out in the open by one Deputy running off to the newspapers he dug his heels in.  He did not lose his temper; others have not been so kind but perhaps we have more reason because we are more concerned about it.  The Minister and the Government have already taxed food, so they are not so concerned about it. I agree with Deputy Tully, and this is why I support him so roundly.  I put in only one item, oranges.  It is not worth talking about; it would cost only £80,000.  The reason I put it in is that there is a serious deficiency of vitamin C in this country, the medicos will talk <i>ad lib</i> about that.  Oranges are important.  I remember when the war was ending, the first cargo of oranges that came in here were regarded as gold.  But the other commodities that are even more important are bread, butter, margarine, tea, sugar and milk.  We put down this amendment in this way not because, unlike the Fine Gael Party, we are in favour <Col N="1480" /> of taxation on food.  Not at all, but because we knew the Minister would not take the tax off anything except these items.  He had told us quite significantly at the last public meeting of the committee that he had £3.7 million.  We proceeded to see what we could get for the £3.7 million, and this is what we proposed.  Like Deputy Tully I heard Deputy Garret FitzGerald talking about figures and how he consulted traders, supermarkets, and so on.  He should have been around the slums of Dublin consulting the ordinary residents there.</P>

This was something which we felt the Minister might agree to but when the matter was blown out into the open the Minister came into the private meeting of the committee and, although, as I say, he was quite polite, he dug his heels in and did not move an iota during all that discussion.  There was a complete change of atmosphere, and this is why I object so strongly about the matter this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let nobody suggest that I am not in favour of taking taxation completely off food.  I am, because I have always spoken against the taxation of food, but on this occasion we wanted to get something from the Minister if we could, and we knew what we were up against and so Deputy Tully and I assessed the position.  Deputy Tully prepared the amendment and I signed <Col N="1481" /> it with him.  This is why we did it, not because it represents our real views but because it represents what we thought was practicable.  Politics is the art of the possible.  One tries to achieve what one can.  We are all here to do the best we can for the people and there is no use in pretending that in what we call our affluent society, the great bulk of the population do not have as their basic foods bread, butter margarine, tea, sugar and milk.  Nobody need tell me that.  The suggestion was made that baby foods might be relieved of tax but most small children are fed on milk and I suggest that 90 per cent of babies are fed on milk.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that this squabble had to take place on this matter.  For once, let me be fair to the Fianna Fáil Party.  They had seven members on the committee and not one of them opened his mouth in public, but a real effort was made to make political mileage out of something in respect of which no such attempt should have been made, and it was made in the most objectionable way.  In a democracy if the democrats, the people in this House, subvert democracy, we have all had it and above all else, the people who talk most about democracy and do this kind of thing deserve the most blame. I hope that Fine Gael Deputies are going to talk on this, but I am personally not prepared to vote for the Fine Gael amendment but I propose to vote for the Labour Party amendment because I think it the practical thing to do.</P>

      <P>I was somewhat surprised by Deputy O'Donovan's attitude in relation to this amendment because we did discuss this fully at a number of meetings of the special committee and I think it was agreed by the members at these meetings that partial zero rating would not be the best way of approaching this problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the simplest way of approaching this problem would be a global one of zero rating of foodstuffs and partial zero-rating would not be the best approach.  The proposals put forward by Deputy FitzGerald are comprehensive in nature and deserving of credit, and I wish to place on record that in his comprehensive approach in relation to proposals to zero-rate food, he has done a very good service.  Allied with this zero-rating of foods would be a simplification of the value-added tax charged at the retail level.  He intended to trap the equivalent of a wholesale tax at the manufacturing and wholesale level and <Col N="1483" /> at retail level there would be two basic taxes, the zero-rate and 6 per cent VAT.  This I think is acceptable to the retailers especially and it has the excellent effect of zero-rating all foodstuffs. This is a principle so far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned which has prevailed down the years.  It is a good social principle and one in which I concur fully.</P>
      <P>There should be an attempt to zero-rate foods for one major reason, that we are going into the EEC on January 1st.  This will bring benefits in relation to some of our food exports, particularly meat, and the cost of living will increase and this increase in the cost of living will bear most heavily on people with smaller incomes, such as old age pensioners and people on fixed incomes who have not the bargaining position of trade unions.  There are many in our society who live on the poverty line and the aim of the amendment is to go some way towards protecting their real income.  The effect of it would be to decrease the price of foodstuffs by the equivalent of 5 per cent and this would hold back inflation on these people, especially those in the poorer classes who are suffering from a very high level of inflation in the past few years.  It is a socially desirable amendment and I approve of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I proposed a list of foodstuffs at a meeting of the special committee somewhat more comprehensive than that proposed today by Deputies O'Donovan and Tully.  I proposed bread, butter, magarine, tea, sugar, red meats, white meats, fish, potatoes, household vegetables and liquid milk and Deputy O'Donovan added oranges.  I feel that the items produced by these Deputies are lacking in protein and not a really well-balanced list of items.  Surely it should be the aim to improve if possible, the diet available to everybody.  Deputy O'Donovan's item of oranges is a very valid item on medical grounds. I was surprised to find that the Labour amendment excluded fish, potatoes and household vegetables. Surely they should be included.  The Minister, in principle, should have made some effort to zero-rate foodstuffs. <Col N="1484" /> This would require a marginal recording of the value-added tax rates and we would, of course, support any marginal change in the value-added tax rates provided such a change would benefit the lower income groups.  Faced with the EEC, with inflation, with higher prices we must take a positive stand here to protect the less well-off sections of our community.  It is for that reason I am more in favour of Deputy FitzGerald's amendment than I am of the Labour Party amendment.  I do not think the latter goes far enough.  I would like to see the Minister taking positive action to zero-rate foodstuffs.  We have put forward a sound financial remodelling of the value-added tax rates.  It would be generous of the Minister to acknowledge that this is possible.  It would be even more generous of him to accept the amendment in principle and come forward himself with his own zero-rate on foodstuffs and a reorientation of the other value-added tax rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be something callous and oppressive about attacks on something as basic as food.  I would like to support the pleas that have been made to the Minister to remove food from the value-added tax net.  There are two amendments before the Minister by which he can do this.  One of these has been tabled by Deputy FitzGerald and seeks total exemption in respect of food and non-alcoholic drinks.  The other is an amendment from Deputies Tully and O'Donovan asking that certain specified foods be exempt. Obviously amendments of this nature must be of considerable magnitude in fiscal terms so far as revenue is concerned and the Minister would be entitled to object to them if they were presented to him without being costed fully.  The Minister must admit, however, that it is unusual to have two such amendments presented to him and to have them presented with the costings involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald's amendment involves a total figure of approximately £17,500,000 and in considerable detail he has spelled out to the Minister how this sum might be recouped.  He has spelled out also how this recoupment would have less adverse social effects than would the taxing of food.  Deputy O'Donovan was inclined to disagree with the omnibus exclusion on the grounds that politics is the art of the possible and that what was being <Col N="1488" /> sought in Deputy FitzGerald's amendment was, by implication, impracticable or impossible.  I suggest that Deputy FitzGerald has indicated that far from being impractical or impossible, his amendment is entirely feasible because it has been costed accurately. Consequently Deputy O'Donovan's preference for his own limited amendment falls on that ground.</P>
    <P>When supporting his limited amendment, Deputy Tully made the point that the items of food which he seeks to have exempted&mdash;bread, tea, sugar, butter, milk, margarine and oranges&mdash; represents the basic diet of a large section of our community.  It is a sad reflection on our society if this should be the case but is it not an argument in favour of exempting food totally to bring down the cost of all foods in the hope that even that reduction might have the effect of broadening the diet of this unfortunate section of our community? Again, that is an argument in favour of Deputy FitzGerald's amendment. Not only would it result in a reduction in the cost of all foods but if we wish to improve the standard in our society generally we should endeavour to make available at the lowest prices possible, the widest range of foods possible and to as many people as possible.</P>
    <P>Our perennial problem is inflation. Inflation is something that is triggered-off very often by non-economic factors. Very often it is triggered-off because of a feeling about prices, and the two areas in which this feeling can be most emotive are in relation to housing costs but above all in relation to food prices. A tremendous psychological blow in the battle against inflation could be struck if food were to be seen to be reduced in price and if it were known to the community generally that this basic commodity was free of taxation. That would ease considerably the perpetual cycle of wages chasing prices and prices increasing consequent on increases in wages.  This is a very strong argument for consideration by the Minister in deciding whether to accept the amendments.</P>
    <P>If an amendment which is desirable socially&mdash;no one can deny that to bring down the cost of food is not desirable socially and at the same <Col N="1489" /> time practicable economically&mdash;is presented to the Minister.  I find it extremely difficult to understand why it is not accepted.  Deputy FitzGerald's amendment has been costed and the balance is in favour of accepting it. Deputy Tully's amendment has been costed at £4.11 million and the Minister has admitted that revenue buoyancy following the introduction of value-added tax will give him a figure of £3.70 million.  I would suggest to the Minister that he had his tongue in his cheek when he suggested that this would be the extent of the buoyancy to result from the change of taxation.  It is my belief that it will be much more than that because, apart from the slight increases involved in certain rates, the accounting procedures will, of necessity, be much tighter and there will be a much better skim-off by the Revenue Commissioners than what they are achieving now.  Instead of having a deficit when he puts this buoyancy against the cost of Deputy Tully's proposed exemption, the Minister will have a surplus.  Even for this limited range of foodstuffs there is no argument against rejecting that particular amendment.  I gather that the argument was put forward that the acceptance of the amendment would lead to complications in accountancy but as Deputy Tully pointed out, the very spot at which this complication would be expected to arise&mdash;the check-out in a shop&mdash;there are already two items to be dealt with and this is a third item not involving any calculation.  By no stretch of the imagination could it be suggested, therefore, that this would lead to complications.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons why I am disappointed and puzzled at the Minister's failure to exempt food.  Even if there were economic difficulties I would expect the Minister to do everything possible to overcome them or to put up with them in view of the social desirability of exempting food. It has been pointed out clearly to the Minister that under both amendments there would not be any economic difficulties.  This must be the case when Great Britain, with a much more complicated economy than ours, complicated apart from its size by its <Col N="1490" /> essential complexity, have found it possible to zero-rate food.  I am sure that the revenue adjustments that have to be made in that country are on a vast scale.  Yet, a Tory Government have found it possible to do so. I suggest to the Minister that when it was found feasible economically and desirable socially to do that in Britain, it defies imagination why it cannot be done here.</P>
    <P>I suggest also to the Minister that to accept these amendments and thereby put food in a special position in the social structure of the nation would result in a tremendous blow being struck against inflation.  Also, the Minister would be setting a climate in which it would be much more difficult to justify the demands that lead to inflation.  There is a great opportunity in this Bill to achieve a result of that size and importance. For these reasons I urge the Minister to accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out already there are at the moment a significant number of Irish families living in poverty.  It has been said that one family in seven has a household income of under £7 per week.  Bearing that in mind when one considers, as one does in this amendment, that we are discussing a proposal to tax the food which people eat it certainly amazes me that every Deputy in the House should not be concerned to see in what way this can be avoided.  We have one family in seven with a household income of under £7 per week, with these families spending 43 to 44 per cent of their income on food, and this House is now solemnly considering a proposal by the Minister for Finance to tax the food that we eat.  That is what is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lenehan has his qualms of conscience; he had them nine years ago.  But he got over them and his little peregrination from that seat over there down to the Minister to exchange a note, deceived nobody, least of all the Minister.  Apparently he has gone away satisfied as to what the answer he sought to the question he asked ought to have been.  The fact is that when the House last considered <Col N="1491" /> a matter as grave as this eight or nine years ago we were told by the then Minister for Finance that it was impossible to exempt food from turnover tax.  This was asserted here. There were Deputies in the Labour and Fine Gael Benches who did not accept that but the assertion so clearly made by the then Minister for Finance convinced a number of Deputies, including the then Deputy Lenehan who, as a result, sojourned or hibernated a while in another place before he came back here.</P>
    <P>This is now so much water under the bridge and we are again discussing whether food should be subject in this Bill to VAT and in effect whether it should ever have been taxed under turnover taxation.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald has clearly shown, decisively in my view, that there is no need to tax food in this country, that we can get almost every penny of revenue this Bill seeks to get, by altering in no unduly hard way rates of taxation.  We can get the same amount without taxing food and if we adopt his proposal the result will be that every single article of food will be reduced by 5 per cent.  What are we talking about?  In these circumstances, which Deputy will vote against a proposal to reduce articles of food by 5 per cent?  What can be the reason for refusing to bring in a piece of social legislation which will have a dramatic effect on the living conditions of at least one family in seven throughout the country?</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it clear in the press before Dáil Éireann met that he is not going to budge on this. Why?  Who advises him?  We can talk about listening to the voice of the people; I regret to say that in my view the Minister is clearly the captive of his advisers in the Revenue Commissioners.  They tell him what ought to be done and he is doing what he is told he should do.  Of course, it is clear that the VAT rates of taxation in the Minister's proposal are convenient for accountancy and for recording; they are the system the Revenue Commissioners have decided on and I assert that they have already <Col N="1492" /> printed the necessary forms.  It would be much too difficult to change all these and, therefore, the Minister will stand firm and will refuse to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Let it be clearly known that that refusal with the present disposition of the House means, in effect, that Dáil Éireann tonight is reimposing taxation on food which it has been clearly demonstrated from these benches has been unnecessarily imposed for the past eight or nine years. As a result of action taken by the Fine Gael Party today the people in at least one constituency in the next three weeks will have an opportunity of saying whether they agree or not. When the people elect a new Government this kind of taxation on food will be removed and those who advise the Minister had better here and now take note of that fact.  We cannot afford by our taxation to be boosting an inflation which is at present menacing the way of life and the sources of employment of many of our workers. We are now experiencing the results of rising living costs continued over the last three or four years and growing apace as a result of indiscreet, ill-advised administrative and legislative interventions by the Government. There is no housewife who does not look back with misgiving and some bitterness on the assurances, given prior to February of last year, that decimalisation would not make the slightest difference in living costs. Everybody knows it did and everybody knows that each week now anyone going into a shop faces enormous price increases, many of them stemming from decimalisation.</P>
    <P>We were told that VAT would make no difference to the cost of living and that it was merely new taxation to supplant what was already there.  This time the people do not accept that.  They fear its effects particularly on food.  If it were necessary for us to introduce it, if it were part of what we had to do by reason of our entry into Europe, and to achieve a position in the newly arrived European Community, that would be a price we would have to pay, but this is not so.</P>
    <P>It is clear now that while VAT as a <Col N="1493" /> system of taxation will be obligatory on members of the Community, this proposal is not necessary.  This is a Fianna Fáil proposal to tax the food of the Irish people.  The British have not done it.  The arguments advanced in support of the Fine Gael amendment demonstrate that it is not necessary to achieve the revenue required.  Why then is the Minister refusing to accept this amendment?</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt about it, Deputy FitzGerald has demonstrated that, by a slight alteration in the rate of taxation, the same revenue could be achieved.  VAT as a system of taxation could go into operation and all food could be excluded with a resultant bonus of a reduction of 5 per cent in the expenditure of the ordinary people of the country.  When we are battling inflation, when we are fighting to sell our goods abroad, surely only a madman would assert that this should not be done.</P>
    <P>When we vote, as Deputies point their shoes towards the division lobbies they should realise that they are voting to tax the food of the people and that there is no fiscal or financial reason for doing it.  It is merely being done because the Minister and the Government have not got the imagination or the sense to realise that this Fine Gael proposal is sound and should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Fine Gael amendment the purpose of which is to exempt all food from VAT. This is consistent with the attitude which this party have adopted down through the years.  This was our attitude when turnover tax was originally introduced. At that time we felt that food should be exempted because it constitutes such a major proportion of the expenditure of less well-off families in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, I should like to pay tribute to the work done by the Opposition members of the special committee which dealt with this matter.  They went into detail and they elicited the facts which enabled us to debate this matter here today.  I am surprised that no member of the Minister's party has yet risen to defend the declared attitude <Col N="1494" /> of the Minister.  We have had six Opposition speakers on this amendment. The Minister's party had ample opportunity to offer to speak in support of the Minister's attitude.  They have not done so.  They will support him silently and with guilt.</P>
    <P>We seek to exempt food from VAT because food constitutes a relatively higher proportion of the expenditure of low income families than of higher income families.  The household budget inquiry estimate shows that in the poorest one-seventh of the community, approximately 43 per cent of their total expenditure is on food.  The better-off section of the community spend only about 20 per cent of their total income on food.  Therefore, a concession given to make foods cheaper benefits the poorer section of the community much more than the better-off sections of the community.</P>
    <P>This proposal by our party is a practical expression of our basic philosophy which is that we need to redistribute income to help those who are earning less than others.  It has been alleged by the Minister that this is an impracticable proposal.  If it is, how is it that the British can exempt food from VAT?  We are not putting forward a proposal which we are not prepared to stand over and for which we are not prepared to face the consequences.  We have estimated how much it will cost and we have stated quite clearly where the revenue can be made up to ensure that there is no net loss to the Exchequer if our amendment is accepted.  Naturally, there will be higher taxation on certain commodities because you cannot exempt food and not expect to have to raise the money elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated by Deputy FitzGerald that there will be a net increase in the total VAT load for people with an income in excess of £2,000 but the reason we have put down this amendment is that there will be a substantial decrease in the VAT load for families with an income of less than £1,250.  In other words, our proposal would redistribute purchasing power in favour of the less well-off section of the community and to the disfavour of the better-off section.  We <Col N="1495" /> would prefer if there were no disfavour involved but, when it comes down to hard practicalities, we realise that if the poorer section is to pay less the better-off section has to pay more if we are to raise the same amount of money.</P>
    <P>There are additional side effects to this proposal.  It will make a substantial contribution towards reducing the rate of inflation.  Wage demands in excess of what the community can bear generally arise from the fact that people are afraid that their pay packets will be eroded by inflation in the prices they have to pay.  The type of inflation to which most people are sensitive, and to which the housewife is most sensitive, is inflation in the price of foodstuffs. That is the type of inflation that results in the push for higher wage demands which are sometimes in excess of what the community can afford.  If we introduce a measure which will reduce the tax load on food, and which will contribute to reducing the rate of increase in food prices, we are making a direct contribution towards a stable incomes policy situation by reducing the necessity for wage demands in excess of what the community can afford.</P>
    <P>We also recognise that this is a food-producing country and a food-exporting country.  Any tax change which gives a relative advantage to the consumer of food is in the interests of our balance of payments because it means that there is a net incentive to people to consume more food.  We produce the vast bulk of the food we eat at home.  Therefore, we are helping home industry by helping the food industry.  We are also helping those who produce the food, the farming community.  We in Fine Gael have always admitted that one of the disadvantages of EEC entry is that it will lead to certain increases in the price of food.  Our proposal would also have the effect of reducing the impact of whatever increases in the price of food may result from the EEC entry.</P>
    <P>Our primary reason for putting forward this proposal is that we believe food is a basic necessity of life and <Col N="1496" /> that it is the largest single item in the expenditure of the vast bulk of our families.  It is a relatively larger item in the expenditure of poorer families than it is in the expenditure of better off families.  Therefore, we in Fine Gael uphold the amendment to exempt food from value-added tax.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I can sympathise with this amendment. It is a popular type of amendment to propose in this House, especially if it results in the alleviation of the distress of the poorer section of the community. As the Minister has already said, there are other ways of benefiting the poorer section of the community.  There are many other sections of the community, the well-off section, people dining in big hotels tonight.  As Deputy Bruton said, there are 20 per cent of the people in the well-off sector of society who would also benefit from the amendment.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This also should be considered.  Let us hope that as time goes on and new legislation is introduced a closer look will be taken at who should benefit from children's allowances.</P>
      <P>If we try to operate the system suggested in the amendment a third level will be introduced.  There is the wholesale level, the 5.26, and the zero rating. This would present problems of accountancy for retail outlets.</P>
      <P>I have certain sympathy with the amendment but I want to be practical about it.  I know what the Minister has in mind as regards the distribution of wealth.  It would be better to have it accrue to those really deserving.  If increased taxation is to be imposed at wholesale level, we must ensure that the rate is not so high as to put manufacturing firms out of business. These are sensitive points which we should keep in mind.</P>
      <P>In Deputy FitzGerald's proposals it was intended to increase certain taxation.  I am not sure&mdash;I did not see it defined specifically enough&mdash;what industries this would affect.  I have no doubt that it would affect some industries, and that sales of companies would be diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy that I should like to see pursued is one whereby whatever resources we have would be distributed in a more confined sphere so that it would benefit the section of the community that are badly in need of help. I would hope that the benefits would <Col N="1499" /> accrue to the poorer section and that the benefits would exceed the 5.26 which they have to pay in respect of their food today.  I am quite convinced that this is the mind of the Minister also.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins said a little while ago that anybody who voted against the Fine Gael proposal would be a mad man and certainly he would be if the position were as outlined by the Fine Gael speakers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait for it.  I am going to take some little time on this, I am afraid, but it is worth doing because it is important that people should know and that Fine Gael members should know what they are committing themselves to, because I do not think they realise it.  Under the proposals in this Bill, food will be liable to tax at exactly the same rate, the effective 5.26 per cent rate under value-added tax, as it is at present.  Consequently, there will be no reason whatever for food prices to be disturbed on the changeover to value-added tax because it will be precisely the same rate of tax that is charged, and the same situation will apply as far as possible to most other consumer goods and services.  The avoidance of de-stabilising price changes was one of the main reasons for making the changeover to value-added tax at the existing rates of sales taxation.  As I said earlier today, this is the main reason that we have these rates of 5.26, 16.37 and so on.  The Fine Gael proposals for the removal of tax from foods and certain other goods would, on the other hand, have repercussions which in some cases could be quite serious, in the form of compensating tax increases in almost the whole field of industry, commerce and agriculture. We reject the massive levying <Col N="1500" /> of extra taxation touching on almost every non-food item involved in the Fine Gael proposals.  Almost every non-food purchase made by the consumer would cost from 1¼ per cent to 7½ per cent more, and even then there would be an unfilled revenue gap of over £4 million for which no provision is made in the Fine Gael proposals.  Items which would be effected at the lower range would include new houses, electricity, coal, gas, clothing, beer, tobacco and cigarettes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if it would be expecting too much of Independent Newspapers Limited, who gave such space and prominence to Deputy FitzGerald's proposals, to allow their readers to judge the issue for themselves by letting them know about the wide range of goods which would go up in price under the Fine Gael proposals. They have failed to do that up to now.  Apart from any effects on the industries concerned&mdash;and Deputy Fitzpatrick touched on this and its quite serious implications&mdash;the increases which are proposed by Fine Gael would be a great hardship to young married couples setting up a new home.  Over 20,000 couples will marry in the next year.  The extra taxation proposed by Fine Gael would <Col N="1501" /> add considerably to the cost of trying to furnish a home.  There is not one household item from a door mat to a piece of curtain material that would not be substantially dearer, and this extra taxation which Fine Gael want to levy would hit everything, proverbially, from a needle to an anchor. Even then one could not guarantee that the hoped for reductions in food would reach the consumer.  Under the Fine Gael proposals you are not even robbing Peter to pay Paul; you are robbing them both.</P>
      <P>Price increases would also extend to a variety of farmers' requisites from spades and shovels right up to tractors and other farm machinery, machine parts, seeds, equipment and machinery repairs.  The provision in the Fine Gael scheme that part of the increased tax would be built in to the wholesale price is simply not acceptable and not workable, and I shall deal with that later on in more detail.</P>
      <P>Apart from the various technical objections that arise in this regard, there is a very real danger that the retailers would apply their normal profit margin to the higher wholesale price with the consequence that prices would rise by more than the increased tax.  The most serious objection to the proposal, however, is that there is no in-built guarantee that food prices would fall by the required 5 per cent so as to bring about the relief to the poorer families which we are all seeking. I will not be a party to what amounts to a confidence trick of the housewives of this country.  To pretend that the exemption proposed by Deputy FitzGerald would bring about a worthwhile reduction to the housewife is just naive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the assurances by RGDATA and other trade organisations that they would not increase their margins, there is no certainty that these organisations could ensure compliance in full by their memberships.  Disparity in the price of groceries throughout the country revealed in a recent survey will make any housewife, if not Deputy FitzGerald or other Deputies opposite, doubt the capacity of the trade associations to enforce real reductions in any item.  In addition, as <Col N="1502" /> Deputies know, there are certain large supermarket chains at present who claim that they do not charge turnover tax.  Whether this claim be true or not, there is the distinct possibility that some of them might not feel obliged to reduce food prices if the tax were removed, because if there is any validity in their present claims then they should not reduce their present prices.</P>

The price surveillance machinery of the Department of Industry and Commerce is geared primarily to the control of price increases by the manufacturers, and there is little or no experience of enforcing general price reductions especially at the retail level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said on numerous occasions in this House.  The <Col N="1503" /> Deputy should not talk about alleging it.  Where would he find an allegation that it exists?  Where in the law does it say that it exists, apart from bread, milk and one or two other items?  I do not want to embarrass Deputy FitzGerald and his colleagues, but there are a number of his colleagues who could explain to him why price control at the retail level is next to impossible. Take a very simple example, the price of a sandwich in a pub or in a café, you fix the price and the next day the size and the content of the sandwich are changed, and there is no control on the article that is produced.  You could go on doing this for ever, and as regards other articles, regular purchases, experience shows that the maximum controlled price, which is the only way you can control at retail level, in most cases becomes the standard price.  In practice it means that you are eliminating competition over a very wide range of goods.  This is known or should be known to the Fine Gael Party, and if it is, they ought not pretend to the public that it is possible to ensure that there would be fully compensating reductions in the price of food if the 5 per cent value-added tax were removed from food items.</P>

      <P>Despite his statements at the week-end, if not since, Deputy FitzGerald could not himself guarantee that there would be food price reductions, and in the special committee discussions, he limited himself to an assertion that food prices would at some time in the future settle at a level 5 per cent lower than they would otherwise be.  Even granting him this very doubtful point, the retail and wholesale trades would in the meantime be the beneficiaries of the tax <Col N="1504" /> reduction at the rate of £17 million a year and the Exchequer and the housewife would be the losers.  If even a significant part of the tax reductions is not passed on to the consumer, then the Fine Gael proposals could result in a greater tax burden on the poorer people with the larger families.</P>

On Committee Stage of this Bill, I invited Opposition suggestions because, despite what may be said on occasions about Fianna Fáil Ministers, we do not think that all wisdom resides in us, and it was possible that some member of the Opposition could devise a scheme which would be feasible and which had eluded me and my officers in the past.</P>

      <P>I think the Labour Party has very clearly indicated their very obvious reservations about this Fine Gael scheme, if only from the limited scope of the amendments which they propose. It may well be that they realise the consequences of the compensatory taxation which Fine Gael would levy on everything except food and it may be that the Labour Party shy away, as I do, from the very dubious social achievement of taking caviare, imported snails, smoked salmon and lobster and grouse in port wine sauce out of the tax net.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, we have, but the point I am really at is that this was the attitude taken by Deputy FitzGerald.  He is the spokesman for Fine Gael on these matters and, unless his colleagues are prepared to repudiate that view, they will have to accept responsibility for that approach.  That will be hung around their necks too. They have their chance tonight.  The Deputy can twist any way he likes but he said, in the circumstances I have described, that he would prefer to double the turnover tax on electricity, fuel, clothing, gas, footwear and other items rather than the present system.  That is what the Deputy said. He may try to get out of it and, if he wants to get out of it and to get up now and say that he did not mean it, that he said it on the spur of the moment, I will accept that; but, if he is not going to say that, then he is stuck with it and his party is stuck with it too unless they are prepared to repudiate it.</P>
      <P>I did say there were a number of reasons&mdash;they might be called technical reasons but, from another point of view, some of them could be described as anything but technical&mdash; why the Fine Gael proposal is not feasible.  The proposal, apart from all the consequences I have mentioned, involves what we describe as trapping tax at the wholesale level.  Without that device it does not work and I think Deputy FitzGerald will agree with me on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We can only take the proposal that we discussed, the one that was in front of us today and again tonight on this amendment.  I want to point out in regard to the Fine Gael proposal, first of all, that the calculations of the rates of tax which would be required to give effect to the Fine Gael proposals do not appear to take into account the fact that on the changeover to value-added tax the equivalent of wholesale tax will not be effectively paid on building materials, such as timber, glass, paint, <i>et cetera,</i> used by traders.  Even accepting that the loss of £3 million on motor cars, radio and television sets, <i>et cetera</i>, would not be made up within the value-added tax system but in some other form of taxation, even if we accept that, the more realistic rates to give effect to the Fine Gael scheme would be food, <i>et cetera</i>, zero; all other taxable goods and services, 6.5 per cent and, at the wholesale level, 26 per cent in place of the 24 per cent that Deputy FitzGerald suggested.  I want to get that straight first of all as regards the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much more important than that is what is involved in this proposal and how it would work.  First, if we accepted this, there would be a tax increase of 24 per cent on certain of the more essential goods and services. As I mentioned, the tax element in those goods and services&mdash;Deputy FitzGerald said a 24 per cent rate would not apply, but it would, in fact, be a 26 per cent rate, that is, the ones to which it would not apply, would be fuel, clothing, footwear, electricity, petrol, hotel and other services. They would go up under his scheme by 24 per cent&mdash;that is, gas, electricity, clothing, footwear, all <Col N="1511" /> these basic essentials.  There would be an indefinite tax increase in other goods and services.  The tax element in goods and services to which the proposed 24 per cent rate would apply would increase by an indeterminate percentage which would depend on the level of the amount of the mark-up price at retail level.  If anyone doubts this I can give him examples but I do not want to delay on examples if it is not necessary.  Under the proposals in this Bill, on the other hand, the tax element in the final selling price is always a constant percentage. Under the Fine Gael proposal the lower retail mark-up the higher will be the percentage of tax in the selling price.  It follows from this that, under the Fine Gael scheme, not only would there be confusion about what was the tax element in goods but also, even when a retailer cuts his profit, he would be unable to pass on to the consumer as great a tax reduction as he would be able to do under the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the lower the retail mark-up, the higher the percentage of tax and, therefore, when he cuts his price he cannot correspondingly cut the level of the tax element involved because the tax element increases, whereas, under the scheme in the Bill, if the retailer cuts his prices, the tax element will be reduced by a corresponding amount.  The scheme proposed by Fine Gael would be biased very much in favour of the larger traders.  It would benefit the big retailer who could obtain the best quantity discounts. If we assume that a trader who was a large retailer could buy a certain quantity of stock for a net price of £900 whereas a small trader would have to pay a £1,000 for the same quantity, the effect of the Fine Gael scheme would be that the price advantage to the large trader, that is the £100 which he has already, would be increased by 20.4 per cent on the deal.  We all know what is the attitude of small traders and what is happening to them because of the competitive advantage of the large chains and supermarkets.  This proposal involves a direct build-up of increased competitiveness by the <Col N="1512" /> large trader against the small shopkeeper. Furthermore the Fine Gael proposal would introduce a cascade effect or double taxation element within the tax system&mdash;something that the value-added tax system is designed to take out of the present system.</P>
    <P>Any significant element of a cascade in the tax system would make Irish exports less competitive in foreign markets.  Of course, this is a factor which must be considered.  Deputy FitzGerald has suggested, as have a number of his colleagues, that the prices of zero-rated goods would fall by a full 5 per cent.  Indeed it has been implied in what they have said that the prices of goods proposed to be taxed at 26 per cent, or at 24 per cent according to their figures, would be likely to rise by no more than the additional tax element.  At present there are such variations in food prices that it would be virtually impossible to determine whether a particular trader had genuinely reduced his prices or whether he was operating merely some sales promotion gimmick.</P>
    <P>There are large traders who claim not to charge turnover tax.  What would they do in these circumstances? Would they reduce their prices by 5 per cent?  If they do, their claims at present would be exposed as being false.  The smaller traders would be inclined to say that because of the competition which they suffer from larger retailers by way of the operation of trading stamp schemes and so on, they held back legitimate price increases which they should have put on but which they could not afford to put on because of this competition.  It is reasonable to expect that a number of them would not pass on the full 5 per cent reduction and this in particular, when they found that under the Fine Gael scheme the competition that they were suffering from big retailers was being stepped up remarkably because of a built-in feature in the Fine Gael scheme.  That would be all the more reason why they would refuse to reduce their prices.</P>
    <P>At present retailers are accustomed to take a mark-up on the cost of goods inclusive of any wholesale tax charged to them by their suppliers.  This practice <Col N="1513" /> continues after the wholesale tax was increased from 5 to 10 per cent and despite any protestations to the contrary, it would be likely to continue in relation to the increased tax proposed under the Fine Gael scheme to be charged at the wholesale level.</P>
    <P>In the grocery trade at least, it is accepted that it would be impracticable to operate two rates of tax at the check-out. In order to do this it would be necessary to segregate the goods in such a way as to be able to obtain a separate total of the goods chargeable at each rate.  The adoption of a zero-rate would not in any way solve this problem.  It would still be necessary to segregate the goods so as to obtain the total to which the zero-rate applied and the total chargeable at 6.5 per cent.  The only saving would be that the assistant would have to calculate the tax for one total instead of two, but since the traders agree that it would be impracticable to arrive at separate totals at the check-out, this advantage can be described only as illusory.</P>
    <P>All of the member and applicant countries of the EEC, with one exception, either tax food under their present system or propose to tax it on the changeover to VAT.  The Commission of the EEC will have power to require new member states to harmonise their VAT system in accordance with the VAT directives which each member must accept.  We are not quite sure as to what would be the Commission's attitude in regard to an application by a member State to continue the zero-rating for food after the end of the transition period, which in our case is 1st January, 1974.  However, there is a very strong possibility that if food were zero-rated as from the commencement of value-added tax, the tax would have to be reimposed within about 14 months.</P>
    <P>Britain is the only one of the ten countries which does not tax food or propose to tax it.  I have gone into this before and I do not wish to go over it again except to say briefly that the British position is different from ours. They are changing from a system which is much further removed from VAT that is ours.  The impact of entry into the EEC and of VAT on their cost of <Col N="1514" /> living will be substantially different and more adverse than it will be in our case.  For these reasons and for the reason that they have never taxed food in the past, it is conceivable that they might get an additional transitional period for their system of non-taxation of food under VAT.  Our situation is different and the odds are very heavy that if we were to adopt the Fine Gael proposal, in about 14 months time we might well have to reimpose tax on food.</P>
    <P>Leaving all these matters aside, if anyone is to judge the merits or the demerits of the Fine Gael proposal he must know, broadly speaking, what are the other items that will be increased in price and how they affect the average person.  He must know also what kind of people are affected.</P>

I said this in the special committee: my first approach to this matter was something on the lines of the Labour Party approach which was to pick out the most clearly essential items and try to take the tax off them. This is probably the approach most reasonable people would take as a first approach.  However, when you get down to it, you find in practice&mdash;and I conceded this already, that I believe Deputy FitzGerald is right and indeed I expressed the same view at the special committee&mdash;in what he says that when you get down to it you either have to zero-rate all food or none, because, some of the problems of zero-rating that arise are these: first, not everybody will agree as to what are the basic necessities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.  Therefore, whatever you do when you begin selecting you reach a stage where, unless you are prepared to ride roughshod, you cannot get any agreement on what should be exempt.  That is only a practical difficulty of application, not a fundamental objection.  A fundamental objection&mdash;and I think <Col N="1517" /> Deputy Tully does not accept this&mdash; is that it would create a third rate at the retail level.  All the arguments we have received from representatives of retailers and all the experience of the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with retailers confirm that they cannot operate more than two rates.  Many of them argue they cannot operate even two rates.  I do not think it can be disputed that they cannot operate three rates.  It may be said that zero-rating is not another rate, but it is.  From the shopkeepers' point of view he must segregate the items which are zero-rated and charge the appropriate tax on what is left.  He might as well be charging a tax at 1 per cent.  The only difference is that he does not have to do a sum.</P>

      <P>There has to be a change for reasons analogous to that whereby the 5 per cent turnover tax is the same as 5.26 per cent value-added tax.  There is no other change involved.  As far as the shopkeeper is concerned it is just the same.  I was saying that the creation of a third rate makes it impossible for shopkeepers to operate.  Further, where you have a selected number of items zero-rated and the other items in the shop subject to different rates of tax you will have a situation in which the housewife will be very confused because she will not know which items are subject to tax and which are not.  She will, therefore, be confused as to what should be the price.  Furthermore, by selecting certain items and omitting others you are affecting the existing trade pattern in regard to those things and the competition between them, for instance, as between tea and coffee and milk and cocoa.  This may not seem a fundamental point but if it has the effect of, perhaps, putting a number of people out of work because of the switchover&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not saying this is a fundamental issue but it is another factor you have got to take into account.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald said that Fine Gael has discussed its ideas with retailers and supermarkets.  &ldquo;From all these groups we sought and secured agreement not alone to the passing on of tax reductions in full to the consumer, but also to a reduction in percentage retail mark-ups, necessary to ensure that the operation of a single rate of tax at retail level&mdash; one of the attractive features of the Fine Gael scheme&mdash;would involve no increase in the size of retail margins in money terms.  Finally, we produced a fully documented proposal complete with tabular statements showing the amount of tax involved <Col N="1523" /> in each aspect of our scheme, and the precise effects of each of our proposals on tax revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was issued to the Press and appeared in the Press and it is as follows:</P>
      <P>Dr. Garret FitzGerald, spokesman on Finance for Fine Gael, today received assurances from all these interests that the full benefit of tax reductions would be passed on to the consumer and that the percentage margins or mark-ups on wholesale prices would be adjusted by the amount necessary to maintain existing margins in money terms on any goods the tax rates on which have to be adjusted as part of an arrangement to secure a single tax rate at the retail stage.  With these assurances, the implementation of which can be undertaken in consultation with the National Prices Commission, the way is cleared for the implementation of the Fine Gael proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In a further statement, I pointed out:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> The Minister's statement that reduction in food prices &ldquo;could not be guaranteed&rdquo;, following an elimination of the tax on food imposed by the present Government nine years ago which now stands at 5 per cent shows a total lack of confidence in the Government's price surveillance machinery, which is surely valueless if, as the Minister suggests, it is so ineffective as to be unable to secure that tax cuts are passed on to consumers.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition, as distinct from the Minister for Finance, had accused the Government of giving such free rein to price fixing, and of such a failure to secure competition in the retail trade, as to make it impracticable any longer to give the public the benefit of tax reductions even when these are agreed to be desirable and financially possible, they would have been accused of factious opposition and political pointscoring! Yet this is what Mr. Colley has now said about the Government of which he is a member; he must not think much of his colleague in Industry and Commerce, Mr. Paddy Lalor!</P>

      <P>Let this go out from this House to the housewives, that there can be no tax reductions <Col N="1528" /> any longer because Deputy Colley has told this House that as long as they are in office there cannot be a reduction because he cannot guarantee that they will be passed on and, like the decent man he is if he cannot guarantee that they will be passed on, if the Government are so imcompetent that he cannot pass them on, then he is not going to reduce taxes.  The housewives can know that as long as Fianna Fáil are here there will be no tax reduction. That is the message from this House tonight from the Minister for Finance.  If the housewives want taxes to be reduced, they will not get it from the Minister who has told us that he is not prepared to do that because he cannot secure that these will be passed on.  This is the message from this debate, a very important one, and it will ring loud and clear in mid-Cork in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>To come back to the points made earlier and I will deal with them as briefly as possible, the Minister talked of a de-stabilisation danger, the importance of securing as far as possible that the same taxes are applied under the new system as under the old.  He objected to the fact that we were proposing to increase the level of wholesale tax on certain goods.  What he has not made clear to this House is that he in this Bill is increasing the present rate of wholesale tax on these goods substantially.  The return in the current year from wholesale tax of 10 per cent is estimated at £10½ million. The Bill before the House is designed to secure £14 million on these goods, a £3½ million increase or an increase of one-third in the return from wholesale tax.  That £3½ million is the Minister's own figure and the figure of £10½ million and £14 million are estimates I have made.  I checked the £14 million with the Revenue Commissioners and arrived at the £10½ million by subtracting £3½ million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the accuracy of the statement, the figures which I calculated and which are set out in the tabular with our statement here were checked out with the Revenue Commissioners.  I have to say there was a difficulty in reconciling the final total for wholesale tax by a small margin, but as they said to me the difference was one that would not be significant, we did not pursue the matter to the last decimal point.  Subject to the question of the final decimal point, the figure I have given of £14 million is accurate to within a few hundred thousand pounds, and that figure is the one after the Minister has added £3,500,000.  The Minister is increasing this wholesale tax of 10 per cent by one-third and then he has the nerve to criticise us for imposing increases in taxation.  That inaccuracy I have now, I think, nailed.  The Minister used the following words in his speech: a &ldquo;massive increase in taxation&rdquo; and goods would be &ldquo;substantially dearer&rdquo;.  When he spoke about the figures he got muddled between 1¼ and 1½ per cent.  He said, in fact, there was a 1¼ per cent increase.  I <Col N="1530" /> think myself that if you have a 5 per cent turnover tax at the moment making the price of goods 105, that to me is an increase of less than 1 per cent. Our proposal envisages for the wide range of goods mentioned by the Minister which are not food and are not covered by wholesale tax just under 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would explain to me how when you add one to 105 you get a 1¼ per cent increase I would be happy to hear it. What we propose is an increase fractionally of 1 per cent, .95 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what we have said throughout.  That is not a massive increase in taxation. In relation to the other goods to which the Minister refers where the increase in price is of the order of 7 per cent &mdash;I do not know where he gets 7½ from, but it is not worth quarrelling about the half&mdash;the point here is that these are goods which are purchased in larger quantities by better off people than they are by less well-off people.  Indeed this is true of the range of goods on which turnover tax has been increased.  The Minister should know that, in respect of goods covered by turnover tax but not covered by wholesale tax and excluding food, at the moment in the lower income group 35 per cent of the budget is covered by these items; it is 53 per cent at the top.  If you have a range of goods which feature much more largely in the budgets of rich people than poor and if you increase the tax there and if you reduce the tax on goods like food which feature very much more largely, twice as largely, in the budgets of the poor than the rich, then you are shifting the burden from the poor to the rich.  That is what the Minister is trying to obscure in this debate by his curious talk of caviare and other products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy accept that his proposal takes the tax off caviare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1531" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, off all foodstuffs, and the net effect of this is that you are relieving the budgets of less well-off people to the tune of 45 per cent on food and of the better-off people to the tune of 20 per cent.  That is the difference.  If in fact you increase the price of goods that wealthy people buy, the range of goods the Minister has pointed out, and if you offset this with the price of caviare going down by 5 per cent and the net effect is that rich people pay £50 more on goods generally and £1 less on caviare, I am willing to give them the £1 to get the £50 from them.  It seems a fair deal to me.  As the Minister said, you cannot distinguish between one kind of food and another; you must either reduce tax on all food or no food, and lest somebody should get cheaper caviare the poor shall bloody-well starve and their budget will not be reduced.  That is Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
      <P>Children's allowances were described as a way of channelling aid to the truly needy.  They certainly channel aid to some of the truly needy, but the Minister was very careful not to refer to the examples I gave.  He did not tell us how children's allowances will cope with the problem of a single woman living alone and working and who now on her £12 a week has to pay £1 a week tax, who because she cannot get housing from the corporation has to pay a rent of £5 or £6 a week.  Has she to have some illegitimate children to benefit from the Minister's proposal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under our proposals she would have an advantage. As our proposals do not involve any net change in the burden of taxation, they do not make any more difficult the improvement in children's allowances that is proposed.  Therefore under our proposals the poor, including a woman in that position, including an old age pensioner, can benefit from the cheaper food prices, and the children's allowances can also be paid.  As we are not imposing any net burden on the Exchequer the money is still there <Col N="1532" /> to pay any children's allowances this Government is willing to pay, which is damned little so far.</P>

      <P>One would want to exceed the sound barrier to get through the barrage of the Minister.  The Minister's reference to children's allowances does not offer much hope to the old age pensioner.  Of course, children's allowances should be radically increased, and the Minister will recall, I trust, the Fine Gael proposals in the last election to increase them by two-thirds, which may put the skids under this Government before the next election. It seems to be doing so.  We shall support any proposals to increase children's allowances which are 40 per cent lower than the British and Northern Ireland figure, the British figure being so much lower than anywhere else in Western Europe.  As our proposals envisage no increase in the burden of taxation, can we not simultaneously help the poor whether they be the families of children, a single woman living on her own in private accommodation because this Government will not house her, or an old age pensioner? Can we not help them with cheaper food and increased social benefits, including children's allowances, in the next budget when the big EEC giveaway will be presided over by this or some other Minister?</P>

When the members of this committee met I was asked to present our proposals. I presented them and made it clear we had proposed a particular method of finding the alternative taxation. It did not involve doubling the turnover tax.  I expounded, as I have done in this House this evening, the reason for this, and then I stopped and the Minister intervened.  The Minister proceeded to say there were several ways this could be done.  He said that my proposal was unworkable because it involved this problem of trapping the tax which, he said, was unworkable; and then he proceeded for the first time in this committee to put forward the proposal for doubling the turnover tax, or, to be more precise raising the level of the value-added tax on goods which involved turnover tax at present from 5.26 per cent to 11½ per cent.</P>

      <P>I was somewhat puzzled&mdash;flattered, of course&mdash;but somewhat puzzled, too, by this concern of the Minister to have my opinion.  I was very interested that the Minister should want my opinion, but a little suspicious, perhaps unworthily and therefore the opinion I gave was carefully worded in the circumstances, because it seemed rather an odd procedure for the Minister to ask my view; I said we had considered this proposal but we had rejected it because it was less satisfactory.  Nevertheless, I had done some calculations for the Minister's benefit and, in fact, I said that, as compared with the present system, the incidence of tax under the Minister's proposal would be more favourable to the poor than the present system under which Fianna Fáil tax food.  But we did not accept this system and we proposed our own system.  Now for the Minister to have the effrontery in the papers and here to talk of this being our proposal, knowing we had rejected it when he brought it in, and when he sought our opinion on it, and when our opinion was given in terms of the household budget inquiry, for him now to come along and say it is our proposal carries things to a height of dishonesty which I had not expected from a member of the present Fianna Fáil Government though, indeed, one or two years ago there were people in Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are now clear and Deputy FitzGerald has now out of his own mouth condemned himself in a way that could not be any worse than anything he said about any member of any Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  As I have said to this House, the Minister's proposal, involving the doubling of turnover tax, is one which, although we do not favour it, although we rejected it in the Fine Gael Party, is better than the present Fianna Fáil system for the simple reason I have mentioned already: as far as food is concerned, in the poorest families in the household budget inquiry 45 per <Col N="1536" /> cent of the money was spent on food and 20 per cent in the richest families, whereas in the goods which are subject to turnover tax at present the percentage was 35 per cent in the poorest families and 53 per cent in the richest.</P>
      <P>One does not need to be very good at arithmetic, and some members of the House perhaps are not, to see that, if the Minister's proposals were adopted and if you, in fact, relieved from tax 45 per cent of the budget of the poorest households but increased by 1 per cent taxation on 35 per cent of that budget you helped them; then, in rich households, you leave them perhaps 20 per cent of the budget but tax 1 per cent extra 53 per cent of the budget and they have to pay a bit more.  You do not have to be brilliant to discover that.  The Minister knows perfectly well that is the case and he knows that his proposal, unsatisfactory as it is, defective as it is, and one we would not accept because it is not the best answer, is a proposal which, in fact, would have some beneficial effects.  But it is not the best proposal and we will not support it because we have a solution which is a far preferable one.</P>
      <P>Those are the main points I want to make, except to comment on the fact that the Minister keeps referring to the EEC, but always in very cautious terms.  He does not tell us the &ldquo;EEC will not let us&rdquo;, because he cannot, because Britain is going ahead with zero-rating food.  Is the Minister going to come into this House and say that the British have got away with something which his Government are unable to get for us?  He cannot say that.  He knows perfectly well that if Britain can zero-rate food then so can we.  And so he has to talk, using Sibylline phrases like &ldquo;If we did this we might well have to revert to the present situation.&rdquo;  All kinds of things might well happen in the future but, as far as we are concerned on this side of the House, we are anxious to take the tax off food unless and until some time in the future we are required by the EEC to do otherwise.  At the moment they do not require us.  If they do require us we will face that day when it comes, but we will fight to prevent that day coming, which is something this Government will not do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for the Fine Gael amendment has been put again by Deputy FitzGerald.  I do not propose to comment on it except to say that we would naturally support the removal of tax from food.  We believe it should be done and we will do everything we can to support any effort to have that done.  But, if this cannot be done, then we accept that too.  The Minister himself provided us with the figures on which we worked our amendment to the Bill and our amendment suggests the reduction or the removal of tax from certain essential foodstuffs.  I have referred before to the fact that the Minister admitted himself that the new rate of tax, the value-added tax, would, according to the Revenue Commissioners, on existing taxation produce a surplus of £3.70 million.  We suggest that essential foodstuffs exempt from taxation would cost the Exchequer a loss of £4.11 million.  We feel that a figure of £.41 million is a small sum to charge for the reduction of the cost of living to the really needy.</P>
      <P>The question of the assistance which might be given by way of social welfare benefits, if this could not be done, has been mentioned by the Minister.  One of the things I have been noticing about Minister's particularly when there is a general election or a by-election around the corner, is their invariably hinting vaguely at some increase in social welfare benefits.  Here, once again, we have the old chestnut being thrown out once more.  There was no increase in children's allowances for a long time until just before the last election and then it was suddenly decided it was necessary to increase children's allowances.  It has been suggested again now that children's allowances will be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Chair will permit him, I would like the Minister to detail the proposed increases&mdash;the extent of the increases, when they will be paid and whether they will apply generally; also what other increases in social welfare are proposed for the purpose of compensating those who will have to bear additional taxation.  I am glad that the Minister has returned.  For his benefit I would repeat briefly that we have <Col N="1538" /> suggested to the House a way of having essential foodstuffs exempt at a cost of £41 million additional taxation, that is, in addition to the £3.70 which will be a surplus.  We would support the exemption of all food from the additional net if that would be possible.  If that cannot be done, we have suggested an alternative.  The excuse the Minister has given is not that it cannot be done but that traders have told him that they could not operate what he calls a third level tax. The extraordinary thing is that we have talked to the traders and they have not made any such case to us. I presume these were the same people who talked to the Minister.  What they wanted was one tax rate but they did not suggest that a zero-rate was a tax or that it would cause any difficulty for them.  The Minister did not try to put forward a zero-rating as an insurmountable difficulty.  He said that when pricing goods, traders will have to segregate zero-rated goods and that this would result in a difficulty although it would not involve any calculation of tax.</P>
    <P>The alternative to this, according to the Minister, is an increase in childrens' allowances and other social welfare benefits.  He may remember that at the last sitting of the special committee, when he said there were other ways of dealing with this, I asked him if he was talking of social welfare benefits and he replied &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, that they were his thoughts on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that Deputy Tully brought up this suggestion as being, in his view, the right way to approach the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told me that these were his thoughts on the matter.  Since then he has had some time to consider it and I would ask him now on the eve of the by-election to let us know by how much he proposes to increase children's allowances, whether they will apply generally, when they will apply and also whether he proposes to grant increases in social welfare benefits to the people who will be hit badly by this taxation. From the discussions we had at the special committee I am aware that the Minister appreciates there are <Col N="1539" /> people living solely on the foods in respect of which we have asked for exemption.</P>
      <P>When tabling this amendment we considered whether we should include red meat, white meat, fish, potatoes and household vegetables.  The reason for not including these was that, according to the Revenue Commissioners, to exempt red meat would involve a cost to them of £5.10 million, white meat £.56 million, fish £.47 million, potatoes £.30 million and household vegetables £1.03 million.  It is impossible for anyone to estimate what will be the price of meat and it is our opinion that even the relatively well-off will not be able to buy meat after a while.  We will know who to blame for that.  Nobody knows what is happening in regard to the price of potatoes.  They are now so dear that people are being forced to go back to the bread-and-spread diet.</P>
      <P>The debate to-day was on a good level.  However, I have always opposed late night sittings because for some extraordinary reason even those who are sober, and that includes most Members of the House, begin saying things which they would not say normally. Of course we have the odd drunk who comes in and interrupts the proceedings and causes a certain amount of embarrassment because this House is embarrassed by such people who do not enhance the image of Parliament before the visitors in the gallery.</P>

      <P>Because the Deputy nor no one belonging to him has ever taken a drink, it does not follow that no one else should either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have these people for as long as the public are foolish enough to return them.  Before concluding can the Minister let me have the answers to the questions I have asked?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that these things will have to be done in the context of the budget.  At the special committee I told Deputy Tully what are the problems in relation to the children's allowances scheme as at present constituted. I told him that we are trying to amend it in a way that would direct it more to the people who need it. Knowing that, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot answer his questions precisely, by-election or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that I have been advocating legislation to deal with Lourdes marriages for the past 12 months but that the Taoiseach has told me now that we cannot have the Bill because it will be an intricate one.  The problem of children's allowances has been with us for a long time. This must have been recognised earlier because, as the Minister knows, the Government discontinued giving increases in children's allowances except at election time.  Surely it is not good enough to say now that the problem is very great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said now is exactly what I told the Deputy at the special committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  Therefore, am I to assumt that nothing has been done in the matter although the people concerned will have to bear additional taxation?  It is essential that these increases be granted quickly.  We will support the amendment to remove taxation from all food but in the event of that not being possible we will press our own amendment.  The Minister may hang whatever he wishes around the necks of Fine Gael but he will have difficulty explaining why the Government are not prepared to exclude from VAT such essential foods as bread, butter, margarine, tea, sugar, liquid milk and oranges.</P>
