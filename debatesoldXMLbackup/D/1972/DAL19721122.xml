      <P>I gave notice to the Chair last Thursday of intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 37, referring to the Atkins Report and its repercussions on the textile industry.  The Chair stated that he would communicate with me in the matter.  I have not heard from the Chair.  I am anxious that permission would be granted to me to raise this important matter affecting my constituency.  I would be grateful for some advice and enlightenment.</P>

    <Title>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Kingdom of Belgium) Order, 1972: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Kingdom of Belgium) Order, 1972</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid on the table of Dáil Éireann on the 18th day of January, 1972.</P>
      <P>Copies of the draft orders relating to double taxation relief conventions with Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and Zambia were laid before Dáil Éireann on the dates mentioned in the motions which appear on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conventions have been signed on behalf of the respective Governments. Subsequent to the signing of the <Col N="2178" /> conventions, four White Papers containing the text of the relevant convention were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Before the conventions can enter into force, however, certain steps must first be taken under the laws of the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>In this country the law provides that an arrangement entered into with a foreign Government to afford relief from double taxation in respect of income tax, sur-tax, corporation profits tax and any taxes of a similar character shall have the force of law here if the Irish Government makes an order accordingly.  Prior to the making of such an order, however, a draft of the order must have been laid before Dáil Éireann and a resolution passed approving it.</P>
    <P>Deputies will find the texts of the four conventions scheduled to the draft orders now before the House. For the convenience of Deputies, a separate memorandum has also been circulated with each draft order explaining briefly the effect of the articles in each convention.</P>
    <P>The conventions with Belgium, Italy and Luxembourg will enter into force upon the exchange of instruments of ratification and the Zambian convention will enter into force once it has been given the force of law in both countries.</P>
    <P>The convention with Belgium will have effect in Ireland, as respects income tax and sur-tax, for the year of assessment beginning on 6th April in the year in which the convention is ratified and, as respects corporation profits tax, for any accounting period beginning on or after 1st April of the year in which the convention is ratified. It will be effective in Belgium as respects all tax due at source on income normally credited or payable after 31st December of the year in which the instruments of ratification are exchanged.  It will apply as respects all tax other than tax due at source on income of any accounting period. ending on or after 31st December of the same year.</P>
    <P>I should add that a limited agreement <Col N="2179" /> between Ireland and Belgium was concluded on 4th December, 1967, for the avoidance of double taxation on income derived from the business of sea and air transport.  This agreement will be suspended for the period for which the new convention is in force and relief from double taxation of the income covered by the agreement will be provided under the provisions of Article 8 of the new convention instead.</P>
    <P>The convention with Italy will have effect in Ireland, as respects income tax and sur-tax, for 1967-68 and subsequent years of assessment and, as respects corporation profits tax, for any accounting period beginning on or after 1st April, 1967, and for the unexpired portion of any accounting period current at that date.  It will be effective in Italy for taxable years beginning on or after 1st January, 1967.</P>
    <P>The convention with Luxembourg will have effect in Ireland, as respects income tax and sur-tax, for 1968-69 and subsequent years of assessment and, as respects corporation profits tax, for any accounting period beginning on or after 1st April, 1968, and for the unexpired portion of any accounting period current at that date.  It will be effective in Luxembourg for periods of assessment beginning on or after 1st January, 1968.</P>
    <P>The convention with Zambia will have effect in Ireland, as respects income tax and sur-tax, for 1967-68 and subsequent years of assessment and, as respects corporation profits tax, for any accounting period beginning on or after 1st April, 1967, and for the unexpired portion of any accounting period current at that date.  In Zambia, it will be effective for tax years beginning on or after 1st April, 1967.</P>
    <P>Each of the conventions will remain in force indefinitely but may be terminated by either this country or the other partner country giving the appropriate notice of termination prescribed by the respective convention.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the conventions with Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and Zambia are broadly similar to those <Col N="2180" /> contained in the conventions which this country has concluded with other countries.  In this respect I might mention that conventions are currently in force with Austria, Britain, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States of America. When the conventions that are now before the House come into force, we will then have double taxation relief arrangements with all the existing member States of the European Economic Community and the acceding countries.  The main benefit which this country derives from the conclusion of such arrangements is the removal of a disincentive to the investment of foreign capital in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I recommend that Dáil Éireann approve these draft orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to approve or disapprove because we have not yet received the explanatory memoranda on a number of these documents.  They are still in the process of distribution.  If the Minister wants co-operation we should receive these documents in advance.  Even if they had been distributed when the Minister began speaking, how could anyone get through this material?  This is only one document and there are four. How could one absorb them and consider whether there is anything appropriate to be said in respect of them?  We have not got them.  At the moment I have in front of me the Zambian draft order and explanatory memorandum and the text of the Minister's speech.  I have not seen the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is mistaken.  I understand they were circulated at the time that the draft orders were laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memoranda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>So I understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it reached me.  I am always hesitant in asserting anything negative as regards what reached me but I think if I <Col N="2181" /> had received four times this volume about double taxation I would recall the fact.  I am open to correction if the Minister insists that that is the case, but I certainly do not recall receiving them.  If I had, I should have regarded it as my duty to read them at once as I would assume that they would come within my area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Deputy, I have a similar hesitation to assert positively or negatively but I am informed that this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the reason, this is the first time I have seen these documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy in the position that he does not at the moment have copies of these documents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>All I have at the moment is the Zambia document. There is a pile over there.  I do not know whether we are meant to have these also distributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>These documents were distributed, I understand, originally when the draft orders were laid before the House and the intention was to distribute them again this morning in case Deputies had mislaid them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include the explanatory memoranda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, I do not recall receiving these documents, including the explanatory memoranda at any stage.  If I am incorrect in that I shall be prepared to apologise but the position is that I have one document in front of me at the moment dealing with Zambia which makes the point that a feature of the convention is that matching credit is provided for tax foregone by reason of tax incentives granted to encourage industrial development.  I do not understand why the Minister has distributed the Zambia one&mdash;or perhaps redistributed it&mdash;and does not redistribute the others.  In the absence of the others I do not know whether <Col N="2182" /> this particular feature is included in the other agreements or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not the Minister who distributes documents in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it the Minister's intention to have this redistributed or distributed?  Copies of all four or only the Zambia one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not reached us yet&mdash;I have now received them.  Am I expected to absorb them and speak intelligently about them? Can the Minister tell us&mdash;because I have not time on my feet to read through the documents&mdash;whether the matching credit provision is a feature of all four agreements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On a point of order, there seems to be some confusion and some doubt as to whether certain information has been made available.  Perhaps in the circumstances the Minister would agree to an adjournment of this discussion to enable Deputy FitzGerald to look into the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be obstructive but I am informed that these documents were circulated before and, if they were, it seems a little unreasonable that the House should adjourn at this stage.  Would the House bear with me for a moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the documents, the explanatory memoranda, were made available to the Dáil Office. Whether they were circulated or made available for Deputies to get on demand, I do not know because they passed out of my ken at that stage.  In the circumstances I would not object to a short adjournment if the House so wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On a general point in relation to the same area I found that in respect of another Department documents which are usually circulated to Members in their homes were left in an office here.  The Government might look into this matter and see that these documents are circulated through the post to Deputies and not left where Deputies may not be able to get them or may not think of getting them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is that if I agree to the suggestion, for instance, that they be taken after Questions, I do not know what other Ministers are concerned in other business and they may have so arranged their appointments today that this might be inconvenient for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should think that, in regard to the mass of documentation, any remarks I make when I do have a chance to absorb it will be pretty brief.  I do not think other Ministers will be held up for very long.</P>

    <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the grounds that the appointment of rate collector should be made a function of the Local Appointments Commission under the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 instead of making it merely an executive function under the County Managements Acts.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan</i>)).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters I should like the Minister to clarify. He said that the posts will be filled on the basis of open competition, following advertisements in the public Press. I should like to know what kind of competition is envisaged by the Minister: is it an interview, an oral or a written examination?  Will a certain standard of education be required? The Minister's statement on this point was so vague it was difficult to draw any definite conclusion from it.</P>
      <P>Have the County Managers' Association been consulted about the new job they will get?  I have a feeling this is a hot potato the county managers do not want.  I am sure their association meet from time to time but we do not know what is their attitude to this proposal.  No matter what any Member here may say, the Department of Local Government can put subtle pressure on county managers.  This can be done in different ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was chairman of Kerry County Council in 1967-68 and as such I had certain rights not granted to other councillors.  As chairman I was able to inspect files and read the correspondence from Government Departments and in this way I could find out what was going on behind the scenes.  On one file I was amazed to read a nice letter from the then Minister for Local Government, Mr. Kevin Boland, inquiring about a certain case and asking the manager to make a decision on the matter as early as possible.  That was subtle pressure put on a county <Col N="2185" /> manager and it was done by a Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the procedure of appointment of rate collectors under the new system and see how the machinery will work.  I presume an advertisement will be put in the newspapers. Immediately applicants will rush to the secretary's office to seek application forms; next, the applicants will go to their local councillors and ask them to do what they can to help in their applications.  Human nature being what it is, the councillor in question will say he will do his best for everyone.  As the appointment will refer to a certain locality, it is obvious that the successful applicant will have to be from the locality and will have to have local knowledge.  The day of the competition arrives and all are under starter's orders.  However, before this date arrives the vast majority of the applicants will have asked the political parties to make representations for them.  This is why I was interested to know what kind of competition for the applicants is envisaged.  Is it an oral competition, is it a written competition or what kind of competition is it?</P>
    <P>I presume the type of competition the Minister has in mind is an oral one. That being so, the manager will set up an interview board on which will be staff officers, assistant engineers and others, all from other counties.  That is the usual procedure.  The applicants will come before that board and a decision will be arrived at.  For argument sake, let us say a Mr. Molloy is appointed as rate collector.  Let us say his appointment was on merit.  What will happen when it is announced that such a person got the job?  What interpretation will be put on it?  The first question to be asked will be to which political party the successful applicant belongs.  He could belong to any of the three parties but, for argument sake again, we shall say he is a Fine Gael man.  Immediately&mdash;let the Minister have no doubt about this&mdash;all the councillors from other parties on that council will say that the man got the job through his political connections.</P>
    <P>In that situation the finger of suspicion will be pointed at the manager, no matter who has been <Col N="2186" /> appointed.  This in itself will cause friction in the council chamber.  The Minister went so far in his brief as to say he wanted to take away from councillors the embarrassing situation they have been finding themselves in.  I put it to him that managers will now find themselves in the same position and I should like forcefully to say that it is not fair to the managers to be put in that position.</P>
    <P>Therefore, since the Minister took the trouble to introduce this Bill he should have gone the whole hog and either given the job to the LAC or adopted the system that has been working very successfully in some counties for some time.  I am sure the Minister can find out easily how many counties successfully have been collecting the rates through their own offices. The percentage collection has been very high.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that during the debate some Members, not from my party, took the opportunity to castigate councillors up and down the country, no matter to which party they belonged. I am quite sure that a great many Members of the House were at one time and still are members of local authorities.  I am afraid it has become fashionable of late for certain people to knock public representatives, members of health boards, of harbour authorities and of urban and county councils, no matter what their politics have been.  I should hate to have it go out from this House that we are wont to belittle such public representatives in this chamber.  In my 12 years' experience as a local authority member I can say that 99.99 per cent of councillors have been men of integrity.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the Bill, if the Minister is not coming across favourably to local authorities he has only himself to blame.  A large proportion of the conflict now emerging between county councillors on the one hand and the Custom House and the Minister on the other could be and should be avoided.  Up and down the country we have councils asking the Minister to receive deputations on different projects and it is unfortunate that the Minister, whether because of advice from civil servants or otherwise, has <Col N="2187" /> adopted a closed door attitude&mdash;he will not meet them.  I take this opportunity to ask him to have another look&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Everybody has problems and the day we stop having them we will not be Members of this House. I was pointing out to the Minister that because of poor public relations in his Department he has been in conflict with local authorities.  Perhaps this situation has evolved from decisions which councils have taken and which the Minister came along and reversed.  I know this has nothing to do with the Bill but between refusing to meet deputations and reversing planning decisions things are not going too well between the two groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to go the whole hog.  Half the heat would not have been engendered here if he gave this to the Local Appointments Commission or handed it over to the different councils to collect the rates through their offices.  It has happened in the past, through no fault of the <Col N="2188" /> managers, that when they set up interview boards and appointed men whom they thought would keep their mouths closed, information has come out even before a decision has been reached that a certain person has been appointed by the board.  Previously the officials of, say, Cork County Council and Kerry County Council would hardly ever meet but now with regional development boards, joint sheep-dipping committees, <i>et cetera,</i> there is a coming together and officials are as well known in neighbouring counties as in their own.  I am worried that undue pressure will be put on the officials when they are known to be on a board.  The managers will be in the cockpit now.  They will bear the brunt of the criticism, no matter who is appointed.  The Minister is being unfair to the managers.  I would ask him to have a hard look at my argument. I do not want to be personal but I know that if a rate collector who happens, whether by coincidence or not, to belong to a political party is appointed, God nor man will not convince the councillors in that authority that it was not political patronage.  If the Minister sees the wisdom of my argument, he should have a chat with the county managers and save them the embarrassment of having friction in their local councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister for having taken this step, which is long overdue.  We have now realised the situation in which councillors found themselves down through the years.  I am sure that every county council will thank the Minister for introducing this Bill.  It has taken from them a function which quite often placed them in an embarrassing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Begley said this will put county managers in an impossible position.  I believe that once you are attached and known to be attached to any political party, irrespective of whether an appointment is made by county councillors, county managers or the Local Appointments Commission, somebody will say you had political pull.  I think the Minister has <Col N="2189" /> done the right thing in giving the power to the managers to make these appointments. It might not be feasible for the Local Appointments Commission to appoint a rate collector in Mayo, Sligo, or some other part of rural Ireland. The manager would have to have some knowledge and the man appointed would need to have some knowledge of the particular county.  It might not be taken very well throughout the country if rate collectors were sent from Dublin.  I am sure many people would object to this.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I believe the Minister's decision is the right one and I think that county councils will welcome it.  We have had many embarrassing situations in the past.  I am not on a local authority but I have been canvassed on occasions by people who were looking for appointments in various counties.  This is undesirable. Now appointments can be made on merit and I am sure that is the situation that will obtain from now on.  I should like to put on record that rate collectors who have been appointed in the past have been as efficient even as those we will have appointed under the new system.  It cannot be said that the right people were not appointed.  Even so, there was that little doubt there.  We are removing it now.  Even in county councils where Fianna Fáil did not have a majority we heard the same accusation being made.  I am sure all political parties welcome this Bill.  I know they welcome it to a certain extent but Fine Gael would like the power to be given to the Local Appointments Commission.  I think the Minister has made the right decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the Minister refused to meet deputations.  Since he <Col N="2190" /> took office I have met no Minister who is more willing to meet deputations. I am sure many people will agree with me on that.  I am sure that on this issue any representations made to him were listened to sympathetically but there are certain difficulties to be overcome and I am sure the Minister weighed all the problems very carefully.  I support the Bill.  I am delighted it was brought in.  I know this view will be shared by every county council.  It cannot be said in future that certain groups appoint their own colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced to remove what was commonly considered to be a rather scandalous position in so far as the appointment of rate collectors gave rise to rumours of corruption and graft and regretfully some of these rumours were based on fact.  In so far as the Bill is designed to remove an abuse of that kind in public life it has to be welcomed.  The Minister is kind in his speech when he refers to alleged abuses and malpractices which are reported in newspapers as being part of the system of appointment of rate collectors.</P>
      <P>He is long enough in politics to know that there were abuses and malpractices.  He talks of the scope for canvassing and unreasonable pressures that may be exercised on elected members, and as a member of a local authority I would be pleased to be relieved from these pressures.</P>
      <P>However, in my local authority we took the step of relieving ourselves from these pressures by deciding to discontinue the appointment of rate collectors and arranged for the collection of rates through the office of the county council.  This is something that was open to every local authority in Ireland to do.  Some of them have done it and the reports from the counties where this particular system of collection is in force are encouraging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of rate collectors is valued by many in politics as being a political weapon of some substance. Rate collectors are involved in the revision of electors lists, and this is a duty of high political import.  If persons <Col N="2191" /> are put on the list whose entitlement to be there might be challenged or persons are left off whose entitlement to be on might be undoubted, one can see that a person evilly motivated politically, with the power of altering those lists, could do an immense amount of harm to one party or bring a lot of political benefit to another party.  It is not in the nature of the Fianna Fáil Party willingly to give up the right to have control over the appointment to posts which have that political power.</P>
    <P>The reality of the situation is that the Fianna Fáil Party by and large up and down the country have lost control of the local authorities.  They do not have the power to appoint rate collectors and thereby have the power over something as important as the compiling of the electoral register.  I have not the slightest doubt, having regard to the practice of local politics by the Fianna Fáil Party for many years, that if they had the continued control of the local authorities we would not see this Bill before the House.  It amazes me that the Minister should unblushingly give as one of his reasons for the introduction of this Bill his desire to relieve local councillors from what he calls unreasonable pressures.  If he is motivated in that way in relation to this Bill, this comparatively minor matter, it defies the imagination how he himself can continue in a position where he is subject not merely to unreasonable pressures but to unsustainable pressures, and I refer to his capacity as the arbiter of planning appeals.</P>

      <P>The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  We have <Col N="2192" /> been waiting for this move for a very long time.  In fact, the Minister has now no choice but to make that move. He is coerced into it by reason of the recent High Court decision which compels him to reveal the technical advice given to him in making decisions on planning appeals.  I have not the slightest doubt that it is the existence of that decision which has triggered the Minister's decision to dispose of his power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir, one of the justifications for this Bill is stated to be unreasonable pressures which may be exerted on elected members.  I believe it is apt to draw a comparison between that statement and the position in which the Minister sustains himself.  However, I am glad the Minister is going to share this power.  I would urge him for his own sake and for the sake of the good name of politics generally to share that power without any delay whatever, because there are matters pending which give rise to serious concern if they should fall to be decided by the Minister personally.  The <i>bona fides</i> of his statement will be decided by the speed with which he brings in this new piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not quarrel with the principle behind this Bill, but on this side of the House we are somewhat apprehensive of making the simple change from <Col N="2193" /> a reserve function to an executive function, and the amendment which has been tabled by Deputy Fitzpatrick goes a bit further and makes the appointment not just one to be made on a local basis but to be made by the Local Appointments Commission.  It is still, of course, an executive function in so far as the county manager will be the person to make the appointment.</P>
    <P>The post of rate collector might be considered somewhat of an anachronism in this day and age, because it is a hangover from the old poor law system.  I am inclined to the view that the appointment of collectors as such to go through the countryside collecting is no longer necessary.  I would quote two counties, Westmeath and Cork, as examples of how the collection can be effected in an impersonal yet humane and efficient way without the necessity of appointing local individual collectors.  Some years ago in County Westmeath a vacancy occurred and as a result of an offer made to a councillor&mdash;it was a bribe which was offered to and rejected by him and reported by him to the council&mdash;the council decided that if this scheme could give rise to such offers, then it should not be tolerated.  Therefore, the council took a decision not to appoint any further collectors but to carry out the collection through the office.  I am glad to say that this decision was implemented and is now working efficiently.  In the first year or two after it was implemented the percentage collection was lower than that being achieved by the existing rate collectors, but that position is now rectifying itself and the percentage being achieved by the office is now on a par with that achieved by the rate collectors.  The actual cost of the collection of rates in terms of so much in the £ is less than the cost of collecting by rate collectors.  That was also the experience in County Cork.  There is no reason why, if this system works in two dissimilar counties like Westmeath and Cork, it would not work on a national basis.  As the law stands, a person has to be named as a collector, but there is a vast difference if that person is a permanent official of the local authority or a person brought <Col N="2194" /> in specially to do this job.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty in giving a warrant to an individual who is not an established officer and not subject to the normal checks and restraints that such an officer would be subject to is that the powers conferred by the warrant could be abused.  When the rate collector gets his warrant for the collection of rates he is placed in a very independent position.  He is virtually untouchable and he is master, subject to certain statutory checks as to the level of rate collection achieved, of his own affairs as to how he goes about making his collection.  There can be abuses which can be difficult to uncover and when uncovered, difficult to deal with.</P>
    <P>In Athlone a few years ago there was a rate collector, who is now dead. This collector was being pressed to improve the collection.  He chose as his target for achieving this improvement a local factory which had never been in default and which was the single biggest ratepayer in the town.  To show his contempt for the County Manager in his effort to improve the collection, this factory was subject to the levy of distress in order to improve the collection.  He closed the front gates and brought operations to a standstill.  He was entitled to do this under the powers arising from his warrant. He was suspended by the manager and an action was brought in the High Court arising out of this, and the manager was upheld.  That was in relation to suspension for questions of staff discipline.  The point is that there was nothing illegal in the rate collector's action in attempting to levy distress on this factory.  It highlights the point I am making that the warrant gives unduly wide powers to individuals who, if they care to use them, can do so in a way that could cause hardship to ratepayers.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the individual collector represents a more humane method of collection because, being a local from the area under his charge, he knows the individual circumstances of people.  There is merit in that argument, provided the person appointed is well-disposed.  Equally, collections through an office can be <Col N="2195" /> carried out in just as humane a manner. Our experience in County Westmeath is that this is what happens.  If there is a case of temporary hardship due to a farmer having his premises locked because of brucellosis or TB reactors or some other temporary difficulty altering his financial position and his ability to pay rates, invariably the county council, whether the collection is through an office or by means of a rate collector, give time for payment and no hardship is caused.  Many people prefer the impersonal method of payment and the impersonal way of making payment through the post by postal remittances or cheques.  More and more people in rural Ireland have bank accounts now and find it easy to pay through the office.  Collection through the office, if it is expanded on a county basis would involve officials being placed at strategic points in the county and this could help to overcome any doubts one might have about the system of collection at a central point being efficient.</P>
    <P>Another argument is some times raised against office collection and the compilation of electoral registers and lists of valuations for revision.  These matters have to be attended to.  In rural Ireland they are attended to by the rate collector who gets an extra fee for his work on the electoral register, but nothing extra in relation to the revision of valuations.  I am subject to correction on that point.  Where there is no rate collector, somebody has to be employed to carry out this work.  In County Westmeath this work has to be done by collectors from adjoining areas or by retired collectors in their own areas.  This involves expense.  This adds to the cost of office collection.  It may bring the total above the old cost of collecting through a collector.  There are other officials in the Council who could be used for this purpose.  Home assistance officers could be seconded for this particular purpose on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  If the position is that officials are placed at strategic locations throughout a county they could be put in charge of the revision of the register of electors as part of their job and they could also be instructed to watch revisions of valuations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2196" /> Revision of valuations is very important. It would be a simple matter to put a legal obligation on an occupier to notify the local authority of any change of ownership.  It is expecting too much, possibly, to expect an occupier to notify a local authority of a change of user or an extension of premises which might lead to an upward revision of valuation.  By reason of the requirement to obtain planning permission and the inducement to apply for a grant all extensions to premises come within the knowledge of the council and can be listed for revision. When there is a change of ownership it would be a simple matter legally to make it obligatory on the person succeeding to property by devolution or purchase to notify, as one of the requirements to perfect his title, the local authority that he has succeeded.  This would keep the valuation lists up-to-date. That requirement does not exist at the moment.  Often there is a family transfer which is not known to the rate collector and the valuation might not be revised for many years after the change of ownership.  If that change in ownership were known at the time it took place, or if there was an obligation to make it known to the council, that might have an important effect in regard to the rating liability in so far as one can take an example of a man with three or four holdings who decides to transfer one or two of them to his son.  The groupings are then different. If they are to the advantage of the ratepayer, he will notify the local authority so that he can get the relevant remissions but, if the contrary is the case, he will not notify the local authority and the Central Fund is thereby liable to continue paying a subsidy to the local authority which it might not otherwise have to pay.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of this, the Minister might consider introducing some measure to compel notification by persons of their succession to property. Incidentally, that would remove the requirement of the rate collector in regard to watching valuations for the purpose of having them revised, and would remove one of the arguments against taking the collections away from the individual collectors. Where collections through the office <Col N="2197" /> have been introduced the experience has been that they have worked satisfactorily.  The system is efficient, cheap and humane.  I do not think you can get any more desirable criteria to justify any course of action.</P>
    <P>In default of that I would urge the Minister to consider the Local Appointments Commission for this post.  It is a minor post&mdash;I concede that&mdash;and it is not normally the type of appointment which would be made by the Local Appointments Commission. It is common knowledge that there is a bit of a backlog or a jam in the Local Appointments Commission system and that some appointments are in arrears.  This could be an argument not to send more appointments to the commission but this does not take account of the principle. The answer to that is to revise the system so that it can deal with the demands made on it.</P>
    <P>The other argument is that this is a comparatively minor post.  It may be, but I have already indicated that its political import is immense.  In order to reassure all parties that they will not be subject to any political pressures in spite of this change, the Minister could do a great deal to vouch for his <i>bona fides</i> in making this change by accepting our amendment and having the appointments made through the Local Appointments Commission.  Bearing in mind that more counties might be encouraged to adopt the office collection, the numbers that will fall to be appointed from time to time will decrease, possibly, and the demands made on the Local Appointments Commission will not be serious.  It would have the added benefit of reassuring the public and the politicians and the applicants that the old political taint which so discoloured these appointments in the past has been finally and completely removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with the method of appointing rate collectors as now envisaged by the Minister.  Those of us who have been in public life for any length of time know the <Col N="2198" /> manoeuvring that goes on when a rate collectorship becomes vacant. Whatever motives have prompted the Minister to take this action at this late stage are no affair of mine.  Better late than never.  Those of us who have had any contact with local government know what has been going on down along the line.  Whatever political party could manage to get a majority on a local authority outside of the boroughs immediately mustered their forces and the tug-of-war began between the party in power and the others.  There the trouble started.</P>
      <P>Naturally enough, canvassing went on.  That is a normal, natural thing to do.  When anything has to be decided by a vote, I do not see anything wrong with people asking for support provided the person is qualified in every respect to hold the position.  It is a responsible position, as we all know. We know that backward men and men who erred were appointed and paid the penalty.  Whether it was the result of a bad appointment I do not know.  Other appointments such as appointments as rent collectors in the boroughs are made by the county or city manager.  In his wisdom he brings in independent men from outside his own authority.  This is the normal practice, and a good practice.  The applicants are interviewed and questioned.  The propriety of the questions asked is another thing.  In 99 per cent of the cases the end product has been proved right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen this in relation to appointments in the city I come from. The candidates come from areas from which they are entitled to come and they are interviewed by an interview board.  The secretary makes up the mark given to him by each member of the board and the board then assess the marks in their hotel, or wherever they are, in private.  In assessing each individual they take many things into consideration.  The standard of education is laid down and then there is a general knowledge test and a test on the approach of each applicant to the job.  There have been misfits in different jobs.  I know that rate collectors and rent collectors and gas collectors have been appointed and, instead of <Col N="2199" /> creating a pleasant and helpful atmosphere, some of them made things very awkward, and difficult indeed, when people met with hardship from time to time.</P>
    <P>I am confused about this.  In the appointment of rate collectors prior to this, in the boroughs the county manager had the right to select his interview board and, on the recommendation of that board, the appointment was made.  If similar circumstances are to apply to the county manager I see nothing wrong with that.</P>
    <P>It is time that there was a change from the tug-o-war system that has been going on for far too long.  The rate collector has many responsibilities and there are some collectors who do not pay as much attention as they should to these responsibilities.  I refer in particular to the compilation of the voters' list.  Very often rate collectors sub-let this work to such people as temporary clerks in county councils. The point is that these lists are compiled in a haphazard way with the result that up to the day of polling we find people telephoning us to inquire why they are not on the voters' list although they have been living in a particular area for, perhaps, ten years. I am sure every Deputy has had such experiences.  There must be a more rigid approach on the part of county and city managers in this regard.  The right to vote is a right that people cherish.</P>
    <P>Occasionally, too, one finds a rate collector who is lacking in cooperation. Some rate collectors, in their quest for poundage, harrass people coming up to poundage date. Of course, if they had their ear to the ground they would be aware of such problems as unemployment which would be likely to occur in an area. We overcame that in Limerick city by accepting the rates through the instalment system.  Ratepayers are given a card which they present every week or every month as they wish to pay.  It is only right that there should be such a facility for the ratepayers especially in view of the very high rates at present. <Col N="2200" /> This year, in particular, with the introduction of the new health services, ratepayers will be dealt a bodyblow from which they will not recover for a long time.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that the cheque book was the order of the day regarding the appointment of rate collectors. I have been a local government representative for more than 20 years and I can say that never once have I heard a mention of money in this regard.  However, if there is any man in public life who has had such experience, I say to him that he is not fitted for public life.  It is his duty to expose any such practice and to expose any persons who have been involved in any way in such corruption so that they might be charged accordingly.</P>

      <P>That is the case no longer, thank God, because I realised the futility of trying to save one's soul and being a publican at the same time. In any case, there would be no harm in an appointee being hospitable in that respect.  Socially, it is a good practice. It augurs well for good relations between the rate collector and the public representative and hardly a day passes but we find it necessary to call on rate collectors in order to have something done.  I do not know <Col N="2201" /> whether the Dublin people have this experience.</P>

      <P>Any man who is not prepared to expose any corruption of which he may be aware is not fit to be a public representative.</P>
      <P>While we may make representations to county or city managers from time to time for the waiver or remission of rates in hardship cases, these managers have no immediate function in such matters.  They can do no more than ask a rate collector if he is in a position to comply with a request for waiver or remission.  Such power should be given to city or county managers. There are rate collectors who are never prepared to give in but who will try to ensure that they get their poundage at all costs.  Therefore, I welcome the Bill.  One might say that the area I represent is a &ldquo;dual-purpose&rdquo; area. In the city there is one method of appointment while there is another in the rural area.  I have had more than 20 years' experience of both systems and I am fully behind the procedure that has been adopted by the city managers.  I am glad that the Minister is now conferring on the county managers a similar authority.  From now on the tugging and politics can be left to one side and persons, regardless of whether they belong to the underprivileged, the privileged or over privileged classes, will jump the same fence together.  At long last we will have the right people to do the work but let it be done in a humane way and outside of politics.  This will result in a happy ratepaying community. They will then know exactly that if there is any hardship or anything like that and they are unable to meet the rates immediately they will get favourable consideration.  I want to impress on the Minister the need for leaving the last word with the city or county manager and not just to the rate collector, which is the position at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in his opening speech: &ldquo;As things now stand there is scope for canvassing and <Col N="2202" /> unreasonable pressures may be exerted on the elected members&rdquo;.  This seems to me somewhat naïve because I know of no business or occupation in which there are not pressures.  There is nepotism everywhere.  There are pressures in the business world.  There are pressures in the professions. Auctioneers tout for business.  While architects may not advertise they certainly let their names be known. Even in the Civil Service there are pressures where promotions are concerned. Does the Minister want to wrap county councillors up in cotton wool?  He also said that there are abuses and malpractices in the present system, but the Minister did not spell these out.</P>
      <P>As I say, there are pressures everywhere. The businessmen will have up to 20 agents calling on him and they will tell him that they knew his uncle, or were at school with his son or were friendly with some relative, in order to get business.  It is stupid of the Minister to say he is against canvassing. Do not all of us canvass for votes under our democratic system of election to this House?  Does not the greatest of all canvasses take place in Seanad elections?  What happens there is worse than anything that happens in the case of a rate collector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all agreed the change is necessary, but the change must be for the betterment of the system.  Where we disagree with the Minister is that we think appointments should be made by the Local Appointments Commission rather than by a local body or the manager.  If a man is selecting staff for his own business he will go to whoever is in charge and ask him if he can recommend staff; the board then listens to the recommendations and make up their minds. Very often it is not the man with the degree who will prove to be the best. Nine times out of ten the reverse is the case.  I know men who were in the C class in school and they are now employing men who were in the A class.  The best man should always be picked.  He should not get the appointment just because he supports a particular political party.  No businessman could run his business effectively if he made appointments on that basis. <Col N="2203" /> Politics, religion, the golf club, the rugby club or anything else do not count.  He picks the best man and the better the man he picks the less work he himself will have to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond welcomed the Bill and he lacerated county councillors. They were, apparently, all corrupt. Perhaps he makes an exception of one party.  I do not agree with Deputy Desmond.  I have never been a member of a local authority but I have had many relatives in local authorities. Deputy Desmond is a member of a local authority.  What he recounted were all the bad things that happened. He forgot all the good things.  He exaggerated one side and ignored the other.  A group of employers talking together will discuss bad employees because bad employees hurt them. They forget the good employees.  A group of employees will talk about bad employers and forget the good ones.  There must be a proper balance.  You get good employers and bad employers everywhere.  You get good and bad workers everywhere. You even get good and bad trade union officials.  Trade unions have had their troubles too.</P>
    <P>I believe that the good far outweighs the bad in every sphere of activity.  The suggestion was made that the rates demands could be sent out from an office in the same way as ESB bills are sent out.  I am familiar with Dublin County Council and I know that their rate collectors are appointed by the old system of voting. They have had no failures but, on one occasion, when there was a commission there were no fewer than three failures.  The proposal now is that the city manager rather than the council should make the appointments.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there was something printed in the papers about the abuses.  In regard to the report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, I should like that person to examine his own conscience about this.  As far as I am concerned, in Dublin Corporation the system I have referred to has worked. There may have been failures of which I am not aware.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2204" /> The third system may work.  If the Minister were to agree to it now I would not be that much against it.  It is the system that most businesses would favour, namely, the phasing out of what is there; as persons retire, bring in the system and build up the council staff to collect the money, something like the system in the ESB. One objection I have to it is that in the case of the ESB, for instance, there is no competition, just a red tape situation. The demand is issued and the date for payment is prescribed and the money must be paid.  Where a rate collector is employed he can use his judgment as to the financial position of the ratepayer and can assess his financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's explanation of the reason for the proposed change at this time.  We are told by the Minister that the proposed scheme is better than the system which has been in operation for 40 years, during 30 years of which Fianna Fáil have been in office.  If the Minister were to tell us that he is a Minister and that he is changing the system because it is wrong that there should be political appointments and if every other Minister were to do the same, I would say that that was fair enough, let us get a proper system; let us get a system to be operated by all Departments. Let us have the same thing done in the Office of Public Works. Let us have the same system in Aer Lingus.  In the case of Aer Lingus, recommendations are not allowed but that does not mean that the Minister cannot make recommendations.  A person has only to walk through the gates of Aer Lingus to see the chairmen of Fianna Fáil cumainn in various jobs.</P>
    <P>There is one reason for the proposed change which it is easy to discover.  On the council of county councils there are 36 Fine Gael members, 17 Fianna Fáil members and eight Labour members.  That is the sole reason for the proposed change. Fianna Fáil cannot do now what they could do years ago.  The opportunity for jobbery in that section has gone and, therefore, the system must be changed.  They think they can still do <Col N="2205" /> it in other departments and in that case they hold on to the opportunity for jobbery.  In Aer Lingus you will see chairmen of Fianna Fáil cumainn. The appointments in this House are completely political.  As Deputy Oliver Flanagan said the other day, one ray of hope is that if Fianna Fáil want to change the system now they must be sure they will lose the next local elections.  The Minister looked to the appointments commission and said: &ldquo;I have not enough control over them but the city manager is different; he is a man who has to be in touch with my Department.&rdquo;  I can tell you the politics of the city manager of Dublin.  So can any Deputy from any part of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the old system, having regard to the membership of local authorities at the moment, the chances of Fianna Fáil members being rate-collectors are very small. There is a greater chance of getting Fianna Fáil rate collectors through the city and county managers.  As mentioned by Deputy Cooney and many other Deputies, if the rate collector happens to be a Fianna Fáil supporter there is a great chance of the register being compiled in favour of Fianna Fáil rather than against them.  In my opinion the Minister should copy the straightforward business.  Let a board decide that there is another man required, let the manager or management recommend two or three and let the board decide, taking all things into account.  Let the city manager and the council nominate three persons.  Let the names go forward to the Local Appointments Commission, the commission to select one person.  I see nothing wrong with that system.  That is the system adopted in business. Businessmen are not interested in politics; they are interested in getting the most suitable person.  Let the manager and the council have a say, without voting, in selecting the three names to go forward to the Local Appointments Commission.  This will ensure that the candidate will be from the area in question.  I would like a four years' residence qualification to be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manager has too much work and too much responsibility.  There has been great pressure on councillors. If more work is given to managers the pressures will be increased.  In Dublin there is no council to push the manager.  The manager can do what he likes.  He can meet residents' associations if he likes or he can say he is too busy.  They are now making the manager a director.  At present a manager in any city or county has a tremendous amount of confidential <Col N="2207" /> information and a tremendous amount of work to do.  It is not so much the hours he puts in as the decisions he has to make.  If you add another task, you take up more of his time, worry him more and put too much pressure on him.  Planning permissions and building are all under his control and now it is suggested that we add to this load.  Take the case of Dublin city where the manager must do all these things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard discussion of political approaches and use of political influence and so on but at least it was done openly.  Now you have a manager&mdash;or it may be any man, a member of the appointments committee; I mentioned manager because that is the person mentioned by the Minister&mdash;who will be under this pressure.  Apart from political influence, if it is in a golf club, a rugby club or any other club he will be approached by somebody to do something.  He will have the choice of agreeing or putting the matter out of his mind altogether.  If he gives the job to the son of a friend of his he is accused straight away.  I am pointing out the weakness of one individual; if the matter is put to a board of six or seven, the chance of any one person knowing all of them privately is very small.  I do not have a job going but about ten people approach me about it, whether people in the political sphere or in the sporting sphere.  Friends of your friends will do it and then you have to make your mind up.  If you bend you are accused and you get into <Col N="2208" /> trouble.  A committee of six or seven who sit, no matter how it is comprised, will not be subject to the same pressure as one individual, the manager. Two heads are better than one. Not alone will six or seven people think better than one, but the chance of any person influencing all of them is more remote.</P>
      <P>I should like to see a system which would be fair all around.  I said we favoured a change, if the system could be improved, but we disagree with the manager proposal for various reasons, some of which I have mentioned.  This should be done by an appointments commission, either the present one or another one which would be set up.  The candidate should be living in the area for four years and, above all, he should be an employee of the council concerned. Many Deputies said that this is a very small, part-time job.  In many cases this is true but in Dublin it is a very well-paid job.  Some are paid higher than many officials in the council.</P>

If it is known that rate collectors can be selected only from council staff there will be more and better recruits for that council.  I ask the Minister not to put pressure on a manager.  I was not speaking against any manager but I think this would put too much pressure on any manager, particularly a manager in a council the size of those in Dublin or Cork.  That would be asking too much from one man.  I suggest the matter should be left to the Local Appointments Commission.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  I have only one objection to these appointments being made by the county manager and it is that the county managers are, in fact, public servants.  It would be much better if Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion were adopted and that the appointments be made through the Local Appointments Commission. Despite all the clap-trap we heard yesterday to the effect that the Local Appointments Commission could only advertise jobs for the whole country, that is all nonsense.  They can always provide that candidates must be from a certain area, which may be even part of a county.  They can say that only candidates who are resident in the area will be eligible.  There is no difficulty about this and the talk we heard was all my eye and Betty Martin.  It is typical of what goes on <Col N="2210" /> in this House.  It is very bad for the reputation of the House when this type of argument is made.  Such people as read the records&mdash;and fewer and fewer are reading the records of the debates in the House&mdash;are intelligent and get the message that tomfoolery goes on in the House and that Members will say anything to make a political point.</P>

      <P>I do not say that everything that is done in Dublin is right but I do not know a single rate collector in the city.  I get the demand for my rates through the post and I pay them through the post.  If a rate collector called on me to collect rates I should fall backwards in astonishment. I understand the method of appointment is by promotion from the staff within the corporation, although I do not say this from my own knowledge.  It would be a good idea to adopt that system and this would not prevent suitable people being appointed.  I realise that in the country rate collectors have to call on farmers and that, for instance, local knowledge is very valuable.  Yesterday Deputy Clinton referred to <Col N="2212" />&ldquo;academic knowledge&rdquo;.  Nobody is suggesting rate collectors should be appointed because of their academic knowledge.  In fact, if they were high-class academics they would be quite unsuitable for the post and nobody would dream of appointing them.</P>

      <P>It was said here that appointments can be made on merit.  Of course, we have heard of good rate collectors having been appointed.  That has been the position generally, but a man does not need to be a genius to be a good rate collector. A complaint was made here about the poundage day business and about how the poundage increases rapidly for the small percentage of uncollected rates left at a certain date.  Of course this poundage can be achieved by rate collectors paying in the outstanding amount themselves and then collecting it afterwards as best they can.

      <P>I should prefer, like Deputy Fitzpatrick whose amendment I support, if these appointments were put into the hands of the LAC. It seems to me to be the appropriate way of doing it.  I do not believe in this rubbish we heard about having to advertise posts all over the country. The LAC can do as they like.  A county manager is only an individual but the LAC are composed of three commissioners.  The Minister may say he has some influence in the LAC because one of his officers is a commissioner. That did not exist when I was around but I think the Minister's secretary is usually a member of the commission and, of course, the Ceann Comhairle is the chairman.  However, it is not they who do the job.  It is done by a selection board appointed by them.  They can arrange to have the interviews locally and the posts advertised locally so that only local applicants will be interviewed.  There is do difficulty whatsoever about it.</P>

      <P>I am not in the habit of interrupting Deputies and I should be obliged if Deputies kept silent while I am making my contribution. There are a couple of reasons why I think that it is in order that these appointments should be made by managers as is the case in the matter of rent collectors.  The value of these posts may vary from county to county.  In my county the job is worth £1,000 or £1,100, not a very colossal salary by present day standards.  In Wicklow promotion within the rate collectors' group occurs.  There are a number of rate collectors whose salaries vary and we agreed some years ago to allow a system of promotion. We were in the minority on Wicklow County Council and anyone leaning towards Fianna Fáil had not a hope of promotion.  However, the position has been satisfactory since.  I do not think the county manager in Wicklow is a man who goes out of his <Col N="2216" /> way to create friends.  I never regarded him as being a great supporter of mine, but I accept him as an honest man who does a good job and I am quite happy to leave this to him.  He will be able to set up a board for the appointment of collectors and I think such a board would be a good one.  I cannot understand the attitude of Deputy Fitzpatrick who intervened, as I understand it, to say that a man appointed as county manager could be got at by local politicians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was, for a number of years, a member of a local authority that was divided three ways. Fianna Fáil had six or seven members, Labour had seven or eight and the rest were Fine Gael and the usual Independent pro-Fine Gael.  When we came to appoint a rate collector members of all three parties voted for people who were supporters of theirs.  I never saw Fine Gael in County Wicklow supporting a Fianna Fáil cumann secretary or a cumann chairman, at the beginning anyway.  At the tail-end perhaps.  I must confess that whenever we had to decide we nearly always came down on the side of the Labour nominee.  I do not know why, but we did.  That is not to say that over the years I did not at some stage support a Fine Gael person. There is no point in making the charge that Fianna Fáil are the only party to do this.  Fine Gael would do it, and so would Labour, if they had the majority on the county council.  Maybe it was not too wrong because if what has been said here is true, that the qualification necessary was membership of a Fianna Fáil cumann, I want to say that since I left the council, and due to the colossal amount of work I put into my constituency and organisational work, the Fianna Fáil Party increased its representation on the council from seven to ten.

      <P>Quite recently we had the appointment of a rate collector in County Wicklow.  There were a number of people seeking the support of the Fianna Fáil group.  If this was the qualification there was one person head and shoulders over everybody else as a worker within the Fianna Fáil organisation.  He was a young man with a young family who was prepared to give not a day on polling day but a week if necessary if he was needed by the organisation.  He did not get the support of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In fact, he only got one vote.  Maybe it was because he was supposed to be a friend of mine.</P>

      <P>I do not know what influenced the Minister to bring in this Bill.  It certainly was not anything that happened in County Wicklow.  The only thing that comes to mind is the skulduggery that went on in County Dublin earlier in the year when there was an unholy alliance of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to dish out fine jobs on a tit-for-tat basis.  The little fellows, the Labour fellows, were out.  This is the real danger at local level, that the big parties would come together.  There is no harm, I believe, in one party, if they have the majority, giving the appointments to their own people but it is wrong when you have two parties, like Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, coming together to dish out jobs to their friends because they are not prepared to take the chance of going into the council chamber and putting up their nominees.  They had to make sure the right people got the jobs and the only way they could do that was by having an alliance and sharing them out tit-for-tat.  I have a funny feeling that is what influenced the Minister to bring about this change. Whatever it was I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>The arguments against the system are well known&mdash;a system of appointment by vote of elected members of local councils does not readily lend itself to the detailed procedures and controls which would ensure that selection is made on merit alone.</P>
      <P>This is an implicit condemnation of the role the county councillor has played.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was very quick to his feet last night when Deputy L'Estrange quoted from a national newspaper and very quick to discount reports in a national newspaper.  He was not so quick to give favourable comment in his speech to the county councillors for the role they played in our community down through the years. This is very important.  Our county councillors, city councillors and town councillors play a positive and helpful role throughout our community.  They do many good acts.  They see that many necessary developments are carried out.  I object <Col N="2220" /> to any Minister making little of them in this House which, in effect, is what the Minister's speech does.</P>

      <P>In the appointment of rate collectors there have been agreements between parties down through the years.  This has given rise to adverse comment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill seems to me to be a rushed affair and not well considered.  I wonder what consultations the Minister had with the County Managers' Association and what consideration he has given to adopting the best system of collecting rates.  I am satisfied that he has opted for the wrong system.</P>
      <P>I doubt very much that county managers want the responsibility of appointing rate collectors.  In effect, this Bill will shift the pressure from the county councillors to the county managers. All county managers are subject to pressures from county councillors, local Oireachtas representatives, and ordinary private people.  They cannot live in an isolated igloo.  They have to play golf, or whatever it is.  They have to live in their social circle.  They are subject to pressures.  Perhaps the pressures to which they are subject are far greater than the pressures to which county councillors are subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County managers have many dealings with the Department of Local Government. Practically every penny they <Col N="2222" /> spend has to be sanctioned by the Department.  Such dealings between county managers and the Department must give rise to familiarity.  It is very easy for a message to come down from the Department, perhaps not directly from the Minister's office, but indirectly, concerning an appointment to be made.  I must honestly admit that it has been my experience, as a member of a borough council, that the appointments, in the middle and upper ranges, certainly, to the council or the corporation have always been made on an unbiassed basis.  To that extent I am satisfied with the Minister's Department. This is not the case in relation to other Departments.  To say that the system which is now being proposed will do away with all abuses is an oversimplification.</P>
    <P>The system which the Minister should try to establish or encourage is the system which allows payment of rates directly to the offices of the county councils and city councils.  The burden of rates has become heavy in the past few years because of inflation. A system of payment by instalment is preferable and is in operation in a number of councils.  I would have preferred it if the Minister had introduced a positive incentive for an instalment payment system which would allow payments directly to the county council offices or the city council offices.</P>
    <P>The traditional method of ensuring payment of rates was the stick rather than the carrot.  A person is open to the legal process of the law and the rate collectors have a good deal of independence in respect of whom they can prosecute.  I would suggest that there should be discount for early payment of rates.  This would be a painless system and a very successful system.  This system is established in respect of houses built prior to 1926, I think.  I am not sure of the date.  I am aware that in certain cities, including Waterford, in respect of houses built early in this century or late in the previous century, you can get a discount for payment of rates if they are paid before a certain date.</P>
    <P>I would much prefer this system of discounts to the present system of automatic recourse to law for nonpayment <Col N="2223" /> of rates.  In some local authority areas, if a person is unable to pay rates the manager has the power to remit portion or all of the rates, which is a good system.  The Department deserve credit for allowing the introduction of this system by councils.  I must say that in fairness. I would suggest that in this Bill or, perhaps, at some future date, the Minister should give positive incentives for an instalment system, for payment through the offices, and for discounts for early payment.  This would be a painless way of achieving payment of the rates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is suggesting that a person who is well off and can pay immediately should get a reduction but that a poor person, paying by instalments during the 12 months, would have to pay in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister is not <i>au fait</i> with the facts.  People most likely to pay their rates at times are not the rich people. The poorer sections of the community are inclined to put their rates aside with the result that they pay earlier than would, for instance, business people or rich people.  I am trying to suggest to the Minister a positive system that would eliminate the necessity for appointing new rate collectors.  When this was suggested by another speaker last night, a Fianna Fáil Deputy suggested that we wished to put people out of work.  Of course that is not the intention at all. The method of paying through the office is a simpler method than the present one.  It is necessary that we remove the fear of the law in so far as payment of rates is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other role of the rate collector is the compilation each year of the register of electors.  This could be done by employees of the various councils.  There is a slack time in the <Col N="2224" /> various departments within a county council when this work could be done. In respect of valuation a person comes under the eye of a valuation officer when he makes an application for permission to improve his premises. Therefore, the role of the rate collector in this respect has diminished substantially.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the role of county managers.  My experience in this respect has been good.  I have been treated fairly by county managers and other members of councils with whom I have come in contact have been treated fairly also by them down through the years.  However, some Deputies have alleged that managers are subject to pressures and that Fianna Fáil candidates are successful while Fianna Fáil are in power.  I am not suggesting that any party, my own included, are angles in this respect but we are trying to achieve a system that would eliminate the possibility of any malpractice.  My only reason for contributing to the debate is to suggest to the Minister that rates should be paid through the office by instalments.  I suggest, as a positive way to ensure the payment of rates that there would be a discount system in respect of early payment. This would be of benefit, too, to county councils because most councils are almost perpetually in an overdraft position by reason of the delays by the Department in the payment of road and other grants to which the council are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>At almost one per cent per month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and with the extra charges now being made by the bank it will certainly continue to be 1 per cent per month.  I am surprised that the Minister has endeavoured to make a political point out of my suggestion that a method of discount would achieve a very good result. Such a system would not favour the rich at the expenses of the poor, but it would have an overall benefit in respect of the finances of the councils. Because of inflation and the increasing cost of works and developments in progress in each county area the position <Col N="2225" /> is becoming worse each year. Unless something is done to ensure the early payment of rates and until such time as the Department are prepared to pay grants on time, the system I have suggested, in good faith and without political overtones, would be of great benefit to the councils and would help towards the alleviation of the overdraft burden on them.</P>

      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Brennan, I welcome this Bill and I compliment the Minister on its introduction.  It will have the effect of restricting the collaboration and mismanagement that has gone on in respect of the appointments of rate collectors.</P>
      <P>The method of the appointment of rate collectors in the constituency I represent must have influenced the Minister in no small way in introducing this measure.  Deputy Collins said it is his opinion that the Bill is a rushed affair.  So far as I am aware legislation of this nature has been on the mat for some time, at least for the past three or four years.  The Minister is to be complimented on grasping the nettle firmly and deciding that the abuses that have been practised in respect of these appointments will be tackled while he is in office.  What has gone on in County Dublin regarding the appointment of rate collectors during the past three or four years has encouraged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, six to be specific. Prior to the appointment of these rate collectors, the posts were advertised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2226" /> The number of applications received was 120.  Some of these people had no chance of being appointed, others had a slight chance and some were members of various organisations: some were members of either Fine Gael, Labour or Fianna Fáil and these were the people who were regarded as having the best chance of appointment. These applicants applied in good faith and were under the impression that by applying formally they would be granted an interview on the basis of which they would be considered for appointment.  They understood that their applications would be considered, too, on the basis of their qualifications and having regard to the areas from which they came.  However, that was not the case.  The appointments were made as a result of overnight collaboration between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That agreement was there for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointments were made on the basis of the representation of both these parties on the council.  That, of course, left the Labour Party out in the cold.  It is regrettable that politics should be brought to such a low level.  Some of the Fianna Fáil appointees were not even members of the local cumann or of the organisation at all, but their fathers happened to be the secretaries of local comhairle ceanntair or they had relatives who were very friendly with local councillors.  It was a case of &ldquo;You scratch my back and I will scratch yours&rdquo;.  It is rarely I get up and say newspapers were telling the truth but the articles in <i>The Sunday Press</i> and in the evening papers with regard to this matter were certainly telling the truth in all that they had to say about the appointment of rate collectors at that particular time. That was one scandal that called for nationwide publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that rate collectors should be familiar with the particular areas to which they are appointed, that they should know the people and their financial position and should be able to deal with the farmers.  For the record, three of the individuals <Col N="2227" /> appointed on that occasion did not even know the areas of north or south County Dublin.  None had ever stood in a farmyard except, perhaps, to collect the Christmas turkey by way of bonus.  Nevertheless these were appointed.  Everyone knows Dublin County Council were most embarrassed because of these particular appointments.  The embarrassment was not caused because of the collaboration; it was caused by the fact that only six could be appointed and, six having been appointed, a great many members of the organisation were left out.  Needless to say this must have prompted the Minister, as well as what I mentioned earlier, to bring in this legislation.  I agree the legislation is necessary because, if it does not solve the problem of preventing a split in some Fianna Fáil organisation in County Dublin, it will certainly solve the problem of county councillors being committed to endorsing the appointments made by people who are their seniors on the council and who tell them that their job is to vote for a particular individual for a rate collectorship: you do that or you get out.  The screws are put on and councillors have to do what they are told or get out.</P>
    <P>These individuals will now become redundant and that will not be before its time.  The Minister said quite rightly that the appointment would be made by the manager.  I have not always had co-operation from the manager of either Dublin city or county, but I will say that he will certainly not be &ldquo;got at&rdquo; in the same way as members of the county council were got at.  I am not saying they got cheque book endorsements for their efforts, but they lived well afterwards and their appointees are still trying to make up the ground they lost as a result of their appointments.</P>

It should be brought to the notice of people generally because <Col N="2228" /> public representatives are increasingly getting themselves a very bad name and this, in turn, reflects on local authorities and gets them a very bad name.  Irrespective of their abilities, rate collectors in the past have been appointed because of their existing or promised support of a particular political organisation.  Neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael are without sin in this regard.</P>
      <P>This applies to a very small extent to Labour in County Dublin because they are in a minority and were left out in the cold, and that was unjust; but collaboration in the appointment of the chairman of the county council is something with which I entirely disagree and that disagreement has been responsible in some small measure for having me sitting now on this side of the House.  My senior colleague at the time, who was alleged to have more knowledge and more ability in dealing with local affairs, thought it was right to collaborate with the Fine Gael Party so that the Chair could be switched about and the Labour Party left out in the cold.</P>

      <P>Everyone can speak for himself.  I am glad the Minister has taken the initiative during his term of office, however long or short it may be, to bring in this Bill.  This will save everybody embarrassment.  It will ensure that justice is done.  Some people have alleged that they might not have faith in the managers.  That causes me to wonder somewhat because the majority of the managers were appointed by the Local Appointments Commissions.  Everyone of them was scrutinised and interviewed and the scrutiny was both searching and strenuous.  If people have not faith in this type of individual they will not have faith in a county council.  A person who has no voice in the matter could not give a fair judgement in the appointment of a rate collector.</P>
      <P>I have every faith in county managers.  I do not say that every single one of them has committed the same offences as are associated with councillors regarding the appointment of rate collectors.  Managers are responsible for their deeds whereas the 15 or 16 members on a council are individually responsible for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's suggestion that the appointment should be made by the county manager gets my full endorsement. I say to him, thank Heavens he has brought in this Bill and had the initiative to see that the type of collaboration which has gone on can be stopped and I say also, thank Heavens <Col N="2230" /> that Dublin County Council and the Fianna Fáil organisation and the Fine Gael organisation in Dublin County Council will not have to come together again to appoint rate collectors <i>pro rata</i> on a party basis.  We can look forward to the appointment of rate collectors on the basis of ability and local knowledge and can be assured that they have been fairly selected and not by way of political persuasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The measure before the House deals with the system of collecting rates.  Changes are suggested. I have been a member of a local authority for many years and I have a view with regard to the collection of rates which I have firmly held for more than 20 years.  The system that I favour has been in operation in County Cork and has been working efficiently and well.  It is the system of office collection. Members of the staff of the authority collect the rates.  I am very much in favour of that system.  That is not to say that I in any way reflect on rate collectors as a body.  They had a difficult job to perform in years gone by when money was scarce and rate collection was not a very popular job. They had to press for payment by persons who were experiencing difficulty in meeting their rate commitments. The rate collectors generally did a reasonably good job and are doing it but in my view the need for that system no longer exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed in Cork almost 20 years ago that the rates would be collected by the office.  That agreement was reached on the basis that it would be a cheaper method and that the approach to rate collection would be uniform.  Naturally, individual collectors differed in their methods of collection whereas a central collecting body usually can bring about uniformity of approach.  That system was continued for a number of years and then, due to heavy pressures on members of the council, some seven or eight years ago the system was changed to allow of four appointments being made.  At that time I opposed the change as vehemently as possible.  I have no fault to find with the authority's right to make that decision.  The majority on the council <Col N="2231" /> were legally entitled to come to that decision and to make appointments in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>My view on this Bill is that it should not be a question of changing the system of appointments; it should be a question of changing the system of collection.  If I had my way I would strongly favour the system of collection through the office and make that applicable to every local authority. That would not interfere with existing rate collectors.  The present system could be phased out according as rate collectors would retire.  I have made myself clear and the records of Cork County Council indicate what my view has been.  Having said all that, may I say that I am not at all satisfied with what is embodied in the Minister's statement or with his hypothesis.  As Simon Pure he states that everything will be fair and impartial and that Fianna Fáil want to appoint people on merit.  Everybody knows that Fianna Fáil do not believe in appointing people on merit.  The main qualification Fianna Fáil seek in the matter of appointments is political allegiance.  It is hypocrisy for the Minister to state as he did:</P>
    <P>It is, as I have said, my view that appointments of county rate collectors should be made strictly on the basis of merit and I fell the time is now opportune to make the change and that it should be made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I will deal with that statement in a few moments.  Of course, I am well aware of the Government's continuing efforts to whittle away the powers of locally elected members of councils.  Members of councils are elected in the same way as Members of this House are elected, by the vote of the electorate, and can be removed from office periodically when the people get the opportunity to remove them.  That is entirely different from the case of executive staffs who cannot be removed from office except in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he would like to see appointments made on merit. How many more appointments would <Col N="2232" /> he like to see on merit?  Is the rule that is to be applied to rate collectors to be applied generally in other areas?  As a Deputy asked, are the Judiciary to be appointed on merit in future?  Are State prosecutors to be appointed on merit?  Are State solicitors to be appointed on merit?  Are postmasters, sub-postmasters and post office staff generally to be appointed on merit? These appointments, are more important than the appointments of rate collectors.  Are Fianna Fáil candidates in future to stop saying and implying when canvassing votes that if the voter votes for them they may be able to get help them, they may be able to get Johnny or Mary a job?  Will they stop saying: &ldquo;If you join the cumann you will have a better chance of getting a grant&rdquo;?  The manner in which grants are disbursed at present is scandalous. It is a well known fact that preferential treatment is given to supporters of the Government.  There is this kind of a Simon Pure attitude in regard to this group of appointments of rate collectors. Who will answer that question? I dislike mentioning these facts here but a possible answer is that the Government are entitled to have certain gifts to bestow on their friends, certain rights in making appointments. Under the Constituation they say they must appoint the Judiciary but there is nothing to preclude the Government from setting up a commission, in the same way as county managers are allegedly appointed by county councils, and getting the commission to recommend a particular nominee for a post. The Government's say would then be purely formal.  In Ireland we do not act impartially and at present appointments to very important posts in different fields are not made impartially over a wide area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have made my point reasonably well.  In regard to the system which applies here we got great insight into what happens from Deputy Foley.  I do not want to reflect on councillors in any county because I could not substantiate any charge from my own personal knowledge but, speaking as a Labour Member, I think the Deputy summed up our position reasonably well when he said that Labour was out in the cold as regards appointments under the present system.  That is generally correct: few Labour men can hope to get appointments by votes of councils when we have not sufficient representation, but that is not my reason for criticising the system that exists.  If the majority of members of a council decide to act within the law I respect their decision.  That is what the Dáil are doing.  A slight majority of elected Members of the House gave Fianna Fáil preference in the last election and they are acting accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the rate collectors I do not want to repeat how I think rates should be collected.  I am not in favour of this proposal.  However, I do not want to have this Simon Pure attitude that because Fianna Fáil have lost in the last election control of a number of councils business is not now so good, and possibly in councils where they hold control it is difficult to satisfy the contenders in their own party for selection, that the present system has outlived its usefulness and therefore should be abolished.  Deputy Foley told us something about Dublin County Council and he was probably correct in his appraisal of what happened there.  I accept the appointments were made by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael at meetings held prior to the ordinary council meeting where such appointments were to be determined. Significance should be placed on Deputy Foley's comments; he is a long standing member of the Fianna Fáil Party and he has told us that, when they were unable because of lack of votes to get their own men nominated in Dublin, his former senior colleague <Col N="2234" /> made overtures to Fine Gael and between them they scooped the pool so that others, including anybody with Labour affiliations, seemingly had little or no chance.</P>
    <P>However, these appointments were made in the open; people knew what was happening.  If the councillors were wrong, people know what happened and if the people of Dublin county dislike the manner in which their councillors are acting they will have an opportunity, possibly in the next 12 months, of saying so through the ballot boxes and of removing them from office.  I make this statement on the remarks of Deputy Foley that they were &ldquo;got at&rdquo;.  How does one define &ldquo;got at&rdquo;?  Is it not the normal practice when seeking election to this House that we try to pressurise people into voting for us and our parties, that we go out and ask them to do so and indicate that we can do a better job than the other parties?  Is that not normal procedure in a democracy? Where appointments are made, as rate collecting appointments were made up to now on a voting system, there is nothing wrong in an individual applicant trying to further his application.  I understand that serious allegations are being made here that this was done by understand methods.  I believe when such allegations are made by a Member of the House in a privileged position he should elaborate and if, as alleged, corruption existed he should expose it.</P>
    <P>The question of an alternative system arises.  We all know what happens at a council meeting but nobody knows, perhaps, what would happen at the alternative meeting suggested by the Minister in this Bill.  Are we to assume that all appointments are made fairly and impartially, that everything is above board in all the local authorities and in State appointments and that interview boards act with absolute impartiality? I have spent 25 years in public life but I do not make all those assumptions.  Even assuming that everything was not satisfactory in the appointment of rate collectors, the same could be said about other systems of appointment.  There are men of the highest integrity in the public service <Col N="2235" /> and I have no doubt they discharge their duty admirably and impartially, but that may not be the position in all cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated: &ldquo;As things now stand there is scope for canvassing and unreasonable pressures may be exerted on elected members.&rdquo;  I remember when Fianna Fáil tried to get back into power in 1951 and it could be stated that then they exerted pressure. They put pressure&mdash;I do not know if it was reasonable or unreasonable&mdash;on the four Independent Members who elected them in 1951.  It was the joke of the country.  Everyone here saw the poor Members being followed around the place and we all knew that the Government were formed as a result of pressure.  When turnover tax was introduced pressure was used.  Do Fianna Fáil exert undesirable pressures?  Coming from the Government, the language used in this instance is hypocritical.</P>
    <P>Is this a new game in the Dáil?  Will the Government make changes with regard to other appointments?  The Government dislike the elected members of local authorities having the right to make appointments.  Will the Government hand over their rights to a commission? The Government are notorious for handing over matters to commissions, not only to Irish commissions but to foreign ones.  We had McKinsey telling us how local government should be restructured; we asked a group called Markpress to tell us how to advertise Ireland; there was a commission to report on the pay structure of Members of this House and others outside&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is this the forerunner of a changed structure so far as appointments generally are concerned? Are we to assume that in the legal field there will be a change? Will it be necessary to be a member of a cumann, or possibly a Deputy, as happened in other instances, in order to get a senior appointment on the bench or as a State solicitor?  We are told that with regard to the appointment of rate collectors the system was rotten and it was time to change it.  It is implied in the Minister's statement that it is the only system that needs change.  Will an independent authority examine the claims of people who require development grants and will there be an impartial system to determine whether their application will be approved?  Will an impartial system be set up to determine other public and Government appointments?</P>
      <P>As the Chair seems to be under the impression that I am extending the scope of the debate, I do not propose to dwell on the matter further as we will have other opportunties to do this.  However, I resent the hyprocrisy of the statement made by the Minister. The Government are trying to pretend they are not guilty and that everything is fair and above-board in State affairs.  It is no pleasure for me or for any Member to cast aspersions on public administration but this is the place to give viewpoints and to make a factual appraisal of the situation.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister but I realise that appeals from the Opposition to the Government are never heard or heeded.  However, many years after an appeal is made occasionally it is acted on.  Can the Minister tell me if it is possible to have rates throughout the country collected through the offices?  I see that Deputy Burke has returned.  It is regrettable he was not here earlier because we had a glowing account from a junior colleague of his of how the Deputy does his job on the Dublin County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to cast any aspersions <Col N="2237" /> on the collectors who have been doing their job.  They have a difficult job to do but they carry it out admirably and efficiently.  However, it has been my belief that office collection would ensure more uniformity and this would be an advantage.  Different methods are applied by different collectors; some are more lenient than others but on the whole it would be preferable to have uniformity in the method of collection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that Fianna Fáil intend to change the system of appointment of rate collectors but surely we cannot be blamed on this side of the House if we begin to wonder and ask why this belated conversion of Fianna Fáil.  Down through the years Fianna Fáil have held sway on a great many of our county councils.  They have taken full advantage of this in appointing rate collectors.  There are different systems which can be employed for the collection of rates.  We could continue to use the present system which I think nobody advocates.  If there is to be a change it could be arranged that the city manager would appoint a commission to appoint rate collectors as envisaged in the Minister's proposal.  We could also have the system of the Local Appointments Commission making the appointments, as suggested by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick.  I think this would prove to be a better and a fairer system.  I cannot at all agree with the suggestion in the Minister's speech that while some of the major appointments should be made by the Local Appointments Commission smaller appointments could not very effectively be made by that commission because of their local character and the necessity of having local knowledge.  This could easily be overcome by having a condition of residence over a number of years and making it necessary that the applicants should furnish particulars of their knowledge of the area.  This is not of great magnitude and could easily be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another method which could be adopted is that of direct payment to <Col N="2238" /> the office.  The Minister must concede it is a compliment to certain councils where Fianna Fáil have not got a majority but other parties have the majority and could appoint rate collectors of their own choice, if they so wished, that they have refrained from doing this.  In Cork they could appoint rate collectors but they have retained the system of collecting rates through the office.  This has also happened in Counties Westmeath and Kerry.  The Minister will agree that the councillors in those areas have not tried to take advantage of their superior numbers over Fianna Fáil. They have not tried to select their own people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foley was very critical of recent happenings in Dublin County Council in connection with the appointment of rate collectors.  I do not intend to go deeply into that but on a previous occasion members of Dublin County Council, the majority of them being against the Fianna Fáil Party, appointed a well-known and prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party as rate collector.  I am not saying he was not entitled to be appointed if he was the best man but they did not take advantage of their superior numbers to get the position for themselves.</P>
    <P>I was beginning to think that there was some hope of Fianna Fáil doing the right thing in this House when they announced that after long agitation they had decided to change the method of planning appeals to the Minister. For many years it had been in the hands of the Minister himself but now they had agreed that it should be subject to a commission.  In this Bill they seem to be doing quite the reverse and the reverse of what Deputy Fitzpatrick had asked them to do.  They are vesting in one man the power to appoint rate collectors.  It would be fairer to have a commission and it would not be placing complete responsibility on or giving full power to one individual.  If this plan envisaged by the Minister would result in a saving there might be some merit in it.</P>
    <P>He has not indicated to us that he has given any consideration to the method of collecting rates through the <Col N="2239" /> offices.  Several Deputies have stated that they have practical experience of having rates collected through the offices in their counties as effectively as if rate collectors were employed, and at a much cheaper rate.  Surely in this day and age with rising costs, the Minister should give serious consideration to this matter.  If rates can be collected as effectively and at a cheaper rate, surely he should try to save even a small sum.</P>
    <P>I do not know that the system envisaged by the Minister, whereby the manager will appoint a commission to select rate collectors, will take local knowledge into account.  In Dublin city, rate collectors are appointed from the existing staff.  I do not think one of the conditions is that whatever member of the staff is being appointed must have a thorough knowledge of the area to which he is being appointed.  They are doing their job very effectively and very well.  We have two systems in Dublin city and Dublin county.  Deputy Burke has experience of both the city and the county.  He has been a member of both local authorities and I think he will agree that the rate collectors in Dublin county are doing an equally good job. While I do not agree with the method of selection employed heretofore, and while it probably led to certain mal-practices, I do not think it is as bad as some people would lead you to believe.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that before he decided to bring in this Bill he consulted with many people, including councillors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us who the people were and who the councillors were.  Was this solely confined to councillors of one party, or did he get views from councillors of different parties?  What type of people were in consultation with him?  Were they members of his own party, or members of the general public, or members of other political parties?  The Minister should be a little more specific about this and let us know what people and what councillors submitted views to him.</P>
      <P>In his anxiety to agree with the method envisaged by the Minister for collecting the rates, Deputy Foley made an excellent case when he said the county manager was the ideal person because he had been examined and appointed by the Local Appointments Commission and that the Local Appointments Commission, having inquired into every aspect of his career, had found that he was a fit and proper person.  If the Local Appointments Commission, in Deputy Foley's words, succeeded in getting the very best person as county manager, surely they are quite capable of finding the most suitable person to be a rate collector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister is doing himself any good by advocating that this power should be vested in the city or county manager.  Because of the structure of local authorities, practically everything done by a local authority is subject to the Minister's sanction.  Therefore, the Minister and the manager must be in close consultation. They must meet regularly.  People cannot be blamed if they say at times that the Minister is influencing the city or county manager, or that the managers are influenced by the Minister. Many of those suspicions could be removed from people's minds.  If there is in a system the slightest taint of suspicion, to use a term employed by the Taoiseach, that system should not be used.  I am sure the Minister will admit that there is just as good a <Col N="2241" /> chance of getting the right person selected as a rate collector by allowing the Local Appointments Commission to appoint him, as there is by allowing the city or county manager to make the appointment.  This would remove any suspicion of undue influence being used.</P>
    <P>For many years local authorities have been jealous of their powers being taken away from them and extra powers being granted to the managers. The fact that the Minister is taking away power from elected representatives on the one hand is bad enough, but at the same time he is granting extra powers to the managers, thereby widening the gap in respect of the extent of power vested in the elected representatives and that vested in the managers.  This will not lead to harmonious relationships between the elected representatives and the managers. This measure will not result in any saving in expense and will not make for better relations between managers and elected representatives and the suggestion might be made that undue influence could be used by the Minister or by his Department in respect of a manager appointing a person whom he considered suited best for the post.  Therefore, this measure is not solving any problem. Rather, it will create extra problems.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When the appointments to which Deputy Foley referred were made I was in hospital suffering from double pneumonia.  However, I must say that all those men on Dublin County Council who were associated with the appointments are honourable men and if there was an agreement reached between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, it was reached honourably.  Obviously, I could not have been present at the meeting when the decisions were made <Col N="2242" /> but Mr. Joseph MacAnthony who was rejected twice by the electorate of County Dublin made much play of that meeting and he blackguarded me in every way possible.  The electorate of County Dublin have been returning me to this House for almost 29 years.</P>
    <P>At that meeting of the county council the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael members voted for three appointments on each side.  There was no influence one way or the other.

      <P>I agree and there was much pressure on Deputies during that period.  So far as Dublin County Council are concerned it is very wrong for anyone to imply that there was anything wrong or that there was any reward in respect of any appointments.  I defend categorically all the members of the council, regardless of which party they represent.  Any member that has ever been appointed to Dublin County Council, and I include in that members who were appointed long before my time there, have done a good job.  The fact that a person might have many letters after his name would not convince me in the least that he would make a good rate collector.  Somebody who would have the right approach and who would be prepared to speak to the people in a humane way would be the best person for the job, who will say to Johnny Murphy, or whoever it may be: &ldquo;Give me what you can.  Do what you can for me.  I will not injure you.&rdquo;  That is the type of human being we have appointed.  Going back 40 years in Dublin County Council I can safely say that no appointee has ever let us down.  A few appointed by another agency did let us down.  The man who is appointed by the county council is always a good man, a man who is loyal to and commands the loyalty of those who vote for him.  All our rate collectors in County Dublin are men of the highest integrity.  As far as the councillors are concerned, I have yet to meet the man who would give his vote for any consideration other than loyalty to his own party and to the person for whom he votes.  He will not allow himself to be influenced by somebody whom the people twice <Col N="2244" /> rejected.  I am sorry to have to say that here, but I have to say it because of the allegations made by a man who was once a colleague of mine but is now an Independent.</P>

I am sorry I have not got a copy of Deputy Foley's speech so that I could deal with it as drastically as it deserves, but there will be another day on which I will do that.  Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I do not approve of this House being used to the disadvantage of anybody else, and I will always defend the people I work with, irrespective of their political affiliations.  I respect them as decent, honourable men.  That is what my colleagues in Dublin County Council are.  Not one would do a dishonourable act for reward.  I say that in all seriousness.</P>
      <P>Dublin County Council has never acted dishonourably and it is because they refused to act dishonourably that we have this Bill before the House today.  The Bill will remove a great deal of responsibility from us.  We appointed six rate collectors in County Dublin.  At the time they were appointed I was ill, but I know that the appointments were made honourably. My only regret was that we could not appoint all the applicants. We could appoint only three and, from that point of view, we lost out politically. But the decision was an honourable one.  There was no promise of reward to anyone.  They were appointed because they were the best.  Even though I was not there I take full responsibility with my colleagues for these appointments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has recommended an alternative way out.  I have to support my colleague, the Minister for Local Government, in this.</P>

      <P>I had great respect for Deputy Hussey always.  This Bill is an open confession by the Minister that the time has come when jobs for the boys are running out and the boys are now running out of the party because there are not enough jobs to go around. I can remember a caucus meeting when the present Minister was a county councillor.  The councillors trailed in through the door at 25 minutes past three like a bunch of sheep; they had been brainwashed and told exactly what they had to do.  It is as a result of that that we have this Bill before the House.  We have reached the stage at which Fianna Fáil are losing out, especially in my county.  We put people forward who had never been members of any party; we put them forward because they were men fit for the job.  What happened?  They got nowhere.  But I knew Fianna Fáil to put some hacks forward who subsequently turned out utterly unfit for the job.</P>

      <P>It may be, but some are more equal than others.  When we, in my party, discovered what had happened we brought a High Court action and, in spite of the Minister at the time, we got the appointment for the right candidate.  The office method collection has been mentioned.  There are certain aspects of that method about which I am not satisfied.  A rate collector has other duties to perform, such as the compilation of the register. I do not know how the office method would work in that respect.  I have known how it has worked over the years.  I have known some great Fine Gael supporters ticked off the register by the appointees of Fianna Fáil. Electors have had a vote for years and have not left their address and have found that their names were not on the register.  The &ldquo;boys&rdquo; were working on the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the <Col N="2246" /> county managers should make the appointments.  I do not think county managers want this kind of work. There are county managers who support Fianna Fáil and there are county managers who support Fine Gael. Irrespective of what Government are in power, county managers should not be in the position that pressure could be put on them in regard to appointments. The Local Appointments Commission is the proper body to make the appointments.</P>
    <P>I have witnessed over a long period the appointment of rate collectors in Galway.  I have seen members of the council walking into the chamber like lads going into court to be charged with something.  One man would be told to propose a candidate and another would be told to second the motion.  There would be no use in proposing a candidate.  The steamroller was used.  I have seen some of the great henchmen of Fianna Fáil being appointed.  I would remind the Minister that my people were on that county council long before he put shoes on or was out of nappies.  I know the history.  Deputy Hussey saw them come in there, like they did on the last day on the Oranmore question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy's question of 19th January last, the question of the future status and staffing of this hospital is one for consideration in the context of the new organisational structure of the health services which now involves the Western Health Board, Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Galway Regional Hospital Board and the County Advisory Health Committee.  As the Regional Hospital Board and Comhairle na nOspidéal have only recently been established it will be some time yet before they can formulate well founded views based on detailed study of the issues involved.</P>
      <P>It would not, in the circumstances, be appropriate for me to make a definitive statement at this stage as to the future role of the hospital.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister state whether it is the Cabinet's decision to upgrade this hospital?

Again, at a Fianna Fáil meeting in October in Roscommon he stated that it was to be upgraded.</P>

These discussions are still in progress but the stage has not yet been reached at which a decision can be taken regarding the future of St. Catherine's.

      <P>and <b>Mr. Governey</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will introduce legislation in line with that of all the EEC countries to control the sale of medicines, especially in the light of public anxiety about the problem of drug-taking; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the question relates to control of the retail sale of medicines.</P>
      <P>A draft directive on the harmonisation of national laws in this field within the EEC is at present under consideration by the member states and the acceding countries.  However, until the terms of the directive have been finally agreed it would be premature to anticipate the changes which may be necessary in the existing statutory controls on the sale of medicines in this country to enable the directive to be complied with.</P>
      <P>At present in this country the retail sale of a wide range of medicines is restricted to qualified persons, such as pharmaceutical chemists.  The statutory basis for these controls is contained in various enactments&mdash;The Poisons Acts, The Dangerous Drugs Act and The Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1966, made under the Health Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, apart from the desirability of bringing our medicines legislation into line with EEC thinking, there is great public concern about the unrestricted sale of an enormous range of non-scheduled medical preparations and that this has grave implications particularly in the light of the public concern about drug taking?  Would the Minister not agree that it is a matter of extreme urgency to initiate the necessary legislation without further delay?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not relate to this question at all.  The next Bill deals with penalties for possession of drugs.  We are already in advance of European countries in regard to the control of the issue of dangerous drugs in that, I think, we are still the only country in Europe that has forbidden the sale of amphetamines except through one hospital authority. Heroin and all the other drugs are controlled in a manner that is as strict as that on the Continent.</P>

      <P>As the reply to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the cost of maintence and treatment varies considerably as between different categories of hospital, and that it would not be practicable to calculate satisfactorily the separate average cost figures for beds in public wards and private rooms.</P>
      <P>I explained, in some detail, the reasons for increasing hospital costs in the Adjournment debate on 4th May last.  In brief, these are: increases in rates of remuneration; increases in numbers of staff employed either as a result of reduction in staff working hours or improved facilities for patients; greater volume of services due to continuing growth in the numbers seeking medical care in hospitals, and increasing commodity costs.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>The figures shown are the average weekly costs per bed in representative groups of hospitals in the categories indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that serious discrepancies have been found in the statistical returns of tourism traffic published by Bord Fáilte when compared with similar statistics produced by the Central Statistics Office; and, if so, whether he proposes to take any action on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The official annual estimates for visits and revenue from tourist traffic are prepared by the Central Statistics Office.  The statistics for any particular year are not generally available until about midway through the following year.  Bord Fáilte prepares its own annual estimates <Col N="2270" /> of numbers and expenditure by visitors and these are used until such time as the official figures become available.</P>
      <P>While there are differences from time to time between the official and Bord Fáilte estimates, I am not aware of any discrepancies between the two sets of figures which need be a source of concern.  All countries experience obstacles and difficulties in interpreting tourism data.  Nevertheless, one of the conclusions of a recently published study was that these problems are less severe in the case of Irish tourist statistics than in the case of most other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it looks very bad in the eyes of the public, and is very damaging to the credibility of Bord Fáilte, to have their official tourist traffic figures publicly questioned by a statistician as happened recently? Grave doubt has been thrown on the validity of the published figures.  In view of this, would the Minister explore the possibility of having a more credible or acceptable method of compiling these statistics devised?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>To put the matter into perspective, this is an international problem.  It is a matter of concern in every country, not just in Ireland.  Mr. John O'Hagan, a very well-known statistician, read a paper recently&mdash;I think this is what the Deputy was referring to&mdash;to the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland in which he highlighted what needs to be done here.  At the moment, in the light of his paper, we are examining how we can harmonise more closely the Central Statistics Office figures and the Bord Fáilte figures.  I want to emphasise what I said in my initial reply.  On our examination of this sort of problem in every country we found that there is less of a difference as regards Ireland than there is in most other countries in the world.  It certainly needs examination. There is no question about that.</P>

There is a difficulty in any sort of open country in which there is freedom of travel in defining who is a tourist and who is not a tourist.  This is really the basis of the problem.  It is being examined.  It is a very real problem.  There is no question about that.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's contention that the Government's existing tourism policy is no longer adequate. The Government's policy and its high level of financial support have been considerable factors in expanding the tourist industry to its present level of importance.  In the current year, the Government is providing £8.35 million for the financing of Bord Fáilte's activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much aware of and concerned about the industry's current problems.  These difficulties are mainly attributable to the impact of the Northern Ireland situation on our markets.  I am not satisfied that any change in policy at this juncture would improve matters; any change could, by undermining present efforts, do <Col N="2273" /> more harm than good.

      <P>As the House is aware, negotiations on the landing rights issue have been taking place over the past year but no agreement has been reached.

President Nixon has undertaken to give the matter his personal attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The airlines are very conscious of the need to keep fares as low as possible so as to attract additional business for their own services and additional tourist traffic for the country.  In all cases the economics of operation must be taken into account and the fares structures must be related to costs and commitments.  In addition, there are international commitments which cannot be ignored.  If for reasons beyond control costs continue to rise, and that is still the current position, I must be prepared to authorise reasonable fares increases so that the airlines may continue to provide the services necessary to meet public demand.</P>
      <P>I have not yet received proposals from Aer Lingus for cross-Channel fare levels in the year commencing 1st April, 1973.  If and when I receive such proposals I will deal with them in the light of the considerations I have just mentioned.</P>

      <P>There is no specific assistance payable by my Department to unmarried mothers, as a class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, those of them who are insured persons and who fulfil the usual conditions are entitled to payment of increases in respect of children in addition to their personal rates of benefits.  An unmarried mother who has a dependent <Col N="2279" /> child or children living with her is also entitled to children's allowances.</P>
    <P>Like any person who is in need, an unmarried mother can have recourse to home assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 26 to 28 inclusive together.</P>
      <P>Ireland will be eligible for assistance from the European Social Fund as from the date of accession.  It will be necessary for this country, as for each other member country, to make applications for assistance from the fund.  The extent to which we can benefit from the fund will depend on the extent to which we have projects which conform to the regulations governing the operation of the fund.</P>
      <P>In general, schemes in respect of which assistance is applied for will have to form part of an overall plan related to a region, a branch of economic activity or a group of undertakings operating within the same field.  In general also, assistance will amount to 50 per cent of public expenditure on training, retraining and resettlement.  There are special provisions in the case of schemes for the rehabilitation of handicapped workers.</P>
      <P>The Council of Ministers of the EEC have recently taken a decision, in principle, on what they call &ldquo;priority interventions&rdquo; of the Social Fund in the area of textiles.  The relevant documents, when available in final form, will show how these priority interventions will operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>The National Manpower Service of my Department is concerned to find suitable employment for teenagers as for other age groups among the unemployed.  Special arrangements exist to assist teenagers who are interested in apprenticeships while unemployed teenagers over 18 years of age with no special qualifications are encouraged to undergo an AnCO retraining course with a view to improving their employment prospects. The career leaflets published by my Department are also intended specially for young people leaving school.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the AnCO training programme is not providing the opportunities or the necessary training for these young people?  They are training semi-skilled workers who cannot obtain employment.  I brought this to the attention of AnCO and they agreed that that is so.  I suggest the Minister should inquire from AnCO and get this information for himself. These young people are being trained as semi-skilled workers.  They are not getting the training required by firms in Dublin and AnCO are actually sending out semi-skilled men.  The firms require fully skilled men.  So this is a lot of bunkum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether any change in the existing tax structure is under consideration which would reduce the incidence of indirect taxation which now constitutes 65.8 per cent of all Government raised taxation and which bears most heavily on lower incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 65.8 per cent referred to by the Deputy appears to be based on OECD national accounts statistics and to relate to the year 1968.  Local authority rates are, it should be noted, included as indirect taxes for the purpose of these calculations.  It is estimated that, since then, the ratio of indirect taxation to total taxation has fallen to about 62 per cent.</P>
      <P>I should point out that about two-thirds of indirect tax revenue, as so defined, is referable to customs and excise duties on alcoholic beverages, tobacco and hydrocarbon oils.  Clearly, apart altogether from fiscal considerations, substantial reductions on, in particular, alcohol and tobacco would be likely to have social and medical implications of a serious nature.</P>
      <P>The comparatively low ratio of direct taxation to total taxation is attributable, <i>inter alia,</i> to the fact that social welfare contributions, which are relatively low in this country, fall into the category of direct taxation and to the comparatively restricted wage and salary sectors and the small corporate sector in the economy.  However, despite the low overall ratio, the actual rates of direct taxation are not low. As I indicated in my financial statement of 19th April last, the Government were for some time past concerned about the increasing burden of income tax, which represents about 67 per cent of direct taxation, in particular on lower incomes and decided that a substantial alleviation of the burden should be provided for in this year's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that the effects on the different income groups of individual taxes or categories of taxes must be considered in the context of the taxation system as a whole and in the <Col N="2288" /> light of benefits accruing from Government expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the incidence of indirect taxation is still pretty high even compared with the European average? Could the Minister say whether, in fact, there is any plan in contemplation coming up to the next budget to alter the situation, accepting that indirect taxation must bear most heavily on the lower income groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it certainly is higher than most other countries but the factors I have mentioned must be taken into account.  I do not think any substantial reduction in indirect taxation, apart from the fiscal consequences, would be the answer to the problem.  In fact, it would create a great deal more problems, as I have tried to indicate.  A very important factor in this is the level of social welfare contributions in this country as compared with other countries.  This distorts the picture very much.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may be permitted, in view of the discussion that took place on this item previously, to say that since then I have made some inquiries about the circulation and I am informed that four White Papers each containing the full text of the respective conventions were transmitted to the Librarian for laying before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  They were transmitted on the following dates: that for Belgium on 10th September, 1970; Italy, on 15th June, 1972; Luxembourg on 11th July, 1972 and Zambia on 20th July, 1971. On the same dates the Department of Foreign Affairs sent 250 copies of the respective White Papers to the Clerk of the Dáil for circulation to Deputies and Senators.  I understand from the Dáil office that the White Papers were in fact circulated but I am not certain at the moment of the dates on which this was done.</P>
      <P>In accordance with well established practice 60 copies of the text of the respective conventions scheduled to the draft orders at present before the House and 60 copies of the explanatory memoranda of the conventions were also despatched by his Department to the Dáil office at the same time as the motions to be moved by me in respect of the conventions were placed on the Dáil Order Paper. I shall not bore the House with the dates on which that was done.  This morning, in case some Deputies likely to be involved in the debate on the motions were not in possession of the text of the four conventions and explanatory memoranda, 20 further copies of each of these documents were handed to the Dáil office at 9.50 a.m. for circulation to Deputies in the House.  I say this because I want to make it quite clear that so far as I could I ensured that Deputies were supplied with all the documents in due time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept what the Minister has said.  It is certainly in on way his fault.  The problem arose because I understood from what was said that these documents were circulated together.  I had no recent recollection of receiving them.  They were circulated over a period of time including a period when I had no direct responsibility for this matter. That accounts for the fact that I did not have them together in a form suitable for debate.  The fault was clearly on my side and not the Minister's. I thank the Minister for his courtesy in permitting the adjournment to enable me to study the matter fully.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a number of points in regards to these agreements. First, I think it is common ground that the more agreements of this kind the better to facilitate commercial relationships between the countries concerned.  We have a number of agreements already ratified and others are before us today.  There are, however, a number of countries in respect of which agreements do not exist but with which we have significant trading relationships and in some cases where there are companies either in existance or contemplating investment here from the countries concerned and I ask the Minister if he can indicate what progress, if any, is being made in relation to similar agreements with countries such as Australia, Israel, Japan, Spain and Portugal. I name only five but these seem to be five with which our relationships are sufficiently close to warrant negotiation of agreements of this kind between us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I asked the Minister whether a matching credit arrangement existed in all four of these agreements as I had no opportunity to go through them when speaking. My understanding was that he replied that such an arrangement did exist. In so far as I am correct in recalling his saying that&mdash;I think it is what he said&mdash;I think what he said was less than the complete picture in regard to Italy.  In the case of Italy my understanding is that the matching credit arrangement is limited to cases <Col N="2303" />&mdash;which would be the minority of cases&mdash;where the Italian company hold at least 51 per cent of the share capital of the Irish company.  This is a serious restriction of a kind that does not exist in most of the other agreements, those we are ratifying today and others that have been ratified previously.  It is regrettable that this restriction is imposed.</P>
    <P>In one or two other agreements there are certain provisions of this kind.  The normal arrangement is that a 25 per cent holding is sufficient but in the case of Canada I think it is 100 per cent and for France it is 50 per cent.  However, in the case of Italy the matching credit arrangement seems to operate only where the company is a majority-owned subsidiary of an Italian company.  This is not the case in other instances and I wonder if the Minister could indicate why the problem arose in the case of Italy.  Further, can he state if the agreement we have signed involves our recognisation of any Italian tax incentives to industry?  Is this reciprocated?  Is there any prospect of having the Italian agreement more in conformity with the general pattern of agreements?  When I asked this question this morning it might have been better if the Minister had indicated there was a significant exception in the case of the Italian agreement but possibly he had not time to consider his answer fully at that moment.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the time taken to ratify the Belgian agreement.  This might not matter if the Belgian agreement was restrospective but that is not the case.  It comes into effect only when both sides have ratified it.  It was signed two years ago and I am wondering why it has taken so long to bring it to this House.  The procedure for ratification is a fairly simple one; it is not time-consuming as will be evident by the short debate that will follow my remarks.  Considerable inconvenience and cost has been incurred by some Irish companies because the Belgian agreement has not been brought to the Dáil for <Col N="2304" /> two years after signature.  I am wondering if this has been influenced by the Belgian ratification procedure? Perhaps the Minister could tell us which of these agreements have been ratified in the countries in question and, where they have not been ratified, if ratification is imminent?  A possible reason for failing to bring the Belgian agreement before the House might be that the Belgian Parliament was similarly neglectful, although even if that were the case and if the two Parliaments were hesitating it would be better for us to get on with it and remove a possible impediment in the minds of the Belgians regarding ratification.  If each of us is waiting for the other to ratify, the procedure could take a long time.</P>
    <P>In general, these agreements have been received favourably.  It is unfortunate that the Belgian agreement has been delayed but otherwise the time-lag between signature and the approach to the Dáil for ratification seems reasonable, given the problems of Dáil procedure and the necessity to fit in other matters.  However, I should be glad if the Minister would comment on the Belgian agreement in his reply.</P>
    <P>It seems a pity the agreement with Italy does not provide for recognition of export and mining reliefs granted by this country.  This may be an impediment to Italian investment in Ireland, except on terms that might not be entirely desirable.  So far as possible we should be concerned to ensure that investment here by other countries would be minority investment rather than majority investment.  An agreement which limits the benefits of tax relief to a case where the Italian company owns 51 per cent of the shares gives a strong incentive to Italian companies investing here not to invest in a minority role but only in a majority role.  It should be the purpose of this Parliament to try to encourage investment by foreign companies in a minority role, with majority Irish shareholding. The fact that this agreement appears to operate in a manner contrary to what this Parliament would wish is disturbing and I wonder if <Col N="2305" /> there is any prospect of making a change in the period immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>There appears to be some differentiation between these agreements in respect of certain other provisions.  In regard to portfolio investments, the withholding tax charged appears to be different in the case of Italy and Luxembourg and Zambia.  In the case of foreign subsidiaries of an Irish company, the withholding tax appears to be 5 per cent for Luxembourg, 15 per cent for Italy and Belgium and no amount whatever in the case of Zambia.  Are there reasons for this differentiation? Has it not been possible to introduce any kind of standardisation or uniformity?</P>
    <P>Members of the Dáil are given a volume of documentation that is physically cumbersome.  I understand several of these agreements are in print; in fact, this morning I was told that one of the agreements is out of print already and copies are not available from the Government Publications Office.  It would be preferable for Members to be given printed versions of the document rather than the rather cumbersome stencilled copies.  I should like to know the reason for the rather curious procedure of printing copies and letting them go out of print in some cases, while giving Members of the Dáil stencilled copies. Perhaps the Minister could explain this in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the general policy on the conclusion of double taxation relief conventions, it is the declared policy of the Government to complete arrangements of this kind with all countries where interest in investment here is likely to develop and where it is clear the absence of such an agreement is operating positively to prevent new desirable external investment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, it is necessary for us to keep in step with international developments in this field.  Because of a growing relationship between many countries they are concluding double taxation agreements with each other. This is clearly illustrated by EEC developments which take account of the need to eliminate double taxation on <Col N="2306" /> the nationals of member states within the Community.  To this end, Article 220 of the Rome Treaty specifically charges member states to engage in negotiations with each other.  Finally, in deciding to conclude a double taxation arrangement with a foreign country account must be taken of whether the demand for such arrangement would warrant it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the countries mentioned by Deputy FitzGerald, in the case of Australia preliminary steps were taken some years ago with a view to concluding a comprehensive double taxation agreement with that country.  While the Australian Government were willing in principle to enter into negotiations, considerable delay in opening negotiations was expected because of previous commitments by Australia.  I understand the position in this regard is unaltered. As far as we are concerned negotiations can be take place as soon as Australia indicates a date for their commencement. I might add there is provision under existing law which enables a measure of relief to be accorded in certain circumstances against Irish tax in respect of Australian tax charged on income derived from that country.  The relief applies to the extent of one-half of an Individual's Irish tax or the amount of Australian tax paid on income derived from Australia, whichever is the lesser, provided he is domiciled and resident in Ireland for the year of assessment in question, and, prior to that year, was resident in Australia for a period not less than ten years.</P>
    <P>There are no double taxation agreements in force between Portugal and Israel on the one hand and Ireland on the other and none is contemplated at present.  In regard to Japan the conclusion of a double taxation convention has been authorised and negotiations are in progress at present.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2307" /> In the case of Spain the conclusion of a sea and air transport agreement, such as one that I referred to in my opening remarks in the case of Belgium, has been authorised with Spain.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy FitzGerald on the Italian agreement I should say, perhaps that, in general, this problem of matching credit often causes considerable difficulty in these negotiations.  In this case the Italian Government found difficulty in giving full matching credit and the measures of matching credit in this convention was as much as they were prepared to agree to.  We do not give reciprocal credit to Italy.</P>

      <P>Maybe, but again in general in these negotiations this question of the withholding of tax creates a number of problems.  The rates involved have to be negotiated.  A fair bit of hard bargaining goes on as we try to get the partner country to <Col N="2308" /> reduce the rate as far as is practicable. In the case of Zambia there was not a problem really for the reason that I mentioned.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are a number of other items.  When we resumed after the long summer recess the Taoiseach announced a number of items which it was hoped to get through before Christmas.  One of them is of particular concern to me and, I think, to Deputy FitzGerald.  That is the Ministers and Secretaries Bill.  I am not going out of order.  I am mentioning this as an example which explains why we have not been able to get the Belgian agreement here up to now.  I would very much like to have had that Bill, and indeed this Belgian agreement before the House before now but there is a great rush of business and, without being unduly critical of the benches opposite, there were items on which a great deal of the time of the House was spent which, I would say, in cool retrospection the parties opposite might agree did not merit all the time that was given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Government have to co-operate with the Opposition to some extent in these matters and the Opposition have to co-operate with the Government to some extent.  The fact is that I am in the position, when trying to get the matters before the House, of having to compete with other Ministers. <Col N="2309" /> Various other factors come into play such as the availability of people on this and on the other side of the House. It all adds up to delays which I would prefer did not occur.  They do occur and this is a fact we have to live with. This is the primary reason why the Belgian agreement did not come before the House before now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that for a 20-hour a week Parliament that took three-and-a-half months holidays on the instructions of the Government, that is not a very good alibi to give to the business community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has had enough experience in the House now to know what I am about to say but if he has not he will have it very soon.  I have no doubt that Deputy Tully would agree with me&mdash;he may not say it in the House&mdash;from his experience that any given amount of time in the House will be used up with whatever business is put before the House.  If we sat 365 days a year it does not follow that we would do more business.  There is a fine balance to be brought between the amount of time the House will spend in sitting and the amount of business it will get through. Parkinson, I think, had some rule which if transposed into parliamentary terms would apply to this.  That is my experience.  Additional time does not necessarily mean additional business transacted.</P>

We will have a look at this to see if it can be improved. It might apply in a very small number of cases only that there would be a printed version of part of a document which comes before the House in stencilled form.  I cannot think that there are many examples of this happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress before Question Time, if you could call it progress, I was saying that I was rather amused at the case Deputy Coogan made for the appointment of rate collectors.  Down through the years in County Galway Deputy Coogan and his friends consistently opposed the appointment of rate collectors.  At each meeting at which a rate collector was appointed they created big headlines about the system of appointment in County Galway.  Apparently Deputy Coogan is now prepared to accept appointment by the Civil Service Appointments Commission rather than by the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2312" /> A few weeks ago, when the Minister announced that he was changing the system of appointing rate collectors, I said at a meeting of Galway County Council that I had great reservations because I thought the Local Appointments Commission would be making the appointment.  I was worried about that because I felt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That they might be impartial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the people in the county where the vacancy arose. The Fine Gael Party have made a great deal of play about this Bill.  I am surprised that they are wasting so much of the life of the House in discussing it, because the vast majority of people agree with the proposal put forward by the Minister.  I certainly agree with it.</P>
      <P>It has emerged from this debate that Fine Gael are very opposed to the Bill.  Fine Gael control the majority of county councils and therefore they will lose most by it.  They have accused us of various things in County Galway over a number of years but anywhere a vacancy arose if there was a Fine Gael majority they appointed their own man even though they accused us of appointing Fianna Fáil supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was nothing wrong with the system of appointment.  During my term as a county councillor in Galway we appointed many rate collectors, all good honest men who have done a good job and are still doing a good job.  I should like to refute in the strongest possible manner the allegations made last night by Deputy Donnellan and by Deputy Coogan today. They accused those men of certain malpractices particularly in regard to the preparation of the register at election time.  Deputy Donnellan accused the rate collectors of deliberately deleting names of Fine Gael supporters <Col N="2313" /> from the register.  I am quite certain this is not true.  If Deputy Donnellan had any proof of it he should have substantiated his charge.</P>
    <P>I know for a fact that certain names have been left off the register through no fault of the rate collectors.  They were left off for various reasons.  It could be the fault of the printers, or the county council clerk, or anybody else, but it definitely was not the fault of the rate collectors.  If names were left off the register they were the names of Fianna Fáil supporters as well as the names of Fine Gael supporters. There is no foundation for Deputy Donnellan's allegation or Deputy Coogan's allegation.</P>
    <P>You do not have to be a mathematician to collect rates.  You must have commonsense and a certain approach to the people.  You must be aware of their problems and you must know when to collect the money.  In the rural areas people have not always got money readily available. The rate collectors are familiar with their areas and they often oblige people by calling to them when they have the money available.  I see nothing wrong with the system as it operated. I agree that the system proposed by the Minister will eliminate many of the doubts in people's minds but it is unfair for speakers opposite to accuse the rate collectors of malpractices. That should be refuted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill which was introduced by the Minister for whatever reason he did introduce it&mdash;and I hope it was for the best possible reason&mdash;relieves members of local authorities of a responsibility which most of us did not want.  It was a bit of a nuisance, when a rate collector was being appointed, to have people, often many of them from the same party, feeling that they should receive support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hussey went a little bit further than he might have gone. There is nothing wrong with people who are elected as Fianna Fáil, or Fine Gael, or Labour supporters giving support to a member of their party if he is suitable for the job.  My experience has been that it did not matter who was appointed as a rate <Col N="2314" /> collector in any county.  With very few exceptions they did their jobs very well.  There are places about which it has been said, and perhaps rightly so, that this is an expensive way of collecting the rates and the suggestion has been made that the office system which has been adopted by some counties, particularly County Kerry, might be a better system.  Perhaps we will see the day when all county councils will adopt a system like that.</P>
    <P>Some rate collectors appointed in my own county received support from Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, and sometimes there was a very close vote.  On other occasions we voted on what appeared to be party lines.  I do not make any apology to anybody for that because in every case we felt that the people we were voting for could do a very good job.  In our county they carried out their trust very well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke in the House yesterday evening and I have with me a transcript of the statement he made.  Apparently the accoustics are not very good in the House because what was said here did not appear to reach the Press Gallery. I have not got a copy of the papers with me but I understand that the Press reports him as having said that he knew of people being paid to support a particular candidate and that it happened even in his own party. If that statement was reported as having been said, it is not what the Official Reporter reported as having been said and I think it is only fair to Deputy Desmond, who is well fitted to look after himself but who, having spoken already in this debate, will not get an opportunity to speak again, that I should delay the House for a very short time in quoting, with your permission, Sir, what Deputy Desmond exactly said in regard to this.  He said:</P>
    <P>In rural areas, too, many of these appointments are above board but we would be utterly hypocritical here if we were not to admit that on occasion in county council areas there has been rank corruption, bribery and party political pressures in so far as these appointments are concerned.  Let us be honest about this: no political party in Dáil <Col N="2315" /> Éireann whether in government or in opposition can claim any exemption from those charges.  I have seen it happen in my party.  I have known allegations of corruption, of bribery, of the passing of money and of people being favoured specially even in my own party.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have seen it happen in my party&rdquo;&mdash;this is the attempt at corruption. There is a big difference between an allegation and a statement that money in fact was passed.  Deputy Desmond has authorised me to say that he did not accuse anybody specifically of receiving money, but that the talk went around that this was done.  Those of us in public life are aware that time and again allegations have been made which have never been substantiated because nobody has been challenged to substantiate them and they are very often from people who are not supporting the successful candidate who know of somebody who knows of somebody who was alleged to have been bribed to vote for a particular candidate.  It is only fair that this point should be made clear because I do not know, nor does Deputy Desmond or any member of our party, of anybody being bribed for a vote in support of a particular candidate for a rate collector's job.</P>
    <P>Whether or not the appointments should be made by the county manager or a committee set up by the county manager, or by the Local Appointments Commission is another issue on which I take issue with Deputy Hussey.  If the county manager has the job, there is the danger that pressure will again be put on county councillors to try to persuade the county manager to give the position to a particular individual, and if we are going to do the job at all, it might be much better if we passed it directly to the Local Appointments Commission and let them do it.  I know a number of minor posts which are filled by committees Appointed by county managers and again in every case the people selected do their job well and they are not usually appointed on a political basis at all.  We are completely divorcing the county council from the appointment of rate collectors&mdash;and they are no minor <Col N="2316" /> posts but jobs for which people are paid more than Members of this House are at present paid&mdash;but when such a job becomes vacant there will be a tendency to try to get certain councillors to persuade county managers to favour one side or the other.  County managers will be able to make up their own minds as to who should be appointed on the committee but again there is a danger that the county manager may select committees which could have certain political connotations and for that reason the Local Appointments Commission might possibly be the best way.  It will divorce completely the local authority representatives from the appointments and since it is the only type of appointment, nearly the only real authority left in the possession of the local authority members, I believe the Minister at least in that regard is doing a good job in taking it out of their hands so that no longer will people be making the wild statements made even in the course of this debate about the appointment of rate collectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a revealing debate.  Whether what it has revealed is to the credit of politicians generally and of Fianna Fáil in particular is another question.  It has not just been from the Opposition benches that the malpractices of the present system have been indicted.  We have heard from the benches up here&mdash;I do not know whether to describe them as opposition but we have heard indeed from the dissident Fianna Fáil members, Deputies Foley and Brennan, something from the inside about the system and we have heard from Deputy Burke, I understand, a defence of the present system.  It is clear that the present system has serious defects.  How serious they are depends on how one regards jobbery&mdash;political jobbery, I mean&mdash;and I will come back to that in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to consider the context within which the discussion is taking place.  The issue before us in a way, is why did Fianna Fáil become the apostles of jobbery and the main protagonists of it?  Why, historically, did this happen?  It is worth dwelling on this for a moment, in a sense to be <Col N="2317" /> fair to that party because this should be seen in historical context.  There was jobbery in Ireland before Fianna Fáil was invented, or Fine Gael or Labour.  It was a 19th century practice under which when governments changed in Britain, Irish people were encouraged to attach themselves to British political parties which had no relevance to the Irish scene with a view to securing promotion.  This was true of the legal profession but was not confined to that profession.  By such an attachment, one could ensure that when the government changed, one had a good chance of a job.</P>
    <P>That practice existed.  It has been perpetuated in Northern Ireland, the only difference being that since the establishment of Northern Ireland the change-over between Conservative and Liberal has ceased to operate, so that we have had one-party jobbery for 50 years.  This has now been effectively abolished, though not completely. There are still defects and legitimate complaints with the system but, nonetheless, in Northern Ireland a lot has been done to get rid of this system. If it has not been completely cleared up overnight, it is because its roots lie very deep and it will be some time before some of the remaining abuses can be rooted out.  In this part of the country, our first Government went to considerable trouble over a whole range of public appointments to try to eliminate these practices and so the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission were established, but their activities, their responsibilities, their terms of reference did not extend to all jobs.  Certain jobs, unfortunately, as we can now see, were omitted from their terms of reference and then there was the problem that during the early days of the State&mdash;I do not wish to rehearse anything controversial; I am making no judgement on the two sides involved&mdash;there was a civil war and the Government in power found themselves in the position of being opposed in arms for reasons the people concerned found proper.</P>
    <P>That Government found themselves in the position of defending themselves against armed attack and finding within their ranks, among the servants <Col N="2318" /> of the Government, people who not only disagreed with them politically, which was entirely legitimate for a public servant, but who in some instances were working actively against them.  I seem to recall as a child hearing a story which always attracted my fancy of one public servant who was believed by the Cabinet of the day to be betraying secrets of the Government to the Republican movement in <i>An Phoblacht,</i> or passing on this in formation.  The story I heard, which may be apocryphal, but it is a nice story, is that the members of the Government concocted an imaginary file with all the proper markings on it&mdash;&ldquo;Bring forward&rdquo; and &ldquo;Put away&rdquo;&mdash; as if it had gone to various people and it contained imaginary correspondence with the British Government in which it was suggested that the British Government was pressing for the introduction of the Union Jack in the corner of the Tricolour.  No such thing had happened.</P>
    <P>The file, having been carefully concocted in a manner which would persuade an ordinary civil servant that it had gone the rounds, that many had seen it, was passed to a particular civil servant, and to him only, by the member of the Government, and it appeared in <i>An Phoblacht</i> the following week.  The civil servant concerned lost his job.  The story may not be true but it is a nice story which suggests a degree of ingenuity and imagination on the part of the Government which we do not see in governments today.  The point I am making is that the Government in the circumstances found it necessary to dispose of some of their employees in circumstances which naturally caused hardship.  After nine years a change of government came about &mdash;democratically because the first Government sought to secure a democratic change-over of power to ensure the establishment of parliamentary democracy in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The new Government coming in found themselves in the position that many of those who had been their supporters, had been, for reasons that were good and necessary at the time from the point of view of the Government then in power, deprived of <Col N="2319" /> positions in the public services.  Understandably and taking the long view of the situation, the new government sought, quite properly, to re-establish this balance within certain limits by reintroducing, for a period of time, some of their supporters back to the public service, normal conditions having been restored.  From the point of view of history, avoiding the partisanship of the time, that was an understandable decision but what was unfortunate about it was, that having undertaken this exercise which might be regarded, not in the strictest sense, as correct, but as a reasonable adjustment to try to re-establish a balance of position after the unfortunate civil war, the Government in question having undertaken this exercise in the early 1930's, got into the habit of doing this and continued the habit long after the necessary readjustment had been made.  Therefore, my personal theory is that in that way the Fianna Fáil custom of jobbery was established.</P>

      <P>I try to be fair in the House and to give both sides of a story.  I do not think that basically there is more natural viciousness in Fianna Fáil people than in others but there must be some reason why Fianna Fáil have been so intimately associated with jobbery throughout the history of this State.  The problem has been that once the practice started it became a habit.  It has corrupted Irish society.  I do not accept the term used by Deputy Tully and others, some, perhaps, from these benches and some from the other benches, which suggests that there is nothing to apologise for, that there is nothing wrong with supporting one of one's own and that to vote for those whom one considers could do a very good job is all right and that the fact that they are supporters of one's own party should not preclude one from voting for them, that in fact, one should favour them so long as one is convinced they can do a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems to me to involve a concept <Col N="2320" /> of distributive justice which does not accord with what I have always understood to be basic Christian principles. If in public appointments there are a number of candidates and if one candidate is better than the others although many may be qualified, failure to appoint that best candidate seems to me to involve an offence against justice.  If he is the person best qualified, he is entitled to the job and for one to deprive him of that post would seem to me to be exactly the same in character as taking from him the sum of money that would accrue from the post.  If somebody contrives by using his influence with a political party to have himself appointed to a post for which he is not the best qualified candidate, he is depriving somebody else of the remuneration involved for that year and for each year thereafter in which he remains in the post and he will have the same duty in terms of restitution as has anybody who steals money.</P>
    <P>I know that that rather harsh Jansenistic view of the practice is not accepted universally but it is one that I have held always.  It is one in respect of which I entered politics with a view to pursuing to the point of implementation, recognising, of course, the imperfections of human nature and that it would be impossible to safeguard always against abuses of some kind and recognising that there are some posts in respect of which it would be very difficult to provide adequate safeguards.  It is all right in respect of rate collectorships, posts that arise rather rarely, to lay down methods of appointment which involve clearcut practices and procedures that should preclude any question of jobbery but, of course, at other levels, for instance, on the question of appointing a person to do a couple of weeks work on the roads, no similar system of appointment would be workable.</P>
    <P>There may be problems also regarding the appointment of directors of State companies.  It is difficult to see how these appointments can be made by anyone other than the Government. It is difficult to see what safeguards one can implement in this respect except to establish a convention <Col N="2321" /> that would be difficult for future governments not to follow, one that would ensure that such appointments are made on the basis of merit and are not rewards for services rendered to a party as a significant minority of such appointments are today.  I do not suggest all because the majority of directors of State companies are appointed as people best suited to the jobs concerned but others are given these jobs as rewards for services to the party.  There are several State bodies which, in the not too distant past, at any rate, have been provided predominantly with directors on this basis.  The quality of the boards concerned has been suspect.  Work has suffered and there have been cases where the Government have had to get rid of boards because of their incompetence which arose from the method of appointment.  However, it is difficult to see how one can use safeguards in these cases, but in other cases one can see methods of doing so.</P>
    <P>For instance, there is no reason why the appointment of judges should not be based on consultation of some kind with the Bar and the Incorporated Law Society whereby a panel of names would be brought forward.  There could be some such system in which the Government would have a choice but where the choice would be between people who, in the opinion of their peers, were qualified eminently. I am not insisting on that system but I am suggesting merely that it is possible to arrive at a system for the appointment of judges which would eliminate political influence and which would go beyond the pure convention that operates in Britain to eliminate political appointments.</P>
    <P>In respect of the appointments we are discussing here the job is one that arises rarely, which is at a reasonably high level and which, therefore, is eminently suited for an appropriate procedure of appointment, a procedure designed to rule out the possibility of political favouritism.  I have listened to some of the arguments in favour of the procedure outlined in the Bill.  I do not see the merit of these arguments but, perhaps, this is due to a certain inability on my part to listen sufficiently receptively to the <Col N="2322" /> views from the other side of the House but I do not see what is the merit of giving this responsibility to county managers.  The arguments put forward against the appointments being made by the Local Appointments Commission seem to me to be perverse.  This Commission was established for the very purpose of making local appointments.  It is not as if there were no Local Appointments Commission and that it was being proposed from this side of the House that some remote body, such as the Civil Service Commission, should have this duty.  The first Government here established the Local Appointments Commission. They did so precisely to enable these kind of local appointments to be made in a manner that would take account of local needs and at the same time which would ensure that these appointments were made on a basis that would preclude political jobbery or any other form of corruption and to ensure that the best appointment was made.  Therefore, to suggest that a system established for this purpose, used for the vast majority of local authority jobs by this very Government, never attacked or criticised by this Government, and rightly so, because it is an excellent system, should suddenly become unsuited to the appointment of a particular local official, in this case, a rate collector is to suggest something which is untenable.</P>
    <P>I have never heard anybody suggest that the Civil Service Commission should not appoint staff to the Revenue Commissioners, that they should be chosen as people who are known to get on well with taxpayers and who would know, as Deputy Hussey suggested, that there was money in a house at any particular time.  I should like to think that when the Revenue Commissioners seek tax from me they would have regard to my immediate family situation, that they would have personal knowledge and consideration in respect of my position but they do not and nobody here has ever suggested that they should.  I do not see why other forms of tax collection should have to partake of this special characteristic either.  Rate collectors should be appointed <Col N="2323" /> by the Local Appointments Commission in the same way as other appointments are made.  No case has been made for their appointment by county managers and a case has been made against the county manager system.  That is a system which already gives excessive authority to one person.  We must reconsider our present position and realise that the diminution of the role of local elected representatives which, no doubt, was designed for very good reasons was, nevertheless, a retrograde step. Perhaps we are more mature now than we were 40 years ago and that whatever reasons there may have been then for taking so much power away from them should be reconsidered. Modern methods of control over expenditure should make it possible to introduce new budgetary methods and to establish standards of performance and behaviour which could be controlled by spot checks that would enable the democratic system to operate properly.</P>
    <P>This is not the moment to give further powers to county managers. Of course, county managers are involved locally and are subject to local pressures.  Their own appointments may have been influenced by political considerations.  I do not know whether that can be the case but it has been alleged by people on this side of the House that many of them have a Fianna Fáil complexion.  Perhaps that is simply a paranoia of Opposition.  The appointment of rate collectors should not be a matter for one person.  We have an established procedure for such appointments that has stood the test of time and despite criticism in this House it is a procedure which, by and large, seemed fair.  Whatever individual criticisms there may have been the commission never came under attack here on a general scale as being in any way lacking in impartiality.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances it is clear that appointments should be left to the Local Appointments Commission. It is not surprising that the Minister's reluctance to adopt this obvious procedure has met with scepticism from <Col N="2324" /> this side of the House.  When one hears Deputies who appear to be defending the present system and who regard it as having worked well telling the House, as we have heard from Deputy Hussey, that their initial opposition dissolved once they heard the work would not be done by the Local Appointments Commission and that it would be done by a county manager, then one wonders why the Minister has proposed this particular course of action which, in fact, commends itself to those who like the present corrupt system and which is opposed by those who are seeking to improve that system.  That is a method at which one should look twice and the Minister cannot expect to emerge from this debate without some mistrust of his motives and without some criticisms of his attitude if he persists in proposing a method of appointment which is so suspect and so far removed from the method which commends itself to those who are seeking to clean up the system and to ensure that distributive justice applies in this area.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, finally, that we are tackling here only the tip of, I will not call it an iceberg, but a large block of ice, because the iceberg was dissolved in the twenties largely by the creation of the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission by the first Government.  But when that dissolution took place the iceberg unfortunately did not totally melt.  A few ice floes broke away and one of these is now coming under the heat of criticism in this House today.  But there are others and although, as I have said, there are certain areas in which there may be practical problems about eliminating political jobbery, it should be the first requirement of this House to get rid of this cancer, because it is a cancer.  The fact is our people are corrupted by it.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country there is a belief that no one can get a job without political influence.  We know in this House that this is not true.  Most jobs are awarded on an impartial basis and the political jobbery has been, <Col N="2325" /> by the action of the first Government, confined to specific and limited areas &mdash;sub-postmasters, rate collectors, judges, guides at the Rock of Cashel, <i>et cetera</i>.  There are a few of these particular categories and these are unfortunately sufficiently obstrusive in the public mind and in each locality people are sufficiently aware of the cases where flagrant jobbery has taken place, where people involved in politics have secured the appointments not merely of their friends but, disgracefully, of their relatives.</P>
    <P>There is enough of that going around to convince many that the whole system is corrupt and that jobbery is prevalent throughout the whole system.  The fact that it is not true is not, unfortunately, fully realised and there are enough politicians going around pretending that, in fact, they can influence jobs that they cannot influence to add to this false impression. This has corrupted the body politic of this country and has created a situation in which politicians are fawned upon, on the one hand, by those who want favours from them and, on the other hand, are the subject of mistrust and cynicism of the kind that can only corrode democracy.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of this House, starting here, and doing a more thorough job than the Minister proposes and extending its work to other areas, to put an end to that and, on this side of the House, that is our determination and that is what we have put in our party policy and that is what we will do if we get into power.  No doubt, in this, as in other parties, there will be people who will regret the fact that we are determined to clean up the system.  There will be individuals who will see that they might benefit from the present system continuing.  No party is perfect.  No party consists entirely of angels and there are bound to be people with some element of self-interest and, in fact, the unfortunate thing is that the persistent practice of jobbery by Fianna Fáil over the last 40 years has in some degree besmirched and, to some minor degree, corrupted the other parties as well, so that within them people are to be found&mdash;not <Col N="2326" /> many, because for those who want jobs it is easier to get them from Fianna Fáil&mdash;who think in these terms.  In our party they are a minority, a small enough minority for us to ignore them and, in government, to set them to one side and to eliminate jobbery wherever it exists and to create in this country a public administration in which when parents have a child going forward for a job they will know he will get the job if he merits it and not if he does not and, no matter who they talk to, if he is not the best person for the job, he will not get it.  We want a public administration in which the people will have both trust and confidence. We have not got that now because of what has happened to the perpetuation of jobbery by the party in power in the past 40 years.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I commend the Minister for bringing in this very timely change.  Those who criticise this change in the method of appointment must surely speak with their tongues in their cheeks. I listened last night to Deputy O.J. Flanagan being very critical of this proposed change and I note in today's paper that he is quoted as saying that this Bill stinks.  I could not disagree more.  From my short experience of local authority work I am convinced that what does stink is the present method of appointment.  It is a method open to abuse and it has been abused and, although I cannot prove it, I am convinced there was a certain amount of corruption and jobbery attached to the appointment of rate collectors.  If appointees were capable of doing their job that was not as a result of the method of appointment; it was in spite of the method of appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should, I suppose, take this opportunity of complimenting the rate collectors.  They do a good job.  They collect all the money they possibly can and they use a certain amount of commonsense and charity in dealing with certain cases and getting rates waived.  There is hardship. People are not always in a position to pay up.  It should be pointed out here that rate collectors are not indispensable. This has been proved in <Col N="2327" /> Kerry where the rates have been collected through an office for many years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan asked the Minister last night to name the pressures brought to bear on him to change this particular method of appointing rate collectors.  He referred to faceless people, people who were just mentioned as &ldquo;they&rdquo; by the Minister. I am not saying that I was directly responsible for this, but I think our organisation in Kildare played some small part; we asked the Minister to change the method of appointment of rate collectors and over a year ago Kildare County Council passed a resolution to the effect that rate collectors in future would be appointed by open competitive examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer for those bodies.  I crave the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to put on the record my humble experience in my own constituency.  On the occasion to which I have referred we were fortunate to have a majority at the council meeting.  Apparently the Opposition members, because there was no question of the appointment of a rate collector involved, were not so concerned to be present and they did not come to the meeting.  We passed the resolution, but they subsequently mustered their forces when there was an appointment to be made and they brought in their majority and the Fine Gael and Labour representatives on Kildare County Council changed back again to the old method.  They had a majority on that particular day when there was something to be gained.  They apparently did not want to see the best man appointed.  They wanted to appoint their own political lackeys as they have appointed them for an unbroken period of 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and, even if we <Col N="2328" /> had the local elections this year and returned a majority of Fianna Fáil councillors to Kildare County Council, as we will in the next election, I would still welcome the Bill because it is high time this change was made. Some years ago there was considerable publicity in the Sunday papers with regard to Dublin appointments and there were people who were very critical of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on that occasion.  Maybe that criticism was deserved, but the real hypocrites on that occasion were the members of the Labour Party who were most vocal in their criticisms and, remembering the political jobbery and broken promises in the last few appointments in Kildare, when rate collectors were being appointed, the Labour Party representatives are the very last people who should throw up their hands in horror at anything like this.  There are two vacancies to be filled in Kildare now.  I believe it is planned to have them filled by next Monday.  If the platitudes, statements and policy expressed by Deputy FitzGerald a month ago could percolate down to the representatives in Kildare, maybe they can prove to us that they are sincere in wanting to bring about this wonderful position where the very best person will get the very best job.  I hope that will be done.  I personally will give them an opportunity of doing that.</P>

      <P>There are further vacancies in Kildare and the electorate there will get an opportunity of seeing <Col N="2329" /> who wants the best man appointed, who wants honesty in politics.  When the Minister indicated his intention to bring in the Bill there was an unholy rush to get the last few lads in if at all possible.  The horse trading is completed.  They now want to do another deal.  If they want the best man, we will facilitate them but I am afraid that will not be the case.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to be welcomed because it removes a source of embarrassment to all county councillors.  We are very critical sometimes of young people not taking part in politics and we wonder at their cynicism.  Political appointments can be one source of their cynicism.  Recently some well qualified young people called on me to ask how the position of rate collector would be filled.  One question they put was to what extent knowledge of Irish would be required. They were surprised when I explained how the appointment would be made. We will have done a good day's work if we change the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to rile anybody during the course of my contribution.  I am a little surprised at the length of time the debate has taken, approximately nine hours.  The debate generated a great deal of heat and some hot air.  It may have been naïve of me to have expected that the House would have accepted this simple Bill without some noise being generated. From my own experience as a county councillor and as a politician I know that the mention of the words &ldquo;rate collector&rdquo; and the question of their appointment has always been a contentious matter and has always <Col N="2331" /> generated some heat and I suppose one could have expected that to have been the case on this occasion when I was sounding the death knell of a system that has continued in operation for many years and as to the merits of which some doubts have been expressed.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael in particular seemed to be very concerned as to my motives in introducing the Bill.  I am disappointed at this because since I became Minister I have strived to put my own stamp on my Department and where I felt improvements were needed and I was in a position to carry them out I have tried to do so.  In my experience as a county councillor I found the process of selecting rate collectors distasteful and never agreed with it.  From discussions with my colleagues and with members of county councils of various parties, I have found a general dislike on their part also of being involved in that method of selection.  However, the onus fell on me as Minister to avail of some opportunity to correct the situation and I brought in this simple Bill proposing that the method be changed and that it become an executive function and that the method of appointment be similar to the method of selection employed for similar type posts in the local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is possible to go further and insist, by way of an order under the 1926 Act, that the selection be made through the Local Appointments Commission. The Local Appointments Commission has, however, generally been dealing with appointments of a senior nature. I will come to the type of appointments that at present are made in the manner I suggest in my Bill, by the county manager, using the methods and the regulations laid down for him.  There have never been any complaints about that system.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate&mdash; and this surprised me&mdash;many contradictory statements were made.  Deputies contradicted themselves and Deputies on the same benches contradicted statements made by their colleagues. There were many hares raised and a lot of the discussion was irrelevant.  I shall as far as possible confine myself to the facts of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2332" /> My motives, which were doubted here, were completely genuine.  My motivation arises probably in the main from my own knowledge and experience as a county councillor.  If the House does not accept that, there is nothing I can do about it.  I brought the matter before my colleagues in the Government.  They agreed with me.  The party discussed the Bill.  Here it is before the House.  I have found, since the Bill was announced, there has been a general welcome for it from the community and from county councillors. Indeed, many county councils have of their own volition already abolished the system of appointing rate collectors and instances were given of local authorities where a different system is employed. Cork was mentioned.  The office system of collection is used in many county council areas.  Generally, there has not been any objection to what I have been doing.  There may be some people who will suggest that I am taking away some power from county councils, whereas one should be moving in the direction of increasing the power and decision-making authority of the councillors sitting in committee in their councils.  I agree with that procedure and have tried as far as possible, and will continue to do so, to give the councillors more say in the operation of local authority affairs and local government affairs generally and to devolve as many functions and as much decision-making as I can from the central Local Government Department down to the local authority.  I do not want to go into that now; I have mentioned it before.  This is a continuing process; I am adding to it all the time and in that way I am strengthening the local authorities, making them more real and, I hope, more interesting for the councillors who are members of them.</P>
    <P>It is a bit galling that Fine Gael should project themselves here as paragons of virtue when, on a previous occasion when there was a free vote of the House, the vast majority of them voted against any change in the existing rate collector system.  It is unrealistic for people like Deputy Garret FitzGerald to present his party as the one that will do the big clean-up: they had <Col N="2333" /> the opportunity before when in Government and when his party were in power many prominent members of that party voted against change when they could easily have voted for it, if all the Deputy said about Fine Gael were true.  I do not accept that it is true.  I see the name of Deputy Coogan, who spoke near the end of the debate for Fine Gael, at the top of the alphabetical list of those who voted against this change when he had the opportunity to vote for it.  Deputy Cosgrave voted to retain the existing system of appointment of rate collectors; so did the then Deputy J.J. Costello, Deputy Donegan and Deputy Oliver Flanagan. Politicians who try to project themselves as paragons of virtue are walking on very thin ice because history and past events can always be found to disprove them and show them up in their true light.  That is the only test: one can only be judged by one's performance.</P>

      <P>This debate has generated much comment about the concern by the Opposition regarding political jobbery and I want to put <Col N="2335" /> my view on record about the political jobbery that took place during the last Coalition Government and the one before that.  It was so bad that it nauseated many people and, in fact, it was the greatest recruiting factor for Fianna Fáil cumainn because people were so disgusted with the tactics of the Coalition Government at that time.  I gave an example last night; I did not want to do so but the tone of the debate was not decided by me.  I am only replying to what has been said.  Anybody who remembers the proposal by the Opposition in Government to carry out drainage on the Corrib will recall the statement made by the person appointed to look after this work, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Works, that nobody would be employed on that drainage scheme who had any connections with the Fianna Fáil Party and that he would go to the ends of the earth to find somebody to do the work but would never employ a Fianna Fáil person.</P>

      <P>Much of what has been said here was based on suspicion and I suppose I am entitled to be suspicious also but I suspect the motive behind the amendment which Deputy Fitzpatrick has put down is in some way based on the assumption that I originally intended that the Local Appointments Commission would make this appointment and that that is what was intended when the Government first decided this issue and that I then changed my mind and made it an <Col N="2337" /> executive function or conceived the intention that it should be an executive function in the Bill rather than a matter for the Local Appointments Commission. This is not true.  I am sorry I interrupted Deputy Fitzpatrick and other members of his party when they continued to make that assumption during the debate and when they continued to allege that this happened.  I should like to put on record the Government Information Bureau statement I authorised on the occasion of the announcement of this Bill.

      <P>The statement was issued on 22nd September, 1972, and it stated:</P>
      <P>The following statement was issued today by the Government Information Bureau on behalf of the Minister for Local Government, Mr. Robert Molloy, TD.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government has had under consideration for some time the method of appointment of county council rate collectors. At present, appointments to these posts are reserved by law to the elected members of county councils and in practice the selection of candidates is effected by ballot of the councillors.  This inevitably involves canvassing of the members by or on behalf of candidates thus placing the members in an invidious position.  The Minister has come to the conclusion that these posts should be filled in the same manner as all other local authority posts.  The Government have authorised the introduction of the necessary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That statement means that the posts <Col N="2338" /> are filled as an executive function by the manager and the method of selection is laid down by way of regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the methods similar in all local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy L'Estrange read from an article which he said was in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  The article purported to quote something I said and, because I did not deny it, he alleges the article was true.  Of course, for a politician that is an extraordinary assumption to make.  I did not make any reference to the article but a second article appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 4th November, 1972 and I replied to that.  The second article was written under the name of a political correspondent.  Because it was not published in full in the newspaper and because I have been accused by Deputy L'Estrange of not denying the statement that it was to be done originally by LAC, I should like to put my reply on record.  The letter is addressed to Mr. Chris Glennon, <i>Irish Independent</i>, Middle Abbey Street, Dublin 1, and it states:</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to refer to your article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 4th instant dealing with the County Management (Amendment) Bill.  There is no foundation in fact for a number of the statements in that article.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not state that selection of county rate collectors would be made by the Local Appointments Commissioners: please see attached copy of the official statement issued at the time by the Government Information Bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true that &ldquo;all other local authority posts&rdquo; are filled through the Commission.  The posts filled through the Commission are only a minority of local offices and comprise (a) offices of Chief Executive Officer of a local authority (b) professional offices (c) such other offices as the Minister with the concurrence of the Commissioners declares to be offices to which the Act of 1926 applies. Offices coming under category (c) are usually the more senior posts for <Col N="2339" /> which a competition on a national rather than a local basis is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to say that selection will not be made through the Commission: indeed the proposed amendment will leave the way open to the Minister, should this course be considered desirable, to seek the concurrence of the Commissioners to a declaration applying the Act of 1926 to the office of rate collectors.  While no definite decision has been made it must be pointed out that posts of this type are not normally filled through the Commission.</P>
    <P>It is not true that &ldquo;the only real change will be that the councillors will be canvassed not for the job of rate collectors but for themselves to undertake a further canvassing of the County Manager&rdquo;.  If selection is made through the Commission this will not arise.  If selection is made by the Manager the process of selection will be that normally followed by him in relation to other posts at present, that is appointment will be made either by promotion or by open competition conducted in accordance with stringent requirements laid down by regulations and circular letters from the Department.</P>
    <P>I have been directed to place these facts before you in order to afford you an opportunity of setting the record straight.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I should like to know if the Minister considers it right and proper that Mr. Chris Glennon who is affectionately known to all Members of this House should be addressed by &ldquo;A Chara&rdquo;?  Would it not be more appropriate to address him in a more affectionate manner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that my intention in bringing in this Bill was for the sole purpose of removing the appointment of rate collectors from the political arena.  I think practically all Members will agree with that intention.  The Bill <Col N="2340" /> contains machinery to provide for that change.  Making it an executive function enables the manager to make the appointment and there are procedures and regulations laid down with which he must comply.  There are three ways in which he can have the selection made.  One is by way of promotion of a member of his staff&mdash;and this is easily understood&mdash;and the other ways are by interview or examination. With regard to interviews, I should like to read from circular letter E.L. 7/52 of 23rd June 1952:</P>
      <P>Care should be taken in the constitution of interview boards set up to advise local authorities in relation to promotions and fresh recruitment. The members of the boards should always be chosen to ensure that their recommendations will command confidence.  It is desirable, in constituting interview boards to vary the personnel from appointment to appointment.  It is recommended that, wherever it is practicable, the procedure of drawing at least two members of the interview board from outside the county in which the appointment is made be generally adopted.</P>
      <P>It can be seen that under the system I am proposing the manager is obliged to set up an interview board and to have two persons from outside the county.  The normal practice is that he has two persons from within the county, usually from his own staff or he may have one from another local authority in the area.  Hundreds, possibly thousands, of appointments have been made since that system was devised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations I mentioned are the ones at present applicable in the case of interview boards as set out in the circular. In the case of the rate collector position the same qualifications will apply as at present.  There are four points that must be taken into consideration. One is character, the <Col N="2341" /> others are age, health and education. The qualifications are the same as at present and the regulations are the same as at present apply to appointments made by the manager exercising his executive function.  I intend to operate under this system.  I think it is the most suitable system for this post. It has come across quite clearly to me here, and has reaffirmed my conviction that what I am doing is right, through the many references to the need to ensure when making an appointment that the person should if at all possible have some knowledge of the area and of the type of life in the area.  It was suggested that it should be kept as local as possible.</P>
      <P>May I refer to the last occasion on which this question was discussed?  It was an Adjournment debate on 18th April of this year.  Deputy Desmond said:</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider amending the County Management Act, 1940, in terms of the reserved function.  He could easily insist that there be introduced the system that operates in the urban area generally. There was substantial variations available to the Minister. I am referring now to county council rate collector appointments.  The whole procedure could be devolved on the Local Appointments Commission.  I do not think that is necessary.  I think we have a much more effective system in operation.  In Dublin Corporation we have a special system for the creation of such collectorships. It is a question of internal competition. Notices are made out, basic educational standards apply, a full interview system is in operation by an impartial general board composed of representatives of the legal, the valuation and the personnel departments of that corporation. They do the general interviewing and candidates emerge on merit.  This is the fairest system and the most effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am suggesting is in line with what Deputy Desmond was asking for on that occasion so I expect that Deputy Desmond and his party will <Col N="2342" /> support me in what I am proposing to do.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to hear the Fine Gael spokesman making the case for their amendment, a weak case really, and implying that this is the view of the Fine Gael Party up and down the country.  I want to assure him that it is not and I should like to quote for him a statement made at the Ballinasloe Urban Council recently, as reported in the <i>Connaught Tribune</i> of November 17th.  The comments of the Fine Gael people are very interesting. Their thinking is exactly along the lines of the Fianna Fáil Bill.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Ballinasloe Urban Council agreed unanimously at Tuesday night's meeting&mdash;on the proposal of councillor Gus Hynes&mdash;to press for the appointment of rate collectors by competitive examination.</P>
    <P>Councillor Hynes said the abolition of the present system, if it did away with abuses, was to be welcomed, but they should be careful about what replaced it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Local Appointments Commission took over, this would be a move away from decentralisation,&rdquo; he pointed out.  &ldquo;It would be better if each County Council held competitive examinations and placed the applicants in order of merit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Councillor Pat Galvin said that there should also be an oral examination. It was agreed to incorporate this suggestion in the resolution, which will be sent to the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Deputies have asked me to say who made representatitons to me, whose views were submitted to me.  They implied that I said in my opening speech that I had gone around consulting.  I did not go around consulting on this matter.  I had sufficient knowledge of my own, sufficient representations being made to me and I think I have made a very wise decision which I hope this House will support.</P>
    <P>If and when the Bill is enacted, the position will be that the appointments will be made by local authorities either by internal promotion, which was the method Deputy Desmond was referring to, or on the result of a competitive examination or interview.  I <Col N="2343" /> have explained how that can be set up. I should like to emphasise that the bulk of local authority offices are filled in this way at present.  I can give examples.  All of the following are appointed in this way: staff officer, second fire officer (other than second fire officer in Dublin County Borough), clerical officer, library assistant, clerk typist, rate collector (other than county rate collector), rent collector (wholetime and parttime posts), gas slot meter collector, storekeeper, law and conveyancing clerk, clerk-of-works, referencer, rate inspector, rents inspector, section officer, assistant section officer, senior executive officer, development officer, draughtsman, draughtsman grade I, work study and organisation and methods officer, personnel officer, quantity surveyor's clerk.</P>

      <P>I have no evidence up to now of any allegations being made that that system is not working satisfactorily. If such were so I would be aware of it.  It is rather late in the day for Deputy Fitzpatrick to be protesting because in practice it has worked, the experience has been good and the system has been successful.  All I am suggesting is to add to that list of responsible persons the rate collectors for the county areas.  Already the other rate collectors are on that list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the Local Appointments Commission is not to be recommended.  We must try to keep these posts local.  The competition should be a local type competition and as far as possible a local person with some local knowledge should be the one who is successful. They would be the people who would be most acceptable to the community and, I think to the councillors who are quite willing to concede this power; as expressed by that councillor <Col N="2344" /> in Ballinasloe they would be quite pleased that appointment should be by way of local examination.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that the manager will now be the sole person involved in the selection of the rate collector.  He is bound, in practice, to accept the person recommended to him by the interview board which has been set up.  The candidates will be marked according to their merits and their ability and assessed by way of interview.  The person deemed to be most suitable for the position will be recommended to the manager and, in practice, he is obliged to appoint that person.</P>

      <P>In practice he is obliged to accept the recommendation of the board.  This has been the practice. A number of Deputies were concerned about the method of collection. They felt that this Bill might in some way act as an obstacle against changing from the rate collectorship arrangement to office collection, or any other method which might be deemed to be more efficient and more economical for the area.</P>
      <P>Some local authorities have already done away with the appointment of rate collectors as we know them, and are carrying out the collection through offices and have officers working permanently on the county council staff to whom these warrants were issued. They can handle quite a large number of warrants.  I understand that in Cork County not all of the collection is yet done through the offices but a very big percentage of it is.  Perhaps the move is in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Bill is passed and becomes law, and the manager has the function of setting up this board and eventually appointing the rate collector, he can do it that way.  When a vacancy arises in his local authority area, he can decide to review the whole collection <Col N="2346" /> system.  He can discuss this with the members, but it is his function finally to decide it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If he decides that it would be more efficient, more economical and of greater benefit to the rate-payers in the area, to transfer the collection of that warrant from an individual rate collector to office collection, he can do so.  He can do it at the moment and he will be able to do it after this Bill is passed.  As has been proved in many areas, this can be very beneficial but I am not giving any explicit direction about it because I realise that there are local factors which decide those issues and that, in some areas, it is found that to do it through the office is the most suitable and the cheapest way of doing it and the way which best pleases the rate-payers.</P>
      <P>I realise that in other areas with a large rural community it is not deemed to be suitable.  I will leave that decision to the manager who can have consultations in his area and who knows the area best.  He can discuss it with members of the county council.  The option will still be open to the manager to move towards office collection if he deems it to be appropriate.  I was asked by some Deputy if the manager will be compelled to continue to appoint rate collectors where these positions are in existence.  He will not be so compelled. He can decide on which method of collection he desires to have.</P>
      <P>Having had experience of the County Management Act and the work of county managers over a long period&mdash; and there are members older than I who have longer experience of dealing with local and public authorities&mdash;I thought it was rather unfair to make the accusations that were made about individual county managers and county managers collectively. This function is only another one at the end of a long list of similar functions they exercise in the appointment of staff to the local authorities.  It is no great change so far as they are concerned.  The implication was that they would not be able to resist pressures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2347" /> Down through the years they have dealt with appointments and vacancies which arose and it is unfair to them, and it questions their integrity, to allege that, if pressure is exercised on them, it will succeed.  We all know that it does not succeed very often.  Since I became Minister I have not approached county managers on these matters but some years ago when I was a Deputy, in making ordinary representations to them, I never found that my representations had any effect.  I am sure that was the experience of all Members of the House.  There should be general agreement on that.</P>
    <P>We should compliment the managers on the work they have done, and we should be proud that we have people with such a high degree of integrity and intelligence working in our local authorities.  We should do nothing to belittle them or the responsible jobs they carry out.  I have no fear that any manager will be so weak as to be influenced by pressure from some Deputy, or some relation who wants his son to be appointed a rate collector.  If that is the case, why has not that type of malpractice surfaced in the filling of the other appointments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>He said he had no faith in interview boards.  In his amendment he suggests that the Local Appointments Commission should make these appointments, but he can have no faith in them either because they must operate through a board. <Col N="2348" /> He wants it done through the LAC which would remove it away from the local scene and it would become a national type competition.  We know from experience that the Local Appointments Commission have a very heavy burden to carry in trying to make fair and reasonable decisions on all the applications before them at present.  If we put the position of rate collector in the Local Appointments Commission pipeline we will add to their work and make it slower.  Also if we add the position of rate collector, why not add all the other positions which are decided at present by way of local competition with the manager exercising his executive function?</P>
      <P>As I said, the option is still there. If, after operating the Bill as it is proposed here, with the manager making these appointments with the help of his selection board, and using his executive function, it is found not to be successful, and if all the things the Opposition Deputies suggest turn out to be true and we become aware of it, and people are dissatisfied with the method of appointment of rate collectors, it is still open to the Minister, under the 1926 Act, to make an order requiring that in future these positions be filled through the Local Appointments Commission.  I do not want to start off at that level. I want to put it into the local authority pipeline the same as the other positions and, after some time has passed, if the Opposition feel it is not successful from experience, it can be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong to put it under the Local Appointments Commission straight away.  The right decision is to do it as suggested in the Bill.  I appeal to Deputy Fitzpatrick to give my proposal a chance to operate, knowing that if, at some future date, his is deemed the better way, or that the one I am suggesting does not work, it is very simple to make an order and include it in the Local Appointments Commission list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to assure the House very strongly that, in anything I have said, or, in anything any Deputy has said, no slur is being cast <Col N="2349" /> on any person who acted as a county councillor, or who was appointed as a rate collector, or who offered himself for appointment as a rate collector. There is no positive evidence in my Department of any bribery or malpractices that could be deemed to be illegal.  If there were, action would be taken.  I stated in my introductory remarks that allegations were being made.  The situation as it existed up to now was wide open to allegations because of the system.  It proved an embarrassment, and it is only honest to say it was an embarrassment, and that deep down every county councillor will welcome this move.  The members of local authorities up to now were obliged to operate a system which was laid down for them by law and the fault was in the system, not in the councillors.  The aim of the Bill is to change the system and relieve the councillors of this involvement in individual staff appointments.  So far as rate collectors are concerned, there is, needless to say, no reflection on them, their honesty or their integrity.  Their honesty and integrity are fully recognised.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2353" /> The purpose of the Bill is to raise the statutory limits on the aggregate amounts of money which may be paid to Bord Fáilte for the giving of grants for holiday accommodation and the development of resorts under the major resort development scheme.</P>
    <P>The major resort development scheme was inaugurated under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, which provided for the payment to Bord Fáilte of sums not exceeding in the aggregate £1 million for the giving of grants for the development of major tourist resorts.  Under the scheme the board provide grants to enable such essential work as basic site development, the provision of facilities such as toilets, shelters, car parks, promenades, parks and other recreational activities to be undertaken in places designated for development by the board.  One of the conditions of the scheme is that there must be a minimum local contribution of 20 per cent towards the cost of the development works.</P>
    <P>Initially 12 centres and four areas were designated for development but subsequently one resort area and two resorts were added to the programme. The scheme, which aimed at developing resort amenities on the basis of joint action by the board and local interests involved the selection of areas for development and the formation of acceptable proposals.  The scheme necessitated negotiations with many interests and the planning and execution of substantial programmes of capital works involving financial commitments spread over several years.  These features and the level of funds which could be made available for this work tended to prolong the carrying out of the various development plans and brought the costs of the scheme well beyond the costs first visualised.  In some cases adaptation of planned works to changing patterns and tastes was also a factor.</P>
    <P>By the Tourist Traffic Act, 1966 the financial provision for the resort scheme was increased from the initial £1 million to £3.25 million.  It was intended to allocate £0.75 million of this sum for the initiation of a second major resort scheme but this did not prove possible because of escalation in costs <Col N="2354" /> and changes in development commitments under the first scheme.</P>
    <P>The total amount issued to Bord Fáilte for resort development at the 31st March, 1972, amounted to £3,202,717 and this left a balance of only £47,283 under the limit prescribed for the fund.  A new statutory limit of £4 million is necessary to enable Bord Fáilte to meet their total outstanding commitments in relation to works already commissioned.  The disbursement of the additional £0.75 million over the next few years will bring the first major resort development scheme to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>Before the resort scheme was introduced, public and private investment in the amenity and recreation infrastructure was minimal.  The scheme stimulated the provision of worthwhile tourist facilities in the places designated i.e. Galway/Salthill, Killarney, Bray, Dún Laoghaire, Tramore, Skerries, Kilkee, Youghal, Ballybunion, Lahinch, Arklow, Lisdoonvarna, Westport and Greystones as well as in the resort area of West Cork, County Donegal, Achill Island, the Dingle Peninsula and the River Shannon and Lakes.</P>
    <P>The grants scheme for the development of holiday accommodation was also introduced under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959.  Provision was made in that Act for giving £500,000 to Bord Fáilte for that purpose.  As a result of the provision of these funds, Bord Fáilte operated a scheme of grants with the approval of the Ministers for Transport and Power and Finance.  As the tourist industry developed and accommodation needs expanded, the scheme was appraised and adapted, including the improvement in 1967 of the scale of incentives. The Tourist Traffic Acts 1963, 1966, 1968 and 1970 permitted a series of increases in the aggregate amounts provided for accommodation development which brought the initial provision from £500,000 to £11 million. The total amount issued to Bord Fáilte for accommodation development grants to 31st March, 1972, was £9.23 million, which leaves a balance of £1.77 million before the statutory limit of £11 million is exhausted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2355" /> As I have explained to the House on a number of occasions, Bord Fáilte have not been taking on new grant commitments in respect of hotel and guest house development since mid-1969. In the meantime, the moneys voted for holiday accommodation grants have been used by the board to reduce the backlog of grants due to developers and a considerable reduction on outstanding commitments has been effected.  Since mid-1969 the board has paid £5.63 million in reduction of the backlog.  No developer at present is being held up because of shortage of grant funds and this has been the situation since 1971.  Outstanding commitments now relate only to projects on which payments have not yet matured.  These commitments will be cleared over the next few years but this necessitates an increase in the statutory limit on funds for the development of holiday accommodation. The Bill proposes to increase the statutory limit from £11 million to £13 million to enable Bord Fáilte to meet outstanding commitments.</P>
    <P>Expenditure to date by Bord Fáilte amounting to almost £10 million on accommodation grants has generated a total investment of over £60 million on hotels, and guesthouses, caravan and camping sites and holiday cottages. The number of bedrooms in hotels and guesthouses has increased from 17,800 in 1960 to 28,885 in 1972 and the existing volume of accommodation is considered to be adequate for the industry's needs for the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the major resort development and accommodation development schemes 13 years ago, increasing material prosperity has stimulated new consumer demands in all fields of activity including holiday making.  For example, distance limits on holiday travel have practically ceased to exist even for people of quite moderate means.  In addition to general change, changes in detail which have had a pronounced effect on Irish tourism include:</P>
    <P>(a)  Serious damage to our markets in Britain and Northern Ireland attributable to events in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2356" /> (b)  The increasing proportion of Continental visitors and the need to cater for this new type of customer.</P>
    <P>(c)  The ending of our &ldquo;island&rdquo; status with the introduction of vehicle ferry services.</P>
    <P>(d)  The greater wish for holiday mobility and the consequent popularty of the independent touring holiday.</P>
    <P>(e)  The recession in coach tour business.</P>
    <P>(f)  The increasing popularity of do-it-yourself holidays whether camping, caravanning or in purposebuilt rented accommodation, and</P>
    <P>(g)  The demand for more varied entertainment.</P>
    <P>In view of these influential factors and with the discharge of all outstanding commitments in relation to major resorts and accommodation development in sight, I consider it both opportune and desirable that a comprehensive review of progress to date should be carried out with a view to developing, if necessary, a completely fresh approach to accommodation and resort infrastructural needs for the future.  Bord Fáilte are at present carrying out this study and in the course of it they are taking account of their own experience and of a number of studies and consultancy research reports on physical planning, accommodation development and tourists' needs.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will enable Bord Fáilte to complete major resort and accommodation development projects.  The limits of £4 million for resort development and £13 million for accommodation development proposed in the Bill do not include any funds for new schemes. By the time the limits included in the Bill have been reached, Bord Fáilte will have come to firm conclusions on the direction which further development should take.  Proposals for continuing assistance in some form for accommodation and resort development are likely to emerge from the board's studies.  The implementation of any such proposals will, of course, need further legislation and Deputies <Col N="2357" /> will get an opportunity to debate in full any proposals for further financial provision for accommodation and resort development.</P>
    <P>I consider it appropriate at this stage to say something about the present tourism situation.  Deputies are aware of the difficulties confronting the industry since 1969 when the unrest in Northern Ireland became aggravated. Tourism revenue in that year was £98.7 million and represented an increase of £5.7 million on the 1968 figure.  Tourism revenue fell in 1970 to £96 million and rose in 1971 to £100.8 million.  On the basis of constant 1970 prices the 1971 figure represents a fall of close on 4 per cent on the 1970 figure.  Bord Fáilte have forecast a revenue of £87.9 million for 1972.</P>
    <P>These figures were only achieved through the massive amount of development, promotional and marketing work undertaken by all the interests concerned.  Full credit is due to Bord Fáilte, the regional tourism organisations and all other interests in the industry for their performance over the past few years in very difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are yet no strong indications of a very early return to stable conditions in Northern Ireland.  Bord Fáilte are, however, optimistic about a resumption of tourism growth and they have set a target of an increase of £6.9 million for 1973 to bring tourism revenue exclusive of carrier receipts in that year to £69.2 million at constant 1972 prices.  The board are undertaking an ambitious promotional programme for 1973. Their programme involves advertising in Britain, North America and the Continent.  New marketing literature for their overseas market is being prepared. Promotional work in the new Continental market areas is being extended. The board is guaranteeing the quality of a programme of holidays offered in Britain and they have appointed public relations consultants for that market area.  The board are trying to increase significantly, in cooperation with carriers and other sectors, the number of travel writers, radio and television units and travel agents <Col N="2358" /> to sample the holidays to be offered to tourists here in 1973.  The convention bureau is endeavouring to increase the number of conferences and incentive travel visits.</P>
    <P>Every possible effort is being made to improve the Irish tourist product and the flow of visitors to Ireland.  I hope that it will not be long before the industry again enjoys the growth trends of the early 1960's.  The industry is sound and I am convinced that it will emerge much stronger from the difficulties it had to face in the past few years.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to thank the very many Irish people who spent their holidays at home in Ireland in 1972.  Bord Fáilte estimate that tourism revenue from this source in 1972 will be about £18.7 million.  On this basis, the &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; programme was a success and it is the board's intention to develop strongly this section of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill will facilitate the provision of important tourism facilities and I, therefore, confidently recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask a simple question.  The Minister said that Bord Fáilte forecast a revenue of £87.9 million for 1972.  I take it this is at 1972 prices.  It is of some significance from the point of view of the figures he was reading out just before that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at this Bill against the background of the present difficulties in the tourist industry, the various adverse factors which exist and the immediate long-term needs of the industry, I regard the Bill, with all due respect, as a huge joke.  Two years ago, in July of 1970, we had another tourist Bill.  This Bill relates specifically to the provision of extra <Col N="2359" /> financial accommodation for resort and accommodation development.  I strongly object to the Bill and I am most disappointed that the Minister did not avail himself of this opportunity to take into account all the other very serious factors and the need for legislative measures to enable the tourist industry to overcome its present difficulties and meet the new challenges.  The major problem confronting the Irish tourist industry is the generation of the additional tourist traffic necessary to utilise existing facilities.</P>
      <P>While technically there may be a need for the two main provisions in the Bill, I submit that there is need for other, far more important measures also.  After all the discussions that have taken place in the last two years, after all the surveys that have been commissioned by Bord Fáilte, I cannot understand why it has not been found possible to introduce a comprehensive Tourist Traffic Bill which would gear the industry to meet the new challenges.</P>
      <P>Normally I would give the Minister all Stages of a Bill of this kind.  I cannot on this occasion do so.  I must fault the Bill and the flimsy introductory statement and the short review of the tourist industry.  The Minister listed seven or eight problems facing the industry, one of which is the serious damage to our markets in Britain and Northern Ireland attributable to events in Northern Ireland. There are many other factors of which the Minister is well aware which have adversely affected the tourist industry. The Minister made no mention whatever of one factor which is recognised by those engaged in the industry and has been mentioned by Bord Fáilte as being a major factor, that is, the question of transport charges particularly between Britain and Europe and this country.  There has been no reference by the Minister to the insidious inflationary spiral which has occurred over the last year or two and which has had a big impact on the competitiveness of Irish holidays in foreign markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to say that I am reluctant <Col N="2360" /> to approve of any financial measure for Bord Fáilte because Bord Fáilte has lost a good deal of confidence. It has lost the confidence of the people directly involved in the industry. Unless there is a major shake up and drastic changes I cannot see how we could be justified in giving Bord Fáilte additional financial facilities particularly having regard to the series of major blunders that have been made by this body that is responsible for tourism, even over the past month.  How can we have confidence in an Irish tourist board which, at the end of the 1972 season issues its report for 1971?  How can we have confidence in and provide extra financial facilities for a board which issued a restaurant guide recently at a total cost of £3,000 which, following public outcry, had to be withdrawn and consigned to the wastepaper basket?  How can we have confidence in a board which poured £10,000 down the drain for an abortive survey by Messrs.  Hill, American consultants?  Bord Fáilte could ill afford that expenditure because they were on a very stringent budget, particularly for publicity purposes. This £10,000 was expended on what the Minister said was a preliminary report into the feasibility of setting up a national tourist agency.</P>
    <P>These are some of the blunders that have been made by the tourist board. I do not know to what extent the Minister is responsible or to what degree he is to be blamed for this situation.  After all the trials and difficulties the Irish tourist industry has experienced since 1969, Bord Fáilte should not make blunders of this kind. There have been other examples.  I do not want to go into detail and to name names but I could do so if I wanted to.</P>
    <P>Despite all the difficulties of marketing and so forth the board have left several important sales posts in Britain and North America vacant for the past 12 months.  One or two have been vacant for two years.  Despite all the talk about attracting our exiles in Britain there is no ethnic or travel officer attached to Bord Fáilte and there has not been for the past six months.  How can we have confidence <Col N="2361" /> in an organisation which is guilty of these blunders?  How can we be expected to vote additional money for it or to give it the financial facilities sought in the Bill?</P>
    <P>I have had much contact with Bord Fáilte in the past six or seven years.  I like to give credit where credit is due. I find myself in the invidious position of having to say what I have said.  I have to be critical of performance on the part of this State-sponsored body. The Minister must accept responsibility because in the final analysis he is the person responsible for the welfare of the Irish tourist industry.  This industry employs 160,000 persons and is a very important part of our economy.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying to the debate I hope he will elaborate and give us something more than the sketchy review that he has given us. I do not know why the mistakes were made.  Have we any guarantee that similar mistakes will not be made in future and that public money will not be poured down the drain in futile exercises?</P>
    <P>There is illustrated by this Bill another aspect of the work and thinking of Bord Fáilte.  The Minister said that Bord Fáilte has ceased to give grants for new hotels in the last couple of years but we have to meet a bill for a colossal backlog of grants and other financial facilities made available.  I cannot understand how this backlog accumulated or why Bord Fáilte entered into financial commitments with certain people.  Obviously, the board exceeded its annual allocation for accommodation.  Obviously, the board gave grants to persons without having the necessary funds.</P>
    <P>The worst aspect of the whole thing is that Bord Fáilte gave grants for the development of hotel accommodation and continued to do so when it was obvious that we had too many hotels. They continued to give grants or enter into commitments to pay grants for hotels of a type of which we have too many and for which the demand was definitely easing off.  Surely it should have been possible for Bord Fáilte with all the expertise at its command to make a proper assessment of market <Col N="2362" /> demand and trends and to have seen long before entering into many of these commitments that the demand for the more luxurious type of hotels was limited.</P>
    <P>We now find that there is a backlog of grants to be paid and commitments to be met and at the same time half the country's hotels are idle and a considerable number of them are up for sale including many for which substantial grants were paid by the Irish people.  When I look at the annual report which came out last week and which relates to 1971 and should have been out four or five months ago, I see the list of people and projects in respect of which grants were paid.  I did a brief analysis of this and I find that accommodation grants are listed under different categories: hotels, guest houses, caravan parks, student accommodation, holiday camps, holiday villages and An Óige youth hostels.  I find that of the £2.8 million allocated to accommodation, over £2 million went to hotels.  In fact, my estimation is that £2.3 million was paid out in hotel grants and that the other half million was divided among guest houses, caravan parks, youth hostels, holiday camps and so on.  This £500,000 includes £126,000 in respect of the renta-cottage scheme.  I should like the Minister to explain how it came about that Bord Fáilte continued to approve for grants a huge number of new hotel developments when it should have been obvious to them that we had too many of this type of hotel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the outset that Bord Fáilte had ceased giving new grants in 1969 but I do not think what the Minister has said totally invalidates the argument I am making because the downward trend in Irish tourist traffic began in 1966.  In a public statement issued by a top official of Bord Fáilte, a copy of which I got recently, this was openly admitted.  It is not all attributable to the troubles in the North.  Even then, it should have been obvious that we were heading for saturation point in regard to hotels.  I believe too many hotels were built and that Bord Fáilte made a mistake in sanctioning grants for so many of them.</P>
      <P>One hears another criticism very often and from the limited investigation I have personally carried out I am inclined to agree with it.  It is that not merely did Bord Fáilte approve grants for new hotels where hotels were not needed but they gave grants to people who had no previous, practical experience of the industry.  Too many speculators, get-rich-quick merchants and fly-by-night men got hotel grants.  Signs on, when difficulties arose and adverse factors began to operate these were the people who ran.  Those who owned family hotels and had a long family connection with the industry, people who had invested their lives and their family's interests in hotels stood their ground.  The others deserted: many of them got out before the going became really bad.</P>
      <P>Not only were grants given to people without training or experience in the industry, people who were merely speculators but, because of their lack of any real interest other than financial in those hotels, standards of service and so on were not maintained.  Their entry into the industry affected standards adversely and in many cases they gave a bad name to the Irish hotel industry which reflected on the tourist industry generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have too many hotels of the wrong type.  There is serious under-utilisation of existing hotel <Col N="2364" /> accommodation on the one hand and a shortage of other types of accommodation for which there is a growing demand on the other hand.  I have a list of what I regard as the correct order of priority to be observed in any future spending for accommodation development.  I think that is very relevant to the present Bill.  First, priority should be given to the small family hotel under owner supervision. Because of the proprietor's supervision or because of the family's involvement in the hotel, prices are kept under reasonable control.  There will be a growing demand for this type of hotel and, consequently, all available resources should be diverted to this kind of accommodation.  This will encourage owners to modernise their premises and to extend their accommodation.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte must not only consider a project from the point of view of location but they must consider the person's suitability to manage this kind of hotel.  The IDA consider not only the project itself; the credibility, suitability and capacity of the industrialist is examined.</P>
    <P>I would give priority also to guest-house and farmhouse accommodation. This year a remarkable feature of the tourist season has been the tremendous demand for this kind of accommodation, and this has been very noticeable in the better known tourist areas.  In addition, there is a growing demand for facilities for caravan parks and more money will have to be given to help in this regard. Additional help will be needed to improve camping facilities also.</P>
    <P>A total of £34,000 has been paid to An Oige youth hostels.  Mention has been made of hostels in Donegal, Cork, Mayo, Kerry and Clare.  The Minister is aware of a project in Limerick.  He has met a deputation in connection with this matter and has been in correspondence with them but we are disappointed that it was not possible to increase the grant given in this instance.  The people in this case have been given a 50 per cent grant because the area is not in the western development area.  A strong case was put to the Minister for additional funds for <Col N="2365" /> this kind of accommodation in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The role of youth hostels and the contribution of An Oige to tourism is not appreciated fully.  In assessing the accommodation needs in the future in the tourist industry it is important that notice be taken of An Oige and of its potential for generating additional tourist traffic.  Although the young people who travel from country to country under the auspices of the International Youth Hostel Organisation may not have much money to spend as most of them are students, they are the potential tourists of the future. Despite all the adverse factors of the last few years, these young people have flocked to this country and the number availing of An Oige facilities has risen considerably.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be parochial in a debate of this kind but I have an obligation to my constituents.  I would ask the Minister to re-examine the case of the An Oige hostel at Limerick.  In this area a tremendous voluntary organisation have raised a considerable amount of money.  A grant of 50 per cent may appear generous but as all the work is done on a voluntary basis the balance required is prohibitive. Perhaps the Minister might find within the resources of Bord Fáilte, of the Shannon Development Company or the regional tourism organisation a few extra thousand pounds.  This would make it much easier to set up the hostel.</P>
    <P>The Irish tourist industry is at the crossroads.  It can remain in the doldrums or it can go forward and grasp the new opportunities opening up in foreign markets, particularly in Europe.  There are tremendous and exciting possibilities for us in the European market.  At the moment when prospects are looking brighter for Irish tourism in foreign markets than at any time since 1966, it is regrettable that the industry at home and the organisations responsible for administration are in a state of chaos and confusion.  Public confidence in organisations such as Bord Fáilte has been undermined.  The tourist industry can overcome present difficulties and move forward to grasp the new opportunities <Col N="2366" /> but changes are necessary.  This kind of Bill is a waste of time because it will not effect any change in the whole approach to tourism development or marketing.</P>
    <P>Certain basic measures must be taken by the Government and by the Minister.  In the course of his speech the Minister said Bord Fáilte were having a close look at the situation and he referred to this matter at Question Time also.  He stated new proposals were about to be made by Bord Fáilte. The Minister today at Question Time said, though not in so many words, that Bord Fáilte are examining themselves.  The Minister said on the 23rd July, 1970&mdash; volume 248, column 1987, of the Official Report&mdash;that the same thing was happening.  He said then:</P>
    <P>I asked Bord Fáilte and the deputation from the Irish Hotels Federation, after very long discussions I had with each body, to prepare for me complete appraisal in depth of where they see the future of the tourist industry for next year and over the next five years.  Each body has promised to have its report to me before the middle of September.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any report has ever been issued.  Now we find that Bord Fáilte are again about to issue a report.  I believe that the time has now come when something more than internal reports commissioned by Bord Fáilte is needed.  The public never sees them except when we hear about abortive ones like the Hill survey which cost £10,000.  What is necessary now is a comprehensive examination of the entire industry, a comprehensive examination of Bord Fáilte and their performance, a comprehensive examination of the other State-sponsored bodies which are involved in tourism such as Aer Lingus, B &amp; I, CIE and the Shannon Development Company. It is vitally important that Bord Fáilte should be restructured and reorganised and the lines of communication with and the relationship between Bord Fáilte and the other State-sponsored bodies and the private sector of the industry rationalised, reorganised and transformed into a new dynamic national effort.  The Minister has a <Col N="2367" /> precedent for achieving this, to which I referred briefly at Question Time.  I hope the Government will not come into the Dáil again with the type of effort contained in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said more than I realised.  I was just concluding. The time has now come when there will have to be a major reform, not internal surveys.  I am thinking in terms of the Fletcher Commission which the Minister set up to examine the ESB.  I personally called for that and the Minister agreed to it.  The report was a very interesting document because it came down very heavily in favour of the ESB.  It did a lot of good in informing public opinion on the exact role of the ESB.  I am asking the Minister to set up immediately a commission of four, five or six people who have practical experience in the industry.  I have no objection to one or two experts from abroad.  They should be given the task of examining the tourist industry, assessing the performance <Col N="2368" /> and functions of Bord Fáilte and the other State-sponsored bodies. They should issue a report to the Minister as quickly as possible and based on that a new development plan for tourism should be formulated by the Government.  I believe that any other type of examination will not have the confidence of the public.  I certainly will not have confidence in it.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister then, before he takes any other step, to set up an independent inquiry into the whole tourist industry particularly in relation to the performance of Bord Fáilte and into the very great problem area of the relationship between Bord Fáilte and the other State-sponsored bodies, particularly those in the transport sector, so that we will avoid a situation such as happened in the past year when CIE pulled out of Britain when they should not have done so and when air fares across channel were going up continuously.  While it may be in the commercial interests of Aer Lingus to increase fares it is having an adverse effect on the tourist industry.  The Minister, before he moves to a higher office, would be doing a valuable job for the tourist industry if he set up this commission of inquiry and then let the Government proceed to formulate a realistic, dynamic development plan which would enable this major industry to overcome its present difficulties and to grasp the new opportunities which now present themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has come in once again with a Bill which simply asks for an increase in the allocation to one of the State-sponsored companies.  In doing so he presents us with the results of the trading of that company, without giving us an opportunity of going into detail with the people involved in the running of this company, as to how they performed their functions and how these requirements came about.  I am simply saying that over the years we in this party, as well as Deputies in the Fine Gael Party, have been asking for some method whereby parties in Dáil Éireann could examine the accounts of semi-State bodies, perhaps by a committee system such as we have in the Committee of Public <Col N="2369" /> Accounts.  In that way certain of the remarks that we make, perhaps in error at times, need not be made and certain of the criticisms made in this House could be avoided, but we have not got the information to hand to do the job the way we would like to do it.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have read the Minister's statement must accept that there is justification for voting more money so that Bord Fáilte can do the job they are hoping to do.  The request comes under two headings: resort development and an increase in holiday accommodation grants.  If we refer to the Bord Fáilte annual report in the index, we find that in the area covering the major resort programme details are given of expenditure on resort development since 1958.  The total listed there comes to £2,957,600, almost £3 million.  The Minister is now looking for an allocation of £4 million to cover the extra expenditure required.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us:</P>
      <P>A new statutory limit of £4 million is necessary to enable Bord Fáilte to meet its total outstanding commitments in relation to works already commissioned.  The disbursement of the additional £0.75 million over the next few years will bring the first major resort development scheme to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>When we refer to the annual report which has just been published belatedly, we find that details of work in progress by the board amount to just under £¼ million.  It is only fair that either Bord Fáilte or the Minister should give details of the additional money, where it is to be spent and what work it is to be spent on.  The Minister is looking for £1 million over and above what has already been spent and details of what it is to be spent on are listed on page 37 of the annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking into consideration the complete resort programme since 1958, a sum of £3 million for that type of operation is very small.  One of the problems facing us is that our investment in resort development has been far too small.  It has been piecemeal in its disbursement. <Col N="2370" /> As the Minister suggests, completely new thinking on the expenditure of money on resort development is needed right now.  Looking at the expenditure over the years, we find that a lot of money has been spent on new golf clubhouses in places like Ballybunion, Bundoran, Greencastle and Salthill.  There must be over a dozen items of expenditure on that type of recreation.  There are over 250 golf courses in Ireland.  I am not given any indication in the annual report, or in the Minister's statement, why such places are picked out to have money spent on them while, at the same time, the expenditure of money on swimming pools would seem to me to be far better.  It would facilitate far more people in the tourist business to have swimming pools not only in seaside resorts, where rivers and the sea are becoming increasingly polluted, but also in many inland towns and near some of the waterways which are used by cruising yachts and other craft.  That type of investment has not been followed through.  I cannot understand why money should be spent on a golf course in one town and not in another.</P>
    <P>I was at a conference in Galway last year and about 50 of us went on an outing to the golf course in Salthill. We were told that we could not get the course for an afternoon in a certain week in June.  In this area quite a sizeable amount of public money was spent from the resort development budget and yet a conference, spending quite a large amount of money in one of our major tourist areas, could not avail of facilities on which public money was spent.  If money is being spent out of the public purse the Minister or Bord Fáilte should see that the tourist development board is represented on the committee and that the people who want to use the facilities are catered for.  In some areas this facility is given. Every facility was given to the same conference this year in Waterford and Tramore.  Golfing and swimming facilities were provided by the local tourist development authority.</P>
    <P>As I said, the details of resort development are given from 1958 and in the next couple of pages of the annual report details of accommodation <Col N="2371" /> grants are given for only one year. If the board felt it necessary to list their achievements and expenditure on resort development grants, they should also have given us details of grants to hotels from the same date in 1958. That would help us to appreciate the work being done by the board.  One of our criticisms is that the information we have is not sufficient.  I have a certain interest in tourism, coming from a tourist area, and I should like to know the full extent of the investment by Bord Fáilte not only in my constituency and county but in other counties, so that I could compare one area with another.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy will be talking to the Minister shortly.  Perhaps the Minister could have put pressure on them to give us the full story. Something like £11 million is involved. When we see the amount of money that has been expended by Bord Fáilte &mdash;and we are now voting them more&mdash; it is only right that we should make some reference to the fact that the charges in many of the hotels which receive this money bear no relation to the charges in other hotels.  Surely if we are trying to attract people from outside the country to our hotels, and also locally, there should be some relationship between the prices charged in all our grade A hotels.</P>
      <P>I have seen the programmes for the Christmas period and I suppose it is hoped to attract people away from the chore of preparing Christmas meals and to give more free time to everybody in the family.  Some of these very attractive programmes are more economical in the private hotels than in the semi-State hotels such as those in the Great Southern group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find that in Killarney and Galway prices are about 20 to 33? per cent dearer than those in a comparable hotel near the city of Dublin, a hotel <Col N="2372" /> such as the Opperman as compared with the Great Southern in Killarney. I cannot understand why a person should pay £48 for his Christmas holiday in Killarney and £36 in the Opperman.  I think that both hotels must be of a reasonably level standard of operation and I believe that this is the type of thing that, perhaps, is discouraging people from availing of the many offers which could be more attractive if they were reasonably priced.</P>
    <P>We have belatedly discovered that there are people in Ireland who do go on holidays and if there is one thing which the Northern Ireland situation brought about, it was the realisation by the people in Bord Fáilte that Irish people do go on holidays and the fact that they found they had to turn their attention to the Irish market proved how lucrative a market it really is.  The Minister in his concluding remarks pointed out that £18 million was spent by local tourists in the hotels of Ireland.  Up to a couple of years ago, this type of tourist was frankly discouraged from going to the major resort hotels in Ireland and it is very strange that in a time of very high inflation, hotel costs could be reduced drastically in the last year to attract people to them because of the few visitors coming particularly from Great Britain and to a lesser extent, from America and attractive holidays offered to Irish people.</P>
    <P>This discovery as the name suggests in &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; has been made by Bord Fáilte more than by the people themselves.  The Irish tourist was quite willing to spend his money here at home but very attractive offers made by the travel agents here were taking many people away from this country who would otherwise have gone to resorts a matter of a hundred miles from their own doorsteps, but I believe the very artificially high charges around 1969 and 1968 simply discouraged people from taking that type of holiday and I am glad to see that they are now realising that there is money to be made in this way and that the Irish pound is as good in their pockets as the pound of anybody else.</P>
    <P>The Minister listed a number of <Col N="2373" /> problems that seem to be besetting the industry and I should like to comment on one or two.  He does not admit that they are problems.  He says: In addition to general change, changes in detail which have had a pronounced effect on Irish tourism include:</P>
    <P>(a) Serious damage to our markets in Britain and Northern Ireland attributable to events in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Of course, we must admit this as anybody would have to admit that the Northern problem has been a serious setback for the industry, and, indeed, we should all hope that for itself alone the Northern Ireland problem would clear up and anybody in the holiday industry will certainly for his own future hope that there is a settling of this grievous problem.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, back in 1969 there were clouds on the horizon for the Irish tourist industry.  Cost inflation was having a disincentive effect on the tourist.  More attractive packages elsewhere in other markets, particularly Spain and France, were taking away the traditional English customer and I believe that at that stage the tourist board should have been taking action, but it would be wrong to blame on the Northern troubles the complete decline in the tourist industry which has occurred. I believe that the clouds were on the horizon in 1969, and if we do not have this new look at the industry which the Minister has now promised, these clouds will get larger particularly because of the cost inflation occurring in the country and the fact that we now find hotels making a new claim for increases in prices, which is certainly going to drive more people who were beginning to think of holidays at home to look to the travel agents for a foreign holiday and certainly make it less attractive for the foreigner in future to come to this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the ending of our &ldquo;island&rdquo; status with the introduction of the vehicle ferry services. I should have thought that this was an advantage rather than a disadvantage to our tourist industry and, perhaps, the Minister may consider that <Col N="2374" /> too when he listed it, because he has not said that these are disincentive effects on the tourist industry but listed them as details affecting the industry.  This is one field that should be catered for in greater degree as conditions return to normal in this country.  The type of holiday now has completely changed.  The person from abroad particularly does not take the usual fortnight's holiday in one place. He wants to see as much of the countryside as he can and, therefore, people, particularly from Britain, are bringing their cars with them.  This creates its own problem because we have always put ourselves forward as a country where there are practically empty roads with lots of room for holiday traffic and anybody will agree that now even without tourists the roads are being much more used. There is a big increase particularly in heavy lorry traffic which makes driving much more strenuous and, therefore, creates a greater need for the type of stopping places, roadhouses, which are becoming increasingly popular in Britain to cater for this type of tourist if we are to encourage them to come.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the complete recession which took place in the coach tour business and I believe this could be improved if we availed of the opportunity to promote the Shannon area, and Shannon Airport particularly, as an area for charter flights.  I do not think enough was done on this.  We have the problem of Shannon Airport at the moment still with us and the American problem of over-flying Shannon and if some opportunity were taken to establish Shannon at this time as an airport for charter flights, it would help not only in resolving to some extent the problem of Shannon but also give an impetus to the coach tour business.</P>
    <P>People on the Continent are becoming aware of Ireland as a holiday centre and one of the most popular holidays on the Continent is the camping holiday.  I do not believe we know much about this at the moment but I believe that if we are serious about bringing people from the Continent of Europe, we will have to develop this end of our tourist business.  This is <Col N="2375" /> one of the advantages that should accrue from EEC membership.  There has been an increase in the number of tourists coming from the Continent and this is an area which gives scope for expansion in so far as the industry is concerned so we should do everything possible to encourage this trend. I understand that it is intended to devote extra expenditure in this direction.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to vote this extra money to Bord Fáilte but there is one matter on which I should like to comment and that is in respect of a brochure issued by the board and which has been mentioned here already.  I refer to the guide <i>Where to Eat in Ireland</i>.  When we learned from Press reports of the production of this booklet we considered the idea to be an excellent one but having heard that it was recalled at very short notice, it it only fair that we should be told the full story.  We hear rumours to the effect that certain persons intended taking legal action against the board.  I do not know what was the situation but there is a need for a guide of that type.  At least it is of assistance to people visiting the country to know where they can have a decent meal. The guide has been replaced by a flimsy document entitled <i>Restaurants.</i> Since public money was spent on the production of the original document why could Bord Fáilte not have spoken up and said they believed that the guide was a good one and that they intended leaving it on the market? Why was it recalled?  The Minister should be able to give us some answer to that.  If he cannot do so he should ask the board what was the reason. The public are very much aware of money spent on such items and those people living in small tourist areas who are doing their best to promote their areas must be embittered at the thought of £3,000 being spent on a document which was withdrawn at very short notice.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked in the House recently regarding the expenditure of £10,000 by Bord Fáilte on a report on travel facilities in other countries.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General <Col N="2376" /> considered it necessary to indicate in his report that the board had no right to spend that money it is our business here to raise the matter with the Minister so as to ascertain the facts.  Were CIE either unwilling or unable to pay that bill?  If we have a public company that run up bills abroad and who are then unable to meet them, surely they are creating a very bad impression of us.  There should not have been this type of wrangling regarding the payment of a bill to a company if that company provided a service.  On the other hand, if the company did not provide the service required of them, why pay them anything at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I intend to be brief.  I understand that the additional moneys we are being asked to vote now are for projects which were commissioned in 1969.  Considering the matter in that light, we are under an obligation to honour these commitments but we must have regard to the fact that this money was estimated against a different background to what is the position today.  No section of industry has gone through greater difficulties than has the tourist industry. Although there may be other factors which contributed to this, we must accept that the major factor has been the Northern situation.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has travelled throughout the country both this year and last year, especially the south and west of Ireland and who has spoken to hoteliers, will be aware that these people blame the Northern situation for their problems.  Of course, inflation plays a part in the difficulty but that was by no means the main factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking through the list of grants that have been paid to various hotels throughout the country, I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that we have gone too far in respect of the grants paid to hotels of a certain type.  We should direct our attention and our finances to the medium-sized hotels because the tourists who avail of these hotels are those we endeavour to bring into the country.  We are aiming at bringing more British and European tourists here and we should ensure <Col N="2377" /> that medium-sized hotel accommodation is available for them.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to note the grants that were paid to some Dublin hotels.  Although the estimates referred to 1969, I can see that a substantial amount of money has been paid in grants to leading hotels in Dublin and to some new hotels that have opened within the past 12 or 18 months.  However, grants have been made available to hotels in Dublin which have since closed down and have been sold for office blocks and other development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This is a ludicrous situation and steps should be taken to ensure that it is discontinued.  From the list we see that about £200,000 has been given by way of grants to large hotels in Dublin. Some of these hotels occupy prominent parts of the city centre and should be well able to pay their own way.  We should ensure that in future grants given to any such hotels are small. When I see a hotel such as Jury's closing while two new ones are opening in the area, there is something wrong with the system that we are permitting.  There are hotels throughout the country that are of a very luxurious type and from now on we should endeavour to ensure that there will not be any more of these hotels opening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should concentrate on staffing existing hotels.  The staffing of our hotels, especially the middle-grade ones, is not of a sufficiently high standard. Top-class hotels, because of the exorbitant prices they charge, are in a position to recruit top-class staff but this is not so in respect of the middle-class hotel.  We should concentrate on the best ways to train hotel managers for the task of recruiting suitable staff. There is always difficulty in this respect where trade is seasonal especially in regard to retaining good permanent staff.  Where there is not all-year-round trade staff have to be dismissed for four or five months of the year and this does not lend itself to good staffing. We must encourage our hoteliers to extend the season as much as possible. <Col N="2378" /> They should endeavour to extend it into the winter season, when there is hunting, fishing, golfing and shooting. The special rate week-ends offered by hotels in many parts of the country are proving very successful.  Invariably the hotels that prove the greatest attraction are those with indoor swimming pools, sauna baths, an adjoining golf course and fishing.  We should try to encourage this kind of winter hotel.  If that were done the staffing situation would improve because the staff would be guaranteed all the year round employment. More money must be channelled into CERT.  It is no use building hotels if they cannot be properly staffed.  It is in the medium sized hotels we are falling down from the point of view of good service. Hoteliers should be encouraged to send their staffs to be trained in the winter season, even if the employees have to be paid during that training period.</P>
    <P>We have always had keen competition especially from the Continent. We are at a disadvantage in this respect because the standard of wages and conditions generally in Continental hotels are very, very low.  The staffs work very long hours for quite small wages.  I know that prices are increasing by at least 10 per cent per year on the Continent and, from that point of view, we will eventually find ourselves in a more advantageous competitive position.  At the moment we are at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>We should also try to encourage more farmhouse accommodation.  Any money given for this purpose will be money well spent.  Seminars should be held to encourage more farmers to take in tourists.  Those who have availed of these holidays have enjoyed them immensely.  Very often this is the first real experience these people have of living in the country.  We should encourage this kind of holiday.</P>
    <P>We should also encourage our hoteliers to employ some staff who can speak a Continental language. This is very essential now that we are entering the Common Market.  When one is abroad one appreciates the advantage it is to find some member of the staff who can converse with one in one's own language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2379" /> We must keep up the pressure from the point of view of publicity.  We know the resilience of the organisation. Over the past 12 months Bord Fáilte are to be congratulated on their publicity campaign in Britain, Scotland and elsewhere.  The situation was very difficult but the results were excellent.  We should not be too critical when times are bad.  Times will not always be bad.  When we get back on an even keel tourism will be one of our most important industries. Were it not for the tragic situation in Northern Ireland over the past two years I am convinced we would have attained the projections forecast three years ago.  We were gearing ourselves along the right lines and getting a good reputation aboard.  We have amenities that are not available in other countries.  I believe the good times will return and, when they do, we must press ahead with all the amenities we can offer.  I wish the Minister every success.  He has a very difficult year ahead, but he must not get depressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I should like to make.  As far as accommodation is concerned we have, I believe, reached saturation point and I would prefer to see grants made available in future for the development of amenities in the different tourist centres.  The first complaint made by tourists, especially those from the Continent, is that there are no amenities when the weather is bad.  Bord Fáilte should draw up now a three-year or a five-year plan to develop amenities in the different localities.  In European holiday resorts one finds casinos, late night drinking and other forms of entertainment.  These are things this country has made no effort to provide so far.  If people want to spend their money in that way, we should have no objection.  It should be possible for Bord Fáilte to issue a licence with special conditions attaching to it in respect of premises where such gambling would take place.  As <Col N="2380" /> the Minister knows, the type of entertainment that I am advocating is available on the Continent.  We should knock down the protective wall we have erected around ourselves.  We must face reality.  If there were proper supervision, the type of entertainment I have in mind would not interfere with the life of the community.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputies who have said that it is not desirable to provide 400-and 300-bedroom hotels.  Visitors whom I met this year who stayed in family type hotels were very satisfied because in these hotels they did not get the impression that they were merely a number staying in a certain room.</P>
      <P>There is wide variation in the prices of meals.  There could be a difference of £10 in respect of a dinner for four persons.  There are complaints about overcharging.  The Bord Fáilte brochure should indicate the charges for meals at various hotels.  The Minister did not mention the regional boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>The regional boards in some areas have outlived their usefulness. Any tourist board should incorporate in its constitution that membership will be for a limited period only. It is undesirable that the membership should remain the same for years.  I would exclude the manager of the region from these remarks.  If there were an annual change of personnel, new ideas would be brought into play and there would be fresh enthusiasm. There is a monopoly.  I was a member of the Ivernia Regional Board for 12 months.  I attended the annual general meeting of the board.  I was sitting pretty because I did not have to be re-elected at that meeting, as I was chairman of the county council.  Electors came in with their pockets full of votes.  There should be direct elections and voting by proxy should not be allowed.  The Minister should endeavour to get new blood into these boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 10 per cent service charge as a separate item in a hotel bill should be abolished.  The charge should be included <Col N="2381" /> in the cost of a meal.  Is the service charge going back to the staff?  I have very grave misgivings about it. In the case of seasonal hotels the staff would not be there all the year round. Do Bord Fáilte distribute the money represented by the 10 per cent service charge to hotel workers as a Christmas box?  Where does the money go?  Perhaps the Minister would say if there is any supervision over the distribution of this money.</P>
    <P>There should be a Minister for Tourism.  I asked the Taoiseach three or four weeks ago if it was the intention to appoint a Minister for Tourism.  The reply was in the negative. Tourism, which is the second largest industry, should be treated as such by the Taoiseach.  I hope that in the near future tourism will cease to be regarded as the Cinderella as far as Government policy is concerned. Too much money has been sunk into it in grants and loans and the State should be taking proper interest in protecting that investment.  Bord Fáilte are being severely criticised throughout the country.  Admittedly, we have a situation at present which is not helping Bord Fáilte but they should have seen that there was no point in plugging the English market and should have gone to the Continent to sell their wares, so to speak.</P>
    <P>Amenities, in my opinion, are very important now.  If the Minister has any influence with the Minister for Justice he should have a chat with him in regard to Sunday drinking hours.  It is ridiculous in this age that on Sunday evenings bars must close at 10 o'clock unless people are staying in a hotel.  The ordinary guesthouse, unless it is a sort of sheebeen, cannot provide drinking amenities and in rural areas where amenities are limited tourists will make a habit of being in the bar on Sunday evenings because they meet more local people there then than at any other time.  I am not in the public house business and I have no vested interest in it but the Minister should step in to ensure that tourists would not be turned out at 10 o'clock on Sunday evenings from bars while it is still bright and they <Col N="2382" /> have nowhere else to go and have money in their pockets to spend.  I do not know how it could be arranged if you wished to give tourists special concessions.</P>

This is what the citizens are asked to do and when it is done and the cheque signed, do we hear any more about it?  I have been addressing myself to this question for a long time.  Our activities should not cease with the passing of the money; we should know how it is expended and if it has been utilised to the best advantage.  I am not satisfied that happens with money allocated to Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>If people want public moneys to help them develop their business or their countryside they cannot get it on a secret basis.  The people who provide the money must know where it is going and what happens to it.  The Minister must do a little more. He must publish the hotel grants in the same way as he has published the development grants from 1948, or whenever this holiday accommodation grant scheme began, and tell us all about it.</P>
      <P>One of the main reasons why I wanted such information was because of the number of applicants who were turned down.  Naturally, they complained, saying that the man up the road or in the next street or town got so much and they asked how was it they could get nothing.  There was no use in them coming to Deputies because they could not help; the information was a State secret and there was no way of finding out what was happening. However, that system has been changed and it would be no harm if the change had retrospective effect.  We like retrospection when changes are brought about.  Possibly, the Minister could move back some years.</P>
      <P>We all like hotels springing up in areas where they are required.  We like to see modern buildings with all facilities but we also like to know how much private money goes into a particular job and how much public money.  We like to know if there is any foundation for the frequent assertions that, by means of inflated costs or costs stated in excess of the actual amounts, grants higher than are warranted are paid. The allegation is that some people have received grants in excess of the amount warranted having regard to the nature of the work and the cost. Formerly it was difficult to say if these assertions were correct but now the amounts paid will be published and we may be in a position to assess the merits of any allegations that may be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard these allegations as very serious and I accept that possibly they may be difficult to substantiate but it is <Col N="2384" /> no harm to mention this matter here. This is the debating Chamber of the nation and if a Member has doubts, even though he may not have positive proof, it is in the interest of the State that he should indicate his doubts.  In this way the people who control the money, who have the power and who have information at their disposal&mdash;in this case it is the Minister and the board&mdash;will have an opportunity to refute any allegation.  I should be very pleased if the Minister were able to say that such allegations were not well-founded.</P>
    <P>The provision of grants for hotels has been mentioned.  This raises the question regarding the criterion used by the board when considering applications. If the person who is building an hotel intends to charge exceptionally high rates that would be beyond the reach of ordinary people, it might be asked whether such an hotel should get help from public funds.  Is the case made that these highly-priced hotels are essential if we wish to attract foreign tourists?  Having regard to the charges set out in the tourist guide book for the limited number of such hotels here, I think they should look after their own modernisation programmes.</P>
    <P>If a man builds a house whose floor area is in excess of 116 square metres he will not get a grant or rates remission because it is considered that he should be in a position to pay for the house himself and to pay the full rates. I realise it is difficult to make a comparison but I think some reasonable limits should be imposed on hotels where a considerable amount of public money has been spent in alteration or reconstruction work.  Some people may say competition imposes limits.  During the months of July and August and during race fixtures and other events, proprietors of some of these hotels are not prepared to charge less than the maximum amount set out in the tourist guide book.  People who are unable to get accommodation are forced to pay these high charges.</P>
    <P>I do not think that applications for grants for resort development are determined on their merits.  Some underhand methods are being adopted by the <Col N="2385" /> board in the disbursement of funds for this kind of work.  I represent south-west Cork, an area that has a most extensive coastline and which enjoys amenities few other areas possess.  With the exception of south-west Kerry, I do not think any other area can compare with south-west Cork.  There are many resorts from Kinsale to the Kenmare river as well as some inland areas that are looking to Bord Fáilte for help in development work.  I do not think any other area has a better claim for Bord Fáilte grants.</P>
    <P>We are told that a sum of £2 million has been made available in recent years for this development work.  It might be asked what areas benefited?  How did south-west Cork or any other area in Cork fare?  In order to get that information, on 13th July, 1972 I asked the Minister for Transport and Power to state in respect of each area the amount of grants allocated by Bord Fáilte for development works during 1970-71, 1971-72, 1972-73.  The Minister had not got information for 1972-73 but he gave details for 1970-71 and 1971-72.</P>
    <P>Cork got £6,600 for 1971-72.  That was for south-west Cork, south-east Cork and Cork county.  That was a drop from the previous year when the figure was about £40,000.  This year the figure is £4,000 for Cork county. Despite the decline in the value of money that's what we got.  This booklet gives some enlightening information. I do not know, I am not sufficiently conversant with the county, what particular amenities County Roscommon can offer.  What outstanding facility has it got?  Is the outstanding facility that it is represented in the Dáil by the Minister for Transport and Power?  Have we reached the stage where you can feed your own area with grants out of proportion to its justifiable share and possibly by so doing feed yourself with votes in order to hold your place in public life?  Roscommon is a relatively small inland county.  Did it get £6,600 like Cork last year?  No.  It got £119,000 odd or almost eighteen times the amount allocated to County Cork. I am picking out Roscommon because <Col N="2386" /> it is the highest on the list.  What special development works took place there in 1971-72 to justify that expenditure? Someone may say that there was something special in that particular year, that it was not the type of expenditure generally given to the county, but let us go back to 1970-71. In that year they got £61,000.  I do not know what the figure for 1972-73 is but it is reasonable to assume that it is up in the six figures.  Is it fair that Kinsale, Courtmacsherry, Clonakilty and the coast from Youghal to the Kenmare River, plus the whole territory of Cork county&mdash;one-seventh or one-eighth of this country&mdash;get £4,000 this year?</P>
    <P>I tried to get a sub-committee of the Dáil to inquire into the activities of boards such as this.  I am making charges here that shady arrangements have been made so far as the disbursement of grants is concerned.  It is a well-known fact that that obtains so far as IDA grants are concerned.  I am sure nobody would dispute that. Certainly in Cork nobody would, because he would be laughed at.  Anybody with any common sense knows how IDA grants are disbursed and they know how the applications of people of the wrong political affiliations are dealt with.  There is no need for the Parliamentary Secretary to look.  If he wants names I will give them.  The names are on the IDA book and the circumstances are well known in Cork.</P>
    <P>How did Galway compare?  They did very well in relation to Cork.  They got £108,596.  For the year 1970-71 they got £104,359.  Clare is doing reasonably well too.  They got £37,000 and £43,000 and I understand that a special grant was allocated, possibly over a few years, of £200,000 for the development of Lahinch golf course. If that is incorrect, the Minister can say so when replying.</P>
    <P>Why do we pass this money here? What advantage to County Cork is the passing of this £4 million or whatever the figure is?  Is it to get back £6,000?  It would be just as well for the county council if this was struck out altogether.  Cork was always prepared to pay a local contribution.  Where is <Col N="2387" /> this resort development money going? Is it all going out in salaries?</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy for poor Leitrim.  It is close to Roscommon. They got £1,800 in 1970-71 and a £5 note in 1971-72.  Possibly Leitrim, like Cork, would say that if this was abolished, if this board's functions were withdrawn and handed over to a local authority, not only would more be done but much more money would be available to do the job because the big salaries and the big incidental expenses would be saved.</P>
    <P>We all know the type of amenity works that are necessary at seaside resorts, not only for tourists but for our own local people&mdash;public parks, proper sanitary services and public toilets.  Another feature which is most commendable and most popular is a children's playground.  In the few areas in West Cork where children's playgrounds have been provided, not with any help from Dublin but out of local revenue, they are exceptionally popular. It is very nice to see the children congregating at such centres and enjoying themselves and keeping out of harm's way.</P>
    <P>If we were getting the money we should be getting I would be advocating more money for these amenities. We would be quite satisfied to contribute towards them.  We know the money does not come from heaven. Naturally, I would be advocating much more money for south-west Cork.  Last week at a meeting of the county council it was decided, possibly as a forlorn hope, to send a deputation to Bord Fáilte, and to the Minister if necessary, to inquire into what is happening to our share of the grants. Repetition is not allowed here, but the Minister was absent on some urgent business for a few minutes and, during his absence, I quoted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There will be more votes for the Minister if it is known in Roscommon what a very capable Deputy they have representing them, and all the grants he is providing for them.  On a more serious line, this type of allocation for Roscommon is not justified, and could not be justified if the board were doing their business impartially.  This is making a sham of public boards administering public affairs.  There is no justification for the Minister scooping the pool, or the jackpot, and bringing it to his own county.</P>

      <P>This is the structure on pages 2 and 3 of this book.  It takes this much space to show the personnel and the senior executives managing this board.  I wonder are they doing a good job?  Could any private company working on its own initiative and enterprise have such an elaborate board and an <Col N="2389" /> elaborate personnel all with jobs with high-sounding names.  I wonder should I list them?  Of course, they have big salaries, and big perks I am sure.  I count 27 senior staff, and in the Dublin region there are almost 40 listed here. Is it to pay them that we are passing this money tonight?  That is the question.  If you turn to another page you find that their salaries are hidden away.  This is supposed to be the balance sheet but you cannot find their salaries.  When we give this £2 million extra for holiday accommodation development it will be quite lawful for it to go to salaries and expenses instead of holiday development.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been on the Bill all the time.  I do not like saying unpleasant things but I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that we are not getting the return for the type of expenditure which this House asks the citizens of the country to provide towards the work of Bord Fáilte.  I am satisfied that they are not doing a good job, particularly so far as resort development is concerned, except in the special areas where special <Col N="2390" /> influence applies.  I ask the Minister to tell us what are the 1972-73 allocations and where the money is going to be expended so far as resort development is concerned.</P>
      <P>I am far from being an economist and I am not so good at statistics, but how in the world do the board arrive at the conclusion that we earned £100.8 million from tourism last year? How is that made up?  How do they arrive at that kind of figure?  That, of course, is for last year; the figures for this year would not be out yet.  How much of that £100 million are Bord Fáilte responsible for?  How many of our visitors are brought into the country as a result of their efforts and how many fewer visitors would come into the country if Bord Fáilte never existed?</P>
      <P>A sizeable percentage of people who come to Ireland for holidays are people of Irish descent and in view of the huge population we have in the neighbouring island, not only of Irish descent but Irish-born people&mdash;more than one million of them&mdash;it is reasonable to assume that there is going to be a big influx of people from Britain, irrespective of the kind of state agency we have to bring them over.  The same applies in the United States and Canada.  We have a huge population there of Irish extraction and I believe that most of these people would come here in any case, irrespective of whether such an agency existed or not. I have reason to believe that private enterprise and private initiative on the part of some people here in the tourist trade have brought far better results than those achieved by Bord Fáilte and that people who travelled to the Continent particularly found customers much more easily and at much less cost than Bord Fáilte found them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not too often that we have an opportunity of discussing this board and, as I say, it is tremendously embarrassing and difficult to have to say unpleasant things about any body or agency, public or private.  It is much easier to stand up here and throw bouquets at a body who would be doing their work effectively and efficiently but circumstances and facts compel us to criticise this board <Col N="2391" /> severely and circumstances and facts, such as the facts in this Dáil Report, compel us to criticise the Minister and his Department severely because the information given on 13th July of this year should leave no doubt in anybody's mind that Bord Fáilte funds are not disbursed on any kind of impartial basis and that the same tactics apply as apply in other fields of public activity.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the senior personnel of the board are not responsible and there could be justification for believing that because the Minister may be exerting an evil influence on the activities of this board as evidenced by this report.  The board may be threatened that they must toe the line and do what they are told and their senior executives may be threatened that unless they respond to the crack of the whip, promotion will not come their way.  That may be happening. We see what is happening with another body.  I am all for having boards accountable to this House but we have seen what is happening to the RTE Authority today because they do something which the Government and Fianna Fáil do not like. What happens is that they must either capitulate or be sacked.  I wonder if that happens and am I blaming this board wrongly.  I would hate to think I was and I would be very sorry for it.  Is the influence of a person such as our new Commissioner in Brussels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have in my possession a booklet which was handed to me only about an hour ago.  It is entitled &ldquo;<i>Where to Eat in Ireland</i>&rdquo;.  Can the Minister tell us who compiled this document and who paid for it?  Was it compiled by Bord Fáilte with the aid of public funds?  Is it true that it cost some thousands of pounds to produce and that the business establishments listed did not pay for the advertising afforded them in the publication?  The person who gave me the booklet assured me that it was produced at a cost of more than £3,000 plus the expenses of a group of people who travelled throughout the country and that it listed 100 establishments to which were given free publicity.  I understand that as a result of the protests from those establishments that were not listed, the book was withdrawn immediately.  I should like to have these matters cleared up by the Minister.</P>

      <P>If what I have heard is true, on what basis were the 100 establishments selected for this preferential treatment while other well-known establishments were omitted? Did the other establishments get an opportunity of being included?  Were they notified that the booklet was being compiled?  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that the booklet was not compiled at public expense.</P>
      <P>The tourist industry is of immense importance to our economy but we have no statistics to tell us the number of people employed in the industry although it is estimated that the figure is in the region of 160,000.  The money we vote is for the development of the industry but that is also the reason why we are so anxious to ensure that these moneys are utilised to the best possible advantage.  In many instances at present public money is not being employed gainfully.  As a result of this our inflationary trend is higher than that of any other country in Europe. There is an increase in the Book of Estimates of about £80 million.  That is a sizeable sum for a small country with a population of less than that of an average city elsewhere.  That trend cannot continue.  The Government generally are acting in a very lackadaisical manner in so far as the gainful expenditure of public moneys are concerned.  It is sad and embarrassing to find public moneys being expended wantonly today in so many fields of activity.  There is an obligation on the Government to crack the whip in so far as their own Departments and public bodies are concerned.  A man engaged in private enterprise must be very wary lest he finds himself in the bankruptcy court.  Of course, the difference between the Government and the private enterprise person is that the Government try to overcome their lapses by levying more taxation. We are now paying VAT on all commodities. The reason for this is to overcome the bungling that has been going on in so many fields of Government activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold the Government mainly responsible, too, for the changes that have occurred in Irish life and traditions. I say that in a general way but <Col N="2394" /> I refer in particular to Bord Fáilte. I charge them with being guilty of this offence also.  Having regard to the fact that I got into the winners' enclosure in so far as the publicity of the holiday development money is concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A small committee meeting periodically with senior personnel of public bodies would be able to discuss many matters of mutual and national importance in so far as the activities of the boards are concerned.</P>

Deputies on this side of the House have no one to provide them with the requisite information.  Any research that has to be done they have to do themselves.  They are not in a position to get the kind of information they would like to have.  A much better understanding would exist as a result of these committees being set up and that better understanding would result in an all-round advantageous effect. We would know what had happened and what was happening and we could give advice.  We come from the four corners of Ireland.  We are representatives of the public.  In return, the boards could tell us their programmes, let us discuss them, the costings and future developments.  Great good would result.  I put this to the Minister for his consideration.</P>

      <Col N="2396" /> The Minister should take a very serious look at the structure of the tourist industry.  He expressed alarm today at the fact that the returns from the tourist industry had not been as satisfactory as one would like.  He gave certain reasons for the decline in the number of tourists coming here.  He said there was serious damage to our markets in Britain and Northern Ireland attributable to events in Northern Ireland.  It may be that people hesitated to come here because of the unfortunate activities in the North.  Might I ask what Bord Fáilte did to make it clear to these people that the activities in the North in no way affected the prospect of a peaceful and pleasant holiday in the Republic? If people failed to come here because of the unfavourable climate in the North of Ireland then the blame is to be laid on Bord Fáilte because they failed to make it clear that what was happening in the North in no way impinged on the prevailing peaceful climate in the Republic.  Were it not for the publicity undertaken by Irish travel agents abroad very little indeed would be known about the facilities here if it were left to Bord Fáilte.  I have seen some of the advertisements. So has the Minister and other Members of this House.  I have seen them in Britain and in France.  I did not see them in Denmark.  The United States and Canada are extensive countries and I doubt if there has been any very extensive advertising to attract North Americans and Canadians to spend their holidays here.</P>
    <P>The Minister may make the case that the difficulties in the North have been responsible for the decline in the tourist trade.  I would put the decline down to the way in which tourists have been rooked, not by all hoteliers but by some of them.  They have killed the goose that laid the golden egg.  People who are rooked never allow themselves to be rooked a second time.  Tourists will not be attracted unless they get good value for money.  If the tourist gets good value for money he will be one of the best advertisements we would could have because he will spread the good news.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not really touch on <Col N="2397" /> the real causes for the decline in the tourist trade.  The Irish hotels are pricing themselves out of the market. No one has any control over our weather.  Young and old now are following the sun and that means that our own people are holidaying outside the country.  We cannot complete with the attractions other countries have to offer.  Our holiday season is restricted. Our hoteliers know that and their ambition is to make as much as they possibly can in the shortest possible time.  That is not the way to run a tourist industry.  What efforts are made to attract anglers here for coarse fishing? Only the surface has been scratched.  Hoteliers like to see the angling tourist because he is out fishing all day.  A great deal could be done to encourage more anglers to avail of the outstanding facilities we have here for coarse fishing.  Some French anglers are aware of the facilities we have to offer.  More publicity should be given to this aspect by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Have there been any talks between the federation of hotels, Bord Fáilte and the Minister in relation to prices and charges?  There were 1,200 complaints to Bord Fáilte last year and, when 1,200 complaints were made, we can take it that there were 1,200 complaints that the tourists did not think it worth their while to make.  Instead they made up their minds not to come back here again.  Tourists should be encouraged not only to return to this country but to bring others with them. We should provide them with all the bargains it is possible to place at their disposal.  It is regrettable when tourists come here from France or Britain or any European country, or from Canada or the United States, that we should put our hands deep into their pockets and their wallets in order to get all that we possibly can get from them. Tourists want an enjoyable holiday and are prepared to pay for it.  They are lavish spenders when they are on holiday but they do not like to be exploited.</P>
    <P>Tourists are disgusted when they find that souvenirs that they have purchased on the understanding that they were Irish-made have, in fact, been made in Japan.  Souvenirs most <Col N="2398" /> popular with tourists are objects representing historical monuments such as the Round Tower of Clonmacnoise. The tourist is shocked to find &ldquo;Made in Japan&rdquo; stamped on these objects.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the increase in the proportion of Continental visitors and the need to cater for this new type of customer.  Is the Minister really satisfied that there is an increase in the proportion of Continental visitors coming here?</P>

      <P>If these people are to be encouraged to come here and if they are coming, there are many other odds and ends of the tourist trade that need tidying up.  Tourists are anxious to contact their friends abroad and they have complained about what they describe as the worst telephone service here that they have ever experienced.  We have tourist complaints regarding lack of facilities in our airports, particularly Dublin Airport.  If tourists complain of lack of facilities at Dublin Airport these complaints should be seriously noted and acted upon because the airports are expected to provide facilities and services for such people.  We can, perhaps, deal with Dublin Airport on a more appropriate occasion.</P>

      <P>In regard to the purpose for which this money is required, facilities and amenities, little or none of this money seems to come our way.  Thanks to <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash;the only paper which published the <Col N="2399" /> information on 17/11/72 &mdash; we see where Bord Fáilte accommodation grants went.  A total of £2,800,341 was accounted for in respect of the financial year ended 31st March last. My constituency got approximately £2,000 out of that total.  I call the Minister's attention to the fact that we are in what is known as the lake-land tourist area but I have yet to see any concentration of tourist activity in that area.  I cannot understand why, out of over £2 million, only £2,000 comes to the Countries Laois and Offaly.  Has there been any request to Bord Fáilte for financial assistance in regard to the development of the Shannon?</P>

      <P>He referred to the fact that £360 came to one part of the county and less to another.  I want to ask the Minister if he is aware that bus loads of continental tourists arrive occassionally at Clonmacnoise.  On one Sunday afternoon this year while I was there a busload of American visitors arrived, brought there by the Kilkenny Archaeological Society for a lecture on the various stones, the Round Tower and the Seven Churches of Clonmacnoise. Bord Fáilte had not even provided a penny piece for toilet facilities at Clonmacnoise and the only toilet that could be made available for the American and continental visitors was the dry toilet of a national school some distance away where they had to queue up and go in one by one.  This was the first occasion on which some of them had the experience of using a dry toilet.</P>

      <P>This money is to be devoted to site development, the provision of facilities such as toilets, shelters, car parks, promenades and parks.  I would not have raised the lack of toilet facilities at Clonmacnoise if the matter had not been mentioned in the Minister's speech when he almost invited comment regarding toilet facilities. One of the greatest tourist attractions in Ireland, in my opinion, is Clonmacnoise in its historical setting by the River Shannon and one would expect that when there is such a tourist attraction in the heart of the country, not too far from the Minister's constituency because the parish of Moore is right across the Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have Bord Fáilte any plans to provide at least a proper information building at Clonmacnoise? An ordinary, small caravan is available there and there is a most courteous lady in the caravan who endeavours to give information to inquirers but there is a long queue outside waiting to get admission.  There are no facilities at Clonmacnoise such as a rest room, a restaurant which could provide even a cup of coffee, or a bookstall to give information in connection with the Shannon and Clonmacnoise, the facilities available at Banagher and Shannonbridge which might be of interest to tourists.</P>
      <P>Clanmacnoise appears to be entirely forgotten.  I raised this matter on every possible occasion in order to have Clonmacnoise even suitably signposted in the various towns surrounding Shannonbridge.  Any tourists who came to Clonmacnoise went away convinced that there was real history, beautiful scenery, peace and everything for which one could wish at Clonmacnoise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am expected to vote enormous amounts of money which will be allocated to areas around the coastline but in my own area where there is a tourist attraction and where there is one of the most historic places in <Col N="2401" /> western Europe not a penny piece has been spent by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a slip provided at Banagher.  I should have said that a penny piece was provided for Clonmacnoise and Banagher but in comparison with what is spent in areas around our coast nothing has been spent on the development of tourism in the Midlands.</P>
      <P>What liaison exists between Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism boards who receive enormous amounts of money to which local authorities are expected to contribute?  I am not satisfied Bord Fáilte have done their part in providing suitable road and car park facilities, they have not provided picnic tables and other amenities. They have done very little for the district near the Slievebloom Mountains, for the area from Kinnitty to Mountrath, from Clonaslee to Killinure.  In this area there are some of the finest forestry lands in the country.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to examine the work of Bord Fáilte.  In my opinion they have not spend the money where it should be spent and they have not spent it wisely.  Money has not been spent to build up tourist activity in an area where it is non-existent.  It would be worthwhile for the tourist organisations to consult with the management of Butlin's Holiday Camp in County Meath.  This holiday camp provides everything that is essential for a holiday: there are playgrounds for children, there is a theatre, a cinema, a casino, dining facilities and indoor and outdoor swimming pools.  Frequently I have wondered why some of the know-alls in Bord Fáilte do not discuss the question of organisation with the management of Butlin's. They could be taught a lot about organisation and about the provision of facilities that would attract tourists. I should like to pay tribute to the contribution of Butlin's Holiday Camp to tourism here.  The people in the camp are courteous and the food is of high quality.  Many Scottish, Welsh or English tourists would not have come to Ireland were it not for the existence of this holiday camp.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte receive very considerable State funds but they cannot provide the facilities that a private concern provides. Another matter I should like to comment on is the price of drink; it does not encourage tourists to come here and I would ask the Minister to arrange that a special rate should be given for tourists.  This would give our tourism a considerable boost.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to state why Bord Fáilte have not co-operated to a greater extent with CIE in the development of our canals.  Does the Minister intend coming to this House at a later stage to get money to develop the canals?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that.  I recall on one occasion the Minister said the Grand Canal would not be closed and he hoped there would be a link from Dublin to the Shannon at Athlone and Banagher. If boating activities could be carried on on the Grand Canal and if there were suitable facilities between Dublin, Tullamore and Banagher this would be of considerable benefit to the midlands. So far as possible we should provide those facilities, thus encouraging tourists who are interested in boating to come here.</P>
      <P>At all our tourist centres there seems to be a lack of children's playgrounds. Why, I do not know.  Perhaps the Minister would take note of this.  Bord Fáilte should seriously consider providing, in conjunction with local development associations or local tourist associations, suitable facilities for children, particularly indoor facilities, because we do get inclement weather from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2403" /> Bad parking facilities prevent the enjoyment of a holiday.  I was at a function in Salthill on Sunday night last and I found the parking facilities there to be most satisfactory.  I have always found parking facilities in Tramore bad.  They have become impossible and because of this people hesitate to go there despite the hospitality, kindliness and courtesy of the hoteliers and the people of Tramore who are always glad to see a visitor.</P>
    <P>It would be well worthwhile carrying out a survey of all our tourist resorts with a view to finding out their requirements.  There is a lack of picnic tables.  I do not know whether local authorities have the right to erect those or not.  The hoteliers naturally do not like to see the picnic holiday-maker but many people, particularly those with families, like to eat out on holiday because the hotels have priced them out.  Quite often people do not stay in the one place on holiday but tour from one place to another. Picnic tables should be provided near lakes, mountain views and other attractive scenery and there should also be toilet facilities available.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have fallen far short of expectations.  They have been in existence for a long time.  They have spent a fabulous amount of money and we expected a much greater return from them.  Our travel agents are a very important section of people in the tourist business.  The private travel agents have done more to publicise our facilities and attract people to Ireland than Bord Fáilte have done.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to &ldquo;Where to Eat in Ireland&rdquo;.  This calls for a serious explanation from the Minister. Certain people had their names enshrined in that notorious booklet. It was withdrawn, I understand, on the Minister's instruction.  Is there a great lack of liaison between the Minister and Bord Fáilte?  Before a publication such as this went to press, does the Minister not think Bord Fáilte should have said: &ldquo;We will send the Minister a draft and see what he has to say about it&rdquo;?  It is quite wrong to spend thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money on the publication of a biased booklet in relation <Col N="2404" /> to tourism.  Such a booklet could have a serious effect on the business of somebody who was not mentioned. I want the Minister to take a serious view of this.  Were Bord Fáilte channelling business to a selected number of people for sinister reasons?  We find that they went to the trouble of spending thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money on publishing this book which the Minister withdrew as soon as he saw it.  I should like to hear from the Minister who was responsible for getting out this publication.  Has he inquired into its origin?  Is he satisfied that the intentions behind its publication were good?  Was it published through ignorance or was there another reason why this was ready for mass circulation to the detriment of some very decent people who have contributed generously to the tourist trade but who, for some reason or other, did not get mention in it?  I pay tribute to the Minister for stopping this publication. I am sure if he had been consulted in time he would have offered some helpful advice.  There should be somebody on the board of Bord Fáilte closely associated with all their activities, who would be a direct link between the board and the Minister and his Department and keep him in touch with the overall activity, the allocation of hotel grants, the development of sites, the plans for tourist activity in any particular area and all publications. Publications can be damning and they can be a great help but one of this kind could have proved disastrous for many people who have made a generous contribution to the tourist trade.  I hope we shall hear from the Minister what steps he has taken to see that conduct of this kind will not be repeated or tolerated because it is something that never should have happened and something which is worthy of note.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister get a report from Bord Fáilte in relation to expenditure on various schemes and works?  I am not going to mention the names of hotels, because I do not think it would be right or fair to do so, but I see here that a grant of £195,000 was given to a particular hotel.  Has the Minister any way of finding out <Col N="2405" /> how that money was spent and what it was spent on?  It is a fabulous sum of money.</P>

      <P>A very wise decision and I agree fully with the Minister in that regard.  The taxpayer does not like to see his money being ploughed in in millions unless he can see some return for it.  Those engaged in the tourist industry have had a very lean time in recent times and efforts should be made now to build up so that what they have lost &mdash; and they have lost; I do not mind the Minister saying that last year or the year before was good because if you talk to these people who depend completely on the tourist business, you will find that <Col N="2406" /> they have a different picture &mdash; can be recouped.</P>
      <P>I do not know what steps the Minister has taken or what steps Bord Fáilte are taking.  I do not know if they are capable of taking any steps because I view their work with a certain amount of suspicion.  Why I am suspicious I cannot say, but maybe it is because I see no evidence in my constituency of their existence at all. This may be one of the reasons.  Their investment may not be channelled in the right direction in order to bring the greatest amount of benefits to the people who require it during the summer months and who have only a very short period in which to make sufficient income out of three months to enable them to exist for 12 months.  Is it not true to say that a person must provide for himself and his family for 12 months and that the tourist season is only two or three months?</P>
      <P>I have often wondered in what way we can take more practical steps to bring about what I call a revival of the tourist trade.  We are in competition with Spain and France.  The amount of money the British Government is putting into holiday resorts and the manner in which the lake-land of Cumberland is being developed is fantastic and I do not know how we are to compete with that.  I do not think we have the ability to compete with it.  More particularly, if there are to be greater facilities provided at cheaper rates, we cannot compete.  Today we were discussing air services and charges and these, in my opinion, will be a hindrance again to tourists coming into this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be no harm for Bord Fáilte to take serious note of any complaints that have come in in relation to the section of the tourist industry known as hire car services who have given dud cars to tourists, with the result that numerous complaints have been made.  This is not fair. The people who operate hire car services for tourists should provide the best possible type of car for the tourist and not something out of which perhaps the bottom falls when the tourist has travelled 50 or 60 miles. <Col N="2407" /> There have been complaints about this and I do not know whether Bord Fáilte have investigated them, but if complaints of that kind have been made they should be followed up.  Incidents of this kind get a bad name for the country when our job is to preserve our good name.  If we have lost it for the time being, we must get it back again, but I believe that we are going to have some job in redeeming ourselves in relation to prices and charges and in respect of speed, efficiency and good service.</P>
    <P>I hope that the moneys which this Bill asks for Bord Fáilte for the provision of all facilities, in the nature of proms, toilet facilities, shelters and other amenities which are needed, will be considered as an investment which will bring reasonably good financial returns to those who depend on the tourist industry for their livelihood. I wish it well and I trust that the Minister or his successor will have a very serious look at the whole structure of Bord Fáilte because it is about time we had a new approach to tourism and we should make that approach on bases other than the steps Bord Fáilte have been taking because I really believe that there is room for much improvement in relation to the entire activities of the board.  They seem to have devoted all their energies to certain people and in certain directions and have neglected to a high degree other sections which are vitally important to the tourist industry.  We must remember that our good name is at stake when visitors come to this country and we should do everything to safeguard and protect it from being tarnished in any way when those people leave the country.</P>
    <P>I love to see the Americans and the Canadians coming here.  I think they are good spenders and I would like to see full facilities being made available for them because there is a great relationship between this country and America and this country and Canada. Let us try to get more Americans over here.  They are welcome and we want to see them coming here.</P>
    <P>I hope that when Senator Humphrey comes here within the next few days he will be impressed by what he sees and <Col N="2408" /> by what we can offer to all Americans. We want more dollars and more dollar spenders here.  Bord Fáilte have not played their part in getting more Americans and more Canadians to come here.  When they start spending they leave Europeans in the shade.  When we try to get Europeans to come here we are casting a sprat to catch a salmon.  Let us get the salmon straightaway, the Canadians and the Americans. We may not have every facility available for them but let us get down to long-term planning.  Let us concentrate on the United States and Canada.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Continent let us concentrate a little more on the French fishermen who come here to fish our lakes.  The French fisherman has been a great asset to the Midlands.  He is very welcome and he is extremely popular. We cannot guarantee him good catches but he is an outstanding sportsman.  In Banagher and Birr they love to see him coming to fish.  We should do more to attract more people of that kind.  Let us concentrate on the big game and get in the Americans and the Canadians.  Let us give a good impression.  Let us provide the facilities.  Let us not rook them when they come here.  It will pay us to treat them well and to give them the best possible bargains.  When they go home they tell their friends about their holiday and they increase the numbers coming in the following year.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Murphy was not foolish in presuming that this is the last occasion on which we will have the Minister here as Minister for Transport and Power.  If he leaves that Department he will be missed even if only by those engaged in the tourist business in Roscommon.  Before he goes I would ask him to alert Bord Fáilte to the problems about Clonmacnoise in my constituency.  I have spoken about this often enough and nothing has been done.  I will keep raising it in this House until Clonmacnoise is recognised as the most historic tourist attraction in western Europe.</P>

      <P>Before going into detail about Bord Fáilte I want to look back and see what they have done in the past.  They have been the subject of grave criticism here by every speaker so far and, while some of it was deserved, they have a very difficult job to do.  It is very hard to assess their work.  Their whole exercise is complicated.</P>
      <P>I am surprised and horrified at the manner in which they have treated my city Limerick.  In 1970-71 we got £7,006 from Bord Fáilte.  In 1971-72 we got the fantastic, unbelievable figure of £21.  Where did that £21 go? To what advantage or use was it put? We are the second lowest in the league &mdash; Leitrim, £5, Limerick, £21, Carlow, £28 and the Minister's own constituency, £119.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care where it is.  Limerick city got 21 miserable, paltry, hungry pound notes.  What was that £21 put to?  Who looked for it? To what advantage was it put?  Was it given as a donation to the St. Vincent de Paul Society?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the confraternity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or was it given to the confraternity?  They could do with it. The St. Vincent de Paul Society could do with it.  The social service unit could do with it.  A city the size and magnitude, and with the growing development, of Limerick, the third largest city in the Republic, is thrown a miserable, paltry, hungry £21.  I should like to know who got it.  I should like to throw it back from whence it came, with acknowledgments in language familiar to the Minister and many of us, particularly from our political opponents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand this.  We are a city with a population between 65,000 and 68,000 people.  We have 20 or 30 grade A hotels.  We have <Col N="2410" /> all kinds of attractions such as banquet halls and assembly halls.  If we organised a flag day in the city we would get at least £221 within a couple of hours.  I do not know where this £21 came from.  I will have to know, and I want to know.  I must be told.  There are areas which have held their own or got an increase: Westmeath, Waterford, Clare, Donegal, Kildare, Louth.  Roscommon has doubled its figure and so has Tipperary. Limerick has dropped from £7,000 to £21.</P>
    <P>Are Bord Fáilte serious when they offer us the paltry sum of £21?  Who do they think they are?  This is typical of the approach by Bord Fáilte in all their transactions.  I wish I knew where this £21 went.  I would collect that much in three minutes outside the chapel gate on a Sunday.  Two people would give it to me.  Some of us collected practically £2,000 recently to put on an international boxing show in Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not take them far.  We put on a show in Limerick last Tuesday week.  The Parliamentary Secretary was at it.  We brought over an American amateur boxing team and we went to the trouble of organising a show.  We put on an excellent show with ballads and dinners, <i>et cetera</i>.  Everybody had a good night.  We inexperienced laymen put this on the boards last Tuesday night week.  If I had known about this figure of £21 from Bord Fáilte, I would have brought those gentlemen down and given them a lesson in how to organise and how to bring in people. Already we have organised the visit to Limerick next year of an amateur boxing team from Russia.  Is this not organisation?  It is the type of work that Bord Fáilte should be doing. There is nothing in it for us.  Our only aim is the advancement of our city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that in respect of the allocations of money for 1971-72, the Minister christened his own child first, as he did in respect of the £119,000 he got.  In this instance he has allotted to himself the sum of £20,000 for <Col N="2411" /> a caravan park at Boyle.  He headed the poll because of the £119,000.  There is not a penny being given to Limerick.</P>

      <P>Lough Derg will do for me.  I mean Lough Derg on the Shannon although I have been to the other Lough Derg also in the past and if I remain in this House much longer I shall have to make another pilgrimage there.  Not very long ago the Minister received, at my request, a deputation on behalf of An Oige. These young people in An Oige had already organised functions which realised between £6,000 and £7,000 for the purpose of providing a hostel in Limerick.  I had taken them to the city manager who agreed on what was a perfect site on the banks of the Shannon.  The Minister referred the matter to Bord Fáilte but they informed us that the full grant could not be paid because of the proposed location of the hostel.  I might add that at the particular point at which it was proposed to build the hostel, a person could cross the river without rolling up the legs of his trousers and not be wet.  One could not drown a pinkeen at that point in the river at any time in the summer but because the site was not on the other bank, 30 or 40 yards on the Clare side, we did not qualify for the full grant.  The site chosen was only about a mile from the city so that it would have been ideal also from the point of view of travel and other facilities.</P>
      <P>I notice that Bord Fáilte were generous enough in the payment of grants towards An Oige hostels.  In Donegal they contributed £6,000, £5,000 and £6,000 respectively.  There was a grant of £6,000 for a hostel in Clare, £7,000 for one in Kerry, £2,000 for one in Cork and there was a grant also in respect of a hostel in Mayo.  Yet although we are in the heart of the tourist industry we did not qualify for a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2412" /> The Minister wrote to us saying he regretted that Bord Fáilte would not agree to the payment of a grant in that particular area but, of course, the Minister knew that the board were wrong but he has not done anything about it.  I thought that, perhaps, the situation could be handled in a diplomatic way and that by making further representations we would be facilitated.  These representations have not been successful and I do not know whether the appeal I am making here now is too late for any action to be taken but if the Minister can do anything in this matter, I ask him to do so.  If we are to act in a rigid and inhuman way in dealing with such matters, we might as well not be here at all.  There is no need for such severity.</P>
    <P>We must complain about this sort of treatment.  Public representatives know the wishes of their people because they are in constant contact with them.  A great injustice has been done to the members of An Oige in so far as this hostel is concerned.</P>
    <P>I turn now to another document which I notice has been censored and put to one side.  Before it saw the light of day this publication should have been edited.  I do not know who is responsible for it.  Nobody had the courage to put his name to it.  I do not know who issued it.  The printer had the kindness to put his name to it. &mdash;Printcraft Limited, Dublin.  Who put all this rigmarole and rubbish, thrash of the first dimension, into this booklet of 33 pages?  The hospitality available in the great city and county of Limerick are beyond anything available in the 32 counties of this one-State republic.</P>

Where have all the others gone?  Were those who found one hotel in Adare and one in Glentworth Street blind or were they like the poor pilot who comes to ground when the navigation gear goes out of place so that they could not find another hotel in the city of Limerick?</P>

      <P>We can all laugh at a joke.  I have a sense of humour; I wish others had.  It is all very well to laugh but who paid for this publication?</P>
      <P>I do not think Roscommon is mentioned at all.  The lodging house that used to be near the Shannon long ago was not mentioned.  It is no wonder you would withdraw this publication. It is no wonder that it would be guillotined and pole-axed.</P>
      <P>While we may laugh at what I have said, we laugh because the publication is so ridiculous and stupid from a board who seem to be divided down along the line.  It is like the history of Brain Boru.  Coming down from the top five or six you find the fellows at the bottom who are supposed to be doing something and who are doing nothing at all.  It is like a family tree.  They are well paid.  I am not objecting to that if they do their job but they are not doing their job.  I have proved it here and will prove it before I conclude my speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pay a deserved tribute to our travel agents who, through their own initiative and organisational ability, have organised tours, at their own expense and at their own risk. <Col N="2414" /> These men have done a much better job than Bord Fáilte, as at present constituted, will ever do.  These travel agents from Dublin, Cork, Limerick and elsewhere organise package tours with hotel, self-drive car and everything included.  Despite what Deputy Flanagan has said about the self-drive car, Deputies have seen the TV advertisements for the last three weeks for 750 cars of last summer season, cars of one year's service only.  On the TV last night the number was down to 200. Dan Ryan of Limerick had sold 550 of these cars.  They were all 1971 cars. The hire-drive cars that I know of in the city of Limerick are all brand new cars, the cars of the year.  They are all 1971 cars that have been sold by Dan Ryan &amp; Company.  The travel agents sell off the cars after one season's service.</P>
    <P>The travel agents who organise package tours should be subsidised and encouraged to go more often to bring in the tourists that Bord Fáilte have failed to attract.  I would ask the Minister to give special consideration to these people.  They undertake grave risks. The self-drive car business is as risky as bookmaking: one or two crashes and the agent is in trouble.  After paying a £10 deposit the hirer may take the car to the Border or to Dublin or may leave the car at the airport and the agent has to look for the car and he might find it in a ditch or over a wall. It is the travel agents in this business who should get our consideration, not the people sitting in plush offices reading statistics and trying to present a picture that has no reality.</P>
