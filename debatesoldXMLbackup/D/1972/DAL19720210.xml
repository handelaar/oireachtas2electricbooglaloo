      <P>Since reporting progress on this Supplementary Estimate, I have been participating in debates around the country on the issue of whether or not this country should join the EEC.  Notwithstanding the fact that in the debate the last day I referred to the matter of a particular sentence in the White Paper, a sentence which is directly and deliberately misleading, I find that the inaccurate version is still being promulgated around the country.  That inaccurate version, that misleading version, that version <Col N="1502" /> which is known to be misleading, is now, in fact, part of the official record of the Dáil of 3rd February, 1972.  I am referring to column 866 where the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>As a member of the Council, we will be taking an active part in all its deliberations....</P>
      <P>The council there is, of course, the Council of the European Economic Community.  The Parliamentary Secretary goes on to say:</P>
      <P>... and will be in a position to ensure that our national interest in the fisheries sector will continue to be safeguarded by appropriate arrangements including the maintenance of special limits.</P>
      <P>There is the word &ldquo;ensure&rdquo;.  That sentence can only mean that we will be in a position to ensure a number of things and one of the things we will be in a position to ensure is the maintenance of special limits.  Now that is simply not true and it is known to be not true by the persons responsible for the White Paper and the persons responsible for what the Parliamentary Secretary said here on 3rd February.</P>
      <P>We had the situation in which Fisheries Ministers from a number of countries were watching the negotiations in the closing days prior to the signing of the Treaty of Accession in the last week of January by the four applicants in Brussels.  Extremely hectic efforts were made by the Norwegians in those closing days to improve the package they had been offered and those efforts included visits by the Norwegian Prime Minister to a number of EEC capitals.  They failed to get an improvement in the offer to which we had agreed and the Norwegian Minister of Fisheries thereupon said that the arrangements offered did not guarantee the maintenance of the limits and he promptly resigned, having stated absolutely clearly why he was resigning; he was resigning because he could not protect the limits of the Norwegian fishery industry beyond the ten-year derogation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Norwegian package was very, very slightly better than our package, though substantially the same.  With all their efforts the Norwegians got nothing <Col N="1503" /> significantly better than we got.  Neither did they get anything worse.  As far as the continuation of limits is concerned, the Norwegian package is the same as ours: after ten years the derogation from full access for all other countries to our waters will lapse unless there is unanimous agreement by all the members for the arrangements to continue. This means, of course, that when the time comes any member can veto the arrangements.  The French, for instance, can veto any extension of the arrangements. If they veto, then the bargain lapses and the full fisheries legislation comes into operation, giving the French and all other member States full access to our waters right up to our beaches.</P>
    <P>That was the package we brought home.  It could be argued it was as good a package as we could possibly get.  That is true at this stage.  It could be argued that, since fisheries is not clearly as important to our economy as it is to the Norwegian economy, then OK.  Many people would agree that that was a fair representation. One had to make up one's balance sheet and, if one set the gains against the losses, that was not a bad thing to do.  But what is not acceptable to me is deliberately to mislead the people.  What is not acceptable, to put it in the sharpest possible way, is to tell lies and that is what I claim has been done on this issue.</P>
    <P>The deal we accepted was probably the best that could have been got from the Community.  That, I think, is true but, if it is true, then it says something pretty terrifying about the Community and something quite contrary to the image of the Community generally accepted.  The policy being peddled is that the Community is concerned with all the interests of all its members in order to ensure the very best possible for every member.  The interesting thing is that the Community did not have for many years a common fisheries policy.  It did not have that in the decade after the signing of the Treaty of Rome.  It did not have a common fisheries policy at the time when the four nations outside the Community decided they would <Col N="1504" /> negotiate to become full members of the Community.</P>
    <P>At that time there was no common fisheries policy and in the middle of 1970, when negotiations in many areas were already significantly advanced, the Six countries rammed through a fisheries policy, very briskly and ruthlessly, which was greatly to their advantage and greatly to the disadvantage of the countries proposing to become members.  They did not wait until the four applicant countries became members and would have their commissioner and their parliamentarians, have members on the council and be able to influence the outcome.  Having done nothing from 25th March, 1957, when the Treaty of Rome was signed until 1970, 13 years, they then rammed through a fisheries agreement advantageous to the existing Six and seriously disadvantageous to the four applicant countries.</P>
    <P>We might tease that out a little.  The Mediterranean is overfished and is a difficult fishing area.  The Dutch, the Germans and the Belgians have to go fairly long distances to their fishing grounds; the French a shorter distance from their west coast, but none of them has anything like the fishing grounds of the Norwegians or the British or the Irish.  None of the present member countries, with the possible exception of France which has a long west coast, has anything like the fishing grounds of three of the applicant countries.  The Danes had a very great tradition, because of their traditional association with Iceland and Greenland, of going long distances to what was friendly Icelandic and Greenland territory so that in that sense, although the Danes did not have big fishing grounds of their own of very high quality, they had Greenland and close association with Iceland.</P>
    <P>It was, therefore, a piece of bad faith on the part of the Community to ram through a fisheries policy in 1970.  It was a ruthless endeavour to secure for themselves access to the extensive fishing waters of the applicant countries when they knew they were not in a position to reciprocate by giving access to comparable fishing waters of their own.  If anybody thinks the Communities <Col N="1505" /> are concerned with the best interests of all the members, looking at the history of fishing alone in the Community should disabuse one because the Communities have behaved disgracefully and ruthlessly in regard to fishing.</P>
    <P>The common fisheries policy came into operation only on 1st February, 1971, a year and a week ago.  We had to accept this in its finalised and immutable form less than a year after it had come into existence although there had been no common fisheries policy for the previous 14 years.  That should disabuse us about the benevolence and kindness and fairness of the Communities' approach to the exploitation of the natural resources of their members.  Since they did that in this hasty and ruthless way when applicants with much greater fishery interests than they had were already knocking at the door, since they rammed through a policy which they declared to be immutable and which was contrary to the interests of all the applicants, if we wanted full membership we had to accept it.  We did so and so did the other applicant countries.  The Norwegian Minister for Fisheries decided that it was contrary to promises he had given to protect the Norwegian industry. He decided the agreement did not safeguard Norwegian fisheries beyond the decade for which the derogation lasted and, therefore, he decided that he could not in honour retain his post as Minister for Fisheries and he resigned.  He described the situation as it was and took the consequences.  It would be nice to have a comparable standard of behaviour in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In passing, I may refer to an interesting sidelight on the way we ran our own arrangements.  I am not certain of this for reasons which I shall give in a moment but my belief is that the Norwegian Minister for Fisheries resigned on 20th January and that his resignation with the reasons was reported in the papers of Friday, 21st January, 1972, some three weeks ago, the day before the signatures.  Before going on, I want to pay tribute to the Dáil Library staff who, in difficult circumstances and with inadequate equipment, are extremely helpful and <Col N="1506" /> courteous.  They have a real interest in their job.  This morning I went to get <i>The Financial Times</i> which I have found to be the best newspaper on fisheries and reporting of the Communities affairs.  The complete file for January was there except for the issue of Friday, 21st January.  I thought the London <i>Times</i> would be almost as good and got the file of that newspaper.. It was complete except for January 21st.  It was then approaching 10.30 a.m. and I had to come in here and I asked the Library staff if I could have any of the British serious papers of that day and I would have taken <i>The Telegraph</i> which has pretty detailed coverage.  All of the English papers for Friday, 21st are missing in the Dáil Library file except <i>The Telegraph</i> which has just been brought into me.  I do not propose to delay the House by searching through it now for the exact details of what the Norwegian Minister said.  It shall suffice to say that he indicated a totally different understanding and comprehension of the fisheries agreement from that which has been indicated to the Irish people by our negotiators.  Such was his understanding of it that he felt it incumbent on him to leave his post. I do not propose to labour the point except to say that people are being misled systematically and deliberately and that after the ten-year derogation, unless we get unanimity from all the other nine countries, no further measures can be applied to protect our fisheries.  If there is not unanimity in ten years the derogation lapses and the full rigour of total access by all the other member states comes into operation.  That is what was agreed to and nothing else and no fiddling can alter that.  It would be nice if it were accurately presented to the fishermen of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word also about the fishery limits agreed between Ireland and EEC and which have now been accepted.  Perhaps I should explain that my own interest in the sea is of fairly long standing.  It is quite a long time, long before I was involved in broadcasting, since I joined the Irish Maritime Institute.  I was sufficiently concerned when I was a broadcaster to persuade RTE to put on a series which <Col N="1507" /> I researched and presented called &ldquo;Surrounded by Water&rdquo; which was concerned with the fact that we were an island and that we did not function and think so as to take maximum advantage of it.  I say this simply to indicate that my interest is not of today or yesterday.  But apart from the long-term scientific interest that I have had in the sea in general and in fisheries, I now have a specific interest and responsibility because the fishing harbours of Skerries and Loughshinny and much of that strip of the east coast north of Dublin&mdash;but not Howth&mdash;are in my constituency.  I have a constituency responsibility as well as an interest.</P>
    <P>On the east coast from Carlingford Lough to Carnsore Point, to the Bend in Wexford, there is a 12-mile shellfish limit but from Cork Harbour to Carlingford Lough there is a six-mile limit for fish as distinct from shellfish. Going west around the coast from Lough Foyle to Cork Harbour there is a 12-mile limit.  What is interesting to note here is that Dunmore East is an extremely important herring centre, that Kilmore Quay is a burgeoning active fishing port, that you have the Arklow fishermen and that you have Dún Laoghaire which, although one might not think of it as a fishing port, is a significant fishing port.  Also there is Skerries and there are the other ports up the east coast.  These are extremely important herring fishing grounds to which we had already conceded&mdash;I think conceded improperly&mdash;partial access by the terms of the 1964 Agreement. A number of EEC countries signed that agreement also.  It was a bad agreement and one that we should not now cite as an indication that we have made matters no worse by the limits conceded now.  That agreement hampered the growth of our fisheries. Extremely important fishing ports on the east coast are not protected to the same extent as those on the west coast.</P>
    <P>If one considers the west coast, there is Killybegs in the far north-west and Castletownbere in the extreme south and there is not a major comparable fishing port elsewhere although there are fishermen in other places along <Col N="1508" /> the west coast who are showing great initiative and vigour.  Between Killybegs and Castletownbere there is nothing comparable to what I have mentioned on the east coast yet the west coast, more difficult to fish and to shore, has a 12-mile limit while the east coast has a six-mile limit.  This is an unfortunate differentiation against the east coast and against Skerries, Kilmore and Dunmore East in particular. I would like some sort of explanation as to why, if there had to be some lapsing from the 12-mile limit all the way round, and I do not agree there had to be, concessions had to be made on the east coast.  I notice what the Norwegians were able to do even though they were not able to extend the ten-year derogation.  They fought a better battle about limits than we did. I might say, regarding the comparison between Norwegian and Irish fisheries, that it is explained to us that fisheries are much more important in Norway than in Ireland and that consequently, a special case could be made in respect of the Norwegians.  One can say two things about this.  The Norwegian fishing industry is very much bigger than the Irish one but it is not nearly as dynamic as ours.  We must give praise where praise is due.  We might criticise Government policy in respect of fisheries in the past but the industry has been showing a cheering dynamism during the past few years.  This is extremely welcome and is due partly to the efforts of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and is, indeed, the result of the Government's efforts which are more vigorous than they were in the past. Secondly, if one considers fisheries as a percentage of GNP, the comparison between Norway and Ireland leaves the Irish fishing industry relatively more important than that of Norway.  The discrepancies in terms of growth in GNP between the Norwegian and Irish industries is not as great as one might be led to think.  The argument has been put forward that fisheries are not as important to us as they are to Norway but I do not think that argument can stand an examination because of the dynamism of our industry and the present scale of its operations.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to training and research.  He spoke <Col N="1509" /> about the Government's decision to establish a permanent fisheries school at Greencastle.  County Donegal.  As one who has been engaged at university level in the field of agricultural production. I welcome any initiative to improve the level of knowledge and expertise of fishermen.  Training facilities are long overdue but it is heartening to know they are being provided now.  Fisheries have changed from the type of folk traditional occupation of 50 years ago to one of the most sophisticated enterprises in the gaining of food.  The industry has become more sophisticated than average farming. A good fisherman needs to understand such matters as navigation, electronic equipment and sonar.  Also, he must understand the sea as well as understanding machinery.  It is a complex and sophisticated profession.</P>
    <P>I have experience in my own professional life of teaching institutions, not of the fisheries kind but of the agricultural schools and the veterinary school run by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Before offering a criticism I want to exempt many dedicated and noble people who work extremely hard and fruitfully in these schools but having said that I want to indicate that everything I have experienced in more than 20 years of professional life and, prior to that, during my years as a student, convinces me that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are unsuited to the running of any place where people are taught anything.  I say this because where the Department are running an institution, there is the dead hand, there is bureaucracy.  Of course one finds the occasional noble person striving, even at the cost of his own well being, to do a decent job.  However, it is obvious to me that if there are to be good schools concerned with training people in the gaining of food, be it from the land or from the sea, these schools should be structured in a more flexible and a more vigorous way than is possible when they are part of a Government Department.  When I say &ldquo;part of a Government Department&rdquo; I mean that there is a partial liberation, a sort of window-dressing.  Where the real power remains with the Department and where there are certain concessions or <Col N="1510" /> tokens towards liberation or democracy or control, these do not work either.</P>
    <P>I am convinced of two things.  First, the Department are not able to do this job to the standard required.  The second thing of which I am convinced is that it is not enough in education just to teach people the necessary skills: how to repair the electronic gear, the engine or to look after the winches and so on.  The largest fishery nation in the world for fish that people eat is Japan.  It is not the largest in terms of total catch but most of the enormous South American catches are for fishmeal. The largest fishery industry for human consumption is the Japanese industry.  This is a dynamic industry which is backed by the universities as well as by training schools up to the very highest level.  The most advanced science in the world in the area of fisheries exists largely in Japanese universities and institutes.</P>
    <P>In terms of our location as an island off a continent&mdash;as regards geography not as regards population or otherwise &mdash;we are the Japan of Europe.  We are the offshore island with the tremendous fishing grounds, the huge continental shelf, the big ocean current flowing towards us and welling up on our shores with its food supplies.  We have this extraordinary potential for fisheries and indeed for other aspects of marine science.  I do not intend to pursue this because it would be out of order on this Supplementary Estimate, but I just note in passing that there is no estimate where the general subject of marine science may be properly pursued, although it is of crucial importance for Ireland.  We are extraordinarily defective in this area of the sea which could be our greatest wealth.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to have a training school under the control of the Department and not linked with the universities. We have some very good marine biologists in Ireland with tremendous dedication, but there is a shortage of funds.  I shall not name individuals, but let me say that the most obvious case for a tremendous input into fisheries research is Galway, specifically into the marine biological work that is going on there.  The connection of Greencastle <Col N="1511" /> not with the university but with a Government Department is the wrong connection, because there are other matters involved besides managing the boat, the gear and so on.  I want to say this about the fishermen I have known.  They live in another world, a vastly fascinating and exciting world. They are people of considerable vigour and courage; they have to be because it is a dangerous and exacting calling they have chosen.  Their vigour and courage carry over into a curiosity of mind.  They are anxious to study the sea and its fish and the possibilities of catching those fish.  We have absolutely failed to structure a relationship between training on the level that is necessary to work the boats and land the fish and training at an academic level in regard to the whole question of the resources and conservation of fish, the possibility of developing new sorts of fishery, the handling of fish, preservation, sterilisation, marketing, all that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>We have some very good people, some of them personal friends of mine over a considerable period, working in both fresh water and marine research in the Fisheries Section of the Department of Agriculture.  As someone who has worked in that Department and tried to do research there, I think the atmosphere there is so extraordinarily unfriendly towards research, so extraordinarily bureaucratic and unfeeling that again we have an instance where a Government Department is the wrong structure in which to employ research workers and the wrong place from which to expect creative and fruitful work to come.</P>
    <P>Research and training should be brought much closer to the university. There is the physics of waves, the design of hulls, the design of telecommunication equipment, the design of engines, the design of nets, and there is the question of how the quantity of water with which we are concerned behaves in regard to detecting devices and so on.  These need physics and engineering as sophisticated as the exploration of space needs.  In regard to the fish themselves, you need the most sophisticated biology and <Col N="1512" /> chemistry.  You have to be in a university where you can talk to a physicist or a chemist over lunch and say: &ldquo;I have a problem about a fish.  Has this ever been sorted out in regard to a man or a domestic mammal?&rdquo; The place for fisheries research or ocean research is close to the universities with all the knowledge, at one end, of economics and business management, to pure physics and chemistry, at the other end.</P>
    <P>My own professional interests are concerned with farm livestock rather than with fish, but the problems are not so different in terms of how you carry on education and research.  The end product is human food.  I know the sophistication that exists in this area in other countries, in Britain, France, Denmark and Germany, for example. I know the marketing that is done in those places.  We are dealing with people who will be more efficient, more scientific and better people in the market place than we are.  That is not a counsel of despair for us that we do not have the talent, the ability or the courage to match them.  We have all those things, but we need the structure and the investment to match them.  We cannot do it just by calling up superhuman efforts from dedicated people. We must help those people.</P>
    <P>The training to which I refer goes right through to the question of fish quality, the handling, processing and transport of fish and new product development of fish.  When I say &ldquo;fish&rdquo; I mean everything that comes out of the sea.  We are going to be up against tough, professional people.  We shall have access to their markets and they will have access to ours.  If we do take the decision to go in we are utterly unfitted for that in terms of research development work for our fishery industry. It may be said that it does not generate enough revenue at the moment to finance input on the scale I envisage.  Certainly at the present levels of production and export it does not, but the growth rate now, if we do not wreck it by leaving it unprotected to harsh competition, is high and has been high in the recent past.  Whether we are in or out, the potential is absolutely <Col N="1513" /> enormous.  The Parliamentary Secretary argues that the only way to realise this potential is by full membership.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to be a fish economist. I do not know the details of the restrictions that exist, but I think they are rather less than what is suggested in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech. Some restrictions do exist in the EEC and more may exist for those who have to put their fish in from outside.  I have not gone into this area in detail and I do not claim expert knowledge of it, but I can make an inference from the outside.  I believe that in round terms, perhaps it is a little less now, but certainly a few years ago the Norwegian industry was 20 times greater than ours.  It is fairly dynamic and efficient in certain ways, certainly in marketing and in researching markets.</P>
    <P>It may be that it will be of very significant advantage to us in terms of quantities and prices to be a full member of the EEC.  I can see that possibility. I am not refuting it with research and with detailed figures, but I refute it with this general thought.  The Norwegians do not believe it.  They have a far bigger industry than we have and they believe the opposite.  They believe it not just in the context of access to their coastal waters after a decade, but in the actual interests of their industry and of the sales of their industry.  They believe that they will be better off outside.  I do not know what their reasons are.  I do not know the small print.  It would take, perhaps, a week of fairly hard research into the economics of fish transport, fish sales and Community policy and this I have not done.  I say that freely.  I note the conclusion by the Norwegians and they have researched it very carefully and very thoroughly.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word now about the question of fisheries protection. I note that we are in the course of spending £¾ million on a Decca navigation system, spread over ten years. In terms of the usefulness of the service that will be obtained that is extraordinarily cheap.  It will give us a service which was utterly unthinkable a quarter of a century ago at what is and will be in terms of benefits a <Col N="1514" /> very small price.  There has been an explosion in what is electronically and technologically possible not only in navigation at sea but also on the question of surveillance.</P>
    <P>We use rather traditional methods of surveillance.  We have two boats. Perhaps two are not enough and we should have more.  I do not intend to talk now about what we should do with our Naval Service.  I believe that we should have a completely restructured service rather like the US coastguard service with a number of responsibilities of which fishery protection would be one.  The point I am making is that as of 1st January, 1973&mdash;not so far away now&mdash;we will have to give comparable access to all the member countries to our shore facilities.  Already a good deal of poaching is going on and the temptation will not grow less; it will become greater.</P>
    <P>The arguments for helicopters, particularly in relation to the west, are pretty strong.  It would seem to me that we ought to have a more complex method of enforcing our limits.  The assault on them is already considerable and will grow.  The method of enforcing limits should include the two boats, and there is an argument for having more which could be used for fisheries research and for oceanography and hydrography.  Now that we are getting a Decca network system we should consider whether we should not use radar from fixed shore sources, and possibly from floating ones also, and helicopters with the boats to give us a more complex and more modern method of enforcing our limits.  To me they are unsatisfactory but still they are there and we must protect them for as long as we can and as well as we can. It may be that what I am suggesting is uneconomic.  This is an area in which I would not claim any expertise.  I should like to hear some thoughts on it from the Parliamentary Secretary. From the point of view of protection it might be money very well spent.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons for having pretty sophisticated surveillance on our west coast.  The south west of the country juts out into the busiest shipping lane in the world.  We have a lighthouse system and we have a lifeboat system.  If we have to spend money on <Col N="1515" /> fishery limits, on navigation aids and on lighthouses, on a totally different sort of navigation aid for different sorts of ships, and if we have to maintain a watch for wrecks and have certain arrangements for rescue at sea, and if we also need oceanography and hydrography and fish research on our coasts, there is an argument for putting all these different needs together and get-thing more cost effectiveness in that area.  It may be that I am talking nonsense now, but I should like to hear an opinion on that.</P>
    <P>There was an interesting passage on the Inland Fisheries Trust.  We cannot offer very much sun to tourists but inland fisheries is an area of enormous potential and the more money that is pumped into developing it and doing conservation work on it the better for Irish fishermen, for the industrial aspect which must increase in certain areas, and also for angling tourists.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that over the years repeated appeals have been made to the anglers of this country to join the Trust.  I knew the Trust existed.  I knew it had been doing useful things. While not directly in the area of the work of the Trust, both as a broadcaster and journalist and professional worker in the veterinary field, I would probably be a little more likely than the average person in the community to know about the work of the Trust. I am also personally disposed to join organisations which I think are doing something useful in areas of applied biology in which the Trust functions. Until I read that speech I did not know that I could join it as a private individual. That was news to me.</P>
    <P>I might be asked how I could be so damn silly and so uninformed and that may be the correct and proper answer. I am suggesting that if I did not know it many other people who might be well disposed to it and willing to join it did not know it either.  Therefore, it might be useful not just to make the appeal which the Parliamentary Secretary very properly makes in his speech, but also to use the media to urge people to join it because there is a bit of ignorance and a bit of hiding of light under the bushel in this area.  Voluntary membership is a very useful way by which to <Col N="1516" /> get participation and funds.  The work of the Inland Fisheries Trust is very useful.  The fact that one can join it should be promoted very vigorously.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, whether or not we go into the Community, that the potential, particularly of our sea fisheries, is unarguably vast both in the fish there and the fact that they can be caught and sold.  That is a truth that nobody can escape from.  The other truth is that there is a highly developed world fishing industry, that we are far down the list of total catch, that there is both a great deal of theoretical knowledge and very hard pushing necessary for the sale of fish, that, either in or out, none of the benefits of this enormous resource will come to us of their own accord.  We need to make a very great effort, not just in development such as BIM are doing, but also in the areas of basic research and development as well as in the areas of training for the whole fishing industry and not simply in the matter of Government run schools or of teaching men how to fish. There is much more to it than that.  If we do not put in that extremely vigorous research and development effort up to the highest level, then others besides Irish fishermen and the people on shore associated with the fishing industry will benefit from the undoubted resource which all the evidence proves is there and which we have neglected for half a century of independence.  On the basis of the scale of vision in the Parliamentary Secretary's report we look like continuing to neglect this at least in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for the manner in which this Estimate was introduced. Fishing to me is one of our most important industries, particularly as far as my constituency of South Kerry is concerned.  This constituency takes in the whole coastline from Castletownbere right up by the Beara Peninsula through Kenmare back to Caherciveen. Cromane, Castlemaine and the Dingle Peninsula as well.  Therefore, fishing is a very important industry as far as South Kerry is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note that the landings have increased from one million in 1969 to four million in <Col N="1517" /> 1970 and that the value of exports has doubled between 1967 and 1970.  It is worth noting that the British were our best customer by taking about 41 per cent of our exports in 1970.  It is also worth noting that substantial exports were made to the Continent, particularly France, Germany and the Netherlands, and that the exports to the six member counties of the EEC amounted to over £2 million or 47 per cent of our total fish exports, also that exports to the six countries of the EEC and to the other three applicant countries represented no less than 89 per cent of our 1970 fish exports.  This augurs well for our marketing prospects on our entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>These are very vital facts.  They certainly substantiate the merit of our application for entry into the EEC so far as our fishing industry is concerned. I believe our negotiators got the best bargain they could under the circumstances, as far as fishing is concerned. It would be very nice, as you could infer from some statements being made up and down the country, if we could get into the EEC so far as our agricultural industry is concerned and stay out as far as fishing is concerned. We cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department exploring with more vigour the prospects of nationalising our inland fisheries.  I have been advocating this for a considerable period.  I believe it is vital for the future of this country that this should take place.  It will cost a lot of money, and this is probably the greatest problem, but I believe that can be overcome over a period.  In the years to come should we succeed in nationalising our inland fisheries I believe it would save us from endless trouble and difficulties, particularly in County Kerry, where we have so many foreign landlords still owning large stretches of good fishing rivers.  It is very hard on local people who are interested in fishing to find they cannot fish the local rivers or local streams.  This requires constant restraint on the part of these local people at the present time.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one particular area near Kenmare, known as the Sheen Falls or the Sheen River, <Col N="1518" /> which is foreign controlled.  There are a number of men employed during the fishing season by the landlord of this river but what they take out of it is miserable compared with what the landlord takes out of the river.  This property was offered for sale on a few occasions during the past few years.  I would strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to see if it would be possible for the State to acquire this property.  This would be a step in the right direction towards the ultimate aim of nationalising our inland fisheries.  If it was seen that we were setting out towards nationalising inland fisheries it would prevent illegal fishing to a substantial degree.</P>
    <P>Landings of certain types of fish should be subsidised in the same way as other schemes in the field of agriculture. There is no doubt that fishing is very hard work.  It entails long hours at sea away from home and there is always danger to life.  We should therefore examine closely ways and means of subsidising fishing so as to increase the incomes of fishermen, whether the subsidy would be paid on the boats or on the catches.  It is very important that more people should be encouraged to fish for a livelihood. In fishing districts we have experienced a downward trend in the population. By encouraging people to fish in those areas we would create more employment, the income of those districts would be increased substantially and so would the population.  Therefore, a campaign should be commenced to encourage people in those areas to fish for a livelihood.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Department and the Office of Public Works for the great work being done on the pier at Castletownbere.  The improvement of the landing facilities there is a great help to the fishermen in the whole Beara Penninsula.  I should like to see more work being carried out on the smaller piers and landing places throughout the coastline. Many of them are being allowed to fall into decay.  If a programme were drawn up immediately for the repair and improvement of those places one by one, I have no doubt far more people would take up fishing for a <Col N="1519" /> livelihood.  In a number of places in South Kerry young people have come to me to say that they would get larger boats and do more fishing if they had improved landing facilities. I appreciate it would require a lot of money but it would be well spent. Deputy Keating spoke about the huge fishing grounds on the Continental Shelf surrounding this country.  Before we can tap these great resources we must encourage more people to fish and the only way we can do that is to ensure that the occupation will be financially rewarding.</P>
    <P>In many areas there seems to be friction between the local boards of conservators and the fishermen.  This is the case not alone in Kerry but through the country.  Therefore, the Parliamentary Secretary should have a hard look into the manner in which the boards are appointed, elected and re-elected.  I suggest that the whole structure of the boards of conservators should be reorganised.  It is amazing that boards of conservators are very slow to avail of moneys made available for river improvement works. This is due to laxity on the part of the boards.  The fishery staffs employed by county committees of agriculture could do the work being carried out by boards of conservators.  They could do it efficiently because they have a certain amount of knowledge and many of them have a great interest in fishing.  Certainly, from the point of view of protection against river pollution they would be highly effective.  In any case, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should look at the possibility of handing over the protection service from the boards of conservators to the fishery staffs of county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should like to say that the sea rescue service for our fishermen could be improved by having small life saving units in certain districts along the coastline.  I understand there is no official life saving unit between Valentia Island and the tip of West Cork.  That leaves a huge area uncovered. We know the capacity of the unit at Valentia and the great work they have done and are doing.  It is a <Col N="1520" /> very long and difficult district to cover and I see no reason why a small unit should not be set up in a place like Kenmare.  There are people there anxious to set up a unit on a voluntary basis.  This may be more a matter for the Department of Transport and Power but I suggest that, through cooperation between that Department and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, a voluntary unit could be set up in Kenmare.  It could be of vital importance to the area between Beara and Caherdaniel which embraces the whole of Kenmare Bay.  The sea rescue service is very important and if we are to encourage more people to take up fishing as a livelihood we must improve the service.</P>
    <P>A great case in support of our entry to the EEC as far as fisheries are concerned was stated by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I shall quote from page 11 of his introductory speech:</P>
    <P>In 1970 we exported fish and fishery products to the total value of £4.6 million.  Of these exports over 89 per cent went to the EEC and the three other applicant countries, as I have already mentioned.  Thus less than 11 per cent of our fish exports went to countries outside the EEC and the applicant countries.  Our significant trade with the existing EEC countries has been achieved despite our exporters being hampered by import duties and in some cases by quantitative restrictions. When we are members of the Community the abolition of these duties and other restrictions will greatly enhance the prospect for our trade and we will, of course, also retain our present free entry opportunities in the UK market.  In view of the expansion which has taken place in our fishing industry in recent years it is essential that markets continue to develop.  Our home market is limited so we must look to export markets to absorb our increased production.  The main items we have available for export are herring, salmon and shellfish, fresh and processed&mdash;all products which will continue to be in good demand in the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see what future <Col N="1521" /> there would be for our fishing industry if Britain, Norway and Denmark joined the Community and we remained outside.  In such event we could lose our free access to the British market and find ourselves confronted with the same restrictions which at present limit our trade with the EEC.  More than this, Community fish would then enjoy free access to the British market.</P>
    <P>No greater case could be made for our entry to the EEC so far as fishing is concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like again to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and the officials of his Department for the manner in which they are carrying out their duties and looking after our fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the extensive detail he has made available to the Members of the House in respect of this Estimate.</P>
      <P>I represent an area which many people would not regard as a fishing port.  Nevertheless, we have in the Dún Laoghaire area an increasing number of full-time workers in the industry.  It is now in the top half dozen or so fishing ports in the country.  If the industry can develop as we would wish to see it develop Dún Laoghaire and the other fishing ports will expand rapidly in the matter of employment and the availability of facilities.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's statement highlights the relatively embryonic state of the industry in our economy.  I have always strongly felt that the potential of the sea round this country has never been fully exploited by any government.  It has not got the attention it merited in the various programmes for economic expansion.  It is a natural resource which could provide very substantial employment and could contribute very substantially to the income of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's figure of £8.6 million.  He said that in the year 1970 the total external income attributable to our fisheries was in the region of £8.6 million.  The <Col N="1522" /> first eight months of 1971 are encouraging despite the late start of the season. However, the Parliamentary Secretary did include in that figure of £8.6 million the sum of £4 million from angling tourism.  The Government would need to have a sharp look at the projections for 1972 because, without wanting to sound an undue note of alarm, I have a feeling that that figure will be substantially down in view of the current serious political situation in this island as a whole. Angling tourism has been growing substantially and has been a valuable source of income.  I think this will be affected quite considerably.  I would point out though to those whom we would wish to welcome to our shores for offshore and inshore fishing that they have not a great deal to fear. Nevertheless, I am concerned about the figures for 1972.</P>
    <P>Every politician in the country is to blame for the neglect of the sea which is very much characterised by the fact that we, an island nation, have not got a separate Government Department for maritime affairs.  I strongly feel we should have, to ensure that our maritime affairs are fully co-ordinated and developed.  It is remarkable that we have never set up such a Department. Other small nations, with lesser resources than we have had, have developed their fishing potential and have indeed on many occasions&mdash;one can take the example of the Norwegians &mdash;rivalled the greatest powers by the proper utilisation of maritime resources. By contrast, in this country successive governments have allowed not only our fishing interests but also our shipping interests to run down with the consequent social and economic decay of a good deal of our coastal areas, particularly in the west of Ireland. These are factors which are not dealt with in any great depth in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, although it is hopeful and in many areas the approach is extremely progressive.</P>
    <P>We should laud and encourage by every means possible those young men who take their courage in their hands and commit themselves to, say, a 75-foot trawler costing anything up to <Col N="1523" /> £50,000 to £70,000 on a ten-year repayment basis.  Men in their twenties and thirties have decided to take up fishing as a livelihood.  They deserve the support of this House.  We should make sure that their livelihood is protected. Every incentive should be given to these young men.  We need hundreds of fully trained sea fishermen.  We also need an expanding training scheme which would give more varied training to all potential fishermen.</P>
    <P>A Department of Maritime Affairs is needed.  Such a Department should be responsible for the whole fishing industry.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara should have close association with such a Department.  At the present time nobody is sure of the relationship between Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Such a Department should be responsible for the operation and expansion of the shipping fleet and also for the shipbuilding industry.  They could also be responsible for coastal protection and the problems of coastal pollution.  Such matters are closely connected with the fishing industry and the quality of life of our nation.  The functions of lifesaving, salvage, the charting of our waters and the preservation and development of inland waterways are dispersed throughout various Government Departments.  All such matters could be under the control of a Department of Maritime Affairs.</P>
    <P>The general structure of our port authorities should be reviewed.  The structure of these authorities cannot be regarded as being particularly democratic or reflective of local involvement. The structure of the port authorities has been inherited from the British model.  Local organisations, particularly fishing and shipping organisations, are not sufficiently involved.  If we are to have a proper plan for the co ordinated development of our ports the present structure of port control in the country must be replaced.  If we had a Department of Maritime Affairs the Naval Service would be more effectively involved in this kind of structure. We appreciate the recent developments in respect of the naval fishery protection <Col N="1524" /> but there are areas of effective coast watching, fishery protection, and hydrographic services which could be co-ordinated in such a Department.  The whole approach to maritime affairs in this country would be better if we had such a Department.  We in this House have a habit of accepting the structure of particular organisations and of trying to marry the estimates to them. That is not very effective.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to points made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary for all the serious defects in the fisheries section of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries but there has been failure to resolve and clarify a number of major policy decisions affecting the future of Bord Iascaigh Mhara in relation to the operation of EEC regulations in regard to fishery products.  The regulations have shown the Government that decisions in relation to BIM are needed.  The absence of any statement by the Government on this matter is causing some disquiet. The regulations clearly envisage definite decisions by the Government on designating marketing organisations, producer organisations and control organisations of a very definite functional nature.  These regulations are quite explicit.  We have no indications from the Government as to whether or not the fisheries division of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is to do the work of co-ordination or whether the work will devolve on BIM. One of the regulations states that member states shall notify other member states and the Commission at the latest one month after the coming into force of each marketing standard of the name and address of the agencies entrusted with checks in respect of the product or groups of products for which the standard has been adopted. In the same regulations it is stated:</P>
    <P>The rules for the implementation of paragraph I shall, as required, be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 29 and account be taken in particular of the need to ensure the co-ordination of the activities of the checking agencies as well as the uniform interpretation and application of the common marketing standards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> If the Government are serious about entry to the Common Market and about bringing our fishing industry into the EEC there is need for urgent Cabinet decisions.  One does not have to be possessed of divine intuition to know that relations between the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and Bord Iascaigh Mhara are at best in a state of general confusion over the occurrences of the past few months.  At worst they could be said to be in a state of strained reaction, one to the other.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should speak urgently with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs would not object.  I would ask him to please stop playing politics and get the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the man who is really responsible, to say what the policy decisions are.  I am very pessimistic about the Cabinet taking the requisite decisions.  I am not very hopeful that we will have a definite Cabinet decision and we will drift into the Common Market with our fisheries in the same sort of chaotic position as the sugar industry is facing.  The prime concern of the Government at the moment is to ensure that the referendum is successfully got out of the way and, when that has been achieved, they will deal with these other important matters in their own good time. That is neither good nor effective government.  The semi-permanent political heads of Departments are more concerned with opening garages and lounge bars around the country than they are with doing the work for which they are paid by the taxpayers.  This is not fair to the permanent civil servants.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred, including Deputy Collins, to Article 23.  The statement there is clearcut: member states shall take the necessary steps to ensure that facilities are made available to vessels flying the flags of member states.  I do not regard the official explanation of this article as satisfactory. I do not suffer from either xenophobic or introverted nationalism where our fishing industry is concerned, <Col N="1526" /> but I am concerned that the truth should be known and that the electorate should be in a position to make up its own mind in accordance with its own conscience.  We have not been told if there is any means by which the French and the Dutch trawlers can be prevented from glutting the Dublin fish market.  While interim regulations may be of some benefit they will be of very little use after the event.  As from January next this possibility will be there and there is a serious obligation on the Parliamentary Secretary to clarify the position for the benefit of all those engaged in the industry.</P>
    <P>I accept some of Deputy Keating's arguments.  He has been very critical of one or two statements made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He referred, in particular, to the statement that, as a member of the Council, we will be in a position to ensure that our interests will be safeguarded by proper arrangements, including the maintenance of special limits.  Perhaps my colleague has a good point, but it is one which needs clarification.  It has been flogged to death by people.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary is practising deception.  I do not think he is trying to mislead.  But there is need to clarify the position.  The more I read, particularly the more I read of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the fishery industry, the more suspicious I become. My lack of faith deepens.  We must be told whether, at the end of the ten year period, any member can veto the retention of the agreed limits.  We need a categorical denial that that will be the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have made statements, but there is a lack of precision in the statements. We Irish have a certain facility in imprecision.  Perhaps I suffer more from it than others do.  There has been a lack of precision on the part of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The regulations are in precise terms. Now the French catch 150,000 tons of fish off our coast and they operate boats of 40 to 100 feet in length.  They <Col N="1527" /> have almost 3,500 boats.  If they have free access, then the advantage will not lie with us.  This review clause must be clarified.  The fishermen are deeply concerned in this and I doubt if the Government will convince them that adequate protection can be ensured. There has been what was described as a very considerable failure by the Government to ensure that there would be adequate future protection for the fishermen of this area.  This is a legitimate complaint.  I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, as reported at column 880 of the Official Report of 3rd February, that the French have said they will fish permanently during the herring season and that the position is not changed.  They are doing that at present.  I accept that as an objective comment on the position but the fishermen of these areas are most upset and feel that this area, which already has a high economic potential, has been sold out.  I do not use these words lightly or in any hysterical denunciatory sense, but because I am reflecting the reaction of fishermen in this area.</P>
    <P>There is need for a full-scale review, to be jointly undertaken by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department, of the demand for vast and rapid capital investment by the State in this industry.  I do not know where we can get the money, but I am talking in terms of £10 million or £15 million. Whether we go to the World Bank or elsewhere we should not hesitate to try in the next two or three years to get this capital investment launched in the industry.  I am reasonably certain that in four or five years there will be an inevitable slowdown in investment as we approach the end of the ten-year period.  People will hold back and wait for the review negotiations before investing further capital in the industry.  If we are to stand up to what the fishermen would classify as &ldquo;the invaders&rdquo; there is need for considerable State investment.  I do not think private investment will be forthcoming in the atmosphere of uncertainty about the 1982 situation.  One does not invest for only ten years in this type of industry. Every Deputy should press the <Col N="1528" /> Government and the Parliamentary Secretary to produce a straightforward ten-year programme of investment in the industry by specific annual capital sums.  Otherwise, I cannot see how Bord Iascaigh Mhara can plan for the next decade.  In this regard Bord Iascaigh Mhara do not get the sort of programme assistance from the Department that it needs in order to work effectively.</P>
    <P>Despite the welcome information in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement about research facilities being made available and being developed, the Government can take some hammering on this score.  Research facilities for the industry are most inadequate. We have in Galway, as is universally admitted, one of the world's finest scientists in the industry but I have heard many strong complaints about the lack of even basic equipment. Those of us who read the papers &mdash;the report is now available&mdash;and Deputies who attended the June symposium of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards can, I think, point out that at least £250,000 is urgently needed over the next three years for essential equipment for fundamental research to be undertaken by Irishmen.  Without this all the injection of State capital into the industry and any investment could be a shot in the dark.  There is an absurd lack of basic research equipment for the industry.  This criticism must be made.  The Department should not ask staff to devote their scientific training and skills to work for which we do not provide them with the necessary equipment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the new permanent fishery school at Greencastle, County Donegal.  There are many young men in my constituency in Dún Laoghaire who join the Naval Service and many would like to go into the fishing industry fulltime. Already, many families are deeply involved in the industry and working out of Dún Laoghaire port.  One might ask some questions about the new school.  How many fishermen is it designed to accommodate?  Will they be boarded there?  How many staff will be employed and how will <Col N="1529" /> they be chosen?  There is no indication of that.  Will the students be taught anything of the fundamental economies of the industry and the prospects?  Now that we have larger boats requiring much larger down payments I think elementary training in management and in the economics of the industry is urgently necessary in such schools.  We should also ask what steps are being taken to ensure that a fair share of the increasing income of the industry will be available for deckhands.  The more full-time, permanent workers we have in the industry the more it is necessary to ensure that the total income from the industry should not stay in the hands of the skippers, the wholesalers and retailers.  I should like to see the deckhands having their fair share of the income.  Now that the industry is expanding, it is time that there was set up a joint industrial council that would set out basic minimum conditions of employment for, say, deckhands working in the industry.  The nature of the industry is such that skippers, deckhands and onshore workers work in close co-operation with each other, but the conditions of employment and the guaranteeing of basic incomes to the employees are very important.  No matter how good are the terms on which a deckhand may be with his skipper, he must bring home a weekly wage to his family. The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Labour, should ensure the setting up of a fully representative joint industrial council.</P>
    <P>Regarding the extent of the growth of co-operatives in the industry, the Parliamentary Secretary's statement was not very informative.  I should like to see a further major effort being made by the Department, with the assistance of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, for the setting up of more fishing co-operatives throughout the country. This is the only way by which we can have an industry that will not be open to exploitation at either end, either by the fishing consortia on land or on sea. The full facts relating to the catching, processing and retailing aspects of the industry have never been disclosed fully to the Irish people.  Therefore, <Col N="1530" /> there is need for co-operatives in respect of catching, processing and retailing. The structure of such co-operatives should be encouraged fully.  On this aspect I found the Parliamentary Secretary's brief to be disappointing. Of course there is a fish co-operative in Dún Laoghaire, which has now engaged itself in the retail end of the industry.  This co-operative has been working very successfully and is giving very good value to the local population as well as to the workers employed in the industry.</P>
    <P>I consider the section of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech concerning the question of harbours to be very vague.  In respect of Dún Laoghaire there are particular difficulties.  There are dredging difficulties at Howth and at other harbours, and development has been delayed in some instances by private property interests.  This question should have been covered more extensively in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech.</P>
    <P>Regarding the personnel of the two research ships, it would be interesting to ascertain from the Department the number of days spent at sea by these vessels.  We should be informed as to whether serious research is being carried out off the southern coast for off-season herring fishing.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us what is the likelihood of greater exploitation of mackerel possibilities in the various areas and within the industry itself.  We have not been given any information either as to the number of full-time and part-time fishermen engaged in the industry and the numbers employed currently in the boatyards of Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
    <P>These, then, are some of the points on which Members of the House are entitled to have more information. There is a fundamental failure to develop a research programme of an adequate nature.  I have tabled many questions here requesting information in regard to research and the expenditure on research generally.  The overall impression I have obtained is that the amount of money being allocated is tending to fall, bearing in mind the price changes.  This is an indictment of Government interest in the industry. <Col N="1531" /> So far as I can see, they are only barely interested in an industry that has much greater possibilities than any other.  We are told there is concern about the conservation of certain species.  That is merely a piece of window dressing because there is no co-ordination of any great extent on this matter, as scientific personnel engaged in the industry could testify readily.</P>
    <P>I was encouraged greatly by the conversion of a fellow Munster man, Deputy John O'Leary, to our policy on inland fisheries.  I refer to his suggestion that inland fisheries should be taken into general public ownership. I suppose, now that Deputy Blaney is no longer Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, we will have a sudden conversion on his part also.  The private exploitation of our inland waters is a public scandal and should be ended as quickly as possible.  The inland waterways of this nation are the property and the inheritance of the Irish people and their development must be undertaken by the nation as a whole as a matter of urgency.  Fianna Fáil are a party that talk frequently of their so-called republican base and background. They should at least put that elementary principle into operation.  There is a need for the development of inland waterways as part not only of angling but also in terms of national recreational planning.  There should be established a much more broadly based national eel and salmon fishery industry, utilising modern techniques and exploiting the markets abroad for these products.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I pay tribute to the work done by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Much of the economic progress in the industry is due to their efforts. They should have control of the general aspect of the industry relating to productivity and also to many aspects of policy.  More finance should be made available to them.  The role of the board should be enlarged rapidly and their operations extended, particularly into the wholesale and processing aspects of the industry. More men of practical experience of the industry should be represented on the board.  It augurs well for the future <Col N="1532" /> that the work of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has resulted in considerable benefits to the industry in the recent past.</P>
    <P>Much should be done to exploit the British market generally.  With Britain's entry I can see our fishing industry doing well inside the enlarged Community because it should be borne in mind that British landings of fish for human consumption exceed those of any existing members or of any applicants. Therefore we have on our doorstep one of the largest fish markets in the world.  There is need for us to expand our share of the British market, and if we concentrate our energy on exploiting the tremendous British fish market we shall be making a major breakthrough in the industry.</P>
    <P>This has been a very difficult year in which one was not quite sure who was deciding what, whether it was the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Bord Iascaigh Mhara or the fishery co-operatives.  Perhaps some of the confusion has been sorted out now and no doubt by January, 1973, we shall see that some of the empires which were built will have been tumbled.  Meanwhile the fisheries division of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is to be commended for its efforts in the past year.  It should be rapidly expanded into a full Department of State and I do not think that even the Devlin Report would quarrel with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation to the fisheries division is very inadequate. The fisheries division has always been regarded as a small brother of agriculture. Over the years the Department of Agriculture has not injected sufficient finance to enable the fisheries industry to be viable or progressive. The result over the years has been apathy towards fishing among people you would expect to follow the tradition of their forefathers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently much more attention has been given to a revival of an interest in fisheries, and Bord Iascaigh Mhara have made really progressive strides in encouraging fishermen and their families to form co-operatives and <Col N="1533" /> generally to rebuild the industry to the required strength.  Grants-in-aid and loans have been helpful in the purchase of boats, but many men who are anxious to purchase boats have serious difficulty in getting accommodation from banks or finance companies to purchase a properly equipped boat.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara should investigate the problems of those people.  I am speaking from knowledge of particular cases, and I am rather disappointed that more encouragement is not being given to people who are breaking new ground.</P>
    <P>The appointment by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society of a full-time organiser to promote co-operatives is a very useful step, but that can only be really effective if the groundwork is already laid and if people are assured that every assistance will be given to them when they undertake fishing as a livelihood. There is no major fishery harbour development in County Clare, despite the fact that we have the best and the most sheltered waters in the country in the Shannon Estuary.  All that coastline has been neglected.  No major processing factories have been sited there. Surveys of harbours are now being undertaken but is it not rather late for that?  In an area where there is a record of high emigration policies should be directed towards encouraging people to live in that area.  I know of one rural district on the coastline where there are 1,000 fewer people now than there were when the last census was taken in 1966.  In another rural district, again on the coastline, there are 600 fewer.</P>
    <P>Fishery research has been undertaken rather late, but that does not mean it is not welcome and necessary. Without adequate research a proper programme cannot be planned.</P>
    <P>As regards the effects of entry into the EEC on our fisheries, there are many disturbing features.  While entry promises wonderful advantages for all our trading activities, and I hope we do decide to enter, many of our fishermen believe that our future partners, with their expensive gear and with their properly equipped ships will, if <Col N="1534" /> you like, rape our fishing grounds without having any regard at all to permitting a growth period to allow young fish to mature.</P>
    <P>The ten mile limit on the west coast will be reviewed in 1982.  This may mean that the fishing limit will be reduced and that other countries will move in nearer to our shores.  We have to maintain our stand.  Our own people must have scope.  They are entitled to protection.  We must maintain an adequate fishing ground for ourselves. If we can persuade our people to consume more fish this will be an encouragement to those who are engaged in the fishing industry.  I must compliment those who are responsible for the publicity given to putting more fish on the menus in our guesthouses and hotels.  The amount of fish consumed may be relatively small but it indicates to our fishermen that we are serious about getting more promotional work done, and in advertising the nutritional value of a fish diet.</P>
    <P>I am totally dissatisfied with the promotional work that has been done on the west coast of Clare.  There has been no research into the siting of a fish processing factory there having regard to the facilities available.  The Parliamentary Secretary should consider, even now, providing something which would relieve the high rate of emigration which has been draining the youth from the west coast.</P>
    <P>More finance should be given to the fisheries section of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Much more money will be available when we enter the EEC, money which hitherto, went on subsidies for our agricultural produce. I see no reason why the industry should not be developed fully all around our shores.  The IAOS organiser will play a vital part in welding together groups of fishermen and giving them every encouragement to buy the equipment and the boats necessary, and having the proper processing plant located in suitable areas for the catches when they are brought in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indebted to my colleagues, Deputy Desmond and Deputy Keating, for standing in for me. Both of them dealt very adequately <Col N="1535" /> with the points which we in the Labour Party feel should be dealt with on this Estimate.  Deputy Keating dealt at some length with the position of the fishing industry in the EEC and with our negotiations over the past year in Brussels.  I do not intend to go back over the ground which my two colleagues have already covered very extensively and very thoroughly.</P>
      <P>In his opening statement the Parliamentary Secretary said that a heavier investment in fishing is being channelled through the Department but a close look at the actual amount involved shows that the figure covered by this Estimate is very small relatively, £1,775,000.  Although it shows a decrease on the previous year, because last year certain amounts of money had to be written off, there is, in fact, an increase of £¼ million over last year's requirements.  The figure of £1,775,000 is relatively small for an industry such as the fishing industry which has been expanding rapidly over the past ten years.</P>
      <P>I believe it is our fastest growing industry.  This year we seem to be peaking at about a total figure of around four million odd.  The improvement up to the end of 1971 will not show a very dramatic increase, I believe, over the 1970 figure.  This, before we enter the EEC, if we enter the EEC, is a bit worrying because, up to and including last year, conditions were good for expansion.  To see the industry beginning to slow up at this stage must be a little worrying for everyone in fishing.  We believe that one of the reasons for this is undoubtedly the uncertainty caused by our negotiations in Brussels and the handling of those negotiations by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that fishing was one of the casualties of the negotiations. In 1971 fishing was regarded as a rather touchy area in the negotiations. Every time the subject was brought up some small excuse was found to put off the hard bargaining until a later stage.  When the negotiating period came to an end and a date was set for the signing of the Treaty Agreement in Brussels, the fishing industry negotiations <Col N="1536" /> were rushed by our negotiators &mdash;and by those in Britain as well&mdash;to meet a deadline so that the Taoiseach could sign the agreement in December, 1971.</P>
    <P>Any trade unionist negotiating in that kind of atmosphere for an ordinary wage agreement would not agree to finish the negotiations on a particular date whether or not the agreement reached was satisfactory to his workers.  It was left to the Norwegians to say: &ldquo;No.  This is not good enough. We will not agree to sign unless we feel we have covered the ground adequately and unless we feel that the various points which are worrying us in the negotiations have been covered.&rdquo;  Our negotiators felt, perhaps, that fishing was of such little importance to the nation that it could be rushed off in the last weeks of the negotiations and arrangements were arrived at which have not been welcomed by anybody in the industry from the head of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara down to the man with the small fishing boat around our coasts.  Everybody is worried about our fishing industry in the future.  I believe this is one of the reasons the dramatic increases which took place in 1968. 1969 and 1970 did not take place in the last year.</P>
    <P>The review clause which appears in the EEC fisheries agreement is vague. I should like to quote from the <i>Irish Skipper</i> of January, 1972 which sets out the official explanation of the EEC agreement.  On page 5 it says:</P>
    <P>Under this review clause we have agreed with the Community that before the expiry of the ten years the Commission should present a report concerning the economic and social development of the coastal areas of the member States and the state of fish stocks.  On the basis of this report and of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy the Council will examine the arrangements to apply after ten years.</P>
    <P>I am sure everybody will agree that this is a very vague promise to fishermen with regard to what will happen at the end of the ten-year period that we have agreed to exclude foreign fishermen of the enlarged EEC from <Col N="1537" /> our waters.  This review clause will cause great indecision in the industry if we enter the EEC.  I believe that people who are at present engaged in fishing will become more cautious about investing extra money in the industry.  It will be much more difficult to attract young people into the industry and it will be difficult to attract businessmen to put money into an industry whose future is likely to be in jeopardy after the ten years expire.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Skipper</i> also says in the January issue:</P>
    <P>The official explanation gives no satisfactory clarification on the subject of fish imports or landings by foreign boats.  While the EEC does operate anti-dumping regulations, we have not been told how, for instance, Dutch or French trawlers working in the Irish Sea can be prevented from glutting the Dublin market occasionally by landing here.  From next January, they will be able to do that.</P>
    <P>The landing of catches by foreign vessels is of considerable importance to our fishing industry.  Occasionally it will be difficult for these boats to return to their home base with their catches and rather than lose them completely they will find they can land them at Irish ports.  It is often very difficult for Irish fishermen to sell their catches but when a glut condition prevails, and this could happen due to weather conditions when foreign boats would land their catches here, we could have a situation where the bottom will fall out of prices for Irish fishermen and valuable catches will have very little value when they are landed.  It is right that the fishermen should have this point cleared up before that eventuality occurs.</P>
    <P>Very little money is being channelled into the fishing industry by the Government through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  If the Department felt the confidence which it should feel in this industry it would endeavour to expand it as quickly as possible before the full effects of the EEC are felt.  We should look to the size of our boats and endeavour to expand to the larger type vessels like those used by boats in the EEC countries.  We have not <Col N="1538" /> done enough to train our fishermen to become more proficient in the handling of the larger type boats.  This is where the real competition will come from in regard to our herring stocks. If our catching ability is limited to the small boats, then our fishing industry will be in for a very tough time in the future.</P>
    <P>My two colleagues have dealt very fully with the EEC position and I do not feel there is any point in going over the same ground.  However, it is worth noting, even before we go into the EEC, that the demand for fish from the EEC countries is there.  In 1970 we exported 89.4 per cent of our fish to the EEC countries and to the countries which will eventually make up the enlarged Community.  If we can do this at the present time, then our fishing industry has no need to worry about the situation if we do not enter the EEC and ask for a trade agreement or other arrangements with the Community.</P>
    <P>Our fishing industry would undoubtedly be stronger if we had complete control of our own destiny and the waters around our coasts.  The fish stocks around the present EEC countries have dwindling because they have been over-fished.  It is natural for these countries to look for more stocks around our coasts.  They are doing this at the moment without our consent.  They are fishing in our waters because we have not adequate protection to stop them.  If we enter the EEC we give them a right to fish in our waters which they had not before.  This is one of the reasons why I will be asking people not to vote in the referendum for EEC membership.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the marketing of fish.  Recently our ecclesiastical laws changed from meat abstinence on Friday.  I said in a previous debate on this Estimate that fish would become more acceptable during the week and would not be a type of penal food only to be eaten when meat was not available. This is still correct.  An opportunity has been given to sell fish every day of the week and efforts are being made to do this but I am not happy that they are sufficient. <Col N="1539" /> I feel that the message has not been got over to me, to my wife or to the ordinary women of the country that fish is a very palatable dish for any day of the week, including Sunday, in Irish homes.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the efforts made by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara on radio and television to popularise fish dishes and to make available a service whereby anybody can ring up the BIM offices any day of the week for a fish dish.  I am sorry to say this type of marketing is not hitting home to the ordinary working family.  It is not getting to the ordinary housewife who has not got a telephone and who rarely has time to sit back and listen to the radio.  She is busy at the time of the day when the sponsored programme comes on.  She has got only one ear to the radio and she cannot avail of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>I should much prefer an active campaign in towns and villages throughout the country, big and small, particularly in the evenings.  I know it is done in a small way but the various clubs and institutions who meet regularly in every village and town should have offers made to them by the staffs of BIM to put on demonstrations at every available opportunity.  There should be a BIM stand during the summer at every agricultural show and at many sports activities, at gymkhanas and regattas all over the country, where demonstrations could be given, as a side show by BIM, showing the various ways in which fish can be cooked apart from boiling and frying which are so often used by ordinary housewives.  A little more money could be invested in BIM for this purpose.</P>
    <P>It has become obvious that the price of meat is exorbitant and that meat is getting less plentiful on the plates of ordinary working families.  I am glad to say the price of fish is not rising at nearly the same rate.  For that reason more people are turning to fish but that is no reason why more attention to publicity campaigns is not required.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I did not think enough money is being put into <Col N="1540" /> fisheries.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that there has been an increase this year of £160,000, but the total investment is £860,000 only.  I do not think this is nearly enough.  If there is confidence in the fishing industry we require a dramatic increase in the amount of money put into it.  I agree with Deputy Desmond's call to have more fishermen put into An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Fishermen should be given a greater opportunity to have their voices heard and I suggest an expansion of the board to allow one or two fishermen in.  In this connection I should be glad to see the Dublin-Wicklow area represented because they have not had enough say in the industry.</P>
    <P>It has become obvious to people on the east coast that very little has been invested there to expand the fishing industry.  I agree there has been investment in boats but not nearly enough has been done by way of harbour improvement. Attention has been paid to Skerries, but Arklow has been neglected completely in this respect. Before the fishing industry got the great impetus and expansion of recent years, Arklow was the traditional fishing harbour on the east coast.  The industry there is not now being pushed sufficiently and the facilities are not as good as they might be.  An expansion of the facilities and of general interest in the industry in that area is badly needed.</P>
    <P>On the question of fishing harbours, an element of uncertainty was introduced by the recent White Paper on local government re-organisation. There was a suggestion in it that the organisation of harbours would be part of general re-organisation in local government. I suggest that the fisheries section of the Department should take over fishery harbours completely. This would be better for the industry. At the moment the fishing industry is spread out over too many areas of Government activity Recently we spoke on fishery protection during the debate on the Defence Estimate.  The break-up of the industry over so many Departments has an uncertain effect, particularly when a Minister feels a certain area should be reduce <Col N="1541" /> organised within his own Department. I hope that as a result of the Devlin Report and of the White Paper on local government re-organisation, fishery harbours as such will become the complete responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>I have suggested that with the expansion of the industry we might have a separate Department of Fisheries such as we had in the 1920s.  The industry has become vital to our economy and I think it is appropriate in these circumstances that there should be a reversion to the original arrangement. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would be ideally suited to look after fisheries in such a new Department. Even though he does not come from a seaside area, I know his interest in fishing is very great.  It would be of great benefit to the industry if a separate Department were set up to deal with all the factors I have mentioned, with harbours, fishery protection <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>We have been told that there has been an investment of £¾ million in bringing the Decca navigation system to the coasts of Ireland.  This is very welcome.  It was essential for the safety of our fishermen and to ensure that they can get to and from the grounds quickly that a proper navigation system should have been introduced.  I compliment the Department on bringing this about so quickly.  Those of us on the east coast are aware that we have been linked up with the Continent and that now the coasts of Denmark and Holland, all around the British coast and the waters of the Irish Sea are covered by the navigation system.  It is only right that this should be extended to the west coast of Ireland.  I welcome the investment made by the Department in this system.  However, the cost of receiving apparatus on the boats is very high.  I hope that money will be made available to fishermen to enable them to benefit fully from the Decca navigation system.  The demands on the purses of the fishermen are very great and it would be a pity if because of other pressure they did not have receiving apparatus.  If money were made available <Col N="1542" /> by way of loan or even grant for this purpose it would complete a very worthwhile exercise by the Department.</P>
    <P>I think the Department have dragged their feet a little on the question of the education of young fishermen.  It is many years since we heard that a school was to be set up at Greencastle, County Donegal.  I think it was Deputy Blaney who first mooted the idea when he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The school has still not been completed.  A better effort could have been made to put this school into operation.  In order to bring young people into the industry, moves should be made to set up another school at the opposite end of the country, in either the Cork or Wexford areas.  This is where the population is most dense and this is where the young people will come in increasing numbers into the industry. A school should be established within a reasonable distance of that area where the industry has expanded in recent years.</P>
    <P>I know that on this Estimate we are not allowed to discuss fishery protection but if our fishing industry is to survive, either inside or outside the EEC, this aspect of the industry must be looked at much more closely.  Protection has been strengthened but there are various opinions about the type of boats that should be used for this work.  I think the Fisheries Division themselves should have their own protection boats.  It is their business. I do not think it should be left to the Department of Defence.  Their job is to maintain a navy, not a protection service.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that fishery protection should be taken over by that Department.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment the Department on their efforts in expanding the industry over the past few years.  The figures show the dramatic improvement that has taken place.  I believe the results are in direct proportion to the efforts being put into fisheries by the Department and by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I am a little worried about what appears to be a flattening out of the peak at the moment.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1543" /> figures are not to hand for 1971 but I am afraid the dramatic increases of the last few years have not continued into 1971.  I hope I will be proved wrong but the indications, even in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, are that 1971 will not show the expansion we have seen in recent years.  I have already explained why I think this might be so.  I hope that in the future we can get over these problems.  I am fearful for the fishing industry in the EEC but I think if the Department now tackle the aspects that have been referred to by Deputies Keating and Desmond, myself and others, the worries the industry have at present can be removed.  I hope when we discuss this Estimate next year our fears will have proved to have been false and that there will have been a still further dramatic expansion in the fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Kavanagh in complimenting the Department on the expansion that has taken place in recent years.  I sincerely hope this can be continued no matter what changes take place in the organisation of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we think of fisheries we naturally think of the west coast.  Like Deputy Kavanagh, I represent an area on the east coast which still has some fishing left.  Of course, there are very fine fishing centres on the south east coast.  Few people would object to more help being given on the western coast in order to build up a really efficient fleet there.  I am not referring to inshore fisheries only.  In the future we should put more emphasis on the building up of a deep sea fleet not only to compete with other Europeans but to fulfil a long-felt want in our fishing industry.  As a means of providing good employment and producing more of our own food, it is essential that we should have this deep sea fleet as soon as possible.  We are an island race but we do not eat as much fish per head as they do in other countries.  It is still difficult to ensure a steady supply of fresh fish to all parts of the country. We should ensure that we supply our home markets properly.  The catering industry should do everything possible <Col N="1544" /> to encourage the consumption of fish. Fish is a source of wealth.  Men undertake arduous sea journeys to keep us supplied with fish and we must ensure that they are adequately compensated for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara are doing excellent work.  They have shown great willingness to help the fishing industry.  We have been told that we will face many problems when we enter the EEC.  I should like to refer to the problem of pollution which exists whether we enter the EEC or not.  A statement was made by Mr. Thor Heyerdahl in Strasbourg in January 1972.  This man sailed in the <i>Kon-Tiki</i> across the Pacific Ocean and in more recent times took the papyrus ship, <i>Ra</i>, across the Atlantic Ocean. He stated in his report as follows:</P>
    <P>As stated by ecologists in all fields, the pollution of air, land and water all sum up as one final unit, pollution of the sea.</P>
    <P>Mr. Heyerdahl stated that unless action is taken to control pollution the Pacific and Atlantic oceans will be destroyed.  In his report he gave figures for the French rivers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we discussing pollution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Pollution affects fisheries. This report deals with the destruction of fisheries by pollution. The French rivers probably held fish at some time but they now discharge 18 thousand million cubic metres of liquid pollution annually into the sea. The city of Paris alone discharges almost 1,200,000 cubic metres of untreated effluent into the Seine every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often boasted that Dublin must be the only European capital which has a fish-bearing river running through its centre.  When I was young I saw salmon being caught in the Dublin area by fishermen using seine nets.  I have seen over 100 salmon caught at a time.  Nowadays only a few hundred salmon are caught in the Liffey each year because of pollution and other reasons.  Pollution is one of the primary causes of the decrease in salmon stocks.  Even the fish in the <Col N="1545" /> Arctic circle are affected today.  It has been proved that pesticides such as DDT seem to affect the penguins there. Lake Erie and other lakes have been killed by pollution.  We should do everything we can to keep our rivers and streams clear of pollution.  The Department and BIM are very much aware of the problems involved and have taken steps to control pollution. Mankind is faced with the problem of saving the seas and the oceans from becoming dead.  Mr. Heyerdahl entitled his paper &ldquo;Can humanity survive in the conditions of the present technological civilisation?&rdquo;  All efforts of European countries to build up the fishing industry will be destroyed unless firm measures are taken.  If there was a surplus of fish it could be given to poorer countries to help them to survive.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the cost to the country of the losses to the French fishing industry because of pollution have been measured accurately.  These losses cannot be afforded.  Pollution must be prevented in order to safeguard our in-shore fisheries.  When a man of Mr. Heyerdahl's standing sends out a document of this kind on pollution he is not offering a solution beyond what we ourselves know of.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the Port of London authority for what they have done to restore fish life to the river Thames.  Two years ago there were no fish in that river.  The British people have spent tremendous sums and have succeeded in having some fish life in the Thames again.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should study the difficulties of the fishing industry.  They know that the biggest problem is not lack of finance or the problems posed by EEC entry or even the pirate trawlers which enter our waters but the problem of pollution which we share with all countries in the world.</P>
    <P>When I was young Dublin had a fine fishing fleet.  That fleet gradually disappeared. Today the amount of fish landed at Dublin is only a small fraction of that landed in the 1930s.  I am not suggesting that Dublin should become a major fishing centre.  This might prove attractive to some people <Col N="1546" /> because of the large market available within a few miles of the port.  Priority should be given to the west coast in regard to planned fishing development. There could be full employment on the west coast if our fishing fleets and our processing factories were developed to the highest degree possible.  Employment could be given by building up a modern fleet and by employing modern handling and modern marketing methods.</P>
    <P>Fish should be in full supply all over the country.  If one asks for fish in some of the smaller towns one is met with an incredulous stare.  This is no reflection on the people in these towns; it is due to the fact that we have so far failed to market fish properly. No effort is made to ensure that there is a steady supply of fish to all parts of the country.  There is no problem in the cities and bigger towns, but all our people do not live in cities and big towns.</P>
    <P>The work done by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to interest our children in fish is excellent.  As a result of essay competitions the children are now beginning to realise the excellence of fish.  Many of these youngsters can write better essays on fish than I could; they would probably be better able to speak about it too.  I hope this activity by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will be extended to every village and hamlet so that the whole country will become fish-minded.</P>
    <P>Fish is becoming more popular, but we have still a long way to go.  With proper development of our fisheries there is no reason why there should not be full employment particularly in the west.  If fish were popularised to the extent it should be the west could become a really viable part of our national territory.  The seas there are less polluted than they are in other parts around our coasts.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we must spell out clearly the dangers of pollution.  We will have to join with other nations in checking or prohibiting pollution.  The Rhine has been described as a sewer; 50,000 tons of waste are daily discharged into the Rhine.  Fish life could not survive there.  The Germans and others are <Col N="1547" /> now awakening to this peril and they are taking steps to correct the situation. Fortunately, we do not have that volume of pollution, but we have a problem.  I trust that some money will be devoted towards awakening people to this danger and educating them in the proper measures to correct it.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that money spent on a fishing fleet will be money wasted if we do not take steps to ensure the survival of the fish.  We will do that by preventing the pollution of the waters around our coast. We will also have to prevent pollution of our lakes and rivers.  From the Arctic right down to the Antarctic the oceans of the world are becoming polluted.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will have to join with the Department of Local Government, the Department of Health and other bodies to prevent pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would begin by sympathising with the Parliamentary Secretary and with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  This sympathy is in no way intended to be a reflection on the efforts of either the Parliamentary Secretary or An Bord Iascaigh Mhara. It is rather an indication of my belief that our fisheries have not been given a fair deal and have not been taken seriously by successive Governments and, in particular, by the Department of Finance over the years.  Even if we do not go into Europe, we are still only toying with the development of our fisheries.  We have been toying with them for years.  All we have done is scratch the surface of the huge potential in the waters around our coast.  This policy goes back for many years, right back to the initial development of our fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That development over the years stems from a sort of hand-out-to-a-poor-relation attitude rather than taking up the matter seriously and devoting to it the huge sums of money required if the potential is to be realised. We should stop fiddling around and tending to clap ourselves on the back if from one year to the next we increase our total catch value by from 10 to 30 per cent.  We should aim at a <Col N="1548" /> tenfold increase in the fishing industry if it is to be an industry and not just a poor relation or a sort of social welfare dependant.</P>
    <P>This is what we have been doing; I have been in charge of fisheries and I say that because I have been there. as well as because of my firm belief when I was there that this is the manner in which we approach it.  For proper development we need fishermen, craft and, above all, we need harbours. We are not doing enough about anything.  Recent experience has been that the cheeseparing insisted on by the Department of Finance, in particular, no doubt with the authority of the Government, has been such that even the most modest efforts made or planned have been cut down or long-fingered.  Deputies representing fishermen are just being codded along. I do not accuse the Parliamentary Secretary or his Fisheries Section of that; they are also being codded but they are being knowingly codded while many of us are just being codded.</P>
    <P>For instance, in the recent past we had the effort to establish the first permanent fisheries school in the country.  It was decided that it should go to Greencastle, Donegal, in my own constituency, perhaps, one of the fastest-growing fishery ports in the country and a proper setting for it. There was a general idea that it was being put there because I had been in Fisheries and wanted it there.  This is far from true.  It is my belief, and this is known to those in the Fisheries Section, that this should be only the first of at least two, and if we develop properly, of three, four or five such schools which would be required to give the instruction and education to potential fishermen which modern techniques now demand and will demand even more in the future.  Instead of getting on with that school which should have opened last September, we find after a long and weary wait, the building of it has only now begun.</P>
    <P>From the Parliamentary Secretary's speech it seems, though it is not absolutely clear, that the only ambitions for this school at present are limited to one year courses in navigation on a low scale for skippers' tickets <Col N="1549" /> and so on which are being covered now by itinerant courses throughout the country.  This is not what this type of school was intended for although that could be its basic function at the beginning.  It was intended that it should become the fisherman's university or school of technology and that ultimately four or five year courses could be envisaged to provide the highest qualifications which would be useful not only in deep-sea fishing but might avail men going on ocean-going craft not engaged in fishing.  This is the sort of school I was trying to nurture when I was in that Department.  The Parliamentary Secretary's speech mentions in a low key what the school is likely to do but if I am wronging him and if this is only the initial idea for the immediate future, very well: on the other hand, if what he has said is regarded as the be-all and end-all of this school, I am immediately entirely at odds with him and the Government which would dictate that that should be so.</P>
    <P>This is not what we want.  This is only a beginning and the Greencastle school should be only one of a number that must be provided if we are serious about developing our fisheries.  If we are not serious we should stop wasting our own time and that of those who are considering fishing as a career and we should stop spending what money we are now spending because if we go into Europe we shall not be in business at all if we do not do it properly.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry has the greatest immediate potential of any asset we possess.  It can and should be going up in step with the tourist and agricultural industries insofar as its value to us is concerned.  Instead, it is a cinderella and has been so regarded and treated for so long that it is difficult to realise we have such an asset and such a potential and that we have such serious efforts to develop things of far less potential and of very doubtful value while we make such mean and miserly efforts to develop this really great potential.</P>
    <P>I believe the Parliamentary Secretary and the Fisheries Section are alive to <Col N="1550" /> this and the Department of Finance and the Government are to be condemned not only for the stinginess with which they treat this section in regard to the school at Greencastle which is an immediate necessity in putting education on a proper basis for emerging fishermen, but also for the manner in which they have sabotaged the efforts being made to establish a very low-cost, five-year programme for the development of our intermediate or smaller harbours. That scheme was announced by me with full Government approval at the end of May or in June of 1968. The Opposition were right in saying at the time that this appeared to be something that only an election would bring forth.  It was a fair comment, but in regard to that time and the intentions and my good faith in regard to that scheme, the comment was unfair and untrue.  Since then the Government have seen to it that the comment would now appear to have been justified and true because they have welched on what I got cleared by the assembled Government at that time to say in reply to a question put down in the House then, regarding the spending of £1 million over five years in a development programme.  I gave out at the time jobs covering roughly four of those years or, to be more accurate, works costing £800,000 leaving the other £200,000 aside for jobs yet to be reported on by the survey that was then unfinished along the west coast.</P>
    <P>There was no reason why what we had announced should not have commenced immediately or why long-fingering or jettisoning should have occurred.  There was no reason for diverting the money to other purposes and for having us misled here by all sorts of side-stepping by the Minister for Finance as to why this or that did not happen.  It is a scandalous performance on the part of the Government. It is a disgraceful performance. If the sum involved had been £10 million over five years instead of £1 million there might have been some excuse, because of the pressure that this would bring to bear on the financial resources of the country, for the Government putting this job on the long finger and not spending even the <Col N="1551" /> £200,000 per year that was promised as and from 1968.</P>
    <P>At that time there was announced a job to be carried out at Glengad in Donegal.  Portaleen pier at Glengad is the nearest point to the second best prime white fishing grounds in Europe. It is a traditional fisherman's port, but has no shelter whatsoever.  They have a record that is probably unique in the world of fishing, that is, they have never lost a boat at sea but have lost a score of them at anchor when they were smashed against the rocks by quick storms.  For years we have been trying to get this job done.  We have had experts telling us what we could and could not do.  Back in the early fifties we were told that, in order to do a job the Board of Works would stand over, the cost involved would be almost £500,000.  That amount of money was not justified then.  I do not suppose that even the most ardent supporter of the improvements could have justified the spending of that amount of money, having regard to the activity at that port in years previous to then.</P>
    <P>There was a proposal at the time that the fishermen of the area would be served adequately by an alternative job costing, perhaps, only one-sixth of the original estimate.  What was proposed was the creation of an internal basin that would have been blasted out of the rock behind the existing slipway and on which lock gates would be available and would be closed in time of storm so as to ensure the safety of the boats anchored there. However, we have since heard from the marine section of the Board of Works that people would be so anxious to get in at a time of storm that they would open the gates which had already been locked, thereby wrecking every boat within.  I never accepted that theory.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the marine section, in fairness to the fisheries division and to the advisers there, the matter was discussed fully and agreement was reached with me that that way of doing the job was feasible and that <Col N="1552" /> there was no danger of fishermen being mad enough to attempt to approach this basin in a bad storm or that there would be the greater madness of those already on shore opening gates which had been closed.  Such madness does not exist among the fishermen up there or, indeed, anywhere else.  They are too wise for that. Surely they would go to Lough Foyle or Lough Swilly rather than attempt to enter a basin not more than 25 feet wide.  The plans and costings for this work were drawn up and agreement was announced in 1968.</P>
    <P>The job was to have started without delay, but of course it has not been started yet.  What has happened since? A deputation of the fishermen was brought here to be talked at by the respective Ministers concerned who told them that what was proposed in 1968 was no longer on.  They were given the ultimatum either to agree to an extension of the existing pier, which is of no use in sheltering boats, or else get nothing.  On that basis these local people thought they had better accept something rather than nothing. I am told here that what is now proposed is acceptable to the fishermen. There is a hell of a difference between saying to them: &ldquo;You can have the pier extended, even though it will not improve in any way the shelter for your boats, but you cannot have the shelter that was proposed.  If you do not accept the extension, you will get nothing&rdquo; and saying in the House that the fishermen have agreed to and accepted the alternative plan to that which was promised to them by me, acting not on my own behalf but on behalf of the entire Government, in 1968.</P>
    <P>This is truly a fishing community. Despite the lack of facilities they have endured down through the years, they have persevered in the true traditional sense, having all the good points and, I might say, none of the bad ones. These are seamen in the true sense of the word.  They have been trained in the most difficult circumstances.  This, now, is the Government's answer to a promise made to them a few years ago.  I would not be even as unhappy as I am in this respect were it not for <Col N="1553" /> my belief that, had it not been I who was concerned with the matter in 1968 but somebody else concerned with Fianna Fáil and still in the Government, the job would have been done.  The word of the Government has been broken.  What sort of people are these who fiddle around with the existence and the livelihood of these fishermen?  This is only a further part of the sorry story of the manner in which the fishermen and the fishing industry is being treated by this Government and by the establishment as a whole.</P>
    <P>If the Government really believe in the development of fisheries, no ulterior motive on any sort of personal bias should be allowed to prevent the doing of what is right.  Surely this sort of activity is beneath that which any Government Minister should indulge in.  The fact that I have been interested in this matter during most of my political life should not be the means of bringing about a situation whereby a promise made at a Cabinet meeting has been broken in the hope that I may lose some political face as a result. I make them a present of any points they can score from it, but let them get on with the job and not waste £40,000 of the taxpayers' money in carrying out a useless operation that would not be adequate to save even one of the boats of those fishermen in a north-east storm.  The Government are prepared to spend £40,000 on this futile exercise but refuse to spend £72,000 on a worthwhile job.  Not only would the job be useless as proposed now but it would obstruct the development of a basin thereafter, because this pier runs across the place where the entrance to that basin should ultimately appear. Therefore, not only is £40,000 to be spent on a job that will prove useless but there is a rejection of a job that would serve the purpose of saving the craft of the fishermen.  The provision of a shelter in the basin is the only satisfactory and viable proposition available.  This was agreed long ago by the best brains available in the marine section of the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the same peninsula a job was to be done at <Col N="1554" /> Moville on the old stone pier which is seawards if the little headland at that village.  Again, the work did not proceed two years ago as it should have done.  It has now been promised again, and in order to give it a completely fresh look it has been transferred to the inner side of the headland, to the old wooden wharf that belongs still to the Derry Harbour Commissioners.  It is a derelict site which should have been cleared.  They still maintain the ownership of that and we are now going to relieve them of removing their derelict property by spending this money on that side of the headland instead of the seaward side which was chosen by the survey team after full consideration.</P>
    <P>It is the contention of every fisherman and boatman at Moville that there is need for this £25,000 or £30,000 project on the seaward side to provide a slipway for salmon boats, in-shore fishing boats, sea angling boats, tourist traffic and so forth.  I have nothing to do with this and I do not want anything to do with it, because it has been put in the wrong place.  I want to know why.  What changed the decision made by the experts who carried out that survey?  Not only may this development work not be useful on the side where the wooden pier now stands but the solid construction there will almost practically certainly cause silting of that harbour and in a very short time Moville will be in a much worse state than if they do nothing.</P>
    <P>Surely the change has not been made merely to divorce what is to be done from the announcement I made in 1968.  Put it in the right place or do not do the job at all.  Listen to the fishermen and the boatmen.  Do not say to them: &ldquo;It is either there or not at all&rdquo; as was done in the case of Glengad.  Let us have the clear assurance of the survey team that where it now is proposed to do the work is a better place.  Let us have the hydrographic and other information that would conclusively prove that where the wooden pier stands is a better location.  If that is done, then I will accept the decision, but as of now I do not accept it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> What has happened to the Fanny's Bay proposal?  Why again, in conjunction with the Gaeltacht Department have efforts not been made to get on with that job?  Likewise across the bay of Mulroy work is now commencing on Sladanavoohogue pier and shelter.  That was promised a long time ago.  It is now being rushed merely as an effort to take up the slack of unemployment that has been having a paralysing effect for months past. These jobs are now emerging when it is a waste of time trying to carry out marine work on the west coast.  At a time when the seas are roughest and highest we find this panic effort by the Government.  We allocate a few thousand pounds here and there to make an impression on the unemployment that is rampant in these coastal areas, not with a view to improving facilities for the fishermen but as a sop to the unemployed. In any event, if they would do more of these projects quickly I would not mind for what motives, provided they did them in the right places and not changed them around as they have been doing in my constituency. The survey team has dictated the location in all other cases and, to my knowledge, on to other part of the coast from Cork to Donegal has there been a change around of a minor nature from one headland to another as can be found in my constituency.</P>
    <P>It is unique that in my constituency this fiddling around has gone on.</P>
    <P>It has been done for the ulterior motives I have indicated time and again, that is, to take from me any credit coming to me because I happened to announce, as the Minister for Fisheries in 1968, on behalf of the Government, that these jobs were going to be done.  All I can say to the Minister for Finance is that I could not care less, so long as this work is done, how many needles he and his colleagues try to shove into me.  It will not deflect my return to this House at the next general election. whatever about the future of some of those who are doing the needling.  I will be back, and I will be back with the help of those people that have been blinded by these operations, these mean, stinking little ways which <Col N="1556" /> would not be worthy of a government or a minister of any government, even in a banana republic, but which we have here.</P>
    <P>It is typical of what has been going on for the last couple of years, that because we are not yes-men in that party, not only are we being done but our friends and our constituents are being done; if we are to get anything to replace what I promised it must have a new overcoat on it so that it will appear as something new.  They can have all the credit but let them not waste the money.  Let them do the job that should be done in the interest of the fishing industry.  If they do that they can still recoup some of the loss of face this Government have suffered as a result of their mean little tricks resulting in a loss to the fishermen, a loss to our community, a loss to the fishing industry and a loss to our country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the jobs to be done under this five-year programme could we help the Parliamentary Secretary and the fisheries section of the Department to strengthen their arm by indicating in this debate that they should get stuck into the Government and the Department of Finance to make them get the &ldquo;readies&rdquo; out and given an adequate amount of money to the Department so that the small programmes we have devised can be got under way immediately and we can catch up on the years already lost.  Three years of that five-year programme have now almost elapsed but we could still make a bold effort to carry out the programme in a matter of the next two or three years.</P>
    <P>This would be worthwhile and it would be an indication to the fishermen that, in addition to the school now started in Greencastle, a year or more after it should have been started, there is some real thought at the top for their interests, and that a serious look is being taken at fisheries.  Our entry into Europe, if it is to come about, requires us to double and treble our efforts not only in our small ports but also in some of our major ports such as Greencastle where there is now overcrowding.  That harbour has grown immensely in a short few years.  It has improved immensely.  A very substantially <Col N="1557" /> increased catch is being landed there.  The fishermen there are doing their best through their own co-op to market their catch to the best of their ability.  The harbour is now overcrowded. If Glengad was repaired, and if work was quickly done at Moville, the smaller boats that must now of necessity occupy space in the inadequate harbour at Greencastle could go elsewhere.  This would provide a breathing space until the second stage is reached in the earlier plan for Greencastle.</P>
    <P>I realise that the second development at Greencastle cannot be carried through overnight or very quickly.  It will take quite a time but in the meantime the harbour is overcrowded.  A number of middle-size craft that are occupying space there could occupy space at Moville if £25,000 or £30,000 were spent there.  They could occupy space in Glengad and Portaleen if a shelter basin was built as was promised in 1968.  The estimate then was £72,000.  It may be up by now.  For £100,000 in round figures we could relieve the congestion at Greencastle and give a breathing space to the Department and the Office of Public Works in regard to the big extension job that is on the drawing-board, and the plan for which has been there for quite a while, but which will take a considerable time to execute.</P>
    <P>In the interests of the development of that harbour and the fishing industry in Greencastle, may we implore the Department and the Government to get up off their behinds and get on with the job in Moville and provide the shelter basin in Glengad, and in that way relieve the utter congestion that is now developing at Greencastle. We must give it time to grow while we are getting on with the much more costly extension that has been promised.</P>
    <P>Down along the Mayo coast in particular there is great need for activity by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Office of Public Works and the Department of the Gaeltacht. In the Gaeltacht areas funds are said to be coming from the Department of the Gaeltacht but whether they come from there or from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Parliamentary <Col N="1558" /> Secretary of the day has the prime responsibility.  He should not be diverted from what he knows to be the proper spending and utilisation of money in the interests of fishing by any consideration that may be put up by another Department for their own narrow little reasons.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that, with all that requires to be done, the Department of the Gaeltacht occasionally return money unexpended at the end of the year.  This may be news to some people in areas such as mine where jobs require to be done to extend little piers and harbours to help our fishermen. but it is a fact.  One wonders what they are doing if they cannot find a use to make of this money.  The Parliamentary Secretary should make a close study of what money they have got, what they are doing with it and, if it appears that they are likely to have a surplus, he should direct them very quickly to where it could be spent usefully to the advantage of the fishermen along the west coast and in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Under the five-year programme we promised to do quite a number of jobs in Mayo.  The survey of that coast has shown additional jobs that need to be done right down along the length of the coast as far as west Cork. These jobs are urgent.  They are not costly by our overall standards.  Over a five-year period what is the expenditure of £1 million in these days?  It might look a big figure standing on its own but, taken in relation to our total spending, over five years it becomes the small change of the operation.  Yet that small change is not being given as it was promised.  It is being held on to.  It is being diverted.  It is said that it is needed for this, that and the other thing, for everything except that for which it was intended.</P>
    <P>At this time of the year when we are approaching the conclusion of the deals on the Budget for the coming year, the Parliamentary Secretary should dig his heels in.  He should not take any more of the sort of treatment he and his Department have been getting. They should say that they will not carry the can and that they do not intend to do so for the Minister for <Col N="1559" /> Finance or the Government in so far as these relatively small amounts are concerned when the need is so great, and so urgent, and so pressing.  He should push on with the development of an overall plan.  He should think big.  He should get his Department to think big and I do not think he would have any difficulty there.</P>
    <P>He should get Bord Iascaigh Mhara to think big and to come up with a plan that would envisage the education of our fishermen over not too many years, the extension of our harbour facilities for our fishermen, the training of fishermen, the provision of more and bigger and better craft for the better trained fishermen.  He should get stuck in there and come up with an overall plan on a grand scale, on a scale that is justified by the colossal potential which we have in fisheries. This is one of the few things we have within our own control to develop and which we have not been thinking about in proper terms for very many years, if we ever did.</P>
    <P>We must do this or our fisheries will perish in EEC conditions.  We have either got to get into the big time or get out.  Now is our last chance.  We will not have another.  For many decades we have done relatively little, although we can show by the record percentage increases.  If you increase nothing by an infinite amount of a percentage you still have nothing.  If you increase a small outturn by a very high percentage it is still a small outturn.  While the increases over the years have been praiseworthy in themselves, and in the circumstances, they have not added up to a real growth or a real growing up of a healthy fishing industry.  This is because of our lack in this Parliament and not because of any lack on the part of our people, whether they be traditional fishermen or people who have never even seen the sea.  They are appreciative of the opportunities but we are not providing the service that would make them into really thoroughgoing deep-sea fishermen of a calibre, and equipped in a way, that could compete with the best in any part of Europe or the world.</P>
    <P>We have got the waters around us. <Col N="1560" /> We have got the fish in those waters and not that far distant from us.  Indeed, they are much nearer than they are to some of the great fishing nations of Europe.  We have the men willing and able but needing the training and needing the craft and, above all, needing the anchorages and safe harbours for those craft.  All these matters must be tackled and it is difficult to say which must be done first.</P>
    <P>I have often thought about this and I am rather of the opinion that the three must grow simultaneously.  We must plan urgently not just for the sake of the potential of the industry but also because of the fact that, if you want to mesh one development into another, that is, the training, the craft availability and the harbour availability, the most economical way of spending our money would be to do all three of them together, practically simultaneously.  In that way we would reduce the losses that might be incurred if we tried to do one too far ahead of another and left ourselves either with redundancies on the one hand or a bottleneck or a surplus on the other. The three things are necessary and without them we are only fiddling around.  We may be fiddling around ten years from now as we have been for the last two or three decades. This is no reflection on those in Departments or elsewhere who have been compelled, because we have by our lack of decision, our lack of the provision of money on a big scale when it was perhaps more freely available than it is now, to fiddle at fisheries instead of developing them as they should have been developed over many years past.</P>
    <P>It is not too late.  The seas are still there, the fish are still there and our men are still there&mdash;although many of them are unemployed&mdash;available and willing to go.  The question is: are we prepared to pull the switch that can make it possible for them to go?  Are we going to do it while there is still time before we are swamped out of fishing by the competition that the EEC, despite what we call the free agreement that we have made, will bring in its train?  Let us not fool ourselves that we have got anything <Col N="1561" /> more than a respite at the moment. Let us not fool ourselves that even if the deal that has been done was done for all time that we are in fact saved for the future.  Yes, we are saved to go on fiddling in the way we have been doing, fishing on a very modest and small scale.  If that is what we want then the deal that has been done will fit the bill.</P>
    <P>This is not what we want.  This is not what we should utilise our fishery potential for.  We should be looking to it as one of the great growth-points in this country, which by its very natural advantages our country gives us, can compete against anything that Europe may bring against us in the years ahead, if we join Europe, I still say &ldquo;if&rdquo; because there is a big &ldquo;if&rdquo;.  If we do not join Europe it is still without doubt the growth-point of greatest potential, the point where we can grow in the most effective, definite and secure way.  We would not be dependent, as many of our other developing industries are, on the whims and the fancies of imported industrialists who blow in when the going is good and blow out again when it is not so good, and are merely dealing with us as pawns and using other countries to do their work in today, then into us tomorrow, out the day after and we are left holding the can.</P>
    <P>We can do a great job here and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept that what I am saying is not a criticism of him or of the officers who serve the Department or indeed of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, but is merely a call from one who believes very sincerely that we have starved this organisation, both departmentally and from the board's point of view, for so long that they at this stage must have been driven to the point where they actually accept this low-gear crawl growth that we are doing and that they have long since been disabused of any great thoughts they may have had in regard to the huge potential that our coast has for us and in a part where it is most needed.</P>
    <P>That is why I advocate that we think <Col N="1562" /> big in this thing.  We are not thinking big enough at all.  We have, in fact, brought ourselves by habit into thinking so small, so microscopically, that in fact this fishing industry is no more than a toy, a plaything in the hands of any Government in recent years.  Let us give it an opportunity of growing up; let us help it to grow by giving it the ingredients that it must have.  Let us help it to be a great industry, a great help to our economy, a great competitor in world markets, which undoubtedly it can be if we provide the wherewithal to the manpower that we have.</P>
    <P>We can do this and we should do it. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, his Department, the board and all associated with this industry will determine, with the fishermen's co-operation that exists there already, that we will do this quickly and urgently as perhaps one of the greatest developing jobs we could do today.</P>
    <P>In so far as pollution is concerned, and in so far as it affects our fisheries, there is no doubt that inland we are fast running into trouble.  As the previous speaker said, if that same pollution of our inland waters is allowed to continue and expand no doubt the shores and the inshore waters will ultimately suffer as well in the not-too-distant future.  To say that we need new laws, new Departments and all sorts of things, is perhaps true in the final analysis but let us have no illusions about it.  If the laws that are there, the regulations that already exist, if all the paraphernalia of State were utilised in a serious manner to try to combat the pollution of the waters today then a great deal could be done instead of our sitting around saying: &ldquo;If only we had a new Act, if only we had a new Department&rdquo;.  We were promised a new Department, incidentally, a few years ago, one which has never since come into being.</P>

That same planning has quite a bit to do in controlling pollution.  Might I appeal to those who are in control of the Department and of planning today, those people in Fisheries and other Departments who are interested in the pollution of our waterways and rivers, that there is at the moment available to them within the laws we have far more power than they are using.  They should use what they have while devising better and greater powers to deal with the problem in the future.  They should not sit on their fannies, as we all appear to be doing at the moment, doing nothing except exploring the ways and means by which we can get the perfect legislation. Let us work what we have got, do something about it and stop polluting these inland waterways which if allowed to continue will pollute the inshore fisheries with detriment to our commercial fishermen as well as our sportsmen on the rivers.</P>

      <P>There is always the practical situation we would have to face that, unless the British Government at least co-operated, there may be the possibility of one-sided evidence being given.  I have encouraged in every way I can that the present commission should be international, or at least <Col N="1565" /> should appear to be independent, rather than having just one British judge on it.  The Deputy will see the difficulties involved in such a proposition unless there is co-operation from the other side.</P>

      <P>I would have thought the Taoiseach would have made contact with the International Committee of Jurists and then that he would have invited Britain to have representatives on this independent commission.  The Taoiseach should have taken the initiative in this matter and contacted them immediately.  He said he hoped for it. We need more than wishful thinking.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that it seems likely the only commission which will operate will be that appointed by the British Government, that this is being deemed to be one-sided and probably will appear to be one-sided, would the Taoiseach not consider, as I suggested last week, the establishment of a body of inquiry so that we would have the two points of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A one-sided, or rather unilateral, inquiry operated in the case of the Derry shootings last October and it was not very effective and did not do much good.  I have <Col N="1566" /> indicated here that we are at the moment proceeding on Article 2 of the Convention of Human Rights which will empower us to have an in-depth investigation into these killings if nothing more acceptable appears in the meantime.  Under our application to the European Commission of Human Rights, we have reserved the right to present fresh evidence, fresh cases, as part of or independent of the case already presented.  If the current inquiry, if one could call it current, by Judge Widgery is not satisfactory, I am sure the ultimate investigation of this matter by the Court of Human Rights will be impartial and will be in great depth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think that on the whole I could leave it to the medical profession.  If they felt there were any grave abuses or that damage of a notable order was done to people by people who practice health cures without being registered, I think I would very quickly hear about it.  I have no such evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, some faith healers belong to churches and there is fairly widespread evidence that the psychosomatic element in medicine can enable people to receive benefit from prayer and from invocation.  The extent to which they can is not known and has never been examined.  That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that some of the psychosomatic benefits which some people receive from some of the invocations, more particularly treble visits and so on, assuming that the faith healer does not get flu in the meantime, are quite questionable, as are some of the practices, fairly widespread, mass gatherings and so on, and I specifically exclude those of a spiritual nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 together.  In the present situation that exists in the North the Government decided that other governments friendly to Britain and to this country and the Secretary General of the United Nations should be advised of this Government's views.  I visited the United Nations Headquarters and since then the Secretary General has indicated that he would be happy to help if both the British and Irish Governments agreed to accept his assistance.  The British Government have refused this offer.</P>
      <P>I also visited the United States Secretary of State, Mr. William Rogers, the Canadian Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Mitchell Sharp, the French Foreign Minister, M. Maurice Schumann and the French Secretary of State, M. de Lipkowski.  While stating the juridical position about non-intervention in the internal affairs of another State, they received me with sympathy and understanding and I am satisfied that they now have a clearer appreciation of the situation from our point of view.</P>
      <P>I am making a similar visit to the Italian Foreign Minister.  Depending on the course of events, I may visit ministerial colleagues in other countries but have made no definite plans as yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that at the present time the area of greatest significance to Ireland and, indeed, to Europe is the EEC and that, therefore, apart from representations to the United Nations, the most important place in which to make representations is Brussels having regard to the political repercussions of events in the North of Ireland from the pending referendum and the very harmful effects on our economy, particularly in tourism, resulting from the events in the North of Ireland which must surely affect our position within the EEC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when Britain is orientating her whole policy and making it more European and departing from an Atlantic emphasis in her foreign policy, would the Minister not agree that more pressure could have been exerted by going to European countries first rather than the North American countries?  Would he not also agree that it must create an unfortunate impression in European countries that our order of priorities is directed towards an Atlantic influence on Britain rather than towards the areas where Britain is most concerned, the European countries, and that the most important country to have called on first in this foreign tour of the Minister was France?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The important first step was to the United Nations in recognition of the stature of the United Nations as a worldwide organisation including every country and every Continent.  By reason of the location of the United Nations, the obvious, practical thing to do, straight away, was to visit the North American countries, the United States of America and Canada.  The first opportunity was then taken subsequent to that to go to France, proceed to Italy, then to the EEC and such other member countries as he may see fit to visit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as a first requirement, is visiting his counterparts in sovereign nations which count and there will be a visit in due course to the EEC if this is required but the first, paramount endeavour, must be to visit the Ministers of Foreign Affairs or their equivalents in sovereign nations.  The explanation straight away as to why this happened in North America as against Europe is that the United Nations is located in New York and the obvious thing from the practical point of view was to visit the two North American Governments and then proceed straight away to France, to Italy and to such other European countries as may be required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs what action the Government has taken to draw the attention of the United Nations to the fact that the obligations of some UN covenants ratified by the British Government are not universally respected within the United Kingdom by reason of the non-applicability of Westminster legislation to Northern Ireland; if it is permissible for a State to exempt a part of its territory ruled by a subordinate regional parliament from the obligations of covenants ratified by its national Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to allege that another country was in violation of its treaty obligations without exhaustive examination of all legal aspects of the case.  I am aware that the British Race Relations Acts, 1965 and 1968, explicitly do not extend to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the question, I would regard Article 29 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties as declaratory of the present position in international law.  That Article provides that &ldquo;unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, a treaty is binding upon each party in respect of its entire territory&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not recall that on previous occasions in <Col N="1579" /> this House he has offered as a reason for not ratifying international covenants that because of absence of legislation or other provisions within our realm we were not in a position to certify universal respect for the particular obligations within our own territory? If this be a valid reason for Ireland failing to subscribe to some of the terribly important covenants of the United Nations, surely it is true that Britain has wrongly ratified some of the conventions to which she is a party because by her own legislation she has specifically excluded the Six Counties of Northern Ireland from the obligations of those covenants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall go along with the Deputy to the extent that we feel there is a case along the lines that Britain is in breach of the convention but it is a very complex legal issue and we are examining the situation in detail at the moment.  There does appear to be a case that they are in breach and we want to examine it in detail to ensure that we are on certain ground before proceeding further.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>As a result of the unrest in Northern Ireland it is likely that there will be a fall-off in non-ethnic tourist traffic from Britain this year.  Bord Fáilte have informed me of a growing resistance being encountered by their staff doing promotional work in Britain.</P>
      <P>I would point out, however, that it has been our policy in recent years to secure increased diversification of our tourist traffic and as a result traffic from North America and the Continent are a more significant element in our total tourist trade than they were some years ago.  These markets have been showing reasonable promise and Bord Fáilte are carrying out intensive marketing campaigns in these areas.  In addition the board are now diverting promotional efforts from Britain into the North American and European markets with a view to generating additional traffic.</P>
      <P>Concentration in Britain is now directed towards the ethnic market.  I have already explained to the Dáil, in reply to a question on the subject on 8th February, the measures which Bord Fáilte are taking to increase the volume of that traffic with a view to offsetting to the maximum possible extent the likely loss in the number of general tourists from Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At home, Bord Fáilte, in association with the Regional Tourism Organisations and other tourist interests, are <Col N="1589" /> conducting a special campaign to encourage Irish people to spend their holidays in this country.  I know that in the present situation many people will want to take home holidays this year.  For that purpose it is essential that all the tourist interests here should demonstrate that they can offer a range of home holidays at attractive prices which will provide good value for money.</P>
    <P>I am keeping in very close touch with the entire tourism situation, through Bord Fáilte and other tourist interests, and I expect to review the position with representatives of the hotel industry in the very near future.</P>

The ethnic market is, as I said, a very logical market from the point of view of Donegal and I appreciate what the Deputy has said.  It is on this market we will have to depend largely this year.

      <P>I explained to the Deputy in reply to a question on 12th November, 1970, that it had been Bord Fáilte's practice, up to 1970-71, not to publish the names of recipients of grants or the individual amounts received by them in respect of accommodation development.  This procedure had been followed because the board had given undertakings to developers that information about their applications and grants would be treated as confidential.  Following a change of practice which Bord Fáilte made at my request in 1970, all applicants are now informed that grant particulars will be published and the appropriate information is set out in the annual reports of the board. However, in view of the arrangements under which the earlier applications were dealt with, it would be a breach of confidence to publish the information in respect of earlier years.</P>

    <P>Under the procedure for joint consultation agreed between the Community and the applicant states, Community proposals on common transport policy for consideration by the Council of Ministers are examined in my Department.  Consultation with the Commission is being sought on a number of proposals which may affect our transport legislation and practice. The Council have decided, in principle, to extend for three years the existing <Col N="1593" /> Community regulations on a rate bracket tariff system in international road freight and to introduce such a system for rail freight.  Should it be found necessary, following consultation with the Commission, to apply these regulations to cross-Border freight transport, I do not anticipate any serious difficulty in doing so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 33 together. Turf is outside the scope of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty and adherence to the Treaty has no effect on our arrangements for the use of turf.  All the bogs suitable for exploitation for fuel production by the best techniques so far developed are already in production or in course of preparation for production for consumption almost entirely in Ireland. Adherence to the Treaty is not expected to affect the market.  Accordingly, no representations regarding turf fuel were made in the course of the accession negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No significant trade advantage is likely to be derived by the Irish coal producers from membership of the Community.  The low-grade semi-bituminous coal produced at Arigna <Col N="1595" /> is for the most part consumed in the generating station erected specially for the purpose.  The remainder is consumed more or less locally since it will not bear long transport.  Native anthracite fuels are generally in short supply in Ireland, imports normally being about as high as home production.  In recent years, there have been some exports to the Continent of smaller grades of anthracite and it is possible that the lifting of restrictions on imports to the EEC may facilitate such exports.</P>
    <P>All the household bituminous coal consumed in Ireland is imported, and membership of ECSC is not expected to interfere with this trade.  The Community as a whole is at present an importer of coal.</P>
    <P>The benefits generally of Ireland's membership of the European Communities, including the European Coal and Steel Community, are set out in the White Paper.  The only Irish producer of steel products that come within the scope of the European Coal and Steel Community is Irish Steel Holdings Limited, which has already commenced a programme of expanded production.  As announced in the White Paper, special arrangements have been negotiated to assist this industry through the transitional period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that participation in the Coal and Steel Community will give coal a slight competitive advantage against turf in the areas in which they are in competition and that benefits will be available for coal production which will not be available for turf?</P>

      <P>It would, I feel, be wrong to attach too much significance to fluctuations in the average numbers of persons in receipt of home assistance from one year to another, since these are a normal feature of the scheme.  However, improvements in the social services, such as, for example, the introduction of the deserted wife's allowance and the prescribed relative allowance for certain pensioners, will undoubtedly have been a factor in bringing about the drop in numbers referred to by the Deputy. There have been no changes influencing entitlement to home assistance apart from the continuing policy of effecting improvements in the social services as the available resources permit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In October last the Government took action designed to increase economic growth and safeguard employment.  The measures included the allocation of an extra £20 million for capital spending in the present financial year over a wide area of investment, in particular in industry, agriculture and housing.  In addition, in order to facilitate further investment in industry, a reduction in the level of company taxation was announced.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the Government's future investment plans were reviewed and, as a result, last month the Taoiseach announced that the public capital programme for next year had been fixed at a level some £20 million more than the higher revised figure for the current year.  The increased provision for next year will give a further stimulus to a range of investment programmes including that for industry. Included in both the measures for the current year and those for next year are substantial capital sums designed to benefit the tourist industry in addition to the generous grants made available annually to Bord Fáilte for the promotion of tourism.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Taoiseach's statement of 19th January, 1972, in this House for details of these and other measures taken which are designed to step up economic growth, enhance industrial investment and tackle the problem of redundancies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the estimated £60 million a year capital investment in agriculture, over £40 million represents investment by farmers.  This investment is financed by re-investment out of farm incomes and by borrowing from banks, the Agricultural Credit Corporation and other credit sources. Of the £40 million, it is estimated that about £8 million is accounted for by increases in livestock numbers on farms while investment in machinery and equipment accounts for a further £23 million.  The balance represents mainly <Col N="1599" /> the farmers' own share of new investments in buildings, water supplies and land reclamation.</P>
      <P>In addition to farmers' investments, a further £18½ million is being channelled into agricultural development through the public capital programme. Of this amount almost £17 million, including the additional £2.5 million authorised by the Minister for Finance in October, 1971, is carried on the Agriculture vote.  Arterial drainage accounts for £1 million and non-voted capital for the state-sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department for £500,000.</P>

    <P>I would refer the Deputies to the paragraphs 196, 197 and 198 of the recently issued White Paper on EEC <Col N="1600" /> membership.  The question of State aids to agriculture is dealt with in more detail in chapter 13 of my Department's study &ldquo;Irish Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC&rdquo;.  I would like to add, however, that the Accession Treaty provides specificially for the continuation during the transitional period, on a gradually declining basis, of our support payments on beef exports to the UK and our consumer subsidy on butter, and also makes provision for support for seed production.</P>

      <P>Agricultural subsidies and development aids are being kept under review in the light of changing circumstances and of prospective EEC membership.  For example, as I announced in the course of the debate on the Estimate for Agriculture, the creamery milk pricing system has been restructured on lines that will be appropriate in an EEC context and the grant that may be earned by new participants under the small farm incentive bonus scheme has been increased.  More recently I announced the Government's decision to raise the price level on the basis of which support payments are calculated for exports of good quality carcase beef to Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>No specific price levels are prescribed in the EEC for milk sold for liquid consumption but the liquid price is, of course, influenced by the support given through intervention prices for butter and skim milk powder towards the realisation of the Community's target price for milk.  The liquid price here would similarly be influenced by the movement in <Col N="1601" /> creamery milk prices after Ireland's accession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is as yet no common organisation of the market for mutton and lamb in the EEC.  During the transitional period customs duties on these products will be eliminated as between the member States in five equal steps.  As regards quantitative or other restrictions, the Treaty of Accession provides that in respect of an agricultural product not covered on the date of accession by a common organisation of the market, a member State may continue to apply, during the transitional period, such restrictions on imports of that product, even from another member State, provided that these restrictions formed part of the member State's national market organisation for the product at the date of accession.</P>
      <P>So far as our exports of lamb to the present member States of the EEC are concerned our main interest is the French market.  France has been pressing the Community, even as recently as last week, to introduce a common organisation of the market for mutton and lamb, and we would, of course, welcome and support such a development. During the transitional period imports of lamb into the UK market from New Zealand and other third countries will, in any event, become subject to the Community's common customs tariff and this will operate to strengthen prices in that market to which we already have free access.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that up to recent times, especially in the earlier part of last year, the prices we got for our lamb were relatively unsatisfactory. The reason for this was the circumstance to which I referred in my reply, that is, the difficulty of access to the Paris market.  If not the only factor in the procurement of prices last year that were unsatisfactory, this was probably the predominant one.  However, I am aware also that current prices for mutton and lamb are very satisfactory.  In saying this, I am not suggesting for a moment that all is well with the sheep industry. That is not so.  I met a representative of the sheep producers yesterday and went into this whole question with him in great detail.  I would remind the House that during the past year supports of one kind or another to the sheep industry totalled about £2.6 million and that the value of our exports, at the same time, was £3.5 million.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Our basic quota of 150,000 metric tons of sugar together with the supplementary quota of up to 50,000 tons will enable Irish sugar production from home-grown beet to be maintained in EEC conditions at a level which will supply not less than our home and export markets for sugar. Expansion opportunities in the industry will largely depend on whether the EEC discontinue national quotas after 1975.</P>
      <P>The Sugar Company have been prepared to contract for a greater acreage of beet west of the Shannon than has been taken up there and I hope that in the future western growers will take full advantage of their opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are a series of figures I have not got with me, but the pricing of sugar beet in the EEC and here vary quite considerably in that the arrangements for the disposal of pulp and the delivery of sugar beet are on a different basis altogether. Therefore, a straight comparison of the price of a ton of sugar or sugar beet here and there would not give the Deputy any valuable information. You would have to consider such facts as that in some of the EEC countries part of the pricing arrangement is that sugar beet pulp is delivered back to the producer in a wet condition and counted as part of the payment for his crop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says in regard to sugar beet but not in regard to sugar.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply is in the form of an itemised statement which with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>(a)  When the EEC sugar production quotas were fixed in 1967 Italy and Belgium/Luxembourg were allowed basic quotas which exceeded by approximately 30 per cent and 40 per cent respectively the average production of sugar in those countries in the years 1961-1965; the average excess for the Community as a whole was about 12 per cent.  The quotas were fixed in negotiations between the member states and no specific reasons for the excesses were published.</P>
      <P>(b)  <i>Denmark</i>&mdash;290,000 metric tons of white sugar; this quota represents average Danish production in the years 1961-65 plus about 12 per cent or in the years 1965-69 plus about 3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" />
      <i>Britain</i>&mdash;900,000 metric tons of white sugar.  This quota which represents British production in the years 1965-70 was negotiated in conjunction with the arrangements for continuation of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Norway</i>&mdash;Nil.</P>
    <P>(c)  35 per cent in the case of the present member states, Denmark and Ireland.  Britain is not being allowed any supplementary quota and the question of such a quota does not arise in the case of Norway.</P>
    <P>(d)  The EEC financial aid (e.g. intervention buying and support on exports to third countries) is available both for sugar produced under the basic quota and for sugar produced under the supplementary quota.  A production levy (which is variable but is subject to a maximum) must be paid to the Community on any sugar produced under the supplementary quota.</P>
    <P>(e)  Under the EEC Sugar Regulations this country will not be entitled to subsidise sugar production after accession to the Community.</P>
    <P>(f)  The arrangements for the importation of Australian sugar into the UK are due to terminate at the end of 1974.</P>
    <P>(g)  The national quota system in the Community is expressed to end on 1st July, 1975.  The current arrangements for imports into the UK under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement are due to end in 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the probable future position of the tomato industry under EEC conditions involving the removal of Ireland's quantitative restrictions; and if he will comment on the price increase of 134 per cent in the price of tomatoes over the 12 months ended August, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EEC conditions our quantitative import restrictions on tomatoes will be removed on 1st February, 1973, and commencing on 1st January, 1974, our import duty will fall to be removed in five annual steps in the case of imports from other member states and aligned with the Community common customs tariff in the case of imports from third countries. In addition, in trade within the Community differences in prices will be eliminated over the transitional period by means of a system of compensatory amounts which will be levied on imports or paid on exports.</P>
      <P>It is expected that our home-grown tomatoes should continue to be able to compete successfully, not only on the home market but as at present in export markets.</P>
      <P>Tomato prices in August, 1970, were among the lowest of the season whereas prices in August, 1971, were unusually high for that period.</P>

      <P>During the period 1st April to 31st October an import duty is now chargeable on raw tomatoes at the rate of 2.5p per lb full, 1.67p preferential.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries what steps he contemplates towards the revitalisation of the sheep industry and the expansion of the sheep population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Effective measures have already been taken for the development of the sheep industry, including the sheep subsidy schemes under which payments to flock owners for the year 1971 amounted to almost <Col N="1614" /> £1,800,000.  Exports of mutton and lamb are also supported under the export guarantee scheme under which support payments amounting to £726,000 in the first nine months of the present financial year have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the export figure of £3,500,000 is far below the potential, that if a proper marketing exercise was done the potential would be improved, and that at the moment our sheep population is not geared to take advantage of the Common Market in relation to this product?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the potential of the market in mutton and lamb will be greatly improved on our accession to the EEC and that it is necessary to support the sheep industry in every way possible.  I again say that the measures that have already been taken by the Government in relation to the total size of the export market are not something to be sniffed at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, while the quantities of money being expended on the sheep industry in relation to its total exports are quite substantial, the effectiveness of this expenditure is very small indeed, and that the figures for the present level of the growth of the sheep industry indicate that it is not gearing itself to take advantage of the present opportunities?  Would he not, therefore, agree that it is not simply a matter of the quantity of the money but the nature of the initiatives taken and that these, on the current showing, are unsatisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the amount of money, considerable although it is, needs to be examined with the improvement of its deployment in mind.  How this can be done is a very difficult question to answer. I discussed it at great length with the sheep committee of the IFA yesterday. I would welcome any other constructive suggestions in that regard, because I appreciate that the sheep industry in relation to other sections of the farming industry is not going ahead as much as I should like it to.  One aspect <Col N="1615" /> that cannot be lost sight of is the fact that the livestock numbers, the numbers of cattle, are increasing so rapidly as to make it likely that this increase is impinging somewhat on the keeping of lowland sheep.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the sheep population is falling and that this is a pity.  I think the Minister appreciates the seriousness of the situation.  Has he had any discussions with CBF on this matter at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Not recently, but these figures are somewhat selective. They demonstrate that the sheep flock rose in numbers through the mid-sixties and thereafter dropped somewhat. At present the figures would seem to indicate that they are on the rise again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this matter has been under consideration for a very long time and that the longer these people are left out of funds the worse the situation gets? Would he agree to treat this matter in a much more urgent fashion than it has been treated to date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used the words &ldquo;in the clearance area&rdquo;.  I recognise that the problem is sharpest in the clearance area but, if there is to be a pool of available clean stock for restocking, is it not desirable to encourage people voluntarily, ahead of the official scheme, to undertake eradication? Would it not, therefore, be desirable to make the voluntary scheme more attractive, as well as the scheme in the areas officially undertaken for clearance?</P>

      <P>I think it is to those seriously engaged in the business of milk production.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 63, 64 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>The prices paid by my Department for reactor cattle are based on current market values, without reference to the results of the tuberculosis or brucellosis tests.  Accordingly full allowance is made for any movements in general livestock prices.  The maximum limits which were increased in May, 1971, are still well above the general range of market prices even for top class animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. Sullivan Mr. Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister state when he gave the last increase in the price paid to the producers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum limit was raised last May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must be aware that the difference in the price the Department got for cattle sent to the factory and the price the farmers paid for the replacement stock in the period between May and now is very considerable.  The farmers are losing £10 to £15 a head for their stock. Would the Minister consider increasing the price immediately and back-dating it so that these people will not lose money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are losing £40 a head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>A reactor going to the factory makes £70 to £80 to £90, depending on size.  The maximum compensation is £75, working out at a figure of £150 or £160 at the very most. Would the Minister tell the House where a replacement of the same quality as a 1,000 gallon pedigree animal, for which a total of £155 has been obtained, can be purchased for that money?  I should like to hear about it and so would every farmer in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1618" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say why it is necessary to have the limit? Are his valuers not competent to assess the true market value of the animal without putting on this restriction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The ceiling for non-pedigree cattle is £140 at present and for pedigree cattle it is £350.  I am well aware of what Deputy O'Sullivan said that, in recent times, because of the increasing profitability of dairying, and other factors as well, the price of dairy cows has jumped forward.  The actual result that this circumstance may produce is that more people will reach the maximum. The legislative provisions under which reactors are taken out of herds provide that farmers are to get the full market value of the animals.  It is the business of the Department to see that they get this.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked that question before.  I think it is as well to have some form of recognisable milestone or fixed point by which people can assess the value of animals. It must be accepted, taking the general run of reactor cattle into consideration, that even now the maximum price of £140 is not terribly unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a grave danger that farmers will hold onto their stocks since prices have increased so much over the past year, and so make it harder to eradicate bovine tuberculosis?  That is the great danger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <P>I am aware, having met the representatives of the workers and of the trade as well, of all the relevant facts.  One point that was very heavily emphasised by both parties was the existence of the differential in old pence terms of 1¼d between our export support and the British deficiency payment.  As the Deputy is probably aware, because of the buoyancy of the market in Britain, the liability of the British Government to pay deficiency payments at all has only arisen marginally in the past year.  Consequently, our fresh meat factories did not get the corresponding payments that they would have got if deficiency payments became payable during the past year.  The Deputy has not mentioned any other steps he has in mind.</P>

The staff have been told that there will be three days next week or a closedown.  It is one or the other.  Work on three days a week is not adequate for these workers.

      <P>The Deputy is ignoring completely a whole lot of outside considerations that I think frankly would be better not discussed in the Dáil because they concern the internal business transactions of firms in the livestock trade.  They concern such matters as the devaluation of the dollar, the existence for a long period last year of an extensive dock strike on the east coast of America and the entering into contracts by the meat trade that proved to be very unprofitable. <Col N="1622" /> These are circumstances over which the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have no control at all and they react on the industry naturally when they prove to be unprofitable.</P>

      <P>While slaughterings of cattle at meat export premises were down about 12 per cent in the final quarter of 1971 compared with the same period in 1970, total cattle slaughterings at these premises in 1971 were slightly higher than total slaughterings in 1970.  Slaughterings of sheep and lambs in 1971 were 56.5 per cent higher than in 1970.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in January of this year slaughterings were down 50 per cent on January last year and that a really critical situation in employment is now being reached in the meat industry?  Would the Minister consider some form of Government subvention to the meat factories to put them in a position of having sufficient investment funds to expand and improve their capacity to take advantage of what are admitted to be the considerable benefits which can be derived from EEC membership?</P>

The Deputy is quite well aware that this particular branch of our livestock industry boomed and had a most spectacular growth during the sixties.  Because of the circumstances I have already mentioned in reply to another question there has been some recession in the profitability of the undertaking.  This is not to assume that this will be a permanent circumstance.</P>

This will inevitably entail the closing of some premises which are not suitable for the handling of food for human consumption.  It is also true that the Denny factory in Waterford was one of the oldest and most antiquated in the country and the Denny Company, bearing in mind the enormous cost of the re-establishment of a brand new industry, and that is what it could amount to, made the decision the Deputy is referring to.</P>

I should like to point out that one of the circumstances that led to the relative inefficiency of some of the plants in the bacon industry is the circumstance that we are now trying to break out of by applying for entry to the EEC.  Deputy Keating and his friends are the very ones who want to keep us in the situation in which we are bound by quota restrictions to Britain.</P>

      <P>It is accepted by all concerned, that is to say all except <Col N="1631" /> Deputy Keating, that rationalisation of the bacon curing industry is necessary. Under the terms of the rationalisation scheme announced in September last the Pigs and Bacon Commission have been authorised to consider offers made to them by individual curers/pork exporters to cease the slaughter of pigs, the curing of bacon and the export of pork and pigmeat products from their premises on the basis of financial compensation. The scheme is voluntary and does not provide for the compulsory closing of any factories.</P>

      <P>There are at present 35 licensed factories slaughtering pigs and producing bacon.</P>
      <P>Under the rationalisation arrangements for the bacon curing industry announced in September last it is open to the proprietors of bacon factories to offer them to the Pigs and Bacon Commission for closure on the basis of compensation.  In addition the commission may invite offers from any other bacon curer if it appears desirable to the commission to do so in the interests of suitable rationalisation in any area.  In the circumstances it is not possible at present to say how many factories will remain in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The report compiled by my Department's western regional officer on &ldquo;Agriculture in the West of Ireland&rdquo; which was published recently contains a detailed review of the operation of the pilot area development programme during the five years <Col N="1632" /> 1965 to 1970.  Future policy in regard to the pilot areas is being examined in the context of this report and of evolving farm structure policy in the EEC.  Pending completion of this examination, it is not proposed to extend the existing pilot areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's reply, in view of the length of time this pilot scheme has been in operation and the wonderful success of the pilot area in west Cork&mdash;I am glad to see that it is the best area in the 12 western counties&mdash;is it not time to extend the area to take in the Beara peninsula, which is suitable for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any measures such as he contemplates will necessarily have to be considered in the context of the farm structure policy within the EEC. It may well be possible that areas like Beara will come in for special assistance from Brussels on our accession to the EEC.  This is hardly the time to extend the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister that areas such as Beara have been more or less abandoned by the Government in so far as development is concerned?  We are told here we must wait for Brussels to develop them.  Have we abandoned all hope of developing the West of Ireland or is the only hope now through Brussels?  What in the name of heavens does Brussels care about places like Beara?  The Minister said he would leave Beara over until we get Brussels to deal with it and he has satisfied himself that Brussels will deal favourably with it.  I want to know the source of his information.</P>

      <P>Deputies Murphy and O'Sullivan seem to be unaware that a great many measures to assist farming areas like Beara have been taken as recently as the last couple of months by way of the farm bonus incentive scheme.  The pilot area scheme was designed for a different purpose. What Deputy Murphy appears to suggest is that areas like Beara are being abandoned totally.  He knows perfectly well that the special measures being employed in the western areas have been extended progressively and the most recent evidence of it was the farm bonus incentive scheme.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the subject matter of the question has been raised here and in a number of public bodies during the past four years, and will he not agree it would be of great advantage to the 12 western counties if the rate of farm building grants operating within the pilot area scheme were extended?  Is he aware that the former Minister, Deputy Blaney, gave what I took to be almost a definite assurance that this would be done in the near future?  In view of what has happened and of the advantages that would accrue to western farmers as a whole if these grants were extended to enable them to have proper farm buildings, would the Minister now consider making that extension?

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was published primarily in order to create a better understanding and to encourage a wider discussion of the problems of agriculture in the West of Ireland.  The specific recommendations contained in the report are, in many respects, similar to the proposals for reform of farm structures currently being considered in the EEC.  Action on the report must, therefore, await the emergence of EEC decisions on structural policy and be in conformity with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister would consider it quite extraordinary that one should now decide to await the emergence of the EEC structural reform programme when, in fact, there are many recommendations in this report which are worthy of consideration and implementation irrespective of the application for EEC entry? Must any suggestion for the internal reform of Irish agricultural law await EEC directives or representations?  The report should be the subject of intensive discussion internally in the Department with regard to examining the many sound recommendations from Dr. Scully's report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Desmond understood me to suggest that no action on any of the recommendations of Dr. Scully is contemplated until entry to EEC, this is a misunderstanding of the case.  We have already discussed a similar question in relation to the Beara peninsula.  The Scully report would cover areas such as that also.  No such inactivity is contemplated at all.  In fact, the intensification of such things as the farm bonus incentive scheme and other farm development schemes is continuing regardless of EEC entry, or with an eye to inevitable EEC entry.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>Motor insurance premium rates are subject to my control, and I have authorised no increase in basic rates of premium during 1971.  I am aware that several companies have applied loadings to premium rates for certain categories of risk in the light of adverse experience but the loadings vary widely from company to company and it would not be possible to estimate an overall percentage increase.</P>
      <P>An increase in employer's liability rates took effect in September, 1971, but here, again, the wide variation of increases makes it impossible for me to give an overall figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> I have no legal power to control premiums for fire or public liability insurance and my permission is not necessary for increases in such premiums.  I am, however, aware that substantial increases have been made in premiums for some types of premises where the insurance companies have found the risk of loss due to fire to be particularly bad.  While the rate of increase varied according to category it may be taken that the average increase was in the region of 30 per cent.  My Department is in touch with the insurance companies about a number of these cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that certain companies have, in fact, increased their fire and public liability insurance by over 100 per cent, even in cases in which there is no known extra risk of a fire claim?  If the Minister has no authority to control such increases would he not consider it a good idea to have the right of control, particularly in view of the fact that most of the fires which have occurred have been paid for by the ratepayers and not by the insurance companies?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

I am given to understand that, in general, this is in relation to large drapery stores which are not fitted with sprinklers and where the risk seems to be extremely high.  I have also information which indicates that there have been losses sustained by insurance companies in the fire business.  For the Deputy's information, the Prices (Amendment) Bill at present going through the House includes provision giving me power of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the beginning of February.  The impression may be given that this committee, quite an extensive committee, has not been active. When a Minister gives a projection as to when he expects a report and that projection does not turn out to be correct, the impression might be created that that is because the committee has been dilatory.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has received complaints about the delay in settling motor insurance claims by some insurance companies; and if he will introduce legislation to ensure that claims are met within a reasonable time or that the company's licence to carry on insurance business be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has received very few complaints about delays by insurance companies in settling motor insurance claims.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation, I am empowered to suspend or revoke an insurance licence granted to an insurance company if it fails to pay a claim within a period of one month from the date of admission of liability or judgment of the case by the courts.  I understand that what may delay the settlement of claims is the consideration of their admissibility or the assessment of liability.  As Deputies are aware a committee is examining motor insurance and, no doubt, the committee will consider all aspects which give rise to complaints by the general public.  I do not propose to make any changes in legislation in advance of the committee's reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in the case of at least one company operating in this country it <Col N="1652" /> would appear that they first inspect the repairs and stipulate the minimum amount to be spent on repairs and, having done that, avoid paying by the device of allowing the matter to go to court, in other words by contesting some liability, with the result that people of modest means are forced to raise money to pay garages for repairs for which the insurance company should pay since their clients were responsible for the damage done?  Would the Minister not consider that something should be done to prevent that sort of racket?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, we have not had any volume of complaints of this nature.  If the Deputy refers to a particular company I have no departmental knowledge of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Possibly if the Minister receives such complaints he might be prepared to do something about it.  Perhaps this question will bring in the complaints which so far have only caused people to curse and do nothing about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of a report (details supplied) that the National Prices Commission, <Col N="1656" /> in the period 15th December to 19th January recommended price increases in 47 of the 49 cases it considered; if he is satisfied that such a large percentage of recommendations for increases should have been made; and if he is satisfied that the recommended price increase in each instance was justified and necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Monthly Report No. 3 &mdash;January, 1972&mdash;of the National Prices Commission indicated that from 15th December, 1971, to 19th January, 1972, the commission considered 49 notices of intention to raise prices. The commission recommended price increases in 47 of these cases.  Most of the recommended increases were less than the increases proposed.</P>
      <P>In a Press release which I issued on 25th January, 1972, in conjunction with the publication of the commission's January report, I stated that I had accepted the commission's recommendations for price increases contained in that report and in view of the Deputy's question, I feel it appropriate to quote the following comments made by the commission in their first and third reports:</P>
      <P>(i)  Report No. 1 of November, 1971</P>
      <P>Prices must bear some relation to costs of production.  Of the main items of costs, the prices of imported materials and indirect taxes lie wholly beyond our influence as a Commission.  The same is true of wages and salaries.  When an application for a price increase reaches us, increases in these have already occured and are generally a main reason for the application.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Report No. 3 of January, 1972</P>
      <P>Cost increases which are not met from higher productivity and efficiency must be met from higher prices; it was only in a small minority of the cases that came before us that it would have been economically justifiable (or even possible) to meet these cost increases from profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In blunt terms, increases in money incomes that are matched by higher productivity in the firms that pay them are in a real sense earned. Higher money incomes that cannot <Col N="1657" /> be (or are not) matched by higher productivity mean higher prices, if the firms are to survive and if employment is to be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering applications for increases could the Minister say if investigation took place into the profit margins of the companies concerned on the products for which they sought increases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this was done. As the Deputy may be aware, there are two representatives of the Congress of Trade Unions on this commission and I am sure that they with the other representatives looked into this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>How long, on average, is there between an application for a price increase, an investigation being made and a report being issued?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to this matter.  It arises out of the Minister's reply, because I am asking if the increase was justified and necessary. Before you can decide that, you decide how long it takes for the investigation to take place.</P>

      <P>I saw the report in question but the Deputy, no doubt, also saw the report on the following day to the effect that the statement in the previous report was exaggerated.  I understand that certain redundancies will arise from the decision of the company to rationalise its lines of production and that the matter is the subject of discussion between the management and the trade union concerned.  My Department was not informed of the proposed redundancies at the time.  I understand the company did not wish to make any statement on the matter pending conclusion of the discussions with the trade union.</P>

I would like to say, however, that the estimated number of new jobs to be created by the expansion of existing industry and by new industry in the city by the end of 1972 exceeds the current level of redundancy.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that 500 people are, or are about to be out of a job in Waterford and that this is a very serious crisis for the city? I do not know what will be done, but I know that nothing much has been done to alleviate the situation.  Certainly, in the next few months there will be considerable unemployment in the city.  Why has the Minister or the IDA not foreseen this situation and brought in the necessary new employment which he talks about and promises?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what reports were commissioned by his Department and semi-State bodies under the control of his Department in each of the past ten years; what reports were published; the total cost of these reports and in what cases the findings were implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As my reply contains a considerable amount of detail, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate a statement with the Official Report giving the information requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>As regards reports commissioned by my Department, I would refer the Deputy to the reply, given by me to a question on 5th August, 1971, at columns 3515 to 3520 of the Official Report, which contained particulars, including costs, of such reports in the ten-year period up to 1970-71.</P>
    <P>Of the 74 reports listed in that reply, 59 were published in the normal way. The four reports dealing with depyramiding of protection were given limited publication in that they were made available to interested parties in industry.  The following six reports were not published:</P>
    <P>Flax and hemp as industrial crops;</P>
    <P>Political risks insurance;</P>
    <P>Survey of Castlecomer Collieries;</P>
    <P>Export merchanting;</P>
    <P>Export survey;</P>
    <P>Export credit insurance.</P>
    <P>The COIP report on the footwear industry will be published shortly.  Four reports commissioned are not yet available for publication.  These are:</P>
    <P>Costs of shipping to the continent;</P>
    <P>Western Ireland transport costs;</P>
    <P>COIP report on the woollen and worsted industry;</P>
    <P>Inquiry into the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>In view of the complexity of many of the reports and their recommendations, it would not be practicable to indicate the extent to which the findings of the reports have been implemented without a very long and detailed statement.  Generally, however, it may be said that action as deemed to be appropriate in the light of the report has been or will be taken in all cases.</P>
    <P>As regards the semi-State bodies under the aegis of my Department, I have, in general, no function concerning the commissioning of reports by these bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if in view of the great need for increased capital for essential investment in agriculture <Col N="1664" /> and industry the Government will now consider taking the rich mineral resources of the State into public ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The State owns all reserves of gold, silver and petroleum and is estimated to own more than 60 per cent of all other mineral rights.  The legislation empowers me, whenever I consider it desirable in the public interest and subject to payment of compensation, to acquire for exploitation minerals which are not being worked or are not being worked efficiently and to grant, subject to such terms and conditions as I think proper, leases for commercial explotation of State minerals.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Government not to participate directly in mineral exploration and development but to provide adequate facilities and incentives to competent private enterprise concerns to engage in such activities. No change in this policy is envisaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I shall take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>My Department have no specific function in relation to the roadworthiness of cars, new or second-hand.  In general, the sale of cars comes within the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, so that it would be an offence for a seller to describe a car or any other article falsely as in good condition if it were not so; but as far as my Department is concerned there is no prohibition on the sale of cars not in good condition. As regards servicing of cars, it would be very difficult if not impossible to devise effective legislation to ensure that services are carried out satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> There are provisions in the Road Traffic Acts for which the Minister for Local Government is responsible, related to roadworthiness of vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. E. Timmons Mr. E. Timmons">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Also, does the Minister not consider it a frightening position that cars can be sold which are not roadworthy thereby affording no protection whatsoever for road users? Legislation to deal with this matter is needed urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

      <P>I am not so aware.  Section 8 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, requires each planning authority to keep a register in which there must, by virtue of section 41 of the said Act, be entered particulars of applications for permission for development and decisions on applications.  The register is kept at the office of the planning authority and is available for inspection during office hours.  A copy of an entry in the register may be obtained by any person on payment of a fee of 50p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the specific case referred to by the Deputy the letter purporting to appeal against the decision of the planning authority was not received within the period prescribed by statute and in the circumstances could not be accepted as a valid appeal.  The residents' association concerned were notified by the planning authority by letter dated 15th November, 1971, that a decision to grant permission had been made on 12th November, that particulars of such decision had been entered in the planning register, that the register is available for inspection at the planning department, 46-49 Dame Street, during normal office hours, that a certified copy of the entry in the register might be had on payment of 50p. and that an appeal against the decision by an aggrieved person must be made within 21 days of the date of the decision. <Col N="1672" /> In the circumstances I am satisfied that the residents' association concerned had adequate opportunity of submitting a valid appeal in accordance with the procedure prescribed by statute.</P>

      <P>Frascati Estates Limited appealed to me on 15th December, 1971, against decisions of Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation, as planning authority, refusing planning permissions for proposed developments. They requested an oral hearing of their appeals and this was being arranged for 8th February, 1972, in the Courthouse, Dún Laoghaire, at 10.30 a.m. However, on 21 January, 1972, the developers wrote, through their solicitors, to my Department to the effect that they had discussed the matter with the planning authority and had decided to make fresh applications to the planning authority which they hoped would satisfy the planning authority's grounds of objections and remove them.  They accordingly asked that the oral hearing being arranged for 8th February, 1972, be postponed. I considered it best to await the outcome of these fresh applications to the planning authority and accordingly I have postponed the oral hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and the regulations thereunder indicate the matters which I should take into account in determining a planning appeal and the procedure to be followed <Col N="1673" /> before a decision is taken.  In particular, the regulations indicate that, where on oral hearing is being held, a relevant matter to be taken into account should be put to parties to the appeal so that there is an opportunity of considering the views of all parties on it at the oral hearing.  I trust that on reflection the Deputy will agree that it would be more appropriate if the consideration he mentions were put to the local authority in the first instance and, in the case of an appeal, raised through the appeals procedure rather than through the procedure of parliamentary questions.</P>
