    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, in the light of the notoriously high incidence of alcoholism in this country and his expressed concern about it, he will request the sponsors (details supplied) to discontinue their highly publicised poster campaign, the general thesis of which may be interpreted to mean that a drinking family, including young adolescents, has a better life-style than a family with one drinker in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's interpretation of the poster and the conclusions he draws from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the clear message of this Guinness poster of parents, grandparents and children all drinking together, is that because one's parents drink, dutifully the children should join them and start drinking too, to be grown up?  Is it not irresponsible and amoral&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite willing to convey the Deputy's views to the advertising group responsible for maintaining the agreement I have with them.  My view is, first of all, that those people are adults and I do not think they constitute a family group.  There could be a difference of opinion about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister's campaign against cigarette smoking is based on the idea that young people are influenced by what older people do?  Is it not a fact that the Minister would not tolerate this kind of poster in relation to cigarettes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1413" />
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I do not think the figures in the poster are of young people.  Again, there may be some question of a difference of opinion.  Maybe it is controversial.  I would say to the Deputy that I have been studying the whole problem of alcoholism with the Irish National Council for Alcoholism and I am preparing a paper the details of which will become available in the next month or so dealing with this problem. The social aspect is of much more importance than any argument of a controversial kind about a particular advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a code of conduct which these brewers purport to maintain and is not this poster in direct contradiction of the idea that young people should not be appealed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In a friendly spirit I disagree with the Deputy.  I will send him the code in relation to alcoholic drinks and he can look into the matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the number of Bord na Móna employees (a) pensionable and (b) non-pensionable who have recently become redundant at Kilberry, County Kildare; the amount of compensation offered to the redundant employees and the likely date on which alternative employment will be made available at the proposed new works near Monasterevan; and if he will have consultations with the board with a view to providing any necessary capital funds to expedite the provision of alternative employment for these redundant employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that of a total of 25 men laid off at Kilberry, four are pensionable and 21 are non-pensionable. The period of permanent service varied between just over two years in one case to between three and a half to four years in the other cases.  I understand that compensation has been paid as provided for by the Redundancy Payments Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> The board have also informed me that there is no possibility of absorbing the men on the small area of bog being acquired near Monasterevan.  Plans in regard to this bog are not restricted in any way by shortage of capital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that a person (name supplied) in County Offaly who applied for an old age pension in May, 1972, has had no decision on or investigation into her claim despite many representations; if he will indicate the present position in the matter and, having regard to her poor circumstances, if he will authorise immediate payment of pension and arrears.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Pension in this case was reduced by decision of an appeals officer as a result of an increase in the pensioner's means following the receipt by him of his share of a deceased relative's estate.  If at any time there is in fact a reduction in his means it will be open to him to make application for an increased pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware of the forecast of the Economic and Social Research Institute of continued high unemployment figures, with little prospects of a reduction in the number of unemployed in 1973; and whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the sole responsibility for the views published in the <i>Quarterly Economic Commentary</i> lies with the authors of that publication and not with the Economic and Social Research Institute itself.  He will also see that on page 14 of the publication the authors draw attention to the high degree of uncertainty relating to any economic projection for the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After making allowance for seasonal influences, unemployment, which appeared to have eased slightly in the first quarter of 1972, rose again in the succeeding two quarters.  The latest indications are that the underlying trend of unemployment showed an improvement in October.  The greater part of the increases in unemployment between March and September was attributable to developments in the services and building and construction <Col N="1422" /> sectors.  Added to this is the fact that, because of the structural change which part of the industrial sector is at present undergoing, a high level of redundancies has tended to cancel out the new industrial employment being provided.</P>
    <P>To stimulate building and construction the Government authorised additional expenditure during the year of £4.8 million under the Public Capital Programme and there is now some evidence of recovery in this industry following the slackness in the earlier part of the year.  Also, every effort is being made to counter the adverse effects of publicity concerning events in Northern Ireland on investment in this country.</P>
    <P>It is particularly difficult to forecast the unemployment level for 1973 because apart from the definitional problems involved in measuring genuine unemployment the level of net emigration also affects its magnitude.  The Deputy can be assured, however, that the Government will do all in its power to bring about an appreciable reduction in the numbers unemployed in 1973.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that whatever about his scepticism of the forecast in the ESRI quarterly report, that taken in conjunction with the British economic situation and the normal unemployment situation in the winter period, it would appear that the unemployment position would be that much more serious at the beginning of next year?  Would the Minister agree that the ESRI are correct, taking in all the factors such as the higher redundancy rate consequent on freer trade with European countries, and that it adds up to a very serious unemployment situation in the early part of next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would not want to under-estimate the seriousness of the problem but, lest there be any misunderstanding, I would not like it to be thought that I had expressed scepticism about the report.  What I did was to quote from it the statement to the effect that the authors <Col N="1423" /> drew attention to the high degree of uncertainty relating to any economic projection for the coming year.  This was from the report itself.  I have indicated some of the factors that operate. The Deputy will appreciate that some of them are matters over which we have not a great deal of control, such as the situation in the North and the consequences that flow from that.  I certainly would assure the Deputy that the seriousness of the unemployment situation is affected by these factors and, as I said, the question of net emigration, which is nil at the moment, is not one which I or the Government would wish to under-estimate in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if there will be any short-term capital injections into public works or the building sector to offset the seasonal unemployment which this year, taken in conjunction with the other matters, will make the position that much more serious?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out that earlier in the year, because of the projections in the building and construction industry, a sum of nearly £5 million extra was injected into it. This is showing results in recovery in employment trends in that industry. I would not rule out the possibility of further action of this kind, not necessarily in relation to that sector of industry, if it could be demonstrated that it would have the effect of creating employment in the coming months.  The Deputy will appreciate that this is very difficult to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the factors the Minister mentioned, the North, unemployment in Britain and the fall in emigration, were operative throughout the campaign for entry to the Common Market and that there was no question whatever raised by the Minister or by his party that these problems would not be solved, by entry into the Common Market and we would have high employment and no emigration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  The Deputy is quite right in saying that these <Col N="1424" /> factors were operating during that campaign but there is a fallacy in his logic, in so far as whether we went into the Common Market or not these factors would operate.  What was stated in the campaign by most of those who favoured entry into the EEC was that given these factors our opportunity to recover was much greater within the EEC than it would be outside it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the views published in the Quarterly Economic Commentary are not those of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  The authors of that publication are solely responsible for the views expressed.</P>
      <P>The full quotation of the reference to which the Deputy draws attention is as follows:</P>
      <P>Food prices seem likely to rise further in 1973, although not so rapidly as in 1972.  Being linked to international conditions food prices are largely beyond the short-term control of the Irish authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with the general tenor of these remarks.  Market conditions abroad for cattle and beef are expected <Col N="1425" /> to continue favourable during 1973.  On the other hand, certain factors of a cyclical nature which contributed to the sharp rise in food prices in 1972 should be absent next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that probably the major item, the explosive factor, in the present prices crisis, which the Minister can read about any day in the papers, is obviously the introduction of VAT? The Minister may have seen the cartoon in today's paper which sums up the position, the denials that VAT contributes to price increases and yet VAT obviously in everybody's experience is being used as the excuse, basically, for all the price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would question the assumptions in the Deputy's question.  First, I would question that VAT is of itself contributing to any noticeable degree to an increase in prices.  As regards the second part of his question, which was that it is being used as a cover for increasing prices, I would concede that there is some evidence for this but I would suggest that the efforts in this regard have been much less successful than many people thought they would be due to a number of factors but primarily due to the vigilance of the consumer, which I hope will be continued.</P>

As the law does not make it compulsory to give us this correct description of weight, quality and so on, it means that the consumer is not helped to make the best bargain. Would the Minister agree that there has been a lamentable delay in the introduction of suitable legislation since it is over a year since the Minister promised legislation of this kind?

However, I might mention a matter to which I referred here before, that is, that as a result of the bank rate and interest position at present, recent bonds are standing very well. They have been steady at about 99 or 99.7 for a considerable time so that there is no reason why people should have any objection at this stage to accepting land bonds.</P>
      <P>At the same time I accept what the Deputy says, that in spite of the fact that this is so statistically, there is reluctance on the part of land owners to settle other than for cash.  I would prefer to have a situation where I could use a great deal more cash than I have.</P>

This is a matter of regret, but it proved to be legally impossible to do this.  We have, in the meantime, been able to make some improvements through discussions with the Department of Finance with regard to land bonds to remove certain disabilities, particularly the fact that they were not acceptable at par for estate duty purposes.  Some improvements of value to the community have been made but not all I would like to make; some of them proved to be legally impossible to achieve.</P>

      <P>At a tuberculin test of this herd on 11th February, 1972, four animals gave positive reactions. Two of the reactors were found on slaughter to have lesions of tuberculosis. The normal procedure in such cases is that the herd must pass two further tuberculin tests before it can be regarded as free of tuberculosis and the blue cards restored.</P>
      <P>The herd was tested in July by the herd owner's veterinary surgeon.  There were no reactors.  An official test by a veterinary surgeon nominated by my Department was then arranged for 13th September.  The herd owner was given advance notification of this but when the veterinary surgeon called the herd owner could not be located. A further official test was arranged for 27th September and on that occasion the herd owner would not allow his cattle to be tested.  The herd must therefore still remain under restriction.</P>

      <P>Might I inquire whether the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister has investigated the fact that there was no record in the Minister's Department of the test which took place in July and that the herd owner was informed by the officer from the Naas office that no such test was carried out?  The veterinary surgeon who carried out the test was available and the farmer was present when the test was being carried out.  In fairness and justice this man is entitled to his blue card.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary have the matter further examined in the light of the extraordinary discrepancy between what the herd owner and the veterinary surgeon say and the attitude adopted by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position is quite clear.  As stated in my reply, there was a herd test in July, as a result of which there were no reactors but a further test was arranged for 13th September and it is in the interests of the owner, and <Col N="1444" /> of everybody else, that he cooperate and have this further test in order to have his blue card returned to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the officer, whose name I have given to the Minister when submitting the question, informed the farmer that no such test was carried out in July and that it was because of this difference of opinion that the Department's officer and the farmer disagreed and there was a most unsatisfactory ending to this visit on the part of the officer of the Department?  In the special circumstances, would the Parliamentary Secretary have this case reopened as soon as possible so as to facilitate the farmer concerned, who has a genuine grievance? Further, would the Parliamentary Secretary undertake to see that the officers of his Department are both accurate and reasonable when dealing with farmers in a matter of this kind, particularly when the farmer is right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 8, to delete &ldquo;sixteen&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;eighteen.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing this Bill on the last occasion I thought we were a trifle irresponsible in introducing the age of 16 as the statutory minimum age of marriage in this country.  In the light of the legislative background to our marriage law, our fundamental law <Col N="1464" /> under the Constitution, providing that ours is a society which permits no dissolution of the marriage bond, it struck me that as a general rule 16 was too early an age for any young person, no matter what the safeguards, to make a decision that would be binding for life.</P>
    <P>Last year I think the number under the age of 16 who were getting married was about 30 and so it is not a very widespread problem.  I accept that the marriage age of 16 in the Bill allows of exceptions which are mentioned as being permitted by the church or religious body involved.  My amendment to make the age 18 would also permit of exceptions and would not prohibit all marriages under that age.  It would simply say that the law sets the statutory minimum age for marriage at 18 and would permit of exceptions where necessary and approved.  In regard to giving permission for people under the age of 18 to marry the bodies mentioned in the Bill as competent to give that permission for exceptions are solely religious bodies.  I ask that there should be a place for parents when such permission is granted for a marriage under the minimum age.  There is no amendment to that effect but it is certainly the spirit of my amendment that if the amendment were carried and the minimum marriage age becomes 18, obviously there should be a place for consultation with the parents involved as well as the religious authorities.</P>
    <P>Some may think it is a bit of a joke that anybody should pause or ponder about the minimum age for marriage in this country.  I think it is a very serious matter.  I do not believe in the possibility that by any legislative means we can prevent the wrong people marrying each other; obviously we cannot; our legislation cannot remove all unhappiness from human affairs.  In latter years, too, we have become rather sceptical about the possibility of passing laws which would promote the good of the greatest number at any one time but at least we all realise that any legislation we pass or any social system we may yet create cannot abolish unhappiness or provide automatic happiness for the majority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> But we have the duty as legislators in this Assembly to go on our own experience and make up our minds as to whether this legislation we are passing is for the benefit of the community and would serve the interests of those whose interests it purports to serve. From my own experience as a working Deputy, listening to constituents over the past seven or eight years, I should say that, considering the problems that lie in the path of married couples, we should not pass airily into legislation the idea that a proper age to make a contract of matrimony which is binding for life would be the age of 16 and that would be regarded as the minimum age.  I think that would be irresponsible legislation.</P>
    <P>The fundamental law of the State under our Constitution accords the highest praise and gives a very august place in our legislation to marriage as an institution and our Constitution which will be only slightly amended by the removal of Article 44, will continue in full flower the various constitutional provisions in relation to the family, woman's place being in the home and, in the social directives part, all the fine things it has to say about the important place the family has in Irish society. So, it would be part of the same bombastic rhetoric&mdash;that is what it is when contrasted with the reality of the Irish marriage; the inadequate things we do, the absence of any real help for the family in the actual conditions of Irish society&mdash;if we were to set the minimum age at 16.  This would be to continue in much the same vein of rhetoric unrelated to the reality of the family in Irish society because the family in our society is not catered for; it is not looked after in our social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Until we come to the point where we can say in our social legislation that there is in existence a charter for the family in Irish society we cannot say we are giving the family the place it is given in our Constitution.  Our entire welfare system looks at the individual in isolation; the sick in isolation, the deserted wife, the father out of work. None of our legislation looks at the family in the circumstances of Irish society and attempts to assist them.</P>
    <P>We know that a man with five children <Col N="1466" /> earning £20 per week is living below the poverty line.  How many such families are there in a country where the Constitution guarantees the family so high a place?  There are thousands of families living below the poverty line; neither our legislation nor our social welfare system gives them any help.  There is this contrast in our attitude towards the family.  It costs very little to give the highest praise in the Constitution to the family as a unit but in material terms little of the nation's wealth is given to the family in want, in sickness, or in trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We are legislating for the minimum age of marriage in this country.  I am making the point that the age of 16 is too young an age for any couple to make a decision that will be binding on them for life and I am suggesting the age should be 18 years.  There is no guarantee that at 18 years people will not make mistakes, that they will not marry the wrong people, but I am suggesting that at 18 years a couple have a greater opportunity to consider certain of the problems they will have to face.  If we pass this legislation setting out the minimum age at 16 years, the problems of young couples will be more acute when one considers the deprived situation of the family in Ireland who are below a certain income level.  In conscience we could not pass such legislation unless we were doing far more than we are doing for the family who are below a certain income level. There are marriages that are formally called marriages where the family relationship has broken down totally because of the lack of concern shown to them and the lack of help given to them in their financial and other troubles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the problems that beset married couples in Irish society, problems of which a couple of 16 years could not be aware, it would be a grave error to pass legislation setting <Col N="1467" /> out the minimum age of marriage at 16 years.  Even considering parental consent and the various exceptions made here, it would be irresponsible on our part to pass this legislation.  It would be committing the same kind of error that was committed in our Constitution.  In our Constitution we pay many rhetorical tributes to the family but in reality we give very little aid to it.  Just because we say in our Constitution that there is no dissolution of marriage it appears we have waved away a problem.  So we think, but I suggest that in our aid to the family we do very little to keep it together.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not arise on the Deputy's amendments. It has nothing to do with the section. The Deputy's amendments deal with the question of age.  He is going outside the ambit of the Bill in this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about marriage in our community. The feature of marriage in our society is that it is a contract for life and this is why this is such a serious matter. It would not be so serious a matter if it were not a life contract.  That is the reason I am suggesting that the statutory age should be 18 years. There is a great deal of hypocrisy surrounding our approach to marriage; we do little to help the institution of the family although we pay it much lip-service.</P>
      <P>We do not assist young married couples to buy their own houses.  In fact, there is no possibility for most of them to buy their own homes.  A man earning £30 a week finds it practically impossible to pay a deposit for a house; we do not assist the deserted wife because the income of £5.15 per week we give her is inadequate, as is the amount of £1.35 given for each child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are some of the reasons why this is an important and serious matter. We should not airily pass into legislation a statutory age of 16 years considering the difficult circumstances of married partners in Irish society.  Those below a certain income level are in a <Col N="1468" /> very difficult position.  Anyone who has been looking at this problem in the last few years in a city context will realise that there are many families here who find it impossible to make ends meet.  Marriages are breaking up because of economic difficulties.  Whatever constitutional measures may be involved, fundamentally it is the economic straits of the Irish family that are mainly behind the greatest amount of marital unhappiness.</P>
    <P>We should ponder and consider the results of our action before we put into legislation the idea that people can make this decision at the age of 16 years, at least until our society does more to help the family.  In a society that gives no support to the family, this minimum age is too young.  At any age the decision to marry is a serious one in society, but 16 years is too early an age for any young couple to anticipate the problems they will meet.</P>
    <P>We all know how families below a certain income level find it very difficult to keep going.  We are all aware of the mother of the large family, or of the family that is existing in poverty-stricken circumstances, who is a nervous wreck.  Many such people are frequently treated in out-patient departments so bad and so harsh are the emotional disturbances of such families who are faced with the daily struggle of living in our society.</P>
    <P>Unless we consider more seriously the plight of the family in society, unless we consider what aids and help we can give it, very soon in Ireland marriage will become a luxury of the rich because the poor will no longer be able to afford it.  We must consider very seriously any formal legislation passed here setting an age limit for people marrying.  We cannot pass that legislation with the comfortable feeling that the married couple will go out into a society which gears its social aids properly, guarantees a minimum income, and believes in giving the married couple a chance amidst the economic hazards.  Instead, they will go out into a society which has a harsh 19th century view of marriage, a society which says that if you sink in the economic seas that is too bad <Col N="1469" /> but the State will not assist you, a society which gives a great deal of lip-service to the Christian ideals of marriage but which has, in fact, the capitalist view of the 19th century and which could not be more harsh in its approach to the marriage contract.</P>
    <P>Unless we do something about this very soon, marriage will become a luxury of the rich because the poor will not be able to afford it in Irish society.  We must think again before we say 16 years is the correct age at which people may marry.  Those who disagree with me may say that only a tiny minority are involved but it seems to me that, if the minimum age for marriage can be as low as 16 years, we are giving a false lead to the country.  The House is being irresponsible because we all know that the contract upon which people are entering is a lifelong one in our society.  We all know that families on a certain income limit can be in very serious trouble indeed.  We all know that the housing situation is inadequate, that the social welfare system is inadequate, and that the question of looking after children is not reflected in our Social Welfare code.</P>
    <P>In that type of society the majority of Deputies are willing to accept 16 years as the statutory age for marriage. I do not share that opinion and that is why I put down this amendment.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his approach.  He explained that he would prefer a more comprehensive Marriages Bill.  He explained that this Bill was introduced some years ago, that it is now the product of a great deal of consultation and that, if we hesitate any longer or postpone a decision, there is little likelihood of any legislation being introduced to improve the situation.  I accept the Minister's sincerity but, if we cannot have a comprehensive Marriages Bill, at least whatever changes are introduced should go in the correct direction as far as possible.  I do not think this is the case in relation to the minimum age in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he agreed there <Col N="1470" /> was some point in the suggestion to raise the minimum age above 16 years.  The point can be made that we could lower the age for voting from 21 years to 18 years, and the minimum age for marriage should be raised to 18 years if we are serious about the effects of this legislation on the couples who will be involved. The Bill permits of exceptions where necessary.  In the case of these exceptions I would hope that the parents would also be consulted as well as religious bodies.  So far as I can see in the Bill as it stands there is only place for the religious bodies.</P>
    <P>We cannot pass legislation of this kind <i>in vacuo</i>.  We cannot pass this legislation without considering the place of the family as we know it in the society in which we live.  We cannot cod ourselves about the problems facing men and women and their children in Ireland today.  We know the problems they face and how ineffectual our legislation is to meet that situation.  Therefore, how can we pass this legislation airily and say that 16 years is the age at which young people can face the terrible problems posed for those who marry in Irish society?</P>
    <P>This contract is lasting for children and parents, in a society which gives little aid to the family, a society which is rich in plámás for the ideals of the family.  In the Constitution we pay a great tribute to the idea of the family, the sanctity of the family and woman's place being in the home but, in reality, little is done to help the family.  No assistance is given to the family in trouble.  Many families are in trouble today in this country.  There may be contributory factors but the major cause of that trouble is the financial one.  I am sure Deputies are aware that there are married women who weep all day when they consider their financial problems.</P>

      <P>We cannot consider this Bill in isolation from the way families exist in our society.  We must consider the family.  My general <Col N="1471" /> contention is that we do little in our social legislation to defend the institution of the family.  It would be irresponsible for us to pass this legislation when we consider how little has been done.  It would be otherwise if our social legislation sincerely attempted to protect the family.  In such a situation my reservations about the minimum age limit of 16 years would disappear but, as it is, I cannot see how in good conscience we can legislate a minimum age of 16 years.</P>

      <P>Some of us might go a certain distance with Deputy O'Leary on this matter and I am sure he is quite sincere in what he has said about a minimum age limit of 18 years.  In introducing this legislation the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Up to now reliance has been placed here on the common law under which minimum ages of 12 years for a girl and 14 years for a boy had been settled.</P>
      <P>Bringing the limit up to 16 years is at least a step in the right direction. Surely it would be a matter for the parents to advise their children, with the guidance of ministers of their own religion.  I know the Minister would have preferred to bring in a completely new Marriages Bill but, at this stage, I think we would be wrong if we objected to increasing the minimum age limit to 16.  I am sure girls and boys of that age will be properly advised by their parents and by the leaders of their religious denominations. I have no objection to the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mixed feelings about this Marriages Bill.  I have a certain sympathy with the Minister in his attempt to bring in a Marriages Bill.  Is it possible to bring in a Marriages Bill which would be of any real value in attempting to mitigate or reduce the amount of hardship which human beings continue to suffer, no matter what we decide here in the Dáil?  At the same time, a number of things occur to me in considering this amendment to raise the age from 16 to 18.  The odd thing is that the debate should take place exclusively between <Col N="1472" /> men, between male Deputies, and we should be trying to decide this very important question without the help of the female side of a marriage.  It is such a muslim sort of society in its make-up in that of the 145, 146 or 147 Deputies, there are three or four women and they do not discuss this provision.  I think their advice would be very helpful.</P>
      <P>When one gets around to this idea of age, one wonders what virtue there is in either 16 or 18.  Is there any great virtue in either, any great value? Should there be not only this minimum age limit but a maximum age limit because, as is said frequently, some very foolish marriages are made by people in their sixties, never mind people of 16 years?  It is just that the whole idea of deciding that somebody at any age is a mature personality is a complete <i>non sequitur</i>.  Age and maturity have little or nothing to do with one another and, therefore, in some ways it could be said that the Minister's 16 and Deputy O'Leary's 18 are equally irrelevant or equally valuable if you wish.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Deputy O'Leary's main point is not that he thinks 18 years is better than the Minister's figure.  He accepts the fallibility, as I suppose the Minister also accepts the fallibility, of any figure or any age.  It is just that in the circumstances of a society in which there are so many more threats to the stability or security of a marriage Deputy O'Leary feels that another two years would be a wise precaution to take so that a person entering into marriage might have a little more experience, a little more understanding, a little more knowledge of quite what this tremendous challenge&mdash;probably the greatest single challenge that two human beings enter into and certainly the most demanding contract that two human beings enter into&mdash;involves.  As he points out, except for the possibility of nullity, of getting an annulment in relation to the Catholic Church in Ireland, there is the absolute permanency of this contract in our particular culture, our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, therefore, I share <Col N="1473" /> his concern about the great dangers involved in the whole question of two young persons marrying and his attempt to see that these are reduced to the minimum.  The truth, of course, is, as again he pointed out, that you cannot be completely and absolutely protected from making the wrong decision. At the same time, some very happy marriages have been made by people of 40, 50, 60 and 70 and some very unhappy marriages have been made by people of 40 and 50, but where there is the question of the indissolubility of marriage involved, quite obviously all the safeguards that can be put into a law passing through this House should be introduced.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties which all of us face is that the whole idea of marriage, particularly for young people, is so trivialised by mainly women's magazines of one kind or another. Certainly the problems involved are greatly under-estimated and the difficulties involved are not as carefully defined by those who have been married or have been through marriage in order to help young people who wish to get married&mdash;not to frighten them but to warn them that marriage can be full of unexpected difficulties which they may not be in a position to deal with or to resolve.  While it is true, as all of us have said, that age is not inevitably associated with the breakdown or success of marriage, statistics show that the highest level of divorces in countries where divorces are permitted, the highest percentage of breakdowns occur in the younger marriage group; and if Deputy O'Leary wanted to make a case based on considerations other than his own instincts and the case he made about the indissolubility of the contract, statistically I think he could support his plea to the Minister that in these circumstances the younger age group type of marriage is more likely not to survive the stresses and demands of married life as well as those made at a later age.</P>
    <P>There are many factors in all modern societies, and not only our own, which are making it impossible &mdash;there is no good in saying difficult &mdash;for anybody to try to decide what <Col N="1474" /> the ideal preconditions for a happy marriage could or should be, because throughout modern civilisation, in the most advanced communities, even in rigid Muslim-type societies in which a woman has little or no place in the scheme of things, right across to the most permissive sort of society where marriage is entered into without any sense of serious commitment, the whole institution of marriage is seriously under question simply because nobody seems to be able to give any idea what the ideal or essential prerequisites to a happy marriage are.</P>
    <P>The Minister could be right in his proposal for 16 years of age and Deputy O'Leary could be right in his suggestion of 18 years.  All I can say is that for most of one's professional life one is involved with persons who have entered into marriage, frequently, mostly, I must confess, young people, without understanding the truly superhuman stresses to which they will be subjected throughout their married lives.  There is not only the conflict of one immature personality attempting to live with a mature personality but of two immature personalities trying to live together.</P>
    <P>There are other factors to which Deputy O'Leary referred.  There are the stresses of living in overcrowded conditions, of living in badly designed housing estates, if one is lucky enough to get a house; there are the changing patterns of urban and rural societies, the breaking up of the old family structure with all the wonderful supports there were, particularly in rural areas and in certain parts of cities like Dublin.  These are all missing.  More frequently young people are finding themselves marrying without the support of their parents, brothers and sisters, people they could lean on in times of stress when the marriage looked like breaking down.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows now that the whole institution of marriage is gravely in question.  It is in question nearly every year.  The question is can it survive and if so how?  This concern, this distress I frequently feel when I am presented with two people living together and turning from loving to <Col N="1475" /> hating one another.  They are finding it intolerable to live together, and to suggest that this is something which must go on and on is the origin of my own concern about issues in which I have become involved in Irish public life, specifically because I have been concerned with the difficulties of young married couples.</P>
    <P>There are the questions, naturally, of family planning, the fear of the next child, the stress of a too large family, the lack of the legal rights of the woman in our society in a marriage about to break up, in which there is serious conflict between the two parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I still believe it is involved in the conflict between the Minister and Deputy O'Leary on the question of age.  The amendment seeks an increase from 16 years to 18. I support Deputy O'Leary's attempt to try to reduce to the minimum the number of young people who enter into marriage, whether they are 18 years, 20 or older, because they may not understand that the contract they are entering is indissoluble, because within that contract there are demands on them from which they cannot escape&mdash;for instance, the large family &mdash;because there is the threat in our society of the broken home from emigration, because there is the threat in our society of unemployment and bad housing.  These factors in our society should colour the kind of laws we pass here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could support the Minister's proposal for the age of 16 years if he were to propose it and at the same time say that because the whole process of marriage is a difficult one he would recommend that our society would stand by with certain provisions for protecting the institution, protecting those people who find themselves unable to work that institution&mdash;to <Col N="1476" /> facilitate them in making their marriages work.  Such recommendation should encompass all the things to which we are attempting to draw the House's attention as we pass this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it should be presumed that persons other than the people who are about to get married, whether at 16 years or 18 years, should be put into a position of making a decision as to why a marriage should take place at all.  I do not understand why that provision is needed.  If there are organisations or institutions which are to be given that authority, I certainly think the parents should be included for the giving of permission to marry.  With so many deficiencies and defects in our society, the need for the education of mothers in respect of marriage, and fathers too, the need for the education of mothers in motherhood, the conditions under which many of them will live, the conditions under which most of them will have to have their families, the fact of the indissolubility of the contract, Deputy O'Leary's amendment is a reasonable one and should be accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I disagree very much with my colleagues on this amendment and I agree with the Minister.  I do not think we have the right to deprive people who are under 18 of the right to marry.  We may talk about the social services not being adequate but we must not deprive these people of their right to marry.</P>

      <P>If we were to raise the age to 18 we might be depriving people.  It would be a retrograde, regressive step if we were to do this.  In this modern age, when we talk about people maturing at a much earlier age&mdash;and we are admitting this fact in calling for a referendum in connection with votes at 18&mdash;I wonder why we should be thinking now of shoving the minimum age up from <Col N="1477" /> 14 to 18.  We are going back to the Victorian era in demanding this.  I think any girl or boy is very mature at 16 and I do not see how we could have the right to deprive them of the right to marry.  It would be very wrong.  We are not saying they should get married at 16.  What we are saying is that the minimum age should be 16, which is a completely different thing.</P>
      <P>We cannot say, and statistics have not shown, that where people have married younger they have broken up. My experience, as a doctor in family practice, is that those who have got married later in life are more inclined to break up because of incompatibility and not being able to adapt to each other.  This is a big problem I have found in my experience as a family doctor.  I think this is an important experience.  It is not necessarily the younger people who break up.</P>
      <P>Of course, we know there should be education and better social services for them but that does not give us the right to legislate against them and that is what this amendment would do. When I went to a former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Neil Blaney, about the housing crisis in Dublin he said to me: &ldquo;They are marrying too young.&rdquo;  He did not get married until he was 38.  That to me is illogical.  What we should be doing is providing the social services so that people could get married younger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not saying that two people of 16 should marry each other.  It may be that a man of 20 or 25 would marry a girl of 17. Does anyone in this House think that is abnormal?  Not at all.  The argument here is that two people of 16 are going to marry.  That is completely illogical. We must consider ourselves as responsible legislators and it would be a retrograde step to deprive people of this right.  It is accepted by everyone that people are maturing very much earlier now and with the mass media there is no girl of 16 or 17 who does <Col N="1478" /> not understand the problems of having a family and who does not understand the problems of building up a home for herself and her husband.  Indeed, girls from a very early age, as early as ten years of age, are actually planning about marriage. I cannot accept that 16, 17 or 17½ is too young to marry.</P>
      <P>These people are paying taxes and they are responsible people.  To say that a person under 18 is not responsible is an illogical argument.  I accept that we might have more training and education in schools.  I agree with the Minister that 16 should be the limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I agree with Deputy O'Connell that we have no right to legislate in this way but I certainly would not share the view that people are mature enough at 16 to marry.  I believe that 16, and even 18, in today's society is too young.  We know the complications of married life today.  I do not believe that a boy or girl of 18 is mature enough to take on the responsibilities of marriage.  We see the tragedies in this city of many boys and girls who have got married young. There are housing problems and other problems.  I do not believe they are capable of taking on this heavy responsibility at 16 or 18 and I do not believe that at that age they would have sufficient means to maintain a wife and family.</P>
      <P>Family advice centres are sadly lacking in this city.  There are many problems for young married couples. We have very few of those centres in Dublin.  I was appalled to read recently that in one city in this country one of these advice bureaux was closed down.  We should give more help to these people.  I would disagree with Deputy O'Connell that they are mature enough at this age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is right to have 16 years in the Bill.  We should not deprive them of that right, but there should be more advice and it should be pointed out to people in schools that there are obligations and problems in marriage and that it is not such a romantic undertaking.  I think the Minister is right in making it 16 <Col N="1479" /> years but it should not be an encouragement to young people to get married at 16.  There should be proper guidance, proper education and instruction in the home.  We need more marriage advice centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion has ranged over a wide variety of topics. I notice that there was disagreement among Members of the House as to what the minimum age for marriage should be.  I cannot really discuss in detail here the problems of married life as it is today.  I think, in relation to the passage of this Bill, that we should all approve of the growth of community centres throughout the country and we hope that the churches will pursue ever more vigorously the need for education for living and education for marriage.  I would like to express the hope that marriage guidance counselling will reach a far greater number of people than it does at present.  I know from talking to the people concerned that the great majority of those who go for marriage guidance counselling are people who are already well disposed for marriage and have come to learn more.  We need a great deal more marriage guidence counselling.</P>
      <P>The whole matter of discussions among people aged 16 and 17 years on courtship is only beginning.  There is a fair amount of it but it is in its initial phase.  On this occasion I should like to pay public tribute to the work done by his Lordship, the Bishop of Ossory, Dr. Birch, who conducts discussion classes at weekends for boys and girls between the ages of 16 and 17.  The boys and girls attend the discussions together.  We need a great deal more of that developing kind of community work.  It does not really arise on this Bill but I wanted to make quite sure that the House understood that I recognise the difficulties that arise in marriage today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say from my knowledge of the psychiatric disturbance element in it that you can find psychiatric disturbances arising among young married people and middle aged married <Col N="1480" /> people of all socio-economic groups. The troubles certainly are not confined to those who are unable to get housing or who, in the opinion of some Deputies, receive inadequate social welfare allowances.  In relation to the social welfare element, the Minister for Social Welfare indicated the other day that in the period when the cost of living went up by 72 per cent the cost of social welfare services was increased by 350 per cent, so some progress is being made in that direction although naturally people will always claim it is insufficient.</P>
    <P>I quite accept everything that has been said by Deputy Browne and Deputy O'Leary in regard to the hazards people have to face in marriage. I once read in a book that a marriage could be compared to one partner holding a violin and the other partner holding the bow and being able to play a tune well together.  It can be as difficult as that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the actual amendments the great majority of marriages are conducted by religious organisations. We consulted the religious organisations in 1957 and later.  The religious organisations as a whole, together with women's societies, suggested that the minimum marriage age should be 16.  I do not think I need read out the account of the meetings which were held.  My Department received views from the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church, and, as late as 1971, from the Dublin Council of Churches, representing a number of churches other than the Roman Catholic Church.  They also received the views of the Catholic Hierarchy.  The deputations argued that the minimum age for marriage should be 16 without exception.  They believed that this was necessary on physical, moral and social grounds and would bring Ireland into line with other countries.</P>
    <P>I have already given to the House the picture abroad and I do not think I need repeat it.  We are to some extent in a medium position.  Perhaps I should say again that a minimum age of 16 years obtains in Britain and in Italy&mdash;although there will be an amendment of the law raising the age <Col N="1481" /> I believe&mdash;and in Portugal and Spain. This is in regard to males.  There is a minimum age of 18 in Belgium, Finland, Sweden, France, West Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Turkey.  A minimum age of 20 years obtains in Denmark and Norway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 20.  As regards females, a minimum of 12 years obtains in Spain for civil marriages only.  A minimum of 14 years obtains in Italy, Portugal and Spain; a minimum of 15 years in Belgium, France and Luxembourg; a minimum of 16 years in Britain, Northern Ireland, West Germany and the Netherlands. A minimum of 17 years obtains for females in Finland and a minimum of 18 years for females in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Turkey.</P>
      <P>If you look at the states of America you will find a wide variety of rules there.  A minimum of 16 for females obtains in 34 non-European countries and states of the United States.  A minimum of 17 years obtains in one state, a minimum of 18 obtains in three states and a minimum of 19 obtains in one state.  Below the age of 16 a minimum of 14 years obtains in seven countries or states outside Europe, a minimum of 15 obtains in ten countries or states outside Europe and therefore 16 years is not an excessively low age judged by that comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to have regard to the position in Britain and Northern Ireland where the age of 16 years for a male and 16 for a female obtains. Any difference in minimum ages for these adjoining areas tends to encourage under age couples to attempt to marry in the country with the lowest age.  We have had this problem with couples who have come here from Britain, who were aged under 16 and came to marry under our law.  We have to have some regard at least to the position obtaining in neighbouring countries to which people can go and where they can obtain work&mdash;it is more difficult now&mdash;and I think on the whole the churches were right in <Col N="1482" /> establishing 16 as the minimum age for marriage.</P>
    <P>I should draw the attention of the House next to section 1 and section 6, as newly amended, which have to be read together, that all persons under the age of 21 have to get parental consent before going to the churches, in the particular cases, or to the courts in other cases, where they will engage in a civil marriage.  I must bear in mind, in offering this Bill to the Dáil, that religious organisations are to an overwhelming degree responsible for the marriage institution in this country and we must have regard to the views of these religious organisations. A great many of the clergy of all the denominations mentioned in the Bill should be able to make wise decisions.  If their decisions are disputed, the parents having given their consent, there is always the possibility of going to court.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any facts on the age of divorce relating to youth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not apply to this country but half of the marriages in the United States, where the partners are either 21 or under, result in divorce but I think it is equally true to say that because marriage is indissoluble here a far greater proportion of young men and women walk out together, so to speak, and face the realities of what marriage means than they do in countries where divorce is so easily procured.  I really think they do.  We have no figures in this country as to the number of marriages that break up or to the extent to which marriages are unhappy in any age group.  We have only the warning from figures across the ocean and in the US which, I hope, will lead young people to reflect on what they are doing when they are considering marriage. We all know of young couples who married while under the age of 21 and who seemed to be well able to cope with matters of domestic life but who were totally immature emotionally. In some cases the reverse is the position.  A wife who cannot cook or a couple who cannot budget might at least be mature emotionally but, <Col N="1483" /> also, there can be cases where a couple are neither mature emotionally nor able to cope with domestic life.  It is a very mixed picture.</P>

      <P>In suggesting 18 as a minimum age, I did not intend that allowance would not be made for exceptions.  In proposing the minimum age of 16, the Minister, too, is making provision for exceptions in particular cases.  I was making the point that our minimum age must not reflect a view that this is a rather transient relationship but rather that our fundamental law on the subject and the minimum age that we would set out in statutory form should not give so low an age as I consider 16 to be in view of the far-reaching consequences of the decision in a society which says that marriage is a lifelong contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's reply I got the impression that the overriding consideration was that in Britain and Northern Ireland the minimum age is 16 and that this was the overriding element in the decision to propose the same minimum age here.  Admittedly I am looking at the situation in terms of the Constitution and the jurisdiction we have at present in the Twenty-six Counties.  It is primarily in relation to the state of affairs in that jurisdiction that I propose a minimum age of 18.  If the general approach of society in its social legislation in our country was different, in other words, if various aids were given to the family, this matter might not be so important, but in view of the total absence of such aids and since the contract is a lifelong one, I consider the age of 16 to be too young.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether the position in the neighbouring country was the overriding element in his proposal.  Also, <Col N="1484" /> can he tell us whether he got any suggestion from any of the bodies he consulted&mdash;the churches, other religious bodies or women's organisations&mdash;that the age might be somewhat higher than 16?  In most of the countries mentioned by the Minister the dissolution of marriage is permitted. If the legislation of Northern Ireland and Britain was the main consideration it was not the best basis for reaching our decision.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us, too, whether women's organisations were consulted on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago the women's societies informed us that they considered 16 to be a suitable minimum age and they have not come back to us since with any further representations. The religious organisations with whom we consulted approved of the age of 16 and, in connection with the discussions we had, they did not mention that their opinion was in any way influenced by the position in Britain or Northern Ireland.  For their own religious and social reasons they proposed the minimum age of 16.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>Before section 5 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5. (1)  Where the governing body of the Dublin Jewish Progressive Congregation notify an tArd-Chláraitheoir that a person has been appointed by them to be the secretary of their synagogue, that person shall be deemed to be a person who is certified under section 63 of the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844, to be the secretary of a synagogue, and until an tArd-Chláraitheoir is notified by the governing body that that person has ceased to be the secretary of their synagogue, he shall continue to be so deemed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  In case of the absence from illness or other reasonable cause of any such person, he may, with the approval of the governing body and subject to the obligation of notifying an tArd-Chláraitheoir, appoint a deputy to discharge his duties under the Marriages (Ireland) Act. 1844, and the other Acts relating to marriages <Col N="1487" /> during any period not exceeding twelve months.</P>
    <P>(3)  References in the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844, to a secretary of a synagogue shall be construed as including references both to a person who is deemed under this section to be certified as aforesaid and to a deputy appointed under this section&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Members of the Dublin Jewish Progressive Congregation wishing to marry currently hold a marriage ceremony in their synagogue but for civil purposes they must have another marriage ceremony in a registrar's office.  This amendment will dispense with the need for the civil ceremony and will enable the registration, for civil purposes, of the synagogue marriage.  The amendment entitles the secretary of the synagogue who will be responsible for the registration of the marriage to have a deputy to act for him in his absence. The proposed revision was agreed to by the governing bodies of both the Orthodox and Progressive Jews.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>Before section 6 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.  The following section is hereby substituted in the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844, for sections 19 and 20:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>`19. (1)  A marriage shall not be solemnised where either of the parties, being neither a widower or widow nor a ward of court, is under the age of twenty-one unless there shall first be obtained (a) the consents of the guardians, or the consent of the sole guardian, of such of the parties so under age or (b) if there is no guardian, the consent of the President of the <Col N="1488" /> High Court (or of a Judge of that Court nominated by the President thereof).</P>
    <P>(2)  The foregoing subsection shall have effect subject to the proviso that the requirement of consent of a guardian shall not apply in a case in which the consent is refused or withheld, or in which the guardian is unknown, of unsound mind or of whereabouts which would be unreasonably difficult to ascertain, if consent of the President of the High Court (or of a Judge of that Court nominated by the President thereof) to the intended marriage is first obtained.</P>
    <P>(3)  The following provisions shall have effect in relation to an application under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it may be made by or on behalf of either party to the intended marriage and without the intervention of a next friend,</P>
    <P>(b)  it may be made informally through the Registrar of Wards of Court in accordance with rules of procedure directed by the President of the High Court,</P>
    <P>(c)  it may be heard and determined in private, and</P>
    <P>(d)  no court fee shall be charged in respect of it.</P>
    <P>(4)  This section applies, notwithstanding section 3 of this Act, in relation to all marriages.&rdquo;'</P>
    <P>This amendment is necessary because of the new amendment specified below. The important changes specified by the new section are as follows: the application of the provision of statutory parental consent for the first time to marriages solemnised by Roman Catholic rites and ceremonies.  The new section makes it quite clear that the marriage of any under age person solemnised in the State must have the consent of parent or guardian. Secondly, the amendment ties in the provisions of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, with the requirements <Col N="1489" /> for parental consent.  In broad terms, the Act specifies that parents are the guardians of their child; if one parent only is alive he or she is sole guardian; the mother of an illegitimate is the child's guardian; a testamentary guardian may be appointed by a parent to act, after his or her death, jointly with the surviving parent.  The new section accordingly requires the consent of both parents or guardians, where there are two, to an under age marriage. This is a change.</P>
    <P>Where there is only one, his or her consent is required.  Where there are two parents or guardians and one agrees and one disagrees to the marriage, the party to be married may look to the courts for consent.  The assistance of the courts may also be sought where a parent or guardian withholds or refuses consent unreasonably; where the parent or guardian is unknown, is of unsound mind or is unreasonably difficult to locate.  This is quite an important amendment the character of which was suggested on Second Stage.  It is an important departure in that, in regard to marriages solemnised by Roman Catholic rites and ceremonies, parental consent of both parties is now required for the first time for those who are under age.</P>

      <P>As the Minister says, this point arose in discussion here.  The Minister's amendment meets the spirit of our amendment. The Minister makes the point that both parents are now involved in the decision and that in the event of disagreement recourse can be had to the courts.  In the original drafting of the amendment the decision was given solely to the father.  The Minister's amendment satisfactorily meets the point and our amendment can be withdrawn.</P>

Would the child have to have the consent of either or both or which of the two?  For instance, would he go to the person of the marriage to whom the children were awarded by <Col N="1490" /> the courts or by the Church in a nullity case?</P>

      <P>(1)  In any case where a decree for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is pronounced, the court may thereby declare the parent by reason of whose misconduct the decree is made to be a person unfit to have custody of the children (if any) of the marriage or of any children adopted under the Adoption Act, 1952, by the parents jointly; and in such case, the parent so declared to be unfit shall not, on the death of the other parent, be entitled as of right to the custody of the children.</P>

      <P>Before section 17 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17.  (1)  The Minister for Health may, by regulations, substitute, for any reference to the age of twenty-one contained in any Act specified in the next subsection, a reference to any lesser age.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Acts referred to in the foregoing subsection are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> (a)  the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844,</P>
    <P>(b)  the Marriage Law (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1863,</P>
    <P>(c)  the Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law (Ireland) Act, 1870.</P>

    <P>This section replaces in more specific terms the provisions in the present section 6, subsection (1), in other words &ldquo;or such lesser age as the Minister for Health may by regulations appoint&rdquo;. It also provides for the tabling of the regulations in the usual terms.  The intention is that, if the voting age be reduced from 21 to 18, the age for parental consent should be similarly reduced.

      <P>I would not say so, really, because persons who are 18 can now make wills and if persons are considered able to vote in an election it would seem to me that they ought to be able to make a decision in regard to marriage.  I do not think it is a very controversial change.  Persons are very much more aware of the realities of life at 18 years of age than was the case.  Great numbers of people are employed before the age of 18.  In general, the consent of the House could be assumed as automatic.  If we make the very serious decision that <Col N="1495" /> citizens can vote at 18 years of age, the age at which consent of the parents to a marriage is no longer required could equally be reduced.</P>

      <P>On Thursday afternoon last as the clock was ticking towards 2.30 I was coming towards a discussion on Radio Telefís Éireann but since the clock was at that time it was possible only to take out a few individual subjects and treat them rather briefly.  I now intend to go more deeply into the finances of RTE, to say something about constraints which are there in relation to programme-making, to speak briefly on questions of colour and education in relation to television and to end by some thoughts <Col N="1496" /> on the question of politics and television and particularly in relation to section 31.</P>
      <P>The Radio Telefís Éireann Authority, as the House knows, was instituted under the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, and there have been amendments in the years intervening but the finances are largely governed by the 1960 Act, the 1966 Act and the 1971 Act under which the authority is entitled to income which can be regarded as coming from three main sources.  Under section 2 of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 1966, as amended by section 1 of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 1971, the authority receives the nett proceeds of licence fees.  Under section 20 of the Broadcasting Act, 1960, it is entitled to receive income by way of advertising and, under section 16 of the same Act, it is entitled to income from miscellaneous sourcess.  The latter section is the one which states that the authority &ldquo;shall establish and maintain a national television and sound broadcasting service and shall have all such powers as are necessary for or incidental to that purpose&rdquo;. The really important section of the Act from the point of view of the finances of RTE is section 24.  Under section 24 the financing of the authority on a broad view is seen as a duty &ldquo;so to conduct its affairs as to secure that its revenue becomes at the earliest possible date, and thereafter continues, at least sufficient (a) to meet all sums properly chargeable to current account and (b) to make suitable provision with respect to capital expenditure&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is useful, I think, at this stage to point out that the authority does not fix the level of its licence fee income. I suppose in the optimum situation the authority might be satisfied if the only restraint on its financing were the stipulation that the service should not be a burden on the Irish taxpayer.  In spite of a widespread impression to the contrary, no public funds were expended on the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority from 1964 to 1971 approximately but, as the Minister said in his opening statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> During 1971-72 a repayable advance of £600,000 for capital purposes was made to RTE from the Exchequer in respect of general broadcasting works.  Apart from a small capital advance for the Ballymun multi-channel communal aerial system, this was the first Exchequer advance made to the authority since 1963-64.</P>
    <P>This is significant because from 1964 to date it can be said that the authority, by and large, carried out its own capital developments largely from planned surplus on current account. This method of providing capital is somewhat unsatisfactory, because having to provide capital out of current account leaves less money for the provision of funds for programme making.  It is a fact, palatable or unpalatable, that the licence fee level is relatively low here by comparison with European standards.  To say otherwise is to go against the facts.  If one compares the daily cost of one's favourite newspaper with the daily cost of one's television programme my point is well taken.  From the middle 1960s to 1969 approximately the financing of the authority was progressive and was carried out, I would say, to the satisfaction of the House and of the authority itself.  We have now, however, reached a situation in which, to put it bluntly, the finances of the authority are not in a healthy condition and the House must face this fact and recommend some way of ameliorating the situation.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with regard to financing is the fact that it is very difficult for an authority, required to provide its capital from current account and from planned surplus, to plan ahead effectively.  The one sphere in which the effect of this is quite obvious is in the decreasing number of home-made programmes now put out by the authority as compared with a few years back.  If one takes the year 1967-68, when the authority was working with a fairly good surplus, the amount in hours of home-originated material was 1,141 as against imported material of 1,061 hours.  If one takes the year 1970-71, when the finances of the authority were not as <Col N="1498" /> healthy, home-originated material accounted for 1,049 hours as against 1,311 hours of imported material.  I put it to the House that there is a cause and effect between these facts. If we wish the station to produce a good proportion of home-originated material we shall have to see to it that the finances of the authority are such as to enable the authority to implement such policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated :</P>
    <P>...The total amount which may be advanced to RTE under section 23 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 as amended by the Act of 1964 is £3 million.  If the full advance of £500,000 authorised for 1972-73 is taken up £2.951 million will have been made available by 31st March next.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Act states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may make advances to the authority for capital purposes (including working capital purposes).</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states that advances under this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  shall be made out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof,</P>
    <P>(c)  shall be made on the recommendation of the Minister,</P>
    <P>(d)  shall be made on such terms and conditions as to repayment as the Minister for Finance thinks proper.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to me that there is great need for long-term planning of the capital programme and I should like to ask the Minister if the authority has outlined its plans to him for the medium term and, if so, has any decision been made in regard to the provision of the £5 million or £6 million required?  The difficult situation of the authority can be seen when one examines the 1971 figure; the excess of current liability at that stage of £1,583,116 over current assets of £996,318 stands at £586,798 and this reflects the authority's difficult financial position.  A few years ago, for example, in 1967, the respective <Col N="1499" /> figures for liabilities and assets were £491,713 and £477,370.</P>
    <P>Referring to section 28 of the 1960 Act we are told that the authority may, with the consent of the Minister, borrow temporarily by arrangement with bankers such sums as it may require for the purpose of providing for current expenditure.  I notice in reading through the reports that the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Suttle, in his Note No. 2 signed on 7th December, 1971, to the accounts of that year states that during the year under review such temporary borrowing exceeded the limit, the bank overdraft being at one point £565,247.3p.  While I understand that under the Rules of the House I am precluded from advocating a change in legislation, perhaps I could draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that there is a difficulty here, that the current figure may, in fact, on investigation be found to be much higher.</P>
    <P>Under section 28 the RTE Authority may borrow for current expenditure only.  What happens if the authority, for example, wishes to purchase equipment in a European country on a system of suppliers' credits which I understand to be a system of hire purchase extended by the supplier instead of by a finance company?  How can this be done on the basis of the cloudy statutory authority of section 28?  Again, I notice that balance sheets down the years have included details of interest charged on repayable advances from the Exchequer under section 23 but the conditions under which these advances shall be repaid have not been fixed.  The figure is a static one which in 1967 was £112,575 and in 1971 was £115,025.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General also refers to section 32 of the 1960 Act, presumably to subsections 10 and 11, which deals with the transfer of property and rights from the Minister to the authority.  These rights were held or enjoyed by the Minister in connection with his functions under Part II of the 1926 <Col N="1500" /> Act.  Section 32 (10) of the 1960 Act says:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance shall, as soon as may be after the establishment day, certify the sums which in his opinion represent the value of the property and rights...</P>
    <P>and under subsection (11), it says:</P>
    <P>...every sum certified under subsection (10) shall be a debt due by the authority to the Minister for Finance and the debt shall be discharged at such time or times, in such manner and upon such terms as the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs determines.</P>
    <P>Year after year, in the accounts for RTE the Comptroller and Auditor General draws attention to the fact that the Minister for Finance has not determined the manner and terms of the discharge of the debt of £249,000 due by the authority under the provisions of the 1960 Broadcasting Authority Act.  This is an unsatisfactory position and I draw the Minister's attention to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that £748,000 of the 1971-72 capital expenditure of £1.75 million was spent on general broadcasting work, mainly the new radio equipment at Donnybrook, but looking at the RTE annual report, 1971, we find that a further sum of £200,000 was drawn from the RTE superannuation fund for capital expenditure, being part of the overall arrangement under which £600,000 in total will be made available to the authority for the construction of the new radio centre.  Section 29 of the 1960 Act says:</P>
    <P>The authority may invest any of its funds in any manner in which a trustee is empowered by law to invest trust funds....</P>
    <P>If one examines the relevant statutory provision of the Trustee (Authorised Investment) Act, 1958, we find trustees are empowered by law to invest in certain funds unless expressly forbidden by the trust instrument and a list of the various securities in which one can invest is given in that Act.  A few examples are Government securities, <Col N="1501" /> securities guaranteed by the Minister for Finance, Bank of Ireland stock, ESB securities, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, securities with Bord na Móna, in real securities in the State. This last mentioned does not entitle the trustee to buy land but merely to invest funds in a mortgage of realty. One can invest in securities of county councils, Dublin Port and Docks Board and so on, or in debentures of any industrial or commercial company registered in the State provided that a dividend of not less than 5 per cent has been paid on ordinary shares in each of the five previous years, or in the Post Office Savings Bank, or British Government securities registered in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of that Act says that the list may be varied by order of the Minister for Finance but before making such an order the Minister must consult a number of specified individuals including a High Court Judge and the President of the Dublin Stock Exchange and the draft order must be approved by each House of the Oireachtas.  I should like to know if, in relation to the expenditure of the money for the radio centre by the trustees of the superannuation fund, the provisions of the Trustee (Authorised Investment) Act, 1958, were in any way contravened? I admit that the relevant document may have been put before this House unknown to me but if not, I suggest that something has been done in this regard based on insufficient statutory authority.</P>
    <P>The major financial factor which sets broadcasting apart is that while it is capital-intensive, injections of capital do not create increases in income. It is, therefore, essential that criteria governing injection of capital must not be based on the more usual commercial considerations governing the terms of investment.  In 1968-69 the authority estimated that in addition to renewals of approximately £1.5 million the capital needs of the broadcasting services would require expenditure of the order of £5.5 million for the six-year period 1969-70 to 1974-75 for such things as the radio building on the St. Andrew's School site, an additional TV studio, film and technical <Col N="1502" /> facilities, completion of TV transmission network, improvement in medium wave radio reception and also, £1 million for colour television development which was seen as a gradual project spread over a number of years.</P>
    <P>According to the 1970 report, page 4:</P>
    <P>The authority considers that the major part of capital expenditure in broadcasting should be financed from revenue.  Borrowing for capital purposes for RTE does not increase income and building up of debt charges on revenue should be avoided as far as possible so that the maximum revenue can be applied to the true purpose of broadcasting, i.e. the making of programmes. The authority should be in a position to generate money for capital at the rate of £500,000 per annum.  The obsolescence rate of broadcasting plant is high and prudent planning for replacement and development requires reasonable assurance of an adequate level of income on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>In the 1971 accounts capital expenditure during the year amounted to £1,073,128 and was financed as to £178,851 from income from internal sources and £894,277 from external sources.  The report says:</P>
    <P>The inability at current level of licence fee and advertising income to earn a sufficient surplus on current account effectively prevents adequate provision being made for essential capital expenditure.  As a result, the reliability of radio and television transmission is now being affected.</P>
    <P>The truth of this was seen when the colour telecine equipment broke down in the past fortnight.</P>
    <P>The 1960 Act gave power to the Minister to pay to the authority the net proceeds of the licence fees.  In practice, the making of the payment has been approved by the Dáil each year through this Estimate under subhead L.1.  During the past decade receipts have shown continuing year to year increases due to growth in receiver numbers as TV viewing was gradually increased.  These increasing <Col N="1503" /> numbers of TV licences enabled Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs to leave the level of licence fee unchanged for many years but we have now reached the stage where the buoyancy will level off.  If the authority are to carry out their functions under the Act we will have to face the fact that more frequent changes in the level of the licence fee will be required.</P>
    <P>I would offer this criticism to the Minister with regard to the licence fee collection: I have noticed the costs of collection are among the highest in Europe.  I calculate the costs are in the region of 13 per cent &mdash;a very high figure which compares unfavourably with the figure of 7 per cent in Britain.  Can the Minister tell us what criteria are used in levying these costs on RTE?  Is there a question of the payment of commission for the collection of licence fees and, if so, to whom is the commission being paid?  What is the explanation for the relatively high deduction from total receipts which results in a net loss to RTE?</P>
    <P>There is another problem here.  In two out of the last four years the authority have been billed retrospectively for shortfall in licence fee revenue as against target.  I should like to know why this is so.  If this happens, how can the authority calculate the exact amount of surplus or deficit?  I am told by the Minister that this year the surplus is a modest £9,000.  I question the reliability of figures arrived at if variations in licence fee income occur from time to time.</P>
    <P>Television was introduced here in December, 1961, and most licences were taken out in January or February of the following year.  This has meant that with regard to collection of fees the early months of the year are extremely busy.  This period of the year is uncomfortably close to the end of the financial year, namely, 31st March, and I would suggest there is a good case either for the change of the date of taking in the licence fee to an earlier point or, alternatively, changing the end of the financial year to 31st July.  There may be administrative <Col N="1504" /> reasons why this is not possible which I do not know about, but I should like to hear the Minister's comment on this suggestion.</P>
    <P>The problem here is that although the annual accounts are published in August, the draft accounts in May might not reflect the true position of the authority.  If the licence fee income is heaviest in the early part of the year and expenditure is heaviest in the latter part, RTE may be carrying a large bank overdraft.  Licence fee shortfall affects the bank position and, logically, affects plans for the rest of the year.  Has the Minister been approached to change the method of collection or have the authority stated they could do the collection with less expense?  If the authority have approached the Minister on this matter, can he state what answer will be given to their request?</P>
    <P>On the last occasion when I spoke on this Estimate I referred to the level of advertising on radio.  I have often wondered what advertisers did before RTE was founded.  I am sure that, like all progressive people, they sought outlets where they could find them.  I think the Oireachtas should spend a little time considering the fact that the aims of broadcasters and advertisers do not necessarily coincide&mdash;in fact, they are different.  The broadcaster's view of advertising is as a source of revenue while the advertiser sees advertising as the method of promoting the sale of his products.  This can lead to a clash between the aims of the broadcaster and the advertiser.</P>
    <P>Obviously the advertiser will pay in relation to the circulation any particular advertising medium can give him and, therefore, there is a direct relationship between audience potential and the rates that can be charged. It is important to stress that it would not be the wish of the Oireachtas that advertisers should be allowed to &ldquo;control&rdquo; or affect to any large degree the content of our broadcasting services.  I suggest that dependence on advertising is too great.</P>
    <P>If one examines the figures in the last ten years since the inception of RTE, one can see the proportion of income directly related to advertising <Col N="1505" /> revenue is up by 60 per cent.  I mentioned, when I spoke on this Estimate last week, that the intensity of advertising is reaching too high a level.  I am not making the case that advertising should be banned, far from it.  In 1960 our predecessors in this House wisely decided that this method of getting revenue, combined with licence fee income, was the best but I suggest that saturation point has been reached.  We are in grave danger that much of the advertising material being shown may be more suitable for more urbanised societies with different standards from those obtaining here. There could be&mdash;and I will put it no more strongly than that&mdash;harmful side effects if the quality of our advertising is not looked at closely.  For example, it is obvious that much of the advertising material shown on RTE is geared towards a British audience.  In fact, recently I heard that certain people in the advertising sphere were dissatisfied with the amount of business which is available for Irish technicians in this area.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from their actions in the last few years that RTE do not consider themselves to be a purely commercial concern.  If it were, it would not have phased out cigarette advertising which it has done over a number of years past, at a loss of something like £400,000 at the rate then obtaining.  There is also the point that advertising of spirits has not been allowed on our station.</P>
    <P>In this regard I would put it to the House that there is a connection between the volume of advertising in any broadcasting medium and the amount of home-made material which can be expected from the station.  As the proportion of advertising revenue increases as against revenue from licence fees, so does the popular rather than the public service content of the station increase.  The reason for this is a thing called a Tam rating document. I am sure Members of the House have heard about it, and I will do no more than refer to that document because people will understand that Tam rating goes into minute details about the popularity rating of individual programmes right through each day and each week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> I am quite sure that is a very interesting exercise but it leads to the question as to whether simple popularity of programmes should be the criterion to guide those who plan programmes and put them out.  I am quite aware of the fact that the authorities of RTE fight very hard to maintain a high standard of public service programming but we would be naïve not to realise that the pressures now on them are very great.  There is the further point that in this country the amount of advertising available for showing on television is not limitless. If we look at the accounts we find that the limit has been reached perhaps. With merging of firms, rationalisation of products, and a keener look at production costs, many firms are taking a hard economic look at their allocations for advertising.  I am not sure that there is much possibility of an increase in this field.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in future the financing of RTE would seem to lie more in the type of financing which will emphasise the public service content. That is all I wish to say about the finances of the authority.  I should like the Minister to deal with some of the questions which I have put to him in relation to the accounts and in particular to the repeated questions which are posed by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish now to refer to the most important aspect of a station's output, that is, the programme section.  Since the inception of this station it has been the privilege of successive Ministers to appoint the authority.  Due to the fact that a Fianna Fáil Government have been in office since 1960 these appointments have been the responsibility of successive Fianna Fáil Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the output of <Col N="1507" /> the station one can rightly say that the responsibility for the programme output, in the final analysis, rests with the RTE Authority.  It would be useful to remind ourselves of a few, what I call, programming constraints which exist in relation to the output of the station.  In the first place, under section 17 the station is required to endeavour to promote the national culture.  Secondly the authority has to function with what can only be described as inadequate finances so that with a certain limit on its licence fee income it has had to rely to a greater extent than is desirable on advertising income, as I said earlier.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it has had to compete with a significantly large area of the State with competitive channels whose income per annum runs well over the £100 million in the case of each channel.  In interpreting its obligations under section 17, no doubt the authority gave some thought to what was intended by the Oireachtas in using the words &ldquo;the national culture&rdquo;.  I do not know if it is of any use to go to the dictionary, as was the custom in the House down through the years, to find the meaning of the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo;.  The dictionary meaning of the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; is &ldquo;the training of the mind, tastes and manners, the condition of being thus trained and refined, the intellectual side of civilisation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In framing section 17 the Oireachtas had a particular view of what our national culture was.  I intend to devote a few moments to reviewing the programme output of RTE against the background of this national culture stipulation.  One tends to judge the performance by RTE of its function by reference mainly to its TV output, but we must remember that the contribution to the national culture and to the implementation of section 17 of the radio section is considerable. The output of the station, I understand, is something like 16 hours per day.  However, looking at the television side of things it can be maintained that RTE television contributes not only to the quality of Irish life but also to a better understanding of it.</P>
    <Col N="1508" />
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be joking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The national culture stipulation in section 17 is phrased in general terms because a more precise definition might have been difficult to formulate.  Let us think about it for a moment.  Ireland is a small nation, as has often been said, beset on both sides by rather powerful Anglo-Saxon cultures, all the greater now because of the spread of communications systems, all the greater now because their effect was not as great in the earlier years of this century and the later years of the past century when the resurgence of the national movement and the Irish revival were in full spate.</P>
      <P>One could dwell at some length on the reasons why the foundation of this State has led, to some extent, to a certain disappointment.  The great movements of the previous 50 years had ended in a rather inglorious civil war. Perhaps the great mistake was that politics and culture had become too closely allied before, so that those who were able&mdash;like, for example, Standish O'Grady &mdash;to give full cultural allegiance to the Irish nation may have been alienated by the then too close alliance with politics.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest to the House that we must be careful in this context not to view Irish culture in too narrow a perspective.  It is not the narrow exclusive thing which some people suggest.  It includes all those elements which go to form the Irish way of looking at life.  It includes an appreciation of the Irish language, of its inheritance, of Irish history and traditions and a consciousness of being part of a distinct nation moulded by various influences, a stream in which the Gaelic, Anglo-Irish and Scots Gaelic elements have mixed, each adding its own enrichment to the whole.  In passing, one could offer the comment that a lot of the potential divisiveness seen in the North of Ireland is less of a religious thing and perhaps more of a cultural one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RTE contribution to the restoring of the Irish language is open to criticism from time to time from those who would demand that more programmes in Irish than perhaps would <Col N="1509" /> gain present acceptance from the viewers be shown.  I shall content myself with saying that the use of the language on television benefits from the conferral of status which any subject depicted on the medium receives from its very appearance.  If I might offer a criticism of Irish language programmes, it is that one should always be careful to remember the statutory injunction in the Act that in presenting programmes in Irish, the relevant personnel remember section 18 which says that the presentation of matters should be balanced and no expression of the authority's own view should be apparent.</P>
    <P>In this regard I should like to pay a tribute to the Irish language programmes we have seen and to say that I think the House will agree that the language has received an increase in status as a result of the showing of various subjects through the medium of Irish on the television screen.  The national culture stipulation of section 17 is also covered by the Gaeltacht radio service, but as I mentioned this on the last day, there is no point in going back over what I said then.</P>
    <P>It is in the field of cultivating a national identity that the station can be a potent force.  Let us not minimise the difficulties confronting us.  Our identity as a nation is in some danger of being submerged in an insipid mid-Atlantic mediocrity by the increasing emphasis on urbanisation and commercialism. I am not suggesting that every modern influence is bad.  It is a sign of a vital living organism if a nation is able to assimilate from outside itself and form afresh by a force which one would characterise as the genius of the race.  Television in my view is the greatest instrument we have in the preservation and enhancement of our distinctive characteristics as a separate Irish nation.</P>
    <P>Speaking of a living vital organism leads me to the next point, that national culture is not a static thing.  It is not a fossilised thing of the past. It embraces all the aspects of our Irish society in this island and to the aspects more usually considered such as literature, art and so on, I would add the living institutions of the State, <Col N="1510" /> legislative, juridicial, governmental, administrative, educational, political and ecclesiastical, and I think it is noteworthy that in an age in which democratic Government has come under attack and in which the media have been used in some parts of the world to undermine the national culture, RTE with some aberrations has done its part.</P>
    <P>The second programming constraint which I mentioned is the financial situation.  It is a fact that imported programmes are cheaper to show than home-produced material and therefore, when a station finds the going hard, it will tend to lessen the proportion of home-produced material shown.  I have already mentioned in another context the tendency of imported material to increase as the financial situation worsens.  Again the type of home-produced material varies in cost, with categories such as drama and documentaries which are costly to produce, suffering as compared with the more easily produced studio discussions which by comparison are relatively cheap.</P>
    <P>The result has been that programmes dealing, for example, with literature, which require visualisation to be meaningful in television terms, and documentary film of many aspects of Irish life have had to be reduced and curtailed.  For example, on the night on which the Green Paper for Northern Ireland was produced, one tuned in to the Panorama Programme to see how they would deal with it and one found that they did not even mention it but they did put on that night a very interesting discussion of the problem of the Palestinian refugees which I would regard as an example of how a particular subject can be tackled and tackled very effectively by a television authority.</P>
    <P>Another effect of the financial constraints has been the effect on the employment of artists who are important for the intellectual life of the community.  It has had its effect on the use of RTE as a training ground for people who would form the basis of an Irish film industry.  We must remember that RTE is not merely a <Col N="1511" /> broadcasting service but the major patron of the arts in Ireland.  It is, for example, the major single employer of musicians and, apart from the Abbey Theatre, of actors.  In other words, financial constraints in the authority are strangling the artistic life of the nation.  I think it is important to pay some attention to this because as a people of three million or 4½ million, depending on your point of view, we are in competition to some extent with our neighbours across the water whose population reaches 55 million.  If we compare the resources of the two nations, we find that ours compares very unfavourably but that does not absolve us from the necessity of trying to do the best we can in relation to our broadcasting services.  We cannot obviously apply quantum measurements in this situation.  For example, if we say that our population is one-tenth that of Great Britain, would it follow that we should be content with one-tenth of the news coverage?  Obviously not, and I put it to the House that given the difference in resources, we may have to do that little bit extra in order to maintain standards at a high level, in spite of our size as a country.</P>
    <P>Further to this, at a point when Ireland is entering Europe and hopefully taking its place, and as we hope a significant place, in that Community, financial constraints have precluded RTE from depicting life in the Community and bringing home to the viewing public the reality of Europe.  My point in this regard will be conceded if we think back to the period of 1967-1968 when the then Director-General initiated moves which led to the excellent series, the &ldquo;Into Europe&rdquo; series.  In a sense, this excellent series was before its time but I think that such programmes are necessary to open up an avenue of exploration into our European heritage and this is an excellent example of a television station being on top of its job and ahead of its time, but, as I say, it also happened to be the period of high financial viability on the part of the authority.  They were fulfilling their role of bringing the public to a higher level of understanding <Col N="1512" /> of an important aspect of life.  A station which is not continually looking into the heart of things may be open to the accusation of leaving the viewers on a plateau of unquestioning acceptance of the <i>status quo</i>.  If this is the case I think the matter will have to be investigated and remedies made.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the financial constraints are easily seen in regard to the important question of Northern Ireland news.  It seems incongruous that affairs of such importance to the nation should be receiving less attention from RTE by way of resources channelled in the Northern Ireland news operation than is the case in regard to the British television services. In saying this I hope nobody will understand me to suggest that I have anything but the highest respect for the personnel involved in that operation.  They are, as I said last week, of a very high standard, comparable with any in Europe.  At the same time, I think resources are not sufficient to enable them to do a job comparable, in visual terms at least, to other channels.</P>
    <P>Even if one were to concede that the Northern Ireland news operation were successful, there is the further question of the news coverage of the rest of the country.  If we are to retain and to increase our self respect as a nation, we must be prepared to provide the resources necessary in this respect&mdash;it is too important a matter to settle for the second best.  We have in the community a press of very high standard, as I said last week, comparable to that of any country in the new EEC.  I put it to the House that it is vital the same standards of comparable excellence should be achieved by our television services.</P>
    <P>The third question in this matter of restraints relates to the necessity to cater for the competition of other stations in a significant area of the State.  The Minister's speech states that RTE's capital expenditure on new works during 1971-72 was about £1.75 million.  This, he said, includes £711,000 on wired television development. Approximately £748,000 was spent on general broadcasting works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> I have a few criticisms here which are intended to be constructive.  In making these criticisms of the present situation in which RTE find themselves, by way of accidental discussion, I will mention how the situation could be improved.  A discussion on the position in which the Irish television viewer finds himself must take as its basis the fact that in this country the viewing time for television programmes is essentially between 6 p.m. and 11.30 p.m. each day.  In this we differ from other more organised societies where urbanisation and industrial organisation exist and where there are workers to enjoy programmes outside the hours I have mentioned.  It follows that if there is to be any extension of broadcasting hours here it will have only the effect of tinkering with the system.  Such an extension would be marginal only.  If we want to have a more comprehensive service we will not get an adequate answer in the extension of the hours of the existing station. I am not referring to incidental, small extensions on, say, a Sunday afternoon.  I am talking about major extensions on weekday evenings. There is no point in producing programmes for the crows: the programmes must have an audience.</P>
    <P>Looking at the present service, I think the first thing that can be said about it is that it is generalised rather than comprehensive.  If we examine any of the categories, for instance entertainment, we find there is not enough entertainment.  If it is an information programme it is not detailed enough.  The entertainment programme is not such that experiment is possible, but if there is an information programme, for instance, there is not enough time to have the programme sufficiently detailed.  Assuming a certain level of educational ability, I am afraid all the programmes start from a certain level.  How do we know, for example, that the educational programmes are not passing above the heads of those whom they were intended for?</P>
    <P>In discussing the question of choice, we should remind ourselves of what I shall call a geographic freak.  It is that half the television set-owning <Col N="1514" /> case for this rests on the following four grounds:</P>
    <P>people of this State can receive three or four channels while the other half are confined to one.  From whichever point we examine this we find it undesirable: it is undesirable for those of us who wish to see our community progress on a unified basis.  Those of us who have given some thought to this are aware of the polarising effect of this on the community where one half is exposed to programmes of British origin and British standards and British interests and the other half are not.  The point is obvious that there could be this polarising effect.</P>
    <P>If we probe more closely we find that in areas of single station, and no choice, there are approximately 350,000 sets and in the multi-channel area there are 150,000 sets.  Of those in the single channel, no choice area, about 50,000 or so, perhaps a somewhat larger number, can be wired economically to a co-axial relay system for reception of outside stations.  Therefore, if one takes the view that the extension of choice could be achieved for 50,000 or perhaps 75,000 homes, somewhat in the region of 300,000 homes would still be deprived of a choice of programmes.</P>
    <P>I do not need to emphasise in the House that I am not hitting at private enterprise here&mdash;far from it.  I wish I had the service myself.  What I am pointing out is that the solution of the problem on a national basis is not to be found by extension of relay systems.</P>
    <P>At this point I wish to draw the attention of the House to a statement in the Proclamation of the Republic that all the children of the nation should be cherished equally.  I think it has some application to the points I am now making, all the more so for those whose roots are in rural Ireland. If we base our examination, therefore, on the limitation of viewing times and the unsatisfactory generalised nature of the service and the necessity of providing equal treatment for all our citizens, one concludes that the solution to the problem lies in the provision of another service which, for the purpose of conveniences, I shall call RTE 2.  The <Col N="1515" /> On economic grounds it is only through the provision of a second RTE service that the many remote and isolated communities, far removed from the major towns, will have available to them a choice of programmes. It would be prohibitively costly for the viewers, even if one could find an altruistic businessman prepared to wire up the whole country, to give choice of programme by that method. I need only hint at the analogous position in which rural dwellers find themselves in relation to the provision of ESB rural electrical schemes to make my point, and the ESB is a State company.</P>
    <P>Secondly, RTE 2 is necessary on social grounds because the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority has, as part of its mandate, to extend the national broadcasting service throughout the community on a basis of equality of treatment for all.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it is necessary because, if there is to be an extension of choice to areas where no choice is now available, it is nationally desirable that editorial control be vested in Dublin rather than in London or Cardiff.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, and related to the third point, it is inconsistent of this Oireachtas on the one hand to insist by statute&mdash;section 17 of the Broadcasting Act, 1960&mdash;that RTE shall bear in mind the national aims of preserving and developing the national culture and, on the other hand, either directly or by acquiescence to allow the situation to develop where RTE has to allow foreign services to be brought in. By directly I mean that RTE is not put in the position, because of capital allocations difficulties, of getting revenue by engaging in the work of provision of relay systems.  By acquiescence I mean that RTE is precluded from making a political case that it is inconsistent with section 17 to engage in the widespread extension of foreign services.  RTE cannot get up and make a political case that the Minister is permitting this situation to develop which is against the express provision of a statute of this House.  It could be accused of political partisanship. But the case can be made in <Col N="1516" /> this House and this is the place to do it.</P>
    <P>One might concede the case so far on the questions I have raised but still remain unconvinced.  This is easily understandable because if the case rests simply on the points made so far and omits mention of programme content, to that extent one might be accused of having no regard to the most important consideration of all. All the background argument in the world falls down if it is not squarely based on matters of programme content. In discussing the benefits which would flow from this I wish to offer a criticism of the present situation. What benefits would flow from the provision of such a service?  A moments reflection brings home to us that one of the drawbacks of the single channel service or the single channel no-choice area of reception is that very often the most worthwhile programmes are missed by the viewers.</P>
    <P>I remember the praise which was given&mdash;and rightly so, I am told&mdash; to a programme in which the artist Seán Keating was discussing an art exhibition.  I believe he turned in a virtuoso performance.  There was another programme more recently which I missed, a &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme on the drug problem.  There are other programmes which would spring to the minds of Deputies immediately. The problem with a single channel service is that, for obvious reasons, there is no possibility of engaging in repeat performances of worthwhile programmes except on very rare occasions.  I remember a programme I saw recently which won the <i>Prix Italia,</i> the Martin Cluxton programme, which I thought was an excellent one. If I had seen that on the first occasion I could have turned on to another programme on another channel when it was shown again but not so the person who is confined to a single choice.  He either switches off or sits through the same programme if a repeat is shown.  In other words, a single channel generalised service cannot easily show repeat programmes, programmes of merit which one might like to see again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> A further consideration I would put to the Minister in relation to the present situation is what I would describe as a difficult national situation. I am not referring to the North of Ireland.  I am referring to the rate at which change is occurring in the community.  The population is being inundated with Green Papers, White Papers, EEC documents, proposals on higher education, IDA regional plans, our own recent proposals about votes at 18, and constitutional amendments. Given the present straitjacket in which the authority finds itself, it cannot devote a large part of an evening or even of a succession of evenings to these important topics.  Referenda are being brought in now with such frequency that they are in danger of being treated with a degree of familiarity which assumes that what is being proposed is acceptable and good for the community.  I know that we in this House do our best to tease out the issues but is there not a case for the proper and full discussion of these various national interests on our television station?  If, as I shall mention in a moment, in another context, it is the function of television to stand critically apart from the society in which it operates, then under its present conditions RTE cannot do the job satisfactorily.  The kind of information service which the community deserves cannot be forthcoming to the degree of detail and interest which I suggest is necessary for the discussion of these problems.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, we had a second channel, we could afford to examine in more depth the national questions which are exercising the minds of the people.  This is because we could escape from the generalised nature of the present service which must not do anything which would alienate substantial <i>blocs</i> of viewers. To take an example of specialised areas of, say, agriculture, these cannot be examined to the degree necessary if our farming community is to understand, for example, the problems of accession to Europe.  Even if farming programmes were scheduled for a substantial period of time there is the question that they might not be of interest to the whole community.  One <Col N="1518" /> could cite urban problems which might not necessarily interest the rural viewers.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, conclude that the decision to provide a choice must be made and made as quickly as possible. Apart from these informational requirements we have also got the educational needs of the community.  We are in a period of change.  The demand for information is great.  There is also the need for educational material for different groups in society.  We hear a lot of talk by economists and others about adaptation, the problems of small farmers, small industries, specialised and exposed industries. There is then the great question, which is exercising the minds of European educationalists, the problem of adult education, of what the French call <i>éducation permanente</i>.  I am not advocating a channel with a didactic intellectual highbrow character.  Not for a moment am I suggesting that a second choice must be all Mahler and Mansholt.  I am suggesting that RTE be given the opportunity of programme discrimination in respect of various groups which cannot now be catered for in the existing service.</P>
    <P>Another consideration which I think is important and which will no doubt commend itself to the Minister and many Members of the House is the very laudable interest which the average Irishman has in sport.  I do not agree with those people who disregard those of us who find great pleasure in looking at the various types of sport we see on television.  In fact, it could be stated that as a nation we are probably more sport-conscious than many but there is a difficulty that large segments of sport do not lend themselves readily to showing on a single channel if only for the reason that as an eminent golfer is about to drop a putt into a hole you cannot break for advertising or if another eminent person is about to score nobody can say: &ldquo;We will stop here and put on an advertising slot.&rdquo; Therefore, sport does not lend itself easily to the requirements of a single-channel service with frequent advertising slots.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the example of what happens on radio on Saturday <Col N="1519" /> afternoons.  The channels divide and on the medium wave you have sport and on the VHF wave you have music or drama.</P>
    <P>The service I am suggesting could run alongside the present one during peak viewing times from 7 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. and initially a seven-day service would thus require about 24 hours viewing time with a possible close-down in July and August when viewing is light.  The home-produced content would form a substantial part of the output while programmes of merit from the existing foreign channels could be used to supplement the output. Nothing I have said so far should be taken as suggesting that any restriction be placed on those private commercial concerns which are prepared to provide a relay service.  I can say that a number of times because one is often subjected to selective misquotation which I regard as a form of intellectual dishonesty.</P>
    <P>This is obviously a free country and if such people are prepared to offer facilities to willing customers all praise to them.  What we must keep constantly in mind is that we in this Oireachtas have responsibility to all our citizens to face up to a decision in the near future as to whether we content ourselves with allowing an extension of choice to a further urban segment of the population, good though that may be in itself, without catering for the needs of our rural dwellers.  We should remember that a significant majority will be left if we do not face up courageously to the decision which I have outlined which will see that all parts of our community get a fair chance of service.  I would like the Minister to consider those aspects of criticism which I have made of the present service and to see if he could meet me to some extent in some of the points I have made.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another aspect of the present service which may not spring immediately to the minds of Deputies but which is of extreme importance in relation to the RTE station's output or to that of any other station for that matter.  I refer to what is called &ldquo;competitive scheduling&rdquo;.  In <Col N="1520" /> situations where television stations are in competition it has been observed that audiences tend to watch one or other channel right through the evening. A controller of programmes is, therefore, anxious to capture as large an audience as possible for his channel. He can do this in a number of ways. Firstly, he can build up a viewing loyalty to his station's output which induces in the viewer a tendency to try his product as a matter of first choice. Secondly, he can put on popular programmes early in the peak viewing period after which, given the nature of the medium, the viewer, as has been observed, will tend to stay with him to view the next programme.  In comparison with a political campaign in which the masters of that art know that to peak later is better than to peak too soon.  It is desirable in television terms to peak early because the television controller who gets his audiences early will, in the ordinary course of events, for various reasons which would take too long to explain now, hold them.</P>
    <P>In many cases a programme of public service content, however excellent it may be, may tend to lose viewers.  This point could be developed at great length but I do not intend to do so except to suggest that there is a pressure on programme controllers to emphasise the popular and minority programmes are sometimes left to find a non-peak slot in the late evening.  Now, given the necessarily generalised nature of RTE's output and the requirement of putting on important public service programmes of less popular appeal it is evident that in competition with outside stations our national service is fighting with one hand behind its back. If one examines the position of the BBC with its two programmes one sees immediately the ease with which that organisation can achieve internal complementarity and at the same time be externally competitive.  By internal complementarity I mean that if on one of the organisation's channels a public service programme is being shown on the second channel a more popular one can be shown.</P>
    <P>I suggest that our television service must be put in the position in which <Col N="1521" /> it will be able to enter into the competitive scheduling race with a little more ease so that it too can achieve the facilities of internal complementarity and external competitiveness. Such a situation would require the services of a controller of programmes on RTE 1 and RTE 2 with a coordinating controller whose mandate would be to secure the complementarity and competitiveness I spoke of. While I cannot prove the following point I have a feeling it is not too far from the mark.  I hold the view that competition between rival organisations on television tends towards similarity of programme output, towards a lessening or lowering of standards, perhaps, or to an emphasis on the less-worthwhile type of programme.</P>
    <P>Competition, on the other hand, between units of the same television organisation leads to a raising of standards. At any given moment what is popular is likely to be capable of easy anticipation.  Television authorities wish to attract as large a proportion of the audience as possible.  A station in RTE's present position will be orientated towards mass appeal.  Even if there were not present the requirement of satisfying advertisers, there would be the ever present categorical imperative of professional communicators, that is, to reach the largest audience possible.</P>
    <P>If a second choice is to be offered to the public from within the national broadcasting system, communicators can afford more easily at times to disregard that imperative because it can be taken for granted that a second service output is likely to be of a public service nature or at least there is the possibility that greater discrimination in favour of viewers is possible on whichever channel the public service interest programme is broadcast.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is interesting to be aware of what happened across the water when Independent Television found themselves faced with a competitor who had this choice to offer. We notice that their answer was to stress the local nature of the 13 constituent stations.  The tendency to exploit that local interest to the full was their method of trying to provide <Col N="1522" /> the extra facilities which their competitors had achieved by the provision of a second service.</P>
    <P>I turn now to some technical aspects of the question, aspects which can be achieved within the framework of the 1960 Broadcasting Act.  This Oireachtas will have to face the technical questions involved, keeping in mind the existing statutory provisions enshrined in the 1960 Broadcasting Act and statutory obligations which we laid on the shoulders of the national broadcasting service.  Provision of choice could be effected by allowing RTE or some other group to set up a transmission system or systems to pick up and broadcast outside signals.  The first factor that springs to mind in this regard is the enormous cost that would be involved in doing this.  Secondly, if done by RTE, it would give rise to the totally anomalous position in which the authority would be engaged in cutting its own throat apart altogether from the expressed will of the Oireachtas as contained in the stipulations of the 1960 Act.  For example there would be the difficulties of copyright and extra payments to foreign actors' unions, to mention only two factors.  Thirdly, to allow commercial interests to engage in this activity of transmission would be to hand over to <i>entrepreneurs</i> the profit-making possibilities in a field in which successive Governments have guarded jealously the rights of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I have spoken already on the wired relay system and have drawn the attention of the House to the point that any extension through this method would have the effect of giving a choice of programme to urban centres with consequent disregard of the more remote areas.  Already, I have mentioned the ESB analogy but there is no need to labour this point.  If one sees the solution to the problem in this avenue of wired relay systems it might be pertinent to ask who will wire Kenmare, Newcastlewest, parts of Tipperary and other parts of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The technical problems involved in providing a choice of programmes to the whole community can best be met by authorising RTE to develop their <Col N="1523" /> own technical system.  This would require seven stations&mdash;four VHF and three UHF.  Some cost would be involved in re-equipping the studio at Donnybrook and there could also be integration, with provision of coverage, into the whole Northern Ireland area from the new transmitter that is to be set up near Clermount Cairn, Carlingford. I suggest that this be done as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>Approaching the matter from the financial point, apart from the initial cost, there would be the question of the method of financing the station. Desirably the cost of setting up the service would be by way of repayable Exchequer advances such as we have had during the past ten years.  I would suggest that running costs be paid for in a similar manner as at present, that is, by a combination of advertisements and licence fees.  The Minister must be aware that periodic adjustments will be required if our television services are to execute properly the function that we require of them.  I am not advocating nor am I allowed to advocate the raising of the licence fees but I am realist enough to know that at some point in the next few years it will be necessary to raise the level of licence fees.  I am suggesting to the Minister that, as he will have to make a case for the raising of the fee at some time in the future, it would be much better to be able to offer viewers something for their money such as RTE 2 service which I have outlined in my remarks.</P>
    <P>I have said that advertisements should be carried on both services. The reason for this is that the national pool of advertising is limited and RTE share a given <i>quantum</i> of this with other media.  If we had the situation of advertisements on one channel and none on the other, there would be a danger of schedules of public service or minority interest programmes losing money but as between the two programmes, RTE's share of the total revenue would be maintained.  In relation to advertising the law of diminishing returns obtains.</P>
    <P>The quality of our television station's output is determined to a <Col N="1524" /> great extent by the moral of the organisation.  Under conditions which I have outlined I would foresee a dramatic improvement in the climate of opinion within the station.  There would be better opportunities for drama and documentaries, which programmes could thrust a little more deeply into an examination of the problems of our society.  There would be less time constraint.  There would be a lessening of pressures and, probably, there would be a more spirited and higher quality output.</P>
    <P>RTE are now in a trapped situation because the amount of time available to them is limited.  They are trapped also by reason of the programme &ldquo;mix&rdquo; being constant.  Deputies need only refer to the proportions devoted to the various categories during the last few years in any of the RTE reports.  The share given to news, drama, <i>et cetera,</i> is fixed because of the exigencies of a single channel service and because of the necessity of providing a generalised service.  On the other hand, if we were to open up to them opportunities by the departures I have suggested, we could have extra home produced programmes with a striking increase and boosting of morale.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to a related point, that is, the provision of a colour television service.  Very often RTE are criticised because their programme content does not contain a high level of colour transmissions.  Some understanding of the problems involved leads one to place RTE's present achievement in perspective.  There are three stages by which a broadcasting organisation gears itself for colour television: first, by showing imported series; secondly, by doing outside broadcasts in colour and, thirdly, by originating studio material in colour. In relation to the first stage I mentioned, it is interesting to note that one-third of the imported series now goes out in colour on RTE.  This has resulted in the purchase of telecine equipment.  I should imagine that it is difficult now to buy black and white equipment because of the changes taking place in the industry.  In a sense the decision to introduce colour has been taken out of the hands of RTE <Col N="1525" /> in that, if rival stations have it, we must have it also.</P>
    <P>The second point I mentioned was in regard to the outside broadcasting unit.  Of the two at present at the disposal of the station one is in colour and is used, as Deputies may know, for sporting events such as the Sweeps Derby, the Aga Khan Trophy, the All Ireland Final and so on.  Since some of these events are relayed outside the country it is obvious that they have to be done in colour.</P>
    <P>It is in the third category of studio-originated material that the least progress has been made.  The importance of this may be underlined if one remembers that, if the Taoiseach or any other prominent member of the Government or the Opposition were, for any reason to give a news conference on, say, a British channel, that interview would come across to the British viewers as a black and white interlude in a colour news programme.  That simple illustration would point up the necessity for a thorough look at this problem.  In any event, the basic problem is this, that if RTE is going to have to pay for expensive re-equipment they might as well go for colour, and after 11 years or whatever it is, of service some of their equipment must now be obsolete.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if, in relation to his powers, he has put any restriction on the number of hours of colour television broadcasting and, if so, what are the reasons for these restrictions.  One reason for a restriction is obvious: given that sets must be imported, I could see a strain on the balance of payments situation.  This country is not sufficiently endowed with nature's resources to be able to expend large sums of money in this regard. However, given that the Minister has referred to the Ericcson project for the provision of telephone equipment to be produced in this country, is there any possibility that some similar firm might go into the production of colour television sets?  Not that I advocate a wide extension of these&mdash;there are probably other priorities&mdash;but if they have to be produced for those who want them could they not be produced in this country rather than be adding to the balance of payments situation?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> Briefly, I want to refer to the RTE Authority's functions in relation to education.  It has been stated many a time that the function of television and of broadcasting in general is to provide information, entertainment and education.  A moment ago I referred to the necessity for adequate provision for adult education viewed in the light of what the French call <i>l'éducation permanente,</i> continuing, lifelong educational programmes for people, continuing, lifelong development of the imagination, of critical attitudes to life, of broadening human experience, to which TV can contribute so much.</P>
    <P>It is the aim of most services to reach those who may have been left out of the educational race in the normal instructional sense.  Experience shows that those most in need of such a service avail themselves of those services, perhaps, to the smallest extent.  I referred earlier in my remarks to the question of choice of programme, and I stated that instructional programmes are increasingly desirable for groups in our community, and there is no need to repeat what I have said.  In the field of educational television RTE acts as an agent for our Department of Education, and it is well that we should understand precisely what happens in these cases.  RTE translates the wishes of the Department of Education into broadcasting terms at a cost of £80,000 per annum.  However, if progress is to be made the tentative co-operation of the last few years must be replaced by policies on a firmer footing.</P>
    <P>In this connection there is obviously need for new thinking, firstly, for the provision of new facilities as required; secondly, for the extension of the hours of broadcasting, particularly with educational requirements in mind.  I would exempt these from the comment I made earlier that extension of hours is not fruitful; it is obvious that it is fruitful in relation to specific educational programmes beamed at individual groups.  This extension of hours of broadcasting is a ministerial function and I should like the Minister, when replying, to let me know if it is his intention to make this extension.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is a need for a clear <Col N="1527" /> directive from the Department of Education as to its policies and priorities. It is proper public policy to beam programmes towards the post-primary level, but I wonder if the House can continue to be satisfied with the present situation in which educational programmes on television are not beamed to the primary level of education. I leave that for other Deputies to take up if they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>An interesting development in the general field is the development of the video cassette which enables programmes to be recorded and used at times to suit the class schedule rather than the schedule of the broadcaster.  This, as any practising teacher would know, is a vitally important development, because the hour of broadcasting of educational material may not be the one to suit a particular educational establishment.  If the programme can be captured on a recording machine, a video cassette, not alone can it be shown at times suitable to the establishment in question but it can be stopped at various places and times for elaboration by the teacher on the subject content of these films.  It will be agreed that it is vitally important to be able to pause at given points in a programme to elaborate and explain more fully.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude this section of my remarks with a brief reference to open university projects.  The Government should give some attention to the Irish requirement in this field.  I understand that the enrolment of Irish students for the open university courses on the BBC channel has not been possible, but a close eye should be kept on developments in this field. Come to think of it, entering into this particular field would be one way in which a second channel could justify its creation.</P>
    <P>I now wish to speak more generally about the television service.  As I mentioned earlier, we discuss in the Dáil under subhead L.1&mdash;Grants for General Purposes equivalent to Net Receipts from Broadcasting Licence Fees&mdash;the whole subject of television broadcasting.  I think the time has come to examine in some depth the place of television in our society&mdash;this <Col N="1528" /> particularly because I understand the Minister has set up a committee which is to advise him during the next 12 months or so about the problems which now beset our television service.</P>
    <P>The first point I should like to make is that, historically, this Oireachtas has taken the view that the ultimate responsibility for the broadcasting services should rest with Oireachtas Éireann.  In the earlier years of the State this was necessitated by technical limitations in that there were very few frequencies available to broadcasters and the matter was determined by the 1926 Wireless Telegraphy Act by which the Minister was given sole power to acquire and establish broadcasting stations and to maintain and operate them.</P>
    <P>In 1960, the Oireachtas decided to set up a public authority to operate the television service.  This Act marked the handing over from the Minister to an authority constituted as a trust in which, apart from the responsibility for regulating hours of broadcasting and power to direct the authority under section 31, it was left to the authority to get on with the job of making programmes. Section 31 says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class and the Authority shall comply.</P>
    <P>It would be fair to say that the Oireachtas envisaged that this power would be in the nature of a reserve power only to be used if the public interest so required.  If the power had to be exercised either the authority was failing in its duty or if it was not failing in its duty the Minister would have committed an error of judgment in exercising his function in putting on a section 31 notice.</P>
    <P>Before going on to refer to the recent and only exercise of this ministerial function, I should like for a few moments to make some general comments by way of placing television in its context as a public service.  It can be accepted that television has evolved as the means by which communicators keep a close eye on the political process and on politicians in <Col N="1529" /> particular.  It is a service which in most countries is worked by people of a left-of-centre temperament who are concerned professionally to examine critically the society in which they operate.  Their field is the field of the creative and as a group they are not necessarily representative of a cross-section of the people taken as a whole.  They are marked by a desire for self-expression and, as I said in another context, their imperative is to communicate.  In particular, they seek to give expression to problems which have not yet found expression in the political field and to dissipate the cozy apathy in which politicians flourish.</P>
    <P>One effect of this has been that television practitioners are emerging as a fifth estate standing over against society, fulfilling with their colleagues of the press the vital function of continuing scrutiny which is essential to the exercise of democracy.  As a profession they derive their rights to function, not from the politician though he may seek to regulate the exercise of their rights, but directly from the society which they serve.</P>
    <P>I would therefore disagree with what the late Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, said in October, 1966, after a rather trivial dispute concerning the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Minister in question complained to the Telefís Éireann newsrooms and the NFA statement was omitted from later bulletins on that occasion.  Our society generally attacked the Minister and the Government at that time for his interference and it occasioned a reply given to this House in October of that year which is quoted from the Official Report, Volume 224, column 1045 and quoted in Senator Professor Kelly's book.  I quote the former Taoiseach's statement.</P>
    <P>Radio Telefís Éireann was set up by legislation as an instrument of public policy and as such is responsible to the Government.  The Government have overall responsibility for its conduct and especially the obligation to ensure that its programmes do not offend against the public interest or conflict with national policy as defined in legislation.</P>
    <P>To this extent the Government reject the view that Radio Telefís <Col N="1530" /> Éireann should be either generally or in regard to its current affairs and news programmes, completely independent of Government supervision... it has the duty while maintaining impartiality between political parties... to sustain public respect for the institutions of Government and, where appropriate, to assist public understanding of the policies enshrined in legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  The Government will take such action ... as may be necessary to ensure that Radio Telefís Éireann does not deviate from the due performance of this duty.</P>
    <P>As I shall mention later in my remarks and as Senator Professor Kelly mentions in his book, no one will disagree that radio and television should not offend against the public interest but the latter is not synonymous with the immunity of Government policy from criticism, a point which I will take up later.</P>
    <P>I have said that the practitioners in television derive their right to operate and function in their profession directly from society and the politician also derives his title deeds, if I may so put it, from society, but his mandate differs in important respects from that of the television communicator.  If only to mention one point, the politician or the public representative is responsible for the good ordering of society and the maintenance of the institutions of State. The 1960 Broadcasting Act was the response of Oireachtas Éireann to the very difficult task of compromise between the rigid ministerial control of the pre-1953 period before certain changes were made and a state of broadcasting autonomy which very few would advocate.</P>
    <P>A furious debate rages as to the power of the television medium.  On the one hand, it is said that television merely reinforces attitudes already in existance in the viewer, that the effect on behaviour is minimal after a period of four to six years, as was outlined in Belson's book, <i>The Impact of Television.</i> On the other hand, there are complaints that television leads to violence, that the camera is never <Col N="1531" /> neutral, that there is an inevitable tendency to simplify and distort, that there is an emphasis on the dramatic, which in itself is a falsification.</P>
    <P>Whatever be the truth of the matter, politicians as a group are wary of television and seek to control it in ways which would never occur to them to employ with a non-broadcasting news medium.  If we compare the following statutory provision in section 18 of the 1960 Act with the editorial freedom of the press, the point will be seen:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the authority's own views.</P>
    <P>Think for a moment of a statutory injunction to editors of newspapers couched in those terms and we see immediately the fundamental difference between the two media.  It is in these very fields of information, news and features that television fulfils its essential public service role.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned its role in the field of education and in the field of entertainment.  These, oddly enough, are not included in section 18. It is in the field of information that the public service responsibility of the station is most clearly seen.  Traditionally, it has been assumed that a free press is essential to the proper functioning of democracy.  In our increasingly complex modern society television broadcasting is increasing in influence to the point at which, as I have said, it may be regarded as a Fifth Estate providing the necessary channels of information which help society to function.  It is clear that it is in the area of information that politicians are most tempted to intervene.</P>
    <P>It is natural, I suppose, in a situation in which many people in broadcasting began their careers as journalists that they should be conscious of the journalistic ethos and, from <Col N="1532" /> that point of view, it should be fruitful to examine for a moment any differences which may be said to exist between the exercise of the profession in the broadcasting medium as distinct from the written media.  The greatest difference I can see is that press journalism operates in an ethos of freedom. Television journalism, on the other hand, operates in an atmosphere of constraint which contrasts with the relatively wide-open-space atmosphere in which collegues in the press operate. If I were asked to give a quick answer as to the differences, I would say that they could be expressed in terms of &ldquo;image&rdquo; and &ldquo;idea&rdquo;.  I should hasten to add that, as a lay observer, I do not pretend to be able to give definitive views on these matters.  However, it behoves us to try to come to grips with the essentials.</P>
    <P>Television can be said to be a paradoxical instrument in that it combines the twin characteristics of tremendous impact and ephemerality. The ephemerality of television is obvious.  Each night's contribution fades into the air.  Only a small <i>quantum</i> of material is recorded for future reference in the field of news and current affairs.  The impact of television renders necessary some public statutory involvement in the exercise of its power, but television's essential ephemerality means that, unlike the press, where one can refer back to the previous printed message, the effect of the television message is instantaneous.  Its influence is measured in terms of impact/image rather than the reflective/logical apprehension of often complex ideas. If the Minister wants to know what any of his friends or enemies are thinking about all he has to do is read back over the newspaper files or the reports of this House.  On the other hand, what is said about him in broadcasting has to be caught on the wing.</P>
    <P>There is a further aspect in that television is a relatively new phenomenon in society, a phenomenon to which no organised community has as yet fully adapted. There is also the undeniable fact that there is a conferring of status in the expression of views on television, irrespective <Col N="1533" /> of whose views they are or by whom expressed.  It follows from that that a heavy measure of responsibility rests on those who select any particular item for discussion.  There is no set of rules to guide those involved and we have to rely on the good sense of professional broadcasters to act with a proper respect for the power of the medium through which they operate. It is in this connection that I wish to refer to the operation of section 31.</P>
    <P>On 18th November of last year during the discussion on this Estimate the Minister said:</P>
    <P>On 1st October, following the appearance of members of an illegal organisation on the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme, I invoked section 31 of the Act and directed the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any matter of the following class, i.e., any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means.</P>
    <P>In referring to the circumstances which led to the implementation of this section I want to examine a little more deeply the events and circumstances surrounding it and to point some areas of concern.  Viewed from any standpoint, it is noticeable that continual contention is a feature of the television condition.  Given that television is peopled with those who are by temperament creative, searching, liberal and left-of-centre, if I may use that phrase, there is bound to be from time to time pressure from below, pressure which I would explain as pressure from producers to experiment, to try out the dramatic, and, to endeavour to give greater insight into problems.  The great imperative of these people is to communicate and those in the authority who have to make judgements, having refused a particular request for a programme to discuss a particular problem on three or four occasions, may come to question the basis on which they continue to refuse the request and, on any given issue, those in control will probably say to themselves: &ldquo;If I am in doubt I should put on the programme&rdquo; rather than: &ldquo;If I am in doubt I should keep it off&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> Further to this, there is the situation in which people engaged in the control of programmes may be preoccupied with non-programming matters. They may, for example, be haggling with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs about finance.  They may be dealing with trade unions in relation to matters concerning their members. They may be running from one meeting to another.  Whatever the situation, it could happen that in some circumstances, due to pressure and lack of time, errors of judgement may be made in allowing certain material to be shown.  There is also the related point that our television practitioners have an <i>entrée</i> to other journalists and creative people in other media, particularly in the press.  In those circumstances people who refuse to put on particular programmes may be classed as &ldquo;right wing&rdquo;, conservative and so forth.  It is obvious that these upward pressures in television must be counterbalanced by other pressures from organised society if a reasonable equilibrium is to be maintained.  These counterbalancing pressures are essential if the station's output is not to move too far ahead of its viewing public and organised society has the duty to exert an influence to ensure that institutions of the State are safeguarded from unfair attack.</P>
    <P>In saying this I am not to be understood as stating that an exposé of social ills such as money lending or the problem of speculative building in our cities is an attack on the institutions of the State.  Programmes dealing with housing problems, for example, can be discussed without any great effect one way or the other on the national interest and we must be careful not to confuse the interests of any party which may find itself in Government with the national interests.  It is obvious that in societies in which these pressures which I have outlined are equalised the television service most readily fulfils in a responsible fashion its unique and essential role in the community.  At another point I intend to refer very briefly to the area of authority and director-general activities which in many ways can be regarded as the junction box where <Col N="1535" /> these pressures are, perhaps, most in evidence.</P>
    <P>Previous debates on this issue have referred to the circumstances in which section 31 came to be used.  The House might like to reflect that the Taoiseach, as constitutional leader of this State, went to Chequers to meet his British and Northern Ireland counterparts and returned.  What was the first response of our national television service?  It was to put on persons whose avowed aim is to overthrow the institutions of the State.  I think this was an error of judgment but the question is: did it merit the full rigours of a section 31 directive?</P>
    <P>The first thing which must be done in this area is to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, ordinary social and economic and even political problems which engage the attention of the public and on the other, the matter which was the subject of the directive. I have spoken in this House before&mdash; from recollection, on 3rd March, 1971 &mdash;on the important question of the extent to which our educationalists in previous decades, perhaps, unwittingly, placed over-emphasis on the physical force tradition in our historical evolution to the unnecessary downgrading of the importance of the constitutional case.  It is idle to pretend that in regard to this question of physical force the Irish body politic is other than in a position similar to that of a haemophiliac; scratch the surface of constitutionalism in this country and you expose the patient to problems of serious political ill-health.  A whole area of our history in recent times was filled with echoes of Thompson guns and it is only 16 years ago since members of the Minister's party walked in funeral procession behind those who had adopted a self-inflicted mandate in relation to the then existing problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>One effect of Partition has been the unfortunate tendency towards political in-breeding in this part of the country which has led to unhealthy political symptoms in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Between haemophiliacs <Col N="1536" /> and in-breeding we are a terrible lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often wondered whether in September, 1971 the use of section 31 was motivated not merely by the Government's desire to do what it considered to be its duty but also more significantly to quell within its own ranks the effects of the haunting echoes of former decades. However, nobody can say in relation to this matter that this party ever wavered from its duty whatever the political consequences.  I say that by way of placing in context the qualification which I wish to make to the approach which has previously been made by this House to section 31.  I should like to put to the House that the subversive case, if I may so call it, is easily stated and assumptions that a counter case can be effectively made must be open to question.  I say &ldquo;effectively&rdquo; because I hold the view that television disputation differs for reasons I have already given from, say, <i>viva voce</i> debate before a live audience or controversy in the printed media.  I say &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; because nationally important things may be treated as mere issues for debate rather than as problems the solution of which is of high national priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Television disputation with these people is no substitute for orderly participation by them in the institutions of the State and it is not in the public interest if the national broadcasting service by a disproportionate and too frequent exposure of those views lends its aid, however unwittingly, to those who would subvert our institutions.  There is a sense also in which television lends itself to simplification and falsification of issues.  The reasons for this could be teased out if one had time.  For example, the dramatic presentation of views is in itself a falsification.  The question of our Northern Ireland problem and its related background is a complex one which requires meticulous attention and balance which I may say it receives from very many eminent Deputies and Senators of this Oireachtas and from other commentators.  We must think of the position of the viewer who <Col N="1537" /> is faced with the discussion of these issues.  Unlike the discussion before a live audience there is the possibility of questions by the participant, the television viewer is not in a position to say: &ldquo;Stop there while I think about this point&rdquo; or &ldquo;Could you refer back to the point you made previously?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is the related problem that if a person is subjected to too stringent questioning on television we may run into the classic phenomenon of the underdog position, the principle of which is that if a public figure is, shall we say, put through the wringer he attracts a certain sympathy to his person which on reflection might not be afforded to his arguments.</P>
    <P>I have put it to the House that programmes dealing with this particular matter may appeal to those whom, as I suggested earlier, may for historical reasons, be predisposed to listen with greater sympathy than is generally thought likely.  Further, even if the counter-arguments are lucid and persuasive is there not the danger, as I have pointed out, of the operation of this underdog phenomenon so that a person might attract sympathy in the way I have mentioned?</P>
    <P>Having made these qualifications, it is necessary to say that, on balance, one must come down in favour of allowing discussion rather than keeping these problems off the air.  There is the point of view of those who say that if our political dissenters appear on TV they may be seen for what they are and not for what imagination has made them out to be.  The case can be urgued that members of political organisations as distinct from militaristic groups&mdash;if such a distinction is possible&mdash;should be allowed to put their political viewpoint so far as it relates to the great social and economic issues which agitate society.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the sudden slapping on of section 31 is not without its dangers and I shall refer to some of those later.  I should like to warn the Minister that in this difficult national phase there is a danger we may legislate or use legislation to deal with what are, hopefully, <Col N="1538" /> transient phenomena but in relation to which, if we are not careful, the effects will remain after the casual factors have ceased to operate.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Oireachtas in 1960 did not advert to the possibility that section 31 once used might be allowed to remain, to fall into disuse only through the passage of time.  I would remind the House of the legislation in connection with the state of emergency in 1939 which still remains with us.  We have liberal traditions in regard to the freedoms of association, the Press, speech and so on, which may be in danger of being eroded by our legislating for transient phenomena that, taking on a character of permanence, may not in the long term be in the interests of the community as distinct from the interests of the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>Measures of the kind taken by the Minister should have an expiry date, or at least provide an opportunity for periodic review, not as infrequently as the annual debates on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I call on the Minister when he is replying to this debate to take up the onus I am putting on him.  He should give the House a reasoned case for the continuation in effect of the provisions of section 31.</P>
    <P>To help him I suggest that the criterion to be used is his estimation of the extent to which the RTE Authority, in the interpretation of a vaguely-worded and imprecise directive, have responded in a manner fully consistent with their public service responsibility. Would the Minister not agree now that RTE have received the opinion of the Oireachtas they can be expected to fulfil their role of trust to the public in relation to the institutions of State?  To continue the imposition of section 31 is, in effect, to say to the authority whom the Minister has appointed as his co-trustees that he does not trust them to carry out their responsibility.</P>
    <P>It seems to me the Minister and the Government are in the position analogous to that of a GP who is faced with the outbreak of a virus disease which he is either incompetent or unwilling to diagnose correctly.  In such <Col N="1539" /> a case the doctor prescribes a broad-spectrum antibiotic.  Section 31 is the Minister's broad-spectrum antibiotic. I will diagnose the disease for the Minister.  The Minister may have seen references recently in the newspapers to the 'flu virus that is spreading; there is speculation whether it is the Hong Kong A.57 or 68 virus.  I will tell the Minister that the virus in our society which section 31 is designed to combat is well documented.  It is known as A.22/23, A.34, A.56 and A.70/72 but it is susceptible to more discriminating approaches than it has received from the Government.</P>
    <P>I pointed out earlier that it would be desirable if the Oireachtas were involved in a periodic review of section 31.  The desirability of such a review arises from the fact that use of this directive places RTE firmly in the political arena.  RTE are not, or should not be, the preserve of the Government of the day.  RTE are a national, vitally important institution but they should not be viewed in the terms of the statement made in this House by Mr. Lemass in 1966.</P>
    <P>The Government are responsible for the security of the State but that power is exercised in Parliament in an overt manner.  For example, in previous sessions we debated and voted on a Prisons Bill but the debate and the voting was open.  Opportunities were afforded to debate the pros and cons of the matter in the House but in the case of section 31 this is not how things were done.  What one objects to here is the covert nature of the continuing supervision of the implementation of section 31.</P>
    <P>Section 31 is sufficiently important in relation to basic freedoms and to the ability of television to report on a grave national situation that its periodic review on a non-party basis is warranted until the time arrives when it is thought appropriate to withdraw it.  In a democratic society broadcasters must accept the superior powers of Parliament.  As agents of society they will be controlled in some measure by representatives of society. As far as I know, broadcasters do not object to this or seek an autonomy <Col N="1540" /> that would enable them to act as they please.  If broadcasters are as intelligent as I think they are what they must seek is that the exercise of control be openly exercised in this Oireachtas and not by the clandestine pressure of executive Government. As Lord Hill, governor of the BBC, said in an important contribution recently: &ldquo;liberty is not often clubbed to death in broad daylight but rather it is dismembered in silence and in the dark&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to meet me in this debate.  Section 31 is a sufficiently important utilisation of a statutory function, originally intended as a reserve power, to warrant the laying down of procedures of a non-legislative kind for its continuing exercise. We require a statement from the Minister of his intention to narrow the effect of section 31, to make it more precise and specific.  I am sure it he has any difficulties in this regard he can consult the Minister for Justice who is giving his attention to legal difficulties in this field.  Secondly, we require a statement that he is willing to give us an expiry date, or at least a date by which he will come before the House for a renewal.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we require facilities for periodic review in which the House could participate, if necessary by means of a Select Committee. Fourthly, any comment, interpretation, criticism or implementation of the directive should be given in writing and copies thereof placed before the House or a Select Committee thereof.</P>
    <P>I am aware that section 26 of the Act gives the Minister the right to require the authority to submit to him such information regarding the performance of its functions as he may, from time to time, wish to receive.  I am also aware that this may lead, from time to time, to pressures on the phone, or <i>per alios</i>, but there is nothing we can do about this.  As Lord Hill said in his important contribution, pressures are to be welcomed if honestly made but these pressures should also be honestly resisted.  I submit to the House in regard to section 31 that we are not in the position envisaged in section 26 <Col N="1541" /> in which the Minister can communicate with RTE any time he likes. We are in a different area, an area in which for the sake of the proper use of this reserved power the consent of all Members of the Oireachtas should be sought towards its utilisation.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude my remarks on television by referring to the area of the authority which is equivalent to a trust set up by the Minister to carry out specific functions laid down by this Oireachtas.  It is obvious that the point of contact between the authority and the Director-General is the point at which the quality of the services of the television station is determined.  The members of the authority are in the position of trustees but they are part-timers, appointed by the Minister of the day to a position similar to that of trustees for the public.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to enter into a discussion on the political affiliations of members of the authority.  I do not think that the tendency to appoint individuals to represent minority interests is necessarily the best method of appointment.  In one sense, the authority can be said to be a veritable mosaic of minority representation.  It seems to me that this method of appointment is less effective in the overall production of a public service television output than the appointment of persons on an individual basis for their strong-minded, independent attitudes.</P>
    <P>A moment's thought should show us that the Director-General in relation to the authority is the professional among amateurs in the broadcasting sense.  The Director-General is subjected to the upward pressure of the creative people in his organisation.  On the other hand, the authority brings to bear the view of the man in the street about the station's output.  I should imagine that the effectiveness of the authority is the extent to which it can persuade the Director-General to its point of view.  I should like to know what happens at these meetings, but, unfortunately, one cannot get that kind of information.</P>
    <P>For that reason I suggest to the Minister <Col N="1542" /> that there is room for the appointment of an advisory council to which the authority or the Director-General or both could turn for advice.  Section 21 of the 1960 Act would seem to have foreseen this necessity.  It was utilised in the setting up of Udarás Radio na Gaeltachta.  Section 21 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of enabling the authority to have advice in performing its functions, the Minister, after consultation with the authority, may from time to time appoint advisory committees or advisers.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) provides that a committee under this section shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister or by the authority.  Subsection (4) provides:</P>
    <P>The authority and the Director-General shall have regard to, but shall not be bound by, the advice of any committee or adviser under this section.</P>
    <P>The appointment of such a council would in no way detract from the statutory responsibility which the authority carries for the supervising of the broadcasting service.  It would be a channel through which the viewers might discuss broadcasting problems.  In the setting up of such a council the Minister might consider the advisability of including members of a Select Committee of this House but on no account should such an advisory committee be a mosaic of minority interests.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking the other day about Radio na Gaeltachta I suggested that if any further dealings with Comhairle Radio na Gaeltachta were required, and since that council was an advisory one under section 21 of the Act, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would be the appropriate person to deal with matters concerning the Gaeltacht Radio and not the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  If, as the Devlin Committee on Review of Public Service Organisation suggested, the present Department of the Gaeltacht should be subsumed in a new Department called the Department of National Culture which would also take over the various other cultural activities, including RTE, I submit that given the very close ties which exist at the moment between RTE and the <Col N="1543" /> Department of Posts and Telegraphs the appropriate combination of Departments, if any amalgamation is suggested in future, would be a Department of Communications and Culture and not a placing of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the Department of Transport and Power and giving RTE to the Department of National Culture.</P>
    <P>I am not allowed to develop this point and I do not intend to do so because it would be against the Rules of the House.  Suffice it to say that the ideals of section 17 of the 1960 Act would be greatly facilitated if the Minister responsible for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were, in the words of Devlin, to be the one whose assignment would be the overall responsibility for all aspects of national culture of which the Irish language is one element, the other aspects of national culture being broadly grouped under the headings of heritage, the arts, cultural media and recreation. I cannot do any more than suggest to the Government that they should read pages 311 to 315 and 368 to 376 of that report.</P>
    <P>It is about time that the activities of this Department were subjected to a close, critical and I hope constructive scrutiny.  There is a sense in which I envy the Minister his portfolio.  At the moment it is a portfolio of tremendous potential for the development of the Irish nation.  I wish him and his Department well in the performance of their functions.  I want to record the receipt of many personal favours and attentions from the Minister and his Department.  I regret that I held up the House for a long period. It is not usual for me to speak at such length.  If one looks up the record one will see that over a period of three years I have not detained the House very long on any occasion.  I wish the Minister and his Department well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the principal Labour Party speaker appointed to speak on this Estimate, I want to congratulate Deputy Burke on what can only be described as a comprehensive, very thoughtful and well-prepared shadow contribution.  It is <Col N="1544" /> important to remember that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs employ some 22,000 people and that RTE now employ several thousand Irish people.  Dáil Éireann has, I think, been unduly neglectful over the years in analysing and putting forward political views to the Minister of the day on the administration of his Department.  This Estimate debate, therefore, has had an auspicious and welcomed commencement.</P>
      <P>My contribution will be limited to two aspects, the telephone services and the future role of RTE.  I want to draw particular attention to what one can only describe as the decline in the telephone services of the State and to point out to the House that we are now reaching a critical crossroads in the effectiveness of these services.  The Minister's speech is a straightforward admission that the quality of the telephone services has deteriorated and that the future programme of telephone installation does not look too bright.  It is an admission that after 15 years of direct party political responsibility, a solid 15 years of Government responsibility, for the development of the telephone services, the situation now is, if anything, worse than it was eight or ten years ago.  There has been a complete failure on the part of the Cabinet to appreciate that the demand for telephones each year in the past decade has been running well up to 10 and 13 per cent growth and that demand for better and more effective telephone services has not been met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the House that the starvation of capital by successive Fianna Fáil Cabinets for the telephone services has led to a marked lack of spare capacity within the system and this is a very serious situation. Our spare capacity in the telephone services now, I am assured on all sides, is at the lowest point in the history of the services.  I am equally assured that the extent of overloading of the existing telephone services, the extent of overloading of the exchange services and of the trunk plant, is also at a very critical point in the development of our national communications system.  It is no wonder then that letters to Members <Col N="1545" /> of this House and to the newspapers contain a growing number of complaints by subscribers and callers over the past two or three years.  It is not just a question of delay in installations; it is not just a question of lack of capital.  It is simply that the growth in demand has in itself outstripped the capital made available by the Government over the past four or five years in particular.  I suggest to the House that the provision of the extra trunk circuits which have been made available and the major new trunk schemes which have been made available in recent years in no way matches up to the growing need, the tremendous explosive demand, in respect of telephone services which is very evident throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would go even further and say that the economic and social services, the industrial services, of the State are suffering because of the ineffectiveness, the growing clogging ineffectiveness of our telephone services.  I have the highest admiration for the Post Office engineering staffs involved.  I consider that they are working under a starvation of capital and under, if I may say so, a rather antiquated management structure in the Post Office engineering sector.  This is my personal assessment of the situation and I think that as a result the staffs are not being given the opportunity to avail of long-term planning techniques which certainly should have been given to them by the Government over the past decade.  I therefore point out that if the planned industrial development of this country is to take place effectively and if we are to have effective regional development, we must have a parallel massive extension of our telephone service.  It is no consolation whatever to current industrialists in many parts of this country to find that IDA grants are available to them, that training grants may be available to them, when in fact the telephone services available to them and indeed in some areas the telex service which admittedly has improved considerably, is substantially below par and below what they may expect in America, on the continent and for that matter in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister is, I think, a little <Col N="1546" /> naïve in coming into this House and sounding the alarm bell which he sounded at page 15 of his contribution last week.  He was quite frank in his admission.  He said that the greatest of the difficulties was the shortage of capital&mdash;the failure to earmark sufficient capital for telephone purposes for the necessary number of years ahead.  It is a clearcut admission by the Minister that as far as his influence within the Cabinet is concerned, he may as well be talking to President Nixon about it as talking to Minister George Colley.  It is obvious that the Department of Finance has no very great intention of making available the urgently required additional capital for the Department beyond what was given in the Budget last year and in the Supplementary Budget subsequently.</P>
    <P>One got the impression from reading the Minister's speech that he is publicly going down on his knees askng for more capital.  He said:</P>
    <P>... it is an absolutely indespensable requirement that works be planned five to ten years ahead so that sites may be got, buildings erected, exchange equipment manufactured and installed and cables provided well in advance of demand.</P>
    <P>Yet all those urgently stated requirements are falling farther and farther behind and it is therefore not enough for the Minister to come into the House and state the obvious, that they have failed miserably to provide the capital. The Minister must come in and accept the political responsibility for this failure.  As far as we are concerned, Ireland should be much more highly developed telephonically and at this stage the intensity of public demand is just not being met.  Therefore the public admission by the Minister of the failure of his administration is an indictment of his political presence in Parliament. It is also an indictment of the situation in which the Cabinet have traditionally regarded the portfolio of Posts and Telegraphs as a rather junior Ministry.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that successive Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs have regarded their political role as simply holding a portfolio out of which they <Col N="1547" /> hoped for larger pastures in the Cabinet, with better promotional prospects, having served an apprenticeship in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. This is rather an unfortunate political attitude.  I am afraid that Fianna Fáil Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs have not regarded their portfolios as matters of special responsibility. Rather do they regard the portfolio as a means of getting jobs for the boys down the country.  The position of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs seems to have been one of ensuring that in whichever county the Minister comes from jobs will be made available, temporary post office jobs. Indeed, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs spends a good part of his working day making sure that this happens and interviewing various Fianna Fáil deputations in regard to the appointment of a sub-postmaster in a townland in some remote part of the country.  That is the extent of the real contribution made by holders of the portfolio of Posts and Telegraphs here in the past few years.</P>
    <P>Occasionally we may have some rather esoteric contribution from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He may announce the issue of some European or Europa stamp.  I am afraid that is the political role of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I suggest that the present Minister would be far better employed putting the screws on the Department of Finance for the extra £8 million or £10 million urgently required by his Department rather than spending most of his time with his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Lenihan, trying to carve up the new constituencies for the next general election.  I believe that onerous job has devolved on himself and Deputy Lenihan.  Of course that is not within the scope of his portfolio or of my contribution here this evening. We will come to the question of the gerrymander later on.</P>
    <P>It is no pleasure for me or any Deputy to be unduly harsh on any Minister but the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and his predecessor, Deputy Lalor, the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;he <Col N="1548" /> should never have been taken out of Posts and Telegraphs because in my opinion he has done an appallingly bad job in Industry and Commerce, a portfolio beyond his capacity, and if one regards Posts and Telegraphs as being an inferior role in the Cabinet, one in charity should have left him there&mdash;would have been better employed in trying to get urgently needed capital for that Department. I say this with the comment that one has to be a bit tough on Fianna Fáil Cabinet Ministers because in my three and a half years here I have not been impressed by what I have seen opposite.</P>
    <P>We must place on record that the telephone services here are deteriorating. The morale of staff operating the services is slowly declining and the answer to the problem is an injection of £10 million, £15 million or £20 million in order to bring back the telephone service to its proper communications role.  It is not any consolation to be told, as we were told by the Minister, that in Britain the backlog in respect of new telephones is approximately 300,000&mdash;I have not got the precise figure.  Incidentally, that figure must be taken in conjunction with a population of 50 million. Here the backlog is in the region of 22,000 persons awaiting telephones in a massive telephone list.  The Minister, therefore, has a serious political obligation to get down to do his homework, to put pressure on the Department of Finance to make available urgently-needed capital requirements.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise one or two specific matters on the Estimate.  I would ask the Minister to review the system of appointing sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  Most dissatisfaction in this sphere lies with those who never got those jobs, but that is not an excuse for the widespread public belief that in order to obtain such an appointment in the public service&mdash;it is a public service appointment on contract&mdash;one must be an ardent supporter of Fianna Fáil.  That is a national belief and who am I to dispute a national belief?</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify the position. There should be an objective <Col N="1549" /> assessment of the system of appointment of sub-postmaster and sub-postmistress throughout the country.  If the Minister for Local Government admitted in public, under intense pressure by Opposition Deputies, that the system of appointing rate collectors was one of rank party political corruption, then we must examine other areas of public appointment in Irish life.  I have been pointing to an area which is the responsibility of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in which an examination is overdue so that these appointments will not be made by ministerial sanction but rather by an open system of selection and examination. This would clear the air in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I cast no reflection on those who hold posts at present but I think they would welcome in the national interest a different system of appointment.  This feeling would be universal within all political parties.</P>
    <P>Another aspect I wish to refer to is the continuing lack of political rights of public service employees, and if there is any section of public service employment which is so disgracefully discriminated against in regard to civil rights it is that of Post Office employees. Of the 22,000 employees in the Post Office service one can say that 18,000 to 20,000 should have full political rights in the Republic of Ireland. Such employees in Northern Ireland have civil and political rights.  They have civil and political rights which they may exercise in Britain as well.  I think, therefore, we in the Republic of Ireland have a bit of a &ldquo;neck&rdquo; lecturing Mr. Whitelaw and Northern Ireland on the civil and political rights of public service employees when we are not prepared to grant it to Post Office employees.</P>
    <P>It is a public scandal that a man working in the engineering division of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs may climb a pole and fix a telephone and if he climbs down from that pole and joins a political party he loses his job by virtue of departmental edict, while an ESB employee who climbs a pole and fixes a light, when he climbs down again he may join a political party, stand for Dáil Éireann <Col N="1550" /> and get elected to Dáil Éireann.  He may get leave of absence from the ESB and he will not suffer any political disability.  I believe, therefore, that the protracted negotiations between the official side and the staff side within the conciliation and arbitration system should be brought to finality.  The matter should be clarified without any further messing on the part of the Department of Finance or within the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I would ask the Minister to brief the House on the up-to-date position in regard to the negotiations between the staff side and the official side because I feel rather strongly about this.  I believe that the current situation is entirely anomalous.  It is a denial of the civil rights of Post Office employees to exercise normal political involvement without discrimination against them.  I do not think we should delay any further on that matter.</P>
    <P>On this Estimate, when considerable criticism of the telephone service is voiced, one should pay tribute, in fairness, to the Department and the staffs involved in what can be described as a generally satisfactory and generally competent, efficiently administered, postal service.  I have been Labour Party spokesman on Posts and Telegraphs for three years and in that time I have received only two minor complaints from the public in respect of the postal delivery services in this State.  They are remarkably good and the staff, under very difficult conditions in many cases, working in premises which are very often inadequate, have done a remarkably good job and deserve the thanks of this House, something which they do not often get from the Members of the House.</P>
    <P>I want to pass now to RTE and the future role of RTE and telecommunications generally in the State. I welcome the setting up by the Minister of the Broadcasting Review Committee. It is over 12 years now since the broadcasting authority was established and it is ten years since our national television service commenced. While substantial progress has been made during that period in the development of sound broadcasting <Col N="1551" /> and the television services in this country, I am pleased, nevertheless, that this general review is under way. The committee are doing a very exhaustive, in-depth analysis of current and future needs in respect of television and radio services.  I might make the point&mdash;it is a party political point and a legitimate one&mdash;that our party are the only party which made a submission to the Broadcasting Review Committee.  I have no doubt that Deputy Burke's contribution will be read by the members of that Committee with great interest.  I would urge him, if I may, to go to that body as we in the Labour Party did.  We went before that committee and stated our views, giving written and oral evidence.  It is not to the credit of the Fianna Fáil Party particularly that they made no submission whatever. It shows the permanent insulation of power that it is not even deemed necessary that the Government party, as distinct from the Government, should convey their views on the future of the national radio and television service.  We made a submission and gave oral evidence as well.  We found the experience to be most enlightening for us and we trust that our views proved of some consequence to that body.</P>
    <P>I shall point out to the Minister the general views I hold in respect of RTE. The whole radio and television service is now at a national crossroads.  One must take into account a number of features that cause serious public disquiet. The first is that RTE are in an extremely precarious financial position at present.  One must also take into account that relations between the RTE Authority and the Government and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are, to say the least, generally strained.  This is an understatement, if anything.  One must take into account the fact that the morale of the staff of RTE is now at a rather low ebb.  It seems to me, and to many outside observers, that there is a good deal of administrative confusion within the management structure of RTE. It is also alarming to note that there seems to be a quite substantial drift away from RTE by the viewing public, <Col N="1552" /> particularly on the east coast.  This has grown very considerably in recent years.  Meanwhile we see the pressures on RTE mounting, particularly the pressure for full colour viewing.  That pressure is growing in the community to a considerable extent.  RTE might well be the authors of their own misfortune by virtue of the fact that now advertisers want increasingly to display their goods in colour and RTE do not seem to be effectively equipped to deal with colour.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that virtually all the satellite and Eurovision international transmissions are now presented in colour, but RTE is again caught in an extremely difficult situation. As a nation we have failed to take into account that because of our extremely limited national resources we at best can afford only a fairly modest and rather limited national television service.  We have also failed, in our assessment of what one would call the strategy of a national television service, to take into account our very close proximity to Great Britain: RTE is in an extremely inividious position and is faced with British television, which is generally regarded on the international scene as being the best television service in the world.  That is not a very pleasant thought for the RTE staff to face.</P>
    <P>Britain has three multi-channels. There has been very large expenditure to provide these services.  There is a much more sophisticated development of colour.  In Britain television is operated in a much more densely populated area which is easier to serve and is more remunerative in terms of licence fees than is the case in the Republic.  This is a very great difficulty facing any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the RTE Authority in the presentation of a television service. Unless the Government, the authority and the Houses of the Oireachtas face up to the great problems now facing RTE it could well mean that in the late 1970s RTE would have such an audience &ldquo;haemorrhage&rdquo;, that it would have to compete against the three British channels with such intensity for audiences, particularly on the east coast, that it could quite <Col N="1553" /> easily find itself in dire financial straits and much worse than it is in at present.</P>
    <P>We have to consider the whole future role of the RTE Authority and the future role of the Oireachtas and how to get to grips with the situation. One way is by setting up something like a national communications commission or board, not necessarily related to RTE.  We need something along the lines of the Canadian federal system, which would have overall national responsibility not just for Radio Telefís Éireann but for radio technology in this country and which might well encompass areas of the Department of Transport and Power, particularly the State radio services of that Department.  This commission would encompass the various channels of television which will develop in the future, not just in the 1980s, but in the more distant future when we will probably have a multi-channel cable system here.  We will have the problems facing us of the cost of colour television, the financing of television, the role of education in our television service, the &ldquo;university of the air&rdquo; and the national television service beamed into the primary schools of this country as distinct from the post-primary television service.  We will have a greater number of local radio stations and we will have the growth of Radio na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, in a situation where one will have radio, television, the development of cable television, the massive problem of the financing of television technology and the State radio services, we need to make special plans.  The Minister should set up, possibly on a State sponsored basis, a national communications commission and the RTE Authority and the Radio na Gaeltachta Authority should be abolished. They should be replaced by an overall national commission responsible for the multisided areas of radio, television, cable, colour, education and university developments in those areas. One has got to take into account the future role of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in this regard.  I believe the relationship which now exists <Col N="1554" /> between the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the RTE Authority is unduly close.  It is excessively narrow in scope and we will have to see a situation developing where the future role of a national communications commission will be rather separate and distinct from the functions of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I believe the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has more than enough on its plate with responsibility for the growth of telephone technology, telephones and postal services, the development of telex services, that its Civil Service oriented hand should be removed from RTE.  The role of RTE and questions concerning radio and television should be removed from the formal control of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I do not suggest that ministerial responsibility should be excessively diluted or abolished.</P>
    <P>We should consider the relative independence of the BBC in Britain and of the Canadian structure.  This is what we should develop in this country.  I do not see the close interlocking of the RTE Authority and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs surviving the 1970s and the 1980s.  I believe that a good deal of fresh thinking in that regard will prove my proposition to be reasonably fair and objective.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider setting up an informal all-party Dáil committee on the matters I have mentioned. I am serious in suggesting the abolition of the RTE Authority and its replacement by a national commission of communications which would have a multi-sided functional nature, and that applies also to Radio na Gaeltachta.  If we are to have a mature democracy and if we are to practise participatory democracy&mdash;we all pay lip service to it but none of us is prepared to practise it because we are all rather authoritarian in our personalities: we like to have sole control, and such authoritarianism has great dangers&mdash;there should be some consultation between the Minister and the various political parties before the appointment of members of a future national communications commission. <Col N="1555" /> Consultation might not have necessarily any statutory function but a select committee of the Dáil should at least have the opportunity of the same kind of approach as happens in America whereby, for instance, various committees vet and consider the qualifications of judicial appointments in America.</P>
    <P>In our case the final say would rest with the Minister and with the Cabinet but it would be a useful extension of democracy if we had a select committee of that kind on broadcasting.  It would provide also an opportunity for Members of the House to keep themselves informed of such developments. It is most unsatisfactory to expect Deputy Burke, as spokesman for Posts and Telegraphs on behalf of his party, or to expect his Labour Party counterpart to come here and make a once-and-for-all annual contribution to an Estimate of such major importance as this, to cover every aspect of the Estimate. It is impossible for anyone to do so.  There should be a select committee of the House, which would meet frequently and which would discuss in public if necessary such aspects as colour television and have placed before it information from the RTE Authority and from the Department as to various cost factors, <i>et cetera</i>, so that the committee might convey to the Minister their views in relation to, say, multi-channel demand in certain parts of the country or the development of local radio networks.  All that type of interdiscussion between Members of the Oireachtas should take place in a less formal, less frigid and less political atmosphere than at present. It could take place in an atmosphere where the intricacies of technological innovation could be explained to Members and assimiliated by them in a more normal manner.</P>
    <P>That type of Dáil Committee might present the opportunity of discussing different aspects of policy with, perhaps, the Director-General of RTE, with the director of Radio na Gaeltachta, with the secretaries and assistant secretaries or with the engineering or communications division of the Department. The proceedings could be recorded <Col N="1556" /> and the minutes made available to the public.</P>
    <P>Of course, all this would mean extra work for the Department but it would be better to have this kind of situation rather than have the tendency whereby debates in the House are based on personal likes and dislikes for individual radio and television programmes. Looking back on the Estimate debates since the initial debate on the setting up of the RTE Authority, they have tended to be more stimulating on matters of personal taste in regard to television programmes rather than on an annual review in depth of the legislative framework of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would suggest that a select committee of this House on communications meeting regularly, at least quarterly, would provide a much more constructive and valuable opportunity to Members of the House to make their views known generally.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal now with section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.  I listened with great interest to Deputy Burke's erudite analysis of the situation and I agree broadly with some of the reservations he expressed.  I think the Minister will agree with me, privately at any rate because it seems to be dangerous for any Fianna Fáil Minister to be seen to agree with a member of the Opposition, that I could hardly be regarded in Dáil Éireann as being a supporter or advocate of violence. Neither am I a supporter or an advocate of those who would, by means of violence, change the democratic institutions in this country.  However, I have one major reservation regarding section 31 of the Broadcasting Act. It is my contention that where either a written or a verbal communication of any kind is delivered by the Minister under this section to a public service broadcasting agent of the State, and particularly where the Minister imposes a ban; he should be obliged by statute to lay any such communication immediately before Dáil Éireann and place it on record. This is imperative and I would like to see the section amended in that area.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister <Col N="1557" /> also that as it stands, the section is extremely broad and does not contain what one would regard as essential pre-conditions or safeguards in the national interest.  It is merely a three line section which states that the Minister may direct the authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matters of any particular class and that the authority shall comply with the direction.</P>
    <P>In 1960 it was not, perhaps, envisaged that the Minister would be obliged, in connection with the Northern Ireland situation, with issues of violence and so on, to implement the section as he is being forced to do.  However, it would allay a good deal of anxiety both within the broadcasting media and within the Houses of the Oireachtas if one had the Minister's assurance that these directives in writing would also be placed before Dáil Éireann in the form of statutory notification and that an opportunity would be given for a discussion on such matters.  It is undesirable that on a matter of such national importance a Deputy should have to put down a Parliamentary Question, thus making it a political football at Question Time.  Such a serious matter should be formally notified to the Dáil which, under an Act of the Oireachtas, is entitled to have the fullest possible information on such an issue.  The second point I would make is in relation to section 31 which reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may direct the Authority in writing to allocate broadcasting time for any announcements by or on behalf of any Minister of State in connection with the function of that Minister of State, and the Authority shall comply with the direction.</P>
    <P>Again, a full notification should be given to Dáil Éireann of all occasions when Ministers of State avail of the national broadcasting service.  This is a sensitive area.  In 1973 we shall have the local elections and a Presidential election.  Most likely there will also be a general election in 1973.  There will be such things as budget contributions by Ministers and party political <Col N="1558" /> broadcasts.  Therefore, when Ministers of State avail of the broadcasting service and it is a public service broadcast it should be described as such.  Rather than that there should be some surreptitious insertion in the news either on a PRO basis or otherwise, it should be formally laid before the House as direct information.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the comments I have made in relation to section 31 of the Act, I wish broadly to support the view that no broadcasting service should be impartial or objective in regard to the advocacy of violence either by individuals or organisations. It is not expected, for example, that the RTE television or radio service should be impartial or objective about religious intolerance.  It is not expected that RTE should be objective or impartial about the advocacy of racial prejudice in our community. Therefore, there should be no exemption in respect of the advocacy of violence even if our State was born in violence and even if the current situation within the island is one of violence.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for anybody, either a politician or a news media presenter, to support violence as a solution to the current problem.  There is the glamour of the gun, the glamour of the political hijacker or of the gun politician&mdash;and there are such people &mdash;who will use Parliamentary democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will conclude that part of my speech by stating that I agree with the general view expressed at considerable length by Deputy Burke, that there is a major responsibility on what he described as the media presenters to ensure that opportunities are not provided on the services for the advocates of violence in our community, while one cannot ignore the reality of violence in many instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pass on to another matter that I shall deal with very briefly, the question of commercial channels.  From <Col N="1559" /> time to time, the introduction of commercial radio or television channels has been suggested.  There are enough Irishmen around to know what a printing press is.  The introduction of commercial radio and television has been correctly described as a licence to print money.  I do not think the House should fall into that danger. By and large, where commercial television and radio have been introduced it has proved almost impossible to exercise effective public control over such channels and in the long run they have simply become a handy way of making a cool few million pounds a year for the owners and in most cases have proved to be entirely objectionable.  We are fortunate in that the present Minister&mdash;I would not say as much for his predecessor&mdash; is very much opposed to the concept of what I describe as money printing commercial radio and television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence that we have to date, particularly from Britain and America, suggests that these commercial stations deteriorate very rapidly into gross commercialisation and are of little real value to the country and that in the long run the introduction of commercial television or radio in this country would have a deleterious effect on the existing services and would completely destroy any hope of effectively financing them. I want to place on record the Labour Party's opposition which we conveyed very strongly to the Broadcasting Review Committee in our recent submission. I would point out that the <Col N="1560" /> Fianna Fáil Party made no submission. Neither did the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>I am telling the truth.  I am making the point that we strongly oppose the introduction of commercial television and we made that view known to the Broadcasting Review Committee and I trust the other political parties will support that view.</P>
      <P>Another point I would make is that the precarious financial position now facing the authority is not fully appreciated by the House.  There is increasing dependence on advertising revenue which has a distorting effect on the subject of programmes and programme schedule.  I understand that 50 per cent of the revenue of RTE is derived from advertising and that may go up to 60 per cent.  If this trend is allowed to continue RTE will continue to lose its audience, as it is losing its audience along the east coast.  Viewers switch over to BBC programmes.  This is happening to a much greater extent than either the authority or the Minister is prepared to admit.  If there is growing dependence on advertising revenue and loss of audience, the financial position of RTE will become critical.</P>
      <P>Unless the authority is given sufficient income for the necessary updating of equipment and to meet the requirements of the European Broadcasting Union and to meet its international commitments, the authority will find itself in more severe financial straits.  There is urgent need for an examination of the proportion of commercial advertising on RTE and to examine simultaneously the financing of our national broadcasting service.  I emphasise that point because I believe that the future financial needs of the authority will have to be effectively met by the Government.</P>

      <P>In relation to Northern Ireland this House has what I call a split personality.  Everybody demands&mdash;I was guilty of this myself &mdash;that we should extend RTE transmission into Northern Ireland.  When the RTE Authority was set up it was set up on a Twenty-Six county basis; it was a television network for the Republic.  From December, 1961, to November, 1972, nobody from Northren Ireland was appointed to the RTE Authority.  In terms of national reunification, our aspirations and desire, and in terms of the various statements and declarations of intent by the Taoiseach. opportunity might have been taken to grasp the nettle and appoint at least one member of the RTE Authority from Northern Ireland.  That nettle was not grasped and we have now to consider the future of television in the context of, to use a hackneyed expression, the Irish dimension.  There will have to be negotiations between RTE and BBC/ UTV on the establishment of a national television network.  You cannot do that by having RTE transmit into Northern Ireland.  There must be an entirely different approach. It will have to be a joint RTE/UTV/BBC television transmission.</P>

    <P>There is serious need for some thinking on social and cultural co-operation North and South.  The ideal way in which to commence social and cultural co-operation and communications co-operation in the truest and most practical sense would be through the medium of joint operations on the part of RTE/UTV/BBC Northern Ireland and the Republic. Even if national unity evolves, transmitting RTE into Northern Ireland will just not be on because the overwhelming majority there, Catholic and Protestant alike, will still want <Col N="1563" /> multi-channel colour BBC/UTV Northern Ireland programmes.  I would hope, in time, to see the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs here going to Belfast to discuss with the head of UTV/BBC Northern Ireland television joint programming and reciprocal arrangements for the whole island.  If that can be done with Eurovision surely it can be done with Northern Ireland.  I hope to see a change of Government and a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;taking the initiative I have suggested.  The important thing is economic, social and cultural co-operation.  It is in that context national unity will ultimately evolve. These are the real implications of unity.</P>
      <P>Let politicians be under no illusions. The people in Northern Ireland will not willingly give up their multi-channel colour television.  They certainly will not give it up in return for an extended RTE network.  I do not want to labour the point unduly. The Minister knows the problem. The erection of a new television mast close to the Border to beam more programmes into Northern Ireland will not provide a solution to the problem.  We must avail of the communications media, North and South, to build mutual trust and respect, the kind of thing which was reflected in the Minister's magnificent contribution recently on Northern Ireland at a commemorative service in the South of Ireland.  That is the kind of sentiment we must translate into action. It can be translated into action in the context of co-operation between RTE and UTV and BBC Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other points I would make include the suggestion, which we reiterated before the Broadcasting Review Committe, that there should be a second non-commercial TV channel to provide for educational public services and for the cultural needs of the nation.  I strongly urge the setting-up of such a second channel which could be a major medium for adult and general public education.  I would not <Col N="1564" /> regard it in any sort of semi-elitist setting but rather as a public service channel where, for example, matters of importance to the consumer and also matters of regional importance on the educational and cultural fronts could be discussed.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to consider setting up local radio stations throughout the country.  It is not sufficient to have Radio na Gaeltachta.  I see no objection to having Radio Limerick, Radio Cork or Radio Dublin.  Must we depend exclusively on the &ldquo;Here and now&rdquo; programme, excellent as it is each morning on RTE with little inserts slotted in from Cork or Limerick?  Why not have local radio stations?  I regard the development of such a network, which I strongly suggest should be within the RTE network, envisaging Radio Dublin, Radio Cork and Radio Midlands as a very necessary piece of regional broadcasting development.  We talk a lot about regionalism but practice none except, perhaps, where we might call, in the case of education, an institute a regional college of technology.  If we want to practice regionalism we should begin in such areas as the broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>I am not exactly familiar with the situation there but I gather that in countries such as Denmark the national voluntary organisations get public service time; that churches have their annual conferences broadcast: that political parties virtually come out over the air.  In Britain, for example, one saw large chunks of the party conferences of the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Labour Party broadcast on a public service basis. There is no reason why local radio could not provide that sort of facility here.  Why could not the Credit Union of Ireland movement have available to them as a public service half-an-hour per week to present their programmes? Why should Macra na Feirme or the Irish Countrywomens Association not have the right to present their own programmes as a public service facility through regional networks?  In Denmark, Holland and Belgium this kind of facility is available. In that way you open up life <Col N="1565" /> democracy and communication.  People begin to talk to one another and come out of their shells by means of radio and television.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We might have fewer politicians but we might have more real people and this could be of considerable importance.  I am just throwing out the idea where I think it should be discussed, in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I further suggest that when the Minister comes to revise the Broadcasting Act he should consider amending it to provide for what one might call greater worker participation within the authority and the radio services. Deputy Burke rightly said that those who work in the media are very frequently persons of a creative bent, not easily subjected to Civil Service forms of expression on radio and television. There is a great need not only to meet the temperaments of those who work in the media but to get rid of the Civil Service structure we have in television and radio.  There is need for greater consultation and industrial democracy within the management structure.  I submit that the classical industrial relations set-up we have in radio and television does not meet the needs of those participating because television and radio production is essentially a team effort and greater consultation at all levels is necessary. There should be far wider range of consultation with the trade unions involved, and I am certain that this would prove to be a major national benefit.</P>
      <P>As regards the appointment of the Director-General, I would remove from the Broadcasting Act the requirement that the Director-General of RTE must be given prior ministerial approval before he takes up office.  The Act should be amended in that regard.  The Director-General should be employed by the national communications commission which I am proposing should be established and the RTE Authority should be abolished.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to transgress the Rules of the House by proposing legislative amendments but I am suggesting that the relative independence of the Director-General should be ensured.  I have the utmost regard for the political resilience of the present Director-General: I do not think any Minister could easily browbeat him no matter from what political party he came; he has managed to withstand great pressures from people of all shades of political opinion in the recent past.  His appointment should be removed from the area of ministerial approval.  The stature and role of the Director-General would be immensely enhanced. The commission, of course, would have the right to dismiss the Director-General without necessarily having to seek ministerial approval beforehand.</P>
      <P>I want to advocate Oireachtas broadcasting.  I wish to make two points.  First, I would make the point that the current facilities are pretty lousy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I make <Col N="1567" /> this comment in the context of the facilities available at Stormont or in Britain.  In contrast our facilities are very primitive.  The House should come to grips with the introduction of radio and television in a normal civilised manner into the operations of this House.

      <P>It is a sad commentary that so feudal and primitive <Col N="1568" /> are the rules of parliamentary procedure here, one must approach the matter in such a circuitous manner. It is a sad commentary that in 1972 one must indulge in this kind of charade, and I make this statement with great respect to the Chair.</P>
      <P>With regard to piped television, the Minister must come off the fence before he finds himself stuck on top of one of the 100 foot high masts. His decision of 6th March, 1970 set out that not more than 500 individual dwellings may be serviced by one communal TV aerial but it is time he reviewed this decision before he destroys the skyline of Dublin.  There are some 100 communal aerials, ranging from 100 to 200 feet high&mdash;I will accept correction if I am wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell me how many such aerials there are?  I am assured there are 100 in Dublin.  One can hardly pick up a newspaper nowadays without reading applications for planning permission for the erection of these aerials.  I gather they cost between £4,000 and £5,000 each to erect and I am assured that for the most part they are unnecessary monstrosities.  It is possible to have up to 30,000 houses serviced from any one of these aerials, to have a whole sector of the city served effectively.  There is an urgent need to review the position in this matter.</P>
      <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7th November, Colm Power pointed out that in Brussels one aerial serviced 80,000 homes and there were nine channels available.  In Vancouver, Canada, he stated, 170,000 homes were serviced by one communal aerial.  The current confusion about this matter must be cleared up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware but I think the conflict of policy which is now evident and the serious implications for the Government, for financing and for environmental control should be considered urgently by the Minister.  I know that most Deputies tend to be exclusively preoccupied with some remark which Charles Mitchel may have said in some programme in the distant past, or with whether or not they like Bunny Car or prefer him to Gay Byrne.  I do not propose to descend to that level of discussion this evening but I want to refer to the matter of the ten o'clock RTE news and to suggest to the Minister that the country would welcome a return to the 9.30 news programme.  I suggest, with respect to RTE, that they should not try to have what one would call a pale imitation of the ITN &ldquo;News at Ten&rdquo;.  I make this suggestion as a purely personal reaction, and I make it in this context&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we have to be mature enough as a small nation with limited resources, with limited broadcasting resources and limited advertising revenue, to appreciate that from 9.30 to 10 o'clock for the most part we should be putting out a fairly comprehensive regional news programme which is essentially what RTE domestic news is, incorporating regional inserts from Northern Ireland which is essentially what that news is. I have no objection whatever to the RTE format of news&mdash;from 9.30 to 9.45, domestic news, and 9.45 to 10 o'clock, domestic commentary and interviews, but I suggest that there are many people on the eastern coast from Dundalk to Wexford and to Waterford who will increasingly tend <Col N="1570" /> to turn to the ITN or BBC news to get the full international coverage, particularly of international events and of major political developments in Britain.  Therefore, RTE would be well advised to return to the news at 9.30 and I would suggest to RTE that the major national news bulletin at the end of the day is rather more important than the marginal transfer of advertising revenue which I gather was the main reason RTE went over to a 10 o'clock news, to stop the loss of advertising revenue at 10 o'clock after the RTE news at 9.30.  I make that point strongly.</P>
      <P>I would also like to see the development of more feature work within RTE.  The kind of feature work I admire and laud is the kind of work done&mdash;I am talking now of one programme but there are many programmes&mdash;of the Enterprise team. Many Deputies may have seen the work done by that team on RTE last Monday week in the programme on Iceland's fishing war.  The work done there by Michael Ryan was an excellent example of the presentation of a feature programme of a very informative and objective nature, with an international flavour, which ranks high with any work I have seen done on any of the other channels.  This is certainly the kind of development which one can welcome as a public representative and I also welcome the growing flexibility of the radio work being done in this country.  I am rather perturbed about the proliferation of confusion relating to the respective RTE news bulletins.  One is never quite sure whether one will hear up-to date news on the &ldquo;Here and Now&rdquo; programme at 1.30 or at 9.30 because they seem to operate three different channels.  Certainly the staffs seem radically different and I suggest that there is a need for co-ordination within RTE in the presentation of information because I had the experience of being asked by all three to appear in the one day, with the result that at the end of the day I was not sure whether I was coming or going or on three different channels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in relation to the issue of the Labour Party's draft policy statement on social welfare.  It was &ldquo;Here and Now&rdquo; at 11 o'clock, at 1.30 and 9.30.  There were three different arrangements, with three different producers and three different interviewers.  Far be it from me to tell RTE what they should do or how they should run their news division, but I suggest that in the interests of co-ordination and to ensure that listeners and viewers will not finish up in a state of frustrated confusion at the end of the day, it would indeed be a useful exercise if there were some management co-ordination.  I do not think one need to spell it our more than that.  These are purely personal observations.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to make an observation not in relation to Radio na Gaeltachta which I welcome, but rather the appointment of the RTE political correspondent.  There is one matter I want to cavil at in relation to Nuachtán Náisiúnta na nGael, <i>Inniu</i>, in which there is a reference to the recent appointment of the RTE London political correspondent.  I want to put a fairly strong question mark against one news item which it used recently.  It states on the main page:</P>
      <P>Deirtear linn go bhfuil John O'Sullivan comhfhreagróir TÉ i Londain, ag éirí as an bpost sin&mdash; ar an ábhar go bhfuil &ldquo;suíochán slán&rdquo; aimsithe ag an bPríomh-aire Heath dó i dTeach na dTeachtaí.

      <P>&ldquo;Giúdach ón Ostair&rdquo;&mdash;a welcome which I think we as Irish people&mdash;agus Giúdach ón Ostair nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge aige&mdash;a welcome, the connotation of which, we in the Houses of the Oireachtas would not wish to attach to a newly appointed staff member of RTE.

    <P>The only comment I want to make in that regard is that I do not particularly see the relevance of the description of the RTE political correspondent in London as being an Austrian Jew without Irish.  I take objection to it, to that particular description meant in that context, which was not called for in the sneer context in which it was written.  I do not want to deal with it any further than that.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in 1973 in dealing with the report of the review committee.  I gather that we may expect a report some time in mid-1973. I do not think I am letting out any State secret because I read in the newspapers that it might be June, 1973, and the Minister might check that, like the other statement I made.</P>

Ach níos tábhachtaí ná sin, is maith liom bheith cinnte pé caint atá á dhéanamh agam nach bhfuil sí ach idir mé féin agus an duine atá ar an dtaobh eile den líne.</P>

      <P>What is popularly known as the Garda Drug Squad consists of those members of the force who are engaged fulltime in the detection of drug offences. They operate in Dublin and the adjoining counties.  In addition, of course, members of the force stationed outside Dublin deal with drug abuse in the ordinary course of duty and a number of them have received special training in this work.</P>
      <P>The Drug Squad were recently increased by 7 detective gardaí to their present strength of one detective sergeant and 14 detective gardaí.  The strength will be further increased over the next few months.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated in reply to questions on this subject, I am not prepared, for obvious reasons, to disclose details about the training or equipment available to members engaged on this work.  The Commissioner is satisfied that both training and equipment are adequate.</P>

      <P>The detailed management and control of their dwellings is a matter for each of the 115 local authorities in the country.  These authorities have adopted various forms of differential renting according to local circumstances over periods extending over 40 years.  It would be difficult to apply a uniform system in place of systems adopted over so long a period to dwellings of so wide a range of sizes, standards and locations.</P>
      <P>However, to help authorities in framing schemes a circular letter was issued in February, 1969, setting out certain guidelines.  The object of this letter was to ensure that, in general, the same schemes would apply to new dwellings in different areas subject to costs, standards and other local circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have had a check made on price increases for the firms named by the Deputy to which, on recommendations made by the National Prices Commission since 1st July, 1972, I raised no objection.  The check showed that the price increases to which I raised no objection included about 570 individual items for the firms concerned and the increases <Col N="1453" /> varied in amount from about 1 per cent to 30 per cent.  It will be appreciated that a single increase approved for a firm normally embraces a number of individual items.</P>
      <P>Price increases brought into operation in recent months may have been cleared by me before 1st July last; increases may also be caused by increased prices paid by importers.  I do not require importers to notify me of price increases provided they are not increasing their margin of profit.</P>

      <P>Under existing prices legislation all manufacturers are obliged to give me advance notice of one month of proposed increases in prices.  On the advice of the National Prices Commission I have, however, decided that firms fulfilling certain conditions may be exempted from detailed price control but such firms continue to be subject to the requirement of giving advance notice of one month.</P>
      <P>In July, 1972, the manufacturers who are the subject of the Deputy's question, applied for exemption from detailed price control and since they fulfilled one of the conditions necessary for exemption (i.e. that 75 per cent of their output was protected against competing imports from Britain by a tariff of 10 per cent or less), I decided, on the recommendation of the National Prices Commission, that they should be exempted from detailed price control on the understanding that the dates and amounts of all proposed increases in the home market prices of their manufactured output were notified to me in advance.</P>
      <P>I have received notification from the firm that they proposed to increase their home market prices for automotive replacement batteries from 30th October, 1972, by an average of 9 per cent.</P>

      <P>The dealing in question was lodged in the Land Registry on 23rd September, 1971.  It was completed, and notification of completion was issued to the solicitor concerned in the case, on 20th July, 1972.</P>
      <P>The delay in the completion of the dealing was caused by the serious arrears position which has obtained in the Land Registry in recent years. Various measures have already been taken to strengthen the staffing and organisation of the registry and these have proved very beneficial.  Unfortunately, however, their effect has been offset by a very substantial increase in the volume of dealings lodged, which has grown from 38,000 in 1970 to 46,000 in 1971 and an estimated 52,000 in 1972.  Further measures are in train to cope with the increased volume of work and it is hoped that, as a result, excessive delays in registrations will be eliminated and that in general a more efficient service will be provided for the public.</P>
