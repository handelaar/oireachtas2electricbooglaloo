      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this debate concludes there are a few points I should like to raise.  The Minister made a lot of play, possibly justifiably, on the commercial type operation his Department carry out.  I have had cause to comment on this in previous years in so far as the Minister claims that he runs his Department on commercial lines, but many of the norms which one finds in a commercial undertaking, as such, are absent from the activities of his Department.</P>
      <P>This is particularly evident in regard to the telephone service.  This, quite obviously, is not run on commercial lines because, if it were run on commercial lines, a lucrative service such as this, a high profit yielding service, would not be starved of capital.  The Minister will have to assert his undoubted powers of persuasion in the councils of the Cabinet to ensure that for his Department and, in particular, for the telephone service the starvation of capital which has existed up to now will no longer be permitted to continue.</P>
      <P>It would appear from my reading of his speech and the notes which he circulated to us, that the amount which he states has been provided by the Government for investment in the telephone service does not represent the true position. It is not the net amount which is available in so far as he does not take into account the large amount of interest which his Department credit against this sum.  Having regard to the tremendous need for vastly increased investment in the expansion of the telephone system, the Department should be relieved, or should relieve themselves, of any obligation of having to repay interest on advances made for capital purposes under the Telephone Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is particularly so in view of the impending arrival of Ericsson's factory. <Col N="1311" /> I am very pleased indeed to see that it has been decided to locate this factory in Athlone&mdash;an extremely wise decision.  It points to the good sense of the management of that concern that they have picked such a pleasant place to locate.  I thank the Minister for having come to an arrangement with them guaranteeing the purchasing of a certain amount of equipment.  This was one of the attractions for them to set up here.  It is not an exclusive arrangement and, quite naturally, it would not want to be.  There would be dangers in that direction.  I am sure that a guaranteed order of the type indicated by the Minister was a very substantial bait in deciding that firm to locate in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Now that the decision has been made to purchase to a large degree from them the firm have responded by agreeing to locate here.  Our telephone system still needs vast investment which, in turn, implies very substantial purchases of equipment.  The fact that this equipment will now be manufactured in this country with all the economic benefits that will bring is an extra reason for the Minister to urge on his colleagues in the Government to make available the money he requires to bring the telephone system up to date.</P>
    <P>The increasing backlog in terms of potential subscribers wanting connection is very disturbing.  Quite frankly, it defies understanding that a service which is potentially so remunerative and which is in such demand would not be provided.  There may be occasional exceptions but, by and large, every telephone which is installed results in a profit to the State.  I would urge the Minister to give the people the telephones for which there is an obvious demand.  This would produce more income for his Department and more returns to the Exchequer for investment.</P>
    <P>If, as the Minister says, the Department is run on a commercial basis, the first priority must be to provide lots of capital in areas where capital can be well spent.  It is a false claim by the Minister to suggest commercial standards when the most lucrative aspect is starved of capital.  I think the Minister <Col N="1312" /> will agree with me on that.  The question now is who gets what of the resources of the nation but if the Minister can say that he has something profitable and which is desirable socially and economically, especially since the basic equipment is now being manufactured in the country, he will have a very strong case for increased capital allocation.  I would not worry too much about the final appearance of the Department's accounts but even if the Minister were to ask to be relieved of the interest repayments on the telephone allocation a considerable amount of extra capital would be available.  I am encouraged by the fact that Ericssons have decided to locate in Athlone.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from that area, I can say that the news brought much satisfaction because we have suffered more than our share of industrial redundancies. I hope the factory can get under way very quickly and that it will expand to full employment and production in the shortest possible time.  The Government can assist in this regard by increasing the scope of their investment in the telephone service, thereby increasing the demand for the products of this new factory and the higher the demand the more employment will be provided.  I have no doubt that the factory will be successful and I wish all the people who will come to work there a very happy time in Athlone.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Minister's operations in which his claim to a commercial concern does not stand up is in relation to the counter services provided in the post offices.  In many ways these are hidebound by excessive and old-fashioned regulations and are antiquated in their approach to modern business.  One example of this which became very apparent during the unfortunate bank strike a few years ago was that at that time many people, such as commercial travellers who had an obligation to collect money in the course of their employment and forward it to their employers used the Post Office services but I understand that the largest sum which they could send in one lot was £100.  This meant that in the case of a traveller who would be sending say, £700, he had to buy seven different orders and pay the <Col N="1313" /> poundage on each.  That was not the worst feature, though, because the official behind the counter was involved seven times on one such operation, whereas if there was some discretion or if there was no financial limit on the amount of an order that could be purchased, the Post Office might take some business from the commercial banks in regard to that type of operation.  The more money the Post Office can have on hands at any particular time, the greater the benefit to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Post Office deposit accounts, too, are administered in an excessively rigid fashion and compare very unfavourably with the facilities provided by the banks to those wishing to maintain deposit accounts.  If one deposits money in the bank in the morning, he can go back in the afternoon and withdraw the entire sum without any formality, whereas if a person opens a deposit account with the Post Office and deposits say, £100 at 11 a.m. but finds in the afternoon that because of some sudden demand he needs the money, he will not be able to withdraw it because it is necessary to give two days' notice to the Post Office. This regulation inhibits people from using the Post Office saving facilities.  I understand, also, that there is a restriction on the number of withdrawals that can be made at a particular time. Occasionally it happens that people who have invested in a Post Office savings account through the savings book method find it necessary to withdraw money suddently, perhaps coming up to a week-end, but because of the rule of procedure a person cannot withdraw his own money without giving certain notice.  That is a regulation that must be eased if the Post Office savings bank is to become competitive and fulfil the function for which it is intended.</P>
    <P>One area in which great improvement could be made in that regard would be the easing of the rules regarding deposits and withdrawls from savings accounts while at the same time using the Post Office counter staffs for the purpose of increasing the public's interest in the facilities offered by the Post Office in the same way as the banks now have productivity <Col N="1314" /> arrangements with their staffs.  I have found during the past year or so that individual members of bank staffs&mdash; not always senior members&mdash;show a great desire to attract business for their employers.  I understand that they are on some sort of productivity arrangement which ensures that they are paid in respect of business which they bring in.  Post Office officials should be given a similar incentive to sell the Post Office facilities to the public.  At present it is frustrating for senior officials to see good business pass the Post Office simply because there is no incentive for them to go after it.  Very often the officials can do nothing in this regard because they are bound by old rules which would inhibit people from using the facilities.  Certainly, in regard to the savings bank if there was an incentive for officials to encourage people to invest, there would be vastly increased investment by the public and the Post Office could compete with the commercial banks for deposits maintained by way of deposit accounts subject to easy depositing and withdrawals.</P>
    <P>The rate of interest offered by the Post Office compares very favourably with that offered by the commercial banks.  I would ask the Minister to institute some sort of study into the commercial counter operations of his Department and ensure that old regulations which no longer serve any good purpose be scrapped and that there be no red tape so as to ensure that the proper use would be made of the experience and skill of officials behind the counters of post offices throughout the country.  Many of the rules restricting their conduct should be examined in the light of the twentieth century.  In many cases these rules have taken on a divine air.  In many instances there are not only double checks but treble and quadruple checks.  While this indicates careful accounting which is commendable, it involves a waste of expensive manpower without any correlative benefit to the service.  They are an irritant so far as the morale of staff is concerned.</P>
    <P>If the Department is to be run on commercial lines, commercial criteria <Col N="1315" /> should be applied where the public are met across the counter in regard to the selling of the services available. Secondly, in regard to making the Post Office attractive for staff to sell these services, there should be an incentive arrangement for them.</P>
    <P>The only other point I wish to make is to compliment the Department on the postal delivery service which is first-class but I think it is a pity that in Dublin it was discontinued on Saturdays.  I hope that will not happen throughout the country. I know there is difficulty in arranging a five-day week for postmen and at the same time maintaining deliveries on Saturdays.  I do not know how that will be overcome but I would ask the Minister to provide rural postmen with a five-day week.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made for working extra hours during the five days in order to have the sixth and seventh days off, but the hours I heard suggested are altogether unrealistic. It would be unfair to ask postmen to work an excessively long day in order to have Saturday off. There will have to be another look at this problem but I would ask the Minister not to sacrifice Saturday deliveries.  This is an aspect of the Post Office service which cannot be conducted on entirely commercial lines.  It is a State service which has to be provided, even though it might not be a viable service in terms of commercial criteria.</P>
    <P>Postmen up and down the country, particularly in rural Ireland, who are not mechanised, perform a wonderful service because this is a job involving considerable hardship, particularly during winter months.  When one sees a postman on a wild and windy morning trundling a bike up a rugged bohereen one appreciates the service he is giving to the community.  The Minister should try to ease his lot by giving him a day off.  It gives me pleasure to pay a compliment to these men for the service they have provided.  I hope commercial considerations, where they are not applicable, will not be used as an excuse for diminishing that service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> I ask the Minister to end the ridiculous situation of having a lucrative service like the telephone service starved of capital, to use the counter services to their fullest by making them modern, by encouraging the staff to sell them and to ease the lot of postmen outside Dublin by introducing the five-day week but at the same time not sacrificing the Saturday delivery.  I know it may be difficult and expensive to do this but for the sake of the morale of the service and in recognition of the services which rural postmen render to the community I do not think we would grudge the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>The other feature of this debate has been the attention paid to Radio Telefís Éireann.  A lot has been said on that and I have no doubt a lot more will continue to be said.  I am sure a lot will be said by the Minister when he closes this debate.  One point I would ask the Minister to deal with in regard to RTE and the dismissal of the authority is to explain why, when asked for an interpretation of the directive that would meet the Government's wishes, it was refused. This was unjust to the authority.  They took the view, and it appeared to me from reading the directive, a justifiable view, that the wording of it left it open to various interpretations.</P>
    <P>It was perfectly reasonable that the person to whom it was given would ask the person who gave it: &ldquo;What precisely does it mean?  Which of these interpretations do you want?&rdquo; In the absence of a clear answer it was contrary to natural justice to dismiss the authority for failing to implement something which defied precise interpretation.  The Minister should specify why he and the Government did not spell out to the authority what they meant by the directive.  One had sympathy with the Government at the time the directive was issued.  They had public opinion behind them at that stage but this has now gone because of the way in which the authority were dismissed. It is quite clear to the public that the authority were unfairly dismissed because of the lack of willingness on the <Col N="1317" /> part of the Government to explain precisely what was meant by the directive.</P>
    <P>I will be disappointed if the Minister does not deal with the Government's failure to explain the directive to the authority.  It is not sufficient to say that it should have been clear to the authority.  The authority were composed of eminent people who found it was not clear.  It will not be an answer on the part of the Minister to say that it was perfectly clear, that they knew well what they were at. The Minister will have to explain why he did not go a step farther and say: &ldquo;This is what I see it means and this is what I want you to see it means&rdquo;.  If the Minister did that and the authority then said that they disagreed and they would not enforce it that way, the Minister's action might have been justified.  He did not go that far and he has left this question mark.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Richard Burke on his appointment as spokesman for the principal Opposition <Col N="1318" /> Party on the affairs of my Department. He certainly made a remarkable speech extending to four hours and 46 minutes.  In acknowledgment of the great labour which he obviously must have devoted to the preparation of this lengthy and detailed speech I should like, other things apart, if only as courtesy, to reply at length but Deputy Burke will, I hope, recognise that I cannot, within a reasonable time, deal with all the points made by him while replying also to other Deputies and deal with other events that have occurred since the debate on this Estimate was initiated.  However, I shall do my very best to reply to the points made by him.</P>
    <P>I particularly appreciate Deputy Richard Burke's disarming admission that because of the fact of being in Opposition he could not know what was going on.  This is certainly very understandable and accounts for the fact that in many of his comments in regard to the telephone service particularly Deputy Burke was unfortunately very much astray.  I say that without any wish to score a political point but it will be necessary, nevertheless, for me, for the purpose of the record, to correct the Deputy in regard to some matters of importance, on which he very clearly was misinformed.</P>
    <P>Deputy R. Burke referred to our accounting system and, understandably enough, coming as he did new to the scene, was a little confused about the position.  Let me put him right about the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to the effect that the accounting system of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is on a receipts and payments basis which is designed primarily to serve the process of parliamentary control of expenditure, but does not facilitate the production of an income and expenditure account and a balance sheet.  The Deputy felt that this comment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General had been made by way of criticism.  This is certainly not so.  It is a statement of fact, and whatever changes may be made in the Department's accounting system as a result of further studies, it will continue <Col N="1319" /> to be necessary to produce accounts on a receipts and payments basis for the purpose of parliamentary control of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Deputy R. Burke went on to make various comments about the Department's commercial accounts which are prepared to show the position of the Department's services on a trading basis.  Let me assure the Deputy that, by and large, the Department's commercial accounts as prepared heretofore serve very adequately the purpose for which they were intended.  They give guidelines for policy making and show the extent of the profit and loss on the Department's main services.  I have no doubt but that they could be improved upon.  If Deputy R. Burke who dealt with this subject was in touch with developments in Britain over the past few years and the continuing developments there, he would be aware that the institute of accountants there are by no means satisfied with the innumerable forms of accounts produced by large commercial organisations in Britain.  An attempt is being made to introduce some broad principles of standardisation. At the moment the presentation of company accounts varies widely. There are few areas in which accountants are unanimous as to the best form of preparation of accounts.</P>
    <P>As I have stated in my introductory speech, the Department have employed a firm of consultant accountants to look over the whole accounting system of the Department, not because it is seriously deficient but because I believe that it is a good thing that we should have the benefit at this stage of an independent, fresh appraisal from outside of our whole accounting system.</P>
    <P>Deputy R. Burke also inquired about the breakdown of the Department's fixed assets.  A statement of fixed assets is published annually in the commercial accounts.  This gives an analysis under five headings&mdash; telegraphs, telephone, accommodation, plant, lands and buildings.  The Deputy suggested that without a revaluation of the Department's assets it was impossible to form any true opinion of the Department's financial <Col N="1320" /> performance.  I regret to be unable to agree with the Deputy on the need for a revaluation of the Department's assets.  The major part of the Department's capital is employed in the telephone service.  Out of a total expenditure on this service which will approach £110 million by the end of the current financial year, nearly £90 million will have been spent since 1960, and £14 million of the remainder in the previous ten years.  In my opinion, revaluation of the assets after so short a period would serve no useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy R. Burke and other Deputies expressed the view that it was a great pity that we had not in 1972 commemorated the 50th anniversary of the deaths of great men who died in 1922.  Deputy R. Burke instanced Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins but generously said that he would not exclude the commemoration of important figures of other traditions in this regard.  He thought it would have shown a certain degree of maturity if we had done this.  The Government decision to issue one stamp in commemoration of all the patriot dead of the 1922-23 period seems to show even greater maturity. It avoids any revival of old quarrels and, perhaps, even more importantly, it commemorates not merely the great people but all the others on both sides who gave their lives for what they believed in, even if they earned little fame by doing so.</P>
    <P>Deputy R. Burke referred to the recommendations concerning my Department which were contained in the Devlin Report on Reorganisation of the Public Services.  Deputy Moore and Deputy Hogan O'Higgins suggested that there was need to review the functions of the Department. Deputy R. Burke dealt extensively with the points made in the Devlin Report.  There is no need for me to reiterate them now.  The fundamental conclusion of the report was that the status of the Department as a Department of State should not be changed. As Deputies are aware, the Government have already taken certain steps in regard to the main recommendations in the report.  A Public Services Department is being set up.  It has <Col N="1321" /> been decided that the separation of the policy making from their day-to-day execution will be carried out on an experimental basis in three Departments.  My Department is not one of those involved.</P>
    <P>The Post Office have a large measure of freedom on commercial lines at present.  They have wide delegated powers from the Minister for Finance to encourage expenditure within broad approved limits.  However, as a Department of State, they have to function under certain constraints which do not apply to semi-State bodies.  To what extent changes might be made within the present structure of the Post Office as a Government Department to enable them to work more efficiently and effectively in providing commercial type services without going so far as to set up a Post Office semi-State body is a matter which the Government will consider in due course in the light of developments in regard to the Devlin recommendations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore suggested that savings services might be handed over to some other body.  Savings services are the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  The Post Office make facilities available for the day-to-day operation of the service.  It is for the Minister for Finance to consider whether any changes in the operation of these services are desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy R. Burke wished to know more about an experiment in balanced delivery in the Blackrock area.  The Deputy seemed to be quite well briefed about this matter already.  The position in Blackrock is typical of that in many areas where there are two deliveries. Postings are generally made in the evenings.  The volume of mail on hands in the morning for delivery is very great.  At present we endeavour to deliver all of it on the first post, although many items such as printed papers are not of urgent character.  In Blackrock about 88 per cent of correspondence has been delivered on the first delivery and only 12 per cent on the second delivery.  The staff in the area agreed to co-operate in an experiment to bring the volume of correspondence in the two deliveries more into balance.  Under the balanced delivery system all available <Col N="1322" /> first-class correspondence is taken out on the first delivery as well as second-class correspondence for those addresses for which there are also first-class items.  Second-class correspondence for addresses for which there is no first-class correspondence is held over for the second delivery.  All available items of first- and second-class are delivered on the second delivery.</P>
    <P>The object of this experiment is to improve efficiency and productivity in a way which will not inconvenience the public to any material extent and which will maintain, if not improve, staff conditions.  Operationally, the results in Blackrock have been satisfactory and I am hopeful we will be able to agree with the staff soon on definite proposals for the implementation of balanced delivery on a permanent basis.  The possibilities of introducing the system elsewhere are also being considered.  The Deputy mentioned some postmen having now only an hour break in their duties instead of a three hour break as formerly.  I think it is a case that staff do not like a long spreadover period of duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also commented that letters posted in Dublin early in the morning under the new arrangements would not be delivered in the Blackrock area the same day.  In practice there are very few such letters, and arrangements may be made to deal with these.  Deputy Burke inquired about costly postal deliveries in rural areas.  In many areas the cost of delivery exceeds the 4p paid for the stamp.  In some places the cost of delivery on a postman's route would on average be 15p, 18p and even as high as 20p per item.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister ever try to estimate what it would cost to supply sewerage and water to those areas?  This is as much a social service as they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke spoke of deliveries in the Dublin <Col N="1323" /> area.  There has been no change in the standard of the postal service in the Dublin area.  The Deputy mentioned late deliveries.  While every effort is made to perform deliveries on schedule, I am sure it will be accepted that having regard to the size of the Dublin delivery force and the necessity to make immediate provision for sick and other absences by staff on overtime or by staff who are unfamiliar with delivery routes concerned, it is inevitable that some instances of late or delayed deliveries will occur.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton suggested that the half day in post offices should be staggered so that the public could transact business on all days of the week except Sunday.  Offices staffed by the Department do not close for a half day.  Sub-post offices close for a half day weekly and where there is more than one such office in a centre the half days are usually on different days of the week.  In Dublin, the majority of sub-post offices take their half day on Saturday but there is at least one office open in each area of the city on that day.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully referred to possible danger arising from sharp edges of letter boxes in local authority houses. This matter was looked into after the Deputy raised it previously.  I am told there does not appear to be a general problem and no particular difficulties or complaints have come to notice recently.</P>

      <P>Not even singed. I was pleased to hear Deputy Coughlan praise the postal service in the Limerick area.  I am gratified to know that he has not had a single complaint about it in five or six years.  Deputy Begley referred to a specific case of alleged delay due to interference with post in the south Kerry area.  He has been in correspondence with me about this and he will know that official inquiries did not support allegations which he made.  If there are further points he wishes to bring to my notice, I will be more than glad to have them examined for him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully referred to difficulties in postal deliveries which can be caused by similarities in street names.  He asked whether the attention of local authorities had been drawn to the matter.  In general, it can be said that the problem arises only occasionally, and the Deputy may be assured that where it does the local authority concerned are quickly contacted.  My Department have also been in touch with the Department of Local Government on the general question of clear and individual identification of new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hogan O'Higgins spoke of losses in the post and mentioned in particular postcards sent by farmers to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in connection with the beef incentive bonus scheme.  The number of items lost in the post is very small. It is certainly negligible in relation to the 460 million postal items handled in a year.  In so far as the items mentioned by the Deputy are concerned, the Department do not appear to have any complaints.  However, because this was raised here by Deputy Hogan O'Higgins, it is being looked into.  She also referred to losses and delays in regard to items posted in Leinster House.  Six posting points are provided in Leinster House and there are collections at 11 a.m., 4 p.m., 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., with a further collection at 10.30 p.m. on sitting days.  Correspondence collected from Leinster House is given special treatment in the Central Sorting Office and should secure a high quality of service. If the Deputy supplies me with <Col N="1325" /> details of the items she mentioned, I will have the matter investigated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton expressed concern about overloading of postmen in developing areas.  I can assure the Deputy that where building development is taking place delivery needs are kept under particularly close review and additional delivery staff are authorised where required.</P>

      <P>Deputy Begley mentioned the absence of Dingle and Cahirciveen from the postal addresses of Dunquin and Ballinskelligs and the inclusion instead of Tralee and Killarney.  Mail for Dunquin and Ballinskelligs is handled at Tralee and Killarney, respectively, and these names must, therefore, appear on the postal addresses.  Tralee and Killarney are the most suitable offices for the handling of mail for Dunquin and Ballinskelligs from the point of view of efficiency and economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan was not satisfied with the postal services being provided in the midlands.  I am convinced that they compare favourably with those provided throughout the country and that they are of the highest standard.  The Deputy referred particularly to letters from Mountmellick to Rahan which he said took four days and from Mountmellick and Rahan to Leinster House which he said took two days.  In either case, letters posted in time for night mail despatch should secure delivery the next working day.  If the Deputy can furnish details of specific complaints, they will, of course, be investigated. He also referred to some recent postal changes in Mountmellick.  The Deputy had a Parliamentary question on the matter and I do not propose to go into detail at this point.  I can <Col N="1326" /> assure the Deputy and other Deputies in the constituency that the postal services provided in Mountmellick continue to be of a high standard and compare very favourably with those in similar towns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan also mentioned overloading of letter boxes in built-up areas.  In urban areas the practise is to provide either pillar boxes or wall boxes according to the volume of traffic likely to be posted. Pillar boxes are usually provided in commercial and densely populated urban areas where the level of posting is high.  Posting needs in suburban areas are, as a rule, adequately catered for by wallboxes.  The capacity of boxes to take the volume of traffic offering is kept under review and remedial action is taken where necessary. Overloading sometimes occurs as the result of large or bulky items&mdash; which to my mind should be handed in at the post office if this is possible &mdash;being forced into letterboxes and preventing further posting.</P>
    <P>I was more than surprised to hear that Deputy Flanagan was of the opinion that motorisation of rural postal services was resulting in a general reduction in standards.  As on other things, he is on his own on that as well.  This is not my understanding of the overall position.  In general, motorisation is planned on the basis of maintaining standards to the maximum extent possible.  A motorised delivery post usually incorporates two pedal cycle posts, and on motorisation delivery is completed earlier than before.  However, because of the amalgamation of delivery routes there will be some places where somewhat later delivery cannot be avoided and these are usually confined to sparsely populated areas.  I need not remind Deputies again of the economics of rural postal delivery and of the contribution which motorisation is making towards reducing costs.</P>
    <P>Deputies Moore and Treacy referred to the need to make sub-post offices more attractive and to improve facilities for the public at such offices.  The provision and maintaining of sub-post office accommodation is the responsibility of the sub-postmaster.  Sub-post <Col N="1327" /> offices are inspected regularly and attention is drawn to the need to improve the appearance of offices where this is considered necessary.  The adequacy and suitability of accommodation offered are taken into account when new sub-post office appointments are being made.  Complaints received are few and have been largely concerned with overcrowding in certain suburban Dublin offices.  These cases of overcrowding do not, however, reflect on the general adequacy of the accommodation but are simply related to exceptional conditions which arise on certain days, for example, on the first Tuesday of every month when children's allowances are payable.  On these days sub-postmasters concerned usually increase their staff but they can hardly be expected to provide accommodation or staff on a scale to ensure no delay under such peak conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to the need for a new sorting office, and I think he had Ballsbridge in mind.  The Department have agreed to lease accommodation for a new sorting office in an office block which a private developer proposes to erect at Ballsbridge, provided the developer obtains detailed planning permission for the scheme.  Terms have been agreed with the developer's agent for the leasing of sorting office accommodation which will be on the ground floor of the office block.  When outside planning permission was given for the scheme, fairly onerous conditions were imposed which necessitated extensive revision of the building plans.  The detailed plans prepared on the new basis have not yet been approved, but the decision is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked what further progress is likely to be made in the erection of buildings to be used as post offices and improving the facilities in the various post offices.  In my opening speech I mentioned some offices where work was in progress or contracted for.  In addition to those, work has just commenced on an improvement scheme at Blackrock post office, County Dublin, and tenders have been invited for the erection of a new post office at Dungarvan.  Plans have reached a fairly advanced stage for <Col N="1328" /> the erection of new post offices at Donegal, Longford, Listowel, Mullingar and Shannon, and the provision of new post offices at Tipperary and Clonmel are at the initial planning stages.  Plans for improvement at Ballyhaunis, Boyle, Castlebar and Kilmallock post offices are also at an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>I will have the Deputy's request considered.  Some Deputies, including Deputy Richard Burke, referred to a recent case in which a summons was issued against the Department for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Office Premises Act.  There have been a few recent instances of this kind.  The summonses were in respect of such matters as toilets, lighting, heating and accommodation for staff clothing, and in one case failure to provide a handrail on a staircase, although I think that particular summons was withdrawn.</P>
      <P>In my opening statement I gave some particulars of the progress made on the provision of new buildings and the extension and improvement of existing buildings and of works in progress and contracted for.  Plans for other new buildings and improvements of existing buildings are at various stages.  Deputies will realise, of course, that because of the age of some post office buildings and because of expansion of the Department's business, particularly on the telephone side, difficulties are likely to arise from time to time in complying with some of the provisions of the Office Premises Act.  However, action is being taken to ensure that all necessary or desirable improvements will be made where practicable as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> Mention was made of the problem of ventilation in the Central Sorting Office here in Dublin.  In my reply to last year's Estimate debate, I gave an estimate of the time needed to instal a mechanised ventilation system in the building which, as it turned out, was over-optimistic.  Unexpected architectural difficulties arose mainly in connection with fire precautions and the location of the penthouse for the ventilation plans, with the result that changes in lay-out and design had to be made. These held up completion of the drawings. I am afraid it will be necessary to continue to use the office, particularly the main sorting office, while the work is in progress, and this gave rise to considerable difficulty in planning scaffolding lay-out to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>This matter has since been the subject of a number of consultations between the Office of Public Works consulting engineer and quantity surveyor and the departmental staff representatives. The Commissioners of Public Works now expect that tenders will be invited early in January.  They expect that a contract will be placed about three months later and, on present information, that the work will take from 12 to 18 months to complete.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon referred to the need for a sorting office in Tallaght.  It is intended to provide a sorting office in that area and my Department have been in touch with the local authority on the question of obtaining a suitable site for a sorting office, and the matter will come up for discussion shortly when the Office of Public Works will have a meeting with the Dublin County planning Department regarding the provisions of facilities and sites for a variety of State services in the Tallaght area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan urged that the pay of temporary telephonists should be increased. The pay of temporary telephonists was revised within the last year following agreement at the Departmental Conciliation Council on a claim made on their behalf.  Deputy Treacy referred to employment as part-time telephonists of persons already in full-time jobs.  The Department's primary concern in recruiting telephonists, <Col N="1330" /> whether whole-time or part-time, is to get people who will be suitable for the work and applicants are assessed on that basis.  If the Department were to exclude from consideration for part-time telephonist work persons in whole-time employment, it would create very serious problems.  The part-time telephonists are employed for only a limited number of hours and, indeed, the pay is not sufficient to attract unemployed persons, who would have to forfeit their unemployment benefit or assistance if they accepted part-time employment.  Furthermore, not everybody has the educational or other qualities necessary for efficient telephone operating.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the question of the amount of overtime paid to delivery postmen at Christmas.  During the Christmas pressure period last year tests were carried out on a representative sample of delivery routes which were agreed with the Post Office Workers Union.  Analyses of the information obtained during the tests showed that the amounts of overtime being paid were generally reasonable.</P>

      <P>Deputies Richard Burke, Desmond and Tully inquired about a five-day week for postmen. Deputy Cooney also referred to that matter.  A five-day week, Monday to Friday with Saturday off, was introduced for delivery postmen in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire in 1970-71.  Following a survey of public reaction to the cessation of Saturday deliveries the staff representatives advised last year that cessation of Saturday deliveries was not being sought at other centres and that a staggered five-day week was acceptable.  Formal agreement in principle was then reached at the conciliation council that a five-day week would be introduced at individual offices where this did not involve significant extra cost or worsening of service.  The possibility of introducing five-day week schemes at these offices is being negotiated office by office at present.  So far it has been found possible to introduce a five-day week for about 540 of the 1740 postmen in provincial centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> Deputy R. Burke inquired about the recruitment of engineers and technicians. Both these grades are recruited through the Civil Service Commission, the technicians as trainees.  Taking engineers first, the number of engineers recruited in the last five years was 120.  The Department has constant liaison with the placement officers in the universities and by arrangement with these officers senior engineers from the Department visit the universities during the early part of the year.  They address the students and issue a general invitation to visit the Department. The Department also operates free scholarship schemes.  One scheme provides for special leave with pay to selected staff in certain grades in the Department to attend a course in technical engineering at a university or the College of Technology in Kevin Street.  The second scheme provides for the award of scholarships to students who have been successful in the leaving certificate examination and the third is for students who have completed at least two years of a course leading to a professional engineering qualification or a science degree including experimental physics as a subject.</P>
    <P>Some 40 engineers resigned in the last five years almost all of whom had very short service.  It is common practice for engineers to move from one employment to another in their early years to widen their experience and the number resigning is not regarded as abnormal.</P>
    <P>As regards technicians, the main avenue of recruitment is via the technician trainee grade.  In the last five years 650 technician trainees were recruited and at present there are some 450 trainees undergoing training, the intake in the current year being 174.  These receive an intensive training over a period of about four years, consisting of full-time attendance at special vocational school courses, full-time attendance at training courses provided by the Department and supervised on-the-job training as well.</P>
    <P>It is now the practice to divert trainees who do not reach the required technical standard to other <Col N="1333" /> work at a lower level in the Department's engineering branch so that use can be made of the knowledge they have acquired.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Richard Burke was speaking about the need for achieving greater productivity he stressed the importance of enlisting the support of the staff organisations and asked for information regarding the consultative councils.  In my opening statement I said we had been assured by staff organisations of their full co-operation in improving efficiency and that the staff organisations and management have been working together for many years to create a climate of good relations. Following discussions at the Departmental Conciliation Council of ways and means of improving management-staff communications, it was agreed between the departmental and the staff representatives that councils should be established on an experimental basis at a number of the major staff centres throughout the country.  Twelve councils are now operating and it has been agreed with the staff to set up four more at other centres.  The councils meet generally at monthly intervals and discuss a wide range of topics of local interest. Their operation is to be reviewed shortly by the Department and the staff organisations and the Departmental Conciliation Council and further action will be considered then.</P>
    <P>Deputy R. Burke inquired about the use of behavioural sciences in helping to identify and remove causes of staff dissatisfaction or causes of friction between staff and management.  I referred in my statement on the Estimate last year to what the Department is doing in this field.  In recent years two assignments of industrial psychologists have been made for the purpose of surveying and reporting on staff attitudes and morale, in particular on how the job could be made more satisfying.  One such assignment, in the Central Telephone Exchange in Dublin, has been completed and preliminary action has been taken on many of the psychologist's recommendations. The other assignment consists of a similar study among postal sorters in the Central Sorting <Col N="1334" /> Office.  The work on this study is fairly advanced and the report of the survey team is expected towards the end of this year.  It should be at hand very soon after Christmas.  When the results of these surveys have been studied and appraised, the question of conducting similar surveys among other groups of staff will be considered.</P>
    <P>Apart from this specialised and specific use of the behavioural sciences, there is, of course, considerable emphasis on the psychology of staff-management relations in training courses for managers, supervisors and others.</P>
    <P>Deputy R. Burke mentioned that junior staff in the lower grades must from time to time be able to offer ideas for improving the service.  A scheme has been in operation in the Department since 1957 for consideration of suggestions made by the staff. A special committee considers these suggestions and makes awards to members of the staff whose suggestions are adopted and also to those whose suggestions, while not warranting adoption, nevertheless, show sufficient thought, care and work to warrant recognition.  Since 1st January, 1969, the committee have considered 1,269 suggestions from members of the staff and have made awards in respect of 345 of the suggestions.  There is no doubt the staff suggestion scheme has been a success and that it has made a useful contribution to efficiency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to statements made by the Sub-Postmasters Union about difficulties encountered in dealing with the increasing volume of traffic at manual sub-office exchanges.  The policy of the Department is to convert such exchanges to automatic working as quickly as possible.  A substantial number of these exchanges has been converted to automatic working but it will take some years before this work is completed. In general, sub-postmasters have been able to deal with the increased volume of traffic.  Some sub-postmasters in charge of the larger exchanges have had problems with regard to this matter and the Department <Col N="1335" /> have given special assistance to enable them to continue to provide the services.  Where any problems may arise in this connection help will be given.  The payment made to sub-postmasters for telephone work is related to the volume of traffic they handle; consequently, when the volume of traffic grows the payment is increased.  I might mention that there is a claim by the Sub-Postmasters Union for higher pay for telephone work before the sub-postmasters conciliation council.  However, I will not comment on this matter at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy McLaughlin referred to assignment of telephone staff to posts away from their homes.  On recruitment, telephonists are normally assigned temporarily to an exchange near their homes but when they are due for assignment to a permanent post it is necessary to transfer them to another exchange.  This is in accordance with an arrangement with the staff association concerned which provides that when vacancies arise applicants for transfer are given priority in order of seniority.  However, every effort is made to ensure that telephonists are assigned to exchanges near their homes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred to the timing of postmen's routes.  Post testing is a long-established and essential feature of post office working; the only way in which the time required for a given post can be assessed is by having the actual test carried out.  It is usual for a postman who considers his post has been overloaded to request the test and I hope Deputy Treacy takes note of this fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan mentioned deductions from pay in respect of income tax.  Income tax liability is assessed by the Revenue Commissioners and deductions from pay are based on that assessment.  My Department have no function other than to make the requisite deductions from pay.  If a person considers the income tax assessment and consequent deductions are unfair, I am sure the Revenue Commissioners would consider any representations made.</P>
    <P>Deputies Donnellan and Treacy referred <Col N="1336" /> to the recruitment of subordinate staff.  The vast bulk of this staff, such as postmen, telephonists and technicians, are established and are recruited by means of open competitions conducted by the Civil Service Commission.  My Department have no say in the selection of candidates. Certain unestablished and part-time grades are recruited either by open competition conducted by my Department or by way of selection from persons nominated by employment exchanges.  All applicants are interviewed and their suitability is assessed by my Department before appointment is approved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy urged that displacement of staff should be avoided in postal motorisation schemes.  In order to avoid displacement of long-serving postmen, motorised services are introduced only when a vacancy occurs. The ideal arrangement would be to introduce the motorised services immediately vacancies occur but often this is impracticable.  Although every effort is made to cover posts in the interval on an allowance basis by utilising the services of existing postmen, in some cases it is necessary to recruit men in a temporary capacity. Where this is done the men concerned sign a form to the effect that they recognise that the work is temporary and gives no claim to continued employment. When motorised services are introduced these men must be displaced but in most cases they would have been employed only for a few months.  If motorisation is to proceed, and in the interests of reducing the high costs of rural postal delivery it is essential that it should, a limited amount of short-term temporary employment of this kind is inevitable.  As I have pointed out, it is very limited and we do all we can to restrict it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke raised some questions about the types of technical equipment and plant used by the Department.  He referred to the old Strowger equipment, an electro-mechanical system being used here, and stated that many of our difficulties were due to the drawbacks of this system.  Deputy Burke wondered if my Department were aware of more up-to-date systems and he referred to <Col N="1337" /> an electronic system he had read about.  When the Deputy saw micro-wave equipment in the Post Office Tower in London he admired the very up-to-date methods beings used by the British Post Office and he was glad to find that in Ireland we also used the micro-wave system.  The Deputy wondered if we had been following the lead of the British Post Office because he asked if these systems were provided simply to slot in effectively with the British system.  It is easy for the layman who tries to familiarise himself with technical and semi-technical matters to be led astray by certain published articles but the Deputy might give the engineering staff in my Department credit for being aware of significant developments and improvements in techniques.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  It is not simply a matter of being aware of developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Micro-wave systems for the transmission of telephone signals and television programmes have been in use in my Department since the early sixties.  They have many advantages and they do not, as Deputy Burke suggested, provide a universal substitute for cables.  So far as the old Strowger equipment is concerned, it may surprise the Deputy to know that in the British Post Office whose modern methods he admired so much, about 98 per cent of the telephone equipment is of this kind.  In 1957 we started to use a more efficient type of exchange equipment known as Crossbar which had been developed by the Americans and the Swedes.  We standardised this equipment for new exchanges in 1962; at present 48 per cent of our exchange lines are of the Crossbar type as compared with 52 per cent of the Strowger type.  Eventually we will replace all the Strowger exchanges but this does not mean such equipment is old or inefficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strowger equipment is in use in many countries including the United States.  Some time ago when in Washington I was shown a Strowger exchange that had been in service for 40 years and I was told it would give many more years of service before they would consider replacing it.  Both <Col N="1338" /> Strowger and Crossbar exchanges are electro-mechanical and are in general use throughout the world.  Electronic exchanges are still in the development experimental stage and only a tiny proportion of such exchanges, mostly prototypes, are yet in use.  We do not propose using telephone exchanges of this kind until they have been proved elsewhere.  We have a new telex exchange on order which incorporates electronic features.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke inquired whether there were any further developments with pulse code modulation systems. There are very definite constraints on the application of PCM techniques to existing cables.  The type of cable must be suitable.  It must not be longer than about 25 miles or shorter than about eight miles and it must have a sufficiency of suitable spare circuits to enable the PCM system to be applied. Apart from the six routes mentioned in the notes for Deputies, there are no other existing routes which meet all these conditions.  However, new cable schemes of appropriate length are now being designed so that PCM equipment can be applied to them as and when required in the future.  I can assure the Deputy that this system will be used to the maximum extent possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke asked about the progress of a group studying latest developments in the field of transmission. I do not know what group he was referring to.  I mentioned in my statement that my Department had joined with other European telecommunications administrations in a special study of future prospects in the date transmission field and a report is expected early next year. Apart from that there are numerous international study groups established under the aegis of the International Telecommunications Union or the Conference of European Postal and Telecommunications Administrations which are considering various aspects on both the technical and operational aspects of telecommunications and through participation in or study of the reports of these study groups my Department keep abreast of developments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke quoted from an <Col N="1339" /> article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 21st October, 1972, in which a British businessman commented adversely on the telephone service here.  The man concerned was quoted as saying that he was appalled by the long delay in having telephones connected.  His firm took over an existing line and applied on 30th August, 1972, for the installation of a switchboard and extra line and four extensions.  On 20th September they asked for a further three exchange lines and two extensions, making five exchange lines and six extensions in all.  This involved providing a different type of switchboard from that first ordered and all of the first order and portion of the second had been met early in November, that is within aproximately two months. This requirement was in a difficult exchange area where, pending completion of a new exchange at present being installed, provision of telephones has to be restricted.  I think the indignant British businessman did not fare too badly at all.  He might well have had to wait much longer in most European countries, possibly not excluding Britain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to the fact that a person dialling 191 to report a fault is answered by a telephonist who has to pass the fault on to the technician in the appropriate automatic exchange and that this can cause misunderstanding and delays.  The system of centralised fault-recording used in the Dublin manual exchange is intended basically to enable scarce technical personnel to concentrate on attending to faults.  The operators who take the details follow clearly established procedures and there is no delay in having the necessary details passed to the technical staff.  Without this system a much greater technical staff would be required.  Of course if a person wishes, for some particular reason, to speak to a technical officer the operator will connect him on request. The Deputy suggested having a special telephone number for each exchange to receive fault reports, for example, 373737 for numbers beginning with 37.  We are looking for ways of improving the existing procedure and the Deputy's suggestion or some <Col N="1340" /> modification of it will certainly be considered.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy asked whether the requirement of rental in advance for new telephones acts as a brake on demand.  Of course it does and it is meant to.  If the requirement were dropped there would be an increase in demand and a waiting list.  On the other hand, the requirement is not unreasonable. Applicants are not being asked to pay extra but to lodge in advance the rental for which they are contractually liable.  The Deputy mentioned that administrations in other countries are in the position where they can almost say: &ldquo;Please take a telephone.&rdquo;  I am quite satisfied that very few, if any, administrations are in that happy position.  Most of the administrations we know of have long waiting lists.  For example, there were nearly a half-million on the waiting list in Great Britain at the end of September 1972.  At the beginning of 1972 there were over a half-million waiting for service in France, over 600,000 in West Germany, almost 200,000 in Italy and well over 100,000 in Holland.  It is certainly not available on request, as Deputy Burke seems to think.  They are not being pushed at people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to the provision of £533,000 under subhead F (3) of the Estimate for satellite and other international telecommunication circuits and asked about liaison with RTE in regard to satellite communications. The provision under subhead F (3) is made up of £330,000 for rentals on existing and additional international circuits and £200,000 for new capital investment in transatlantic satellite and cable facilities.  The figure for rental includes rentals on our direct circuits to European centres as well as on leased transatlantic circuits needed to carry the growing telephone and telex traffic between this country and the US and Canada.  Telecommunications satellites and cables are used as required to provide relay facilities for broadcasting organisations, including RTE. Those organisations pay for the occasional use in much the same way as the public pay when they make telephone calls.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> Deputy Paddy Burke and others referred to vandalism to kiosks.  I agree that this is a very serious problem, particularly in urban areas.  There has been a substantial increase in the incidence of vandalism in recent years and various measures have been taken to combat it&mdash;for example, by replacing glass with large sheets of strong plastic material, by fitting steel plates to which the coin-box can be bolted and by installing continuous fluorescent lighting.  A strong type of coin-box is also being experimented with.  My Department are fully conscious of the need to follow up all developments which would reduce the level of vandalism and we have been keeping in close touch with other administrations on this matter.  Special attention is being given to the maintenance for kiosks to ensure that they are kept in service as far as practicable. A large staff is engaged exclusively on this work in Dublin city, where almost 90 per cent damage by vandalism occurs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was eloquent on the subject of deficiencies in our telephone service.  He compared it very unfavourably with the service of other European countries.  I have made no claim that the telephone service is perfect and in my opening statement I explained some of the reasons for such deficiencies as exist, but I must confess to some feeling of irritation with this habit&mdash;only too common&mdash; of denigrating Irish services and praising those of other countries. Deputy Burke candidly referred to the fact that the telephone services in other countries are very far from perfect and indeed in many countries the telephone service is very distinctly inferior to the Irish telephone service. I think it would be very helpful if Deputy Desmond before making charges of this kind would seek a little experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond suggested that it was small consolation to people waiting for telephones here to be told of waiting lists in other countries.  This is a view with which I do not very seriously disagree but, when we come to review the telephone service, we must have regard to facts as we know them to exist in other countries as well as in Ireland.  The Deputy referred to a waiting list of 300,000 in Britain as compared with 22,000 here and he implied that, having regard to the comparable population of the two countries, 300,000 was substantially smaller.  I would respectfully suggest to the Deputy, even if he has his 300,000 instead of 600,000 today that he sharpens his pencil and have another try at getting his sums sorted out.  He might be surprised at the result.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to suggestions since this debate started and, I might add, without interrupting anybody.  I was very grateful to Deputy Desmond for the strong support he gave to my declaration in regard to the need for ample <Col N="1343" /> capital moneys to expand the telephone service at the desired rate.  He was critical of the failure to provide adequate capital in recent years for the telephone service and he suggested that the Minister for Finance was totally unresponsive to my request for additional capital.  He clearly had paid little attention to what I said in my opening statement.  In that statement I mentioned that in 1971-72 the original allocation of capital for telephone development was increased from £9.4 million to £11.11 million and for 1972-73 an allocation of £13.73 million has been approved.  The Deputy will not, I hope, be surprised if he finds me coming back here later in the year with a Supplementary Estimate for still more capital funds. I would be even more impressed by Deputy Desmond's support if, having been for three years, as he told us, principal spokesman for the Labour Party in the affairs of my Department, he had shown some understanding of the capital figures about which he was talking.  He said, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The answer to the problem is an injection of £10 million, £15 million or £20 million in order to bring back the telephone service to its proper communications role.</P>
      <P>Apparently Deputy Desmond regards the difference between £10 million and £20 million as of no consequence.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond also talked about what he described as starvation of capital over the last 15 years by successive Fianna Fáil Cabinets.  I have remarked already on the looseness with which the Deputy bandies figures of millions of pounds, but he is much more reticent on the subject of finding the money.  However, as we have had this charge by the Deputy in respect of the last 15 years, it is no harm to look at what happened in the three years immediately preceding that period of time.  In the ordinary course of administration the Department has internal committees for certain purposes.  There is, has been for a long time, a telephone development committee dealing with the expansion and development of the telephone service. During the years 1954 to 1957, when the Coalition Government were in office, engines were reversed and, instead of a telephone development committee a special telephone capital restrictions committee was set up to decide how best to carry out the Coalition Government's directives to cut down on expenditure on telephone capital development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more than 14 now and I can still remember something that happened then.  I am very happy to say that no Fianna Fáil Government have ever been driven to these straits.  In my opening statement I referred to shortages of capital, but these shortages should be seen in the context of an investment of approximately £96 million in the period from 1957 to 1973 as compared with a total previous investment of £17 million since the telephone service was established.  The State has not got a bottomless purse and the capital requirements of the telephone service have to be appraised alongside other capital needs of the economy.  I am more than hopeful that the progressive increases in the allocations of capital which my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has been glad to make available for telephone development will continue, and that it will be possible to devote to telephone <Col N="1345" /> development all the funds required to enable the service to be rapidly brought to the standard of perfection we would all like to see.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked for some information on the transmission of computer data by telephone.  Such date may be transmitted by a telephone subscriber to a computer centre, either over exclusive circuits rented from my Department or over the public telephone system.  For this purpose data transmission units, known as modems, are supplied and maintained by my Department on a rental basis.  If Deputy O'Donnell is interested in having further information in regard to these facilities and charges I shall be more than glad to forward it to him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy referred at some length to the interception of telephone calls in certain circumstances.  He was correct in thinking this was a matter for the Department of Justice rather than my Department.  The position is that telephone communications may be intercepted only in pursuance of warrants issued by the Minister for Justice.  I am not in a position to give further information on the matter. Deputy O.J. Flanagan's suggestion of temporary telephone operators being recruited to record calls on certain lines is too ridiculous to merit a reply.</P>
      <P>Comment was made on the rapid development of the telex service. There are now about 1,600 subscribers and automatic service is available to 21 of the 108 countries to which we have telex service, but these 21 account for 99 per cent of our international telex traffic.  We are anxious to have 100 per cent automatic service, but there are difficulties, the most obvious being absence of automatic service in the distant country. The number of telex circuits to the USA has been increased from the 27, mentioned by the Deputy, to 35.  Additional circuits can be provided quickly when required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke asked when the new exchanges in Galway and Limerick would be in operation.  We expect to have these in operation at the end of this year or very early in the new year. <Col N="1346" /> He also inquired about the waiting list of applicants for telex service. With the exception of about ten applications, which at the end of November could not be met because of temporary plant shortages, there is no waiting list for telex.  A similar position obtained generally at the end of November, 1971.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon suggested that the emergency services should be in bold print on the green pages.  The entries relating to the emergency services have been revised for the 1973 directory and I hope the Deputy will find the new format an improvement.</P>
    <P>It was with much interest that I noted that Deputies who spoke on the earlier stages of the debate with regard to the question of the application of the direction issued on 1st October, 1971, under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, were all persons who are, were, or had been actively employed by RTE on its various programmes.  I refer in particular to Deputy Thornley, an ex-employee of RTE, to Deputy Desmond who is rarely absent from the current affairs programmes and Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, who, coincidentally, happens to be their exclusive expert when they wish to have a special series of programmes prepared, and who also appears on others.</P>
    <P>It is, indeed, interesting that these people&mdash;and Deputy Garret FitzGerald whose absence from a current affairs programme on RTE might almost be regarded as a matter for surprise&mdash; have taken up the cudgels on behalf of RTE.  I do not for one moment suggest that in speaking on this subject they are not entirely disinterested, but a person less objectively minded than myself might fear they were.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Authority Act was passed in 1960.  It contained a provision which enabled the Minister to direct the authority, in writing, to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class. For 11 years that power was not used and, in 12 years, it has been used just once.  If this is tyranny, as has been suggested, I look to some other definition.  May I recall to the House that this direction was issued with the <Col N="1347" /> greatest reluctance.  It commanded not merely the general support of all parties in the House, but in the community at large.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thornley was kind enough to advise Deputies to listen to BBC programmes for the good of their education.  He also told us that he &ldquo;read the English papers quite a lot, another very educative exercise for Deputies,&rdquo; he said.  Deputy Thornley was very worried about the dictatorial power of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and suggested that the Broadcasting Authorities in Britain were not subject to any constraint such as the Oireachtas put in the 1960 Act. This is what Deputy Thornley said.  If Deputy Thornley, who is so anxious that Deputies should educate themselves by reading English newspapers, had not been too lazy to take the trouble to look at the BBC Handbook of 1972, he would have realised that his statement in regard to the freedoms of the BBC were totally wrong.</P>
    <P>He would have found that the BBC Charter provides for the appointment of the Board of Governors of the BBC by Order-in-Council.  Article 5 of the Charter provides for the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the BBC by Order-in-Council. Article 6 of the Charter provides for the dismissal of the BBC Governors by Order-in-Council.  To improve Deputy Thornley's education I shall quote for him from page 166 of the BBC handbook of 1972 which states:</P>
    <P>There are other obligations which are laid on the BBC not in the context of the Licence but in the form of &ldquo;Prescriptions&rdquo; from the Minister, acting within the powers vested in him by the Charter and by the Licence and Agreement. These prescriptions known as the Prescribing Memoranda serve as a kind of unpublished appendix in the Charter and Licence.</P>
    <P>One such memorandum elaborates on clause 13 (4) of the Licence by (i) requiring the BBC to refrain from expressing its own opinion on current affairs or on matters of public policy; (ii) forbidding <Col N="1348" /> the transmission of television images on very brief duration which might convey a message to or influence the minds of an audience without their being aware or fully aware of what was being done.</P>
    <P>The first of those two requirements underlines one of the major differences between the freedom of the Press and the freedoms of the broadcasting media in Britain; the fact that the newspapers are at liberty to editorialise on any subject they choose whereas the Broadcasting Authorities are specifically prevented from doing so.  The second requirement is a safeguard against &ldquo;subliminal&rdquo; advertising or indoctrination.</P>
    <P>I noted that the ex-Chairman of RTE, in appearances on television in Britain on a recent Sunday, did not question that the statutory position of RTE was more favourable than that of the BBC or ITV, instead of being less favourable as our broadcasting experts in this House thought.</P>
    <P>I am little interested in what the BBC or any other British television organisation arranges to do in regard to its broadcasts, but some Deputies and, in particular Deputy Thornley, seemed to be deeply moved by the attitude of the British communication authorities on this subject.  They may wish to know that, apart from the restrictions I have quoted, the BBC Chairman in a letter dated 19th June, 1964, accepted the &ldquo;BBC's duty to treat controversial subjects with due impartiality and to ensure that, so far as possible, programmes should not offend against good taste, or decency, or be likely to encourage crime and disorder, or be offensive to public feeling.&rdquo;  These last were regarded as obligations which the BBC imposed on itself, but their formal communication by the BBC's Chairman to the Minister, and the latter's formal acknowledgment of them, invested them with something of the nature of a prescription.</P>
    <P>I need hardly point out that these rules governing the BBC and ITV, to which some of the Labour Party Deputies and Fine Gael Party Deputies seem <Col N="1349" /> so devoted, are more restrictive than those of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  I fully recognise that the spokesmen of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party imagined that they were echoing views that would be expressed in Britain.</P>
    <P>Why the representatives of Opposition parties in particular cannot debate this subject on the basis of conditions in this country, instead of those in Britain, where conditions are so different, I do not know.  Regretfully I attribute it to their sense of inferiority. Apparently, for them what happens in Britain should happen here in regard to television and radio, regardless of the different circumstances.  When I say &ldquo;regardless of the different circumstances&rdquo; I am not talking of some minor matter of detail.  What the Fine Gael and Labour spokesmen seem to forget is that we are different countries, and with very different problems and, in particular, that Britain has not at this time to face the problems confronting this country.</P>
    <P>As a Minister and as a Member of the Government I cannot sit back and forget that over 600 people have met violent deaths recently and that many others have been sadly maimed because of the circumstances obtaining in this country.  I have a personal responsibility to see that, so far as my influence carries, I shall not give the opportunity to people of violence to use RTE as a recruiting platform to increase the death toll.</P>

      <P>I am answerable to this House for having issued a direction under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act which was included in that Act for the purpose of dealing with an emergency situation.  If any Member of the Opposition suggests that there is not now an emergency situation let him say so but, as long as I am Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I will do my duty to the best of my ability, and that includes the exclusion from RTE of the propagation of views aimed at stirring up further killings and sectarian hatred within this country.  Let no one be in doubt that when I talk of this <Col N="1350" /> country I mean the 32 Countries of Ireland.</P>
      <P>When I was preparing the first, stages of my reply to the debate in this House, as it went along, I was not prepared for the tragic events which have since occurred in Dublin.  I have been listening to the logic chopping of certain Deputies in the House and, as a reasonably experienced politician, ordinarily I would not mind in matters of lesser importance a certain amount of logic chopping and point scoring, but we have passed far beyond such things.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Thornley hold forth because, at one stage, he was in a position to conduct interviews on television.  Deputy Thornley set himself up as an expert on the basis of his minor, if profitable, employment in RTE.  He expressly objected to the following four provisions in regard to broadcasting in Ireland as imposing more direct ministerial control than the BBC has to endure.  First, he objected to the appointment of the chairman by the Government. Secondly, he objected to the power of the Government to remove a member of the authority from office and thirdly, the obligation of the authority &ldquo;to secure that when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the authority's own views.&rdquo;  Fourthly, he objected to the power given to the Minister under section 31 to direct the authority to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In none of these matters is RTE in a weaker position than the BBC. Deputy Thornley claims with pride that what he describes as the principal architect of a certain programme on the BBC had made the point that, very often they were able to broadcast that programme, only by concealing from the senior staff what they were doing until the last moment, by which time nobody could intervene. This is Deputy Thornley's standard. I leave it to this House and to the people to decide whether this is the <Col N="1351" /> way the staff of RTE behave.  I am confident that the staff of RTE would be the first to reject Deputy Thornley's ideal.  The Deputy suggested that the television journalist is alcoholic and excessively left-wing.  These are Deputy Thornley's words but I am confident that he is wrong.  He expressed the view also that it would be impossible for any assembly, however wise, to find language which would define impartiality in a manner that would be satisfactory.  Deputy Thornley went on to quote Deputy Richard Burke&mdash;no doubt to the great embarrassment of Deputy Burke&mdash;who, in his opening speech had asked if the Minister would not agree, now that RTE had received the opinion of the Oireachtas, that they could be expected to fulfil their role of trust in relation to the institutions of the State. Seldom can a Deputy have been answered so quickly and directly by the body concerned when, within a week of the question, they showed clearly that it was not possible to rely on them to fulfil that role.</P>
    <P>Might I digress at this stage to express some wonder that despite the events that Deputy Thornley foresaw occurring, he apparently failed to live up to his firm promise to catch the next plane for Uruguay?  I am sure that some of his own colleagues are more disappointed at this than I.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald in his usual two-faced way announced that he agreed heartily with every word Deputy Thornley had said.  He went on to say that the problem we faced here is the basic conflict that exists between the political authorities in any country and those concerned with communications. The Deputy added that it is a conflict which has not very much to do with parties.  He developed the idea of how, if he were Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, he would have no trouble in finding a dishonest and devious way of dealing with RTE. Happily, I take a different view.  I prefer the honest and straightforward attitude.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald went on to say that frequently he had listened to television programmes and detected what <Col N="1352" /> he thought was a biased viewpoint For example, he mentioned that during the EEC campaign he thought the predominant views that emerged was one of scepticism about the EEC. He added that to him it was not surprising that a particular group of people in RTE have shared assumptions and ideas which to him, and I gather he meant also the majority of people in the country, might be alien. He added also that this was true of other matters.  Deputy FitzGerald went further and referring back to January, 1969, when Deputy Thornley was not a Member of this House but was employed by RTE, he reminded us that he had said that every one of the programmes on politics that he had watched had involved comment, that every time he had listened to Mr. Thornley putting over a programme on the Oireachtas he was commenting on some point, that Mr. Thornley could not refer to the issue without comment, that he was giving an informed view on the subject and that whatever the Act may say or whatever the Minister may think, inevitably the officer of RTE will comment on public affairs as he goes along.</P>
    <P>I come now to what was, perhaps, one of the most extraordinary statements I ever heard in this House, even from Deputy FitzGerald.  Deputy FitzGerald said there is something inherently unbalanced about the idea of a Government deciding what is in the national interests.  Go bhfóire Dia orm.  I can hardly believe that any Deputy with any pretentions to a sense of responsibility could give expression to this idea.  I will let it go at that.  I am hopeful that the Deputy who is regarded by some as not being devoid of intelligence will realise how unwise was his expression.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan during the course of the debate on the Estimate pointed in an interesting fashion to the extent of Deputy FitzGerald's engagement in a professional and, I am sure, remunerative capacity by RTE. On this subject Deputy FitzGerald, while not denying the frequency of his paid appearances on RTE, referred to a problem some years ago which prevented his being employed, as he <Col N="1353" /> claimed, to speak on &ldquo;Thomas Davis Lectures&rdquo;.  Wisely or otherwise, the view of the recently departed authority on this sort of thing changed radically.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien who spoke later in an eloquent and moving manner on behalf of RTE was placed in a more favourable position than apparently was Deputy FitzGerald because the authority found no difficulty in engaging Deputy Cruise-O'Brien at what I hope was a handsome fee to appear actively on a programme called &ldquo;We, The Irish&rdquo;.  Before I dismiss Deputy FitzGerald's remarks regarding the Government, I consider myself bound to say that of all the persons in this House to speak of &ldquo;slight vanity that could easily blossom into arrogance&rdquo;, to quote the Deputy, he should be the last to give expression to the thought because few more arrogant men have ever sat on any bench on any side of this House.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald complained that the directive under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, 1960, was so imprecise as not to be effective.  He said that it did not specify who were the people to be kept off RTE or what were the statements that were not to be made.  He said that the matter was left so vague that if he were the authority he would not know how to proceed at that point. The Deputy has been severe in his censure in various respects and I find it difficult to imagine the degree of indignation that he would have expressed if I, as Minister, had named specific people to be kept off RTE.  I fear the Deputy might have exploded. I made no attempt to name those people.  The RTE Authority were composed of people who were assumed to be responsible citizens who could be expected to act according to their judgment.  I have not the slightest doubt that if I had decided to name people Deputy FitzGerald would have been one of the first to cry out his indignation at this arrogant expression of Government opinion.  The Deputy has used the occasion of the debate on the Estimate for my Department to make the most extravagant <Col N="1354" /> charges against the Government.  He has talked in terms of the Government not liking the truth to be told on RTE programmes.  Section 18 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, which was passed by the elected representatives of this country provides that:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the authority's own views.</P>
      <P>Both Deputies FitzGerald and Thornley regard the preservation of impartiality as a tiresome restriction to be evaded when possible.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien tells us that he read a very lucid and informative statement made by Deputy Burke during the debate and that he had heard the statement made by the Labour spokesman on Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Thornley, and also that made by Deputy FitzGerald.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien expressed pleasure at the harmony of thought that prevailed in all those statements and he was pleased to think that he would be able to set his own remarks into the same framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Deputy would have been able to fit his remarks more easily into the same framework if it had not been that Deputy Desmond had announced profoundly earlier in the debate that he was, to quote himself, &ldquo;the principal Labour Party spokesman appointed to speak on this Estimate&rdquo;.  Clearly Deputy Cruise-O'Brien does not know who is the spokesman for his party on this Estimate but I am confident that the two, or should I say the three Deputies, will be able to straighten this out between themselves and let us know at a later date what is the outcome. Deputy Cruise-O'Brien read a Labour Party declaration on this issue of the situation in regard to the Government and RTE.  He insisted that the statement was a unanimous one and that the Labour Party were entirely united on it.  This must have given great pleasure to the Labour Party, it being <Col N="1355" /> the first matter on which for many years they have been united.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien referred, in the course of the debate, with a nakedness which could almost be deemed indecent, to differences within the Labour Party.  He referred to the fact that Deputy Thornley whom he described as their spokesman on Posts and Telegraphs, and himself had taken different positions on various issues. Deputy Cruise-O'Brien talked of not having changed his mind and thinking that Deputy Thornley had not changed his mind; he did not mention what Deputy Desmond had done with his mind.  I suppose he did not read the <i>Cork Examiner</i> yesterday.  In view of present circumstances I have no intention of dealing with anything in relation to Mr. Mac Stiofáin personally because I think this House will recognise it is not my function to do so.</P>
    <P>The matter has been raised that the authority asked the Minister for clarification of his direction and that he refused to give any clarification.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien suggested that the intention was: &ldquo;It was up to them to construe it and if they construed it wrongly, that is to say differently from the Minister's own interpretation, his own construction of his own words, they would get it in the neck.&rdquo;  In fact, according to Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, the object of the direction was to set up a situation in which they could get it in the neck.  He said: &ldquo;Give them a directive that was so vague that almost anything they did was bound to violate it according to the Minister's interpretation which he held in reserve and then catch them when their pants were down on some suitable issue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and other Deputies who later spoke referred to the brutal, impetuous or heavy-handed way in which the former RTE Authority were dismissed.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, making his typical each way bet added: &ldquo;We are not saying that the State should have no concern about what is being broadcast in the public service broadcasting system.  We are not saying that the Minister should not have the right to talk to the authority and that he <Col N="1356" /> should not say: `Listen, my friends' we are worried about the handling of things in RTE.  We fear it may be promoting certain activities and certain kinds of sedition in this country&rdquo;'.</P>
    <P>A number of other Deputies subsequently echoed the same view that I, as a Minister, should have sat down with the authority and discussed with them their problems in regard to the implementation of the direction issued under section 31.  This was suggested. Other Deputies were more than ready to suggest that if I opened my mouth to the authority I would be guilty of improper interference with them in the performance of their duty.  It is quite clear that so far as the Opposition Deputies are concerned there is nothing the Minister can do in relation to the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority which is right.  However, I share the view expressed by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and others that it was right that I should talk candidly to the authority about the situation that existed and the uneasiness which I and my colleagues in the Government felt about how the affairs of the authority were being conducted in relation to current affairs programmes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien expressed it well when he said he would find it hard to believe that the authority would have been altogether heedless of the Minister's view &ldquo;gently expressed&rdquo;.  I have great sympathy with the view expressed by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and echoed by later Opposition speakers. Indeed, I have more than sympathy for them.  In fact, before he expressed his views, I had done exactly what he in this debate said he would like to see done.</P>
    <P>On the 23rd June last I asked the full authority to meet me and I explained to them my sense of uneasiness about the trend of events in RTE just as Deputy Cruise-O'Brien apparently would have wished.  I indicated my views very, very clearly to the authority on that occasion.  In view of the fact that, in opening the meeting of the 23rd June, 1972, with the authority I indicated I wished the proceedings of the meeting to be treated as confidential I am reluctant to disclose the full statement I made on that <Col N="1357" /> occasion.  If the House wishes me to do so, it will give me great pleasure to say fully what I said on that occasion in view of the suggestion that the authority were under some misapprehension about the interpretation of the direction under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.  If there is anybody who wants to hear what I said, I will let him know what I said.  If I have any takers, I will be only more than glad to oblige.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, of course. Was I not asked for it?  I notice it was not by any of the kind-hearted gentlemen in the Deputy's party.  I continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me preface my remarks by saying that the proceedings here today are confidential although, of course, the fact that a meeting is taking place is well known.  I had decided some time ago that I would like to meet the authority for the purpose of conveying to them my views of certain aspects of radio and television programmes.  It is, perhaps, a little unfortunate that before this meeting could be arranged developments in the Dáil arising out of a Parliamentary question and an Adjournment debate made it necessary for me to say publicly, in advance of this meeting, some of the things which it had been my intention to say here.  However, <Col N="1358" /> the discussions in the Dáil and other public comments have clearly shown that my uneasiness about certain matters is widely shared in the community.  The comments which I wish to make relate to one area of the authority's responsibilities, namely, current affairs programmes.  I fully recognise that these programmes present serious problems for RTE but I feel it necessary to stress the influence which some of these programmes may have on matters affecting the welfare and, indeed, the safety of the State.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the circumstances surrounding the radio programme of <i>This Week</i> broadcast in June 1971, containing an interview with two Belfast members of the Provisionals will have remained fresh in the minds of members of the authority. They will recall that this programme was put on by RTE in face of the stated opinion of the Taoiseach that he was very concerned about the proposed broadcast because it would be likely to encourage recruitment for the Provisionals and that he wished to have this part of the programme dropped.  I may remark in passing that it is sufficient evidence of my reluctance to intervene in programme matters that no direction was given that the programme be modified or withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Subsequently the Taoiseach made the Government's view clear in the Dáil that members of an illegal organisation should not be permitted to use such RTE broadcasts to publicise their aims and activities. Despite all this, RTE arranged for a further programme on the 28th September containing interviews with two IRA members.  Before that programme was broadcast, I discussed fully and at considerable length with the chairman the undesirability of going ahead with it and so giving these IRA men a platform for their propaganda.  I urged most strongly that it should not be broadcast but the authority decided to set their own judgment of the public interest above that of the Government although important considerations of <Col N="1359" /> national security were clearly involved. As a result, it was necessary for me, with the approval of the Government, to give a direction under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, the first ever given.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated in the Dáil, and I repeat now, that while I do not say there has been any breach of the section 31 direction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>this was last June&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;many programmes have given rise to grave unease on the part of the Government and myself because of their likely harmful effect on the national interest.  It would clearly be impossible to go into detail about all of these programmes since they are not specially watched and criticisms are not noted down except where something particularly objectionable comes under notice.</P>
    <P>But the conclusion is inescapable. The programmes have frequently been seriously unbalanced and RTE have been giving far too much publicity to various groups and individuals who persist in various ways in defending the use of violence and those who practise it.  At times these people have been enabled to try to upset the efforts of others who are trying hard to have violence ended.  For instance, on RTE the limited publicity given to the efforts of the Derry women and of Fr. O'Neill to bring about an end to IRA hostilities in Derry was discounted by counter-publicity which suggested that the peacemakers were not representative.</P>
    <P>In a recent Dáil debate on the Adjournment of the House Deputy L'Estrange, speaking for the Fine Gael Party, gave many examples of items which made him feel that programmes tended at times to be biassed and unbalanced.  A recent example of the sort of programming which assists the subversive elements was the arranging that the Taoiseach's statement on the 22nd of May that stronger measures were contemplated against the IRA should be followed by a counter-statement by Mr. Ruarí <Col N="1360" /> Ó Bradhaigh to the effect that such measures would not be passively accepted by &ldquo;republicans&rdquo;.  The views of other political parties were not given and I assume that they were not approached for their views.  Mr. Ó Braidagh is not, of course, an elected public representative.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Malley, the Minister for Justice, was reported incorrectly as describing the prisoners responsible for the riots at Mountjoy Jail as &ldquo;political prisoners&rdquo; although the Minister went to pains to point out that all the people concerned had been charged with ordinary criminal offences.  Such prisoners were also referred to as &ldquo;republicans&rdquo;, again giving these advocates of force and violence an aura and a status to which they were not entitled.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any instructions exist in RTE in regard to the careful use of words and expressions which tend to confer unwarranted status on illegal and subversive groups such as giving high-sounding military titles to IRA men.</P>
    <P>The amount of broadcasting time given in recent months to Ruairí Ó Bradaigh and Tomás Mac Giolla to explain and defend the views and arguments of the Provisional and Official IRA has hardly been in accord with the spirit of the direction under section 31 given to RTE.  On the day following my statement in the Dáil that I was unhappy with the amount of publicity given to certain groups RTE put on an interview with Mr. Seán Ó Bradaigh on how he felt about hunger strikes.</P>
    <P>Many people consider that the Féach programme series has over a long period been unbalanced. I would suggest that members of the authority should judge for themselves by viewing a representative selection of Féach programmes broadcast over a period.</P>
    <P>I have stated in the Dáil and elsewhere that the country is entitled to expect the utmost care and restraint from RTE in their treatment of violence and of people who support <Col N="1361" /> its continuation.  I am sorry to say that I do not consider that sufficient care and restraint have been exercised.</P>
    <P>The incidents to which I referred were representative of many which in sum suggest to me that there may not be sufficient control within the RTE organisation of programmes dealing with news and current affairs.  I am not concerned with the details of arrangements for securing that extreme elements in the community are not given excessive publicity but I must concern myself with the end product.  The authority has a statutory responsibility to ensure objective and impartial presentation of news and current affairs programmes and it has a general responsibility to the community not to help those who try to foster unrest and violence by giving them a platform for their views or by giving encouragement in other ways.</P>
    <P>It is with regret that I find it necessary to speak in these terms to the authority and I would not do so if I did not feel that it was an inescapable duty on my part. But, I have an ultimate responsibility to the Oireachtas which I shall not shirk.</P>
    <P>That is what I said to these people in June, 1972.  If anybody feels that that was not spelling it out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would be wrong of me to suggest that the members of the authority did not feel that they had an answer to some of these criticisms and that they felt they had been endeavouring to do their duty to the best of their ability.  I did not find the answers given to be convincing but, having made my position clear and having made the position of the Government clear in regard to the direction issued under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, as it had been made clear on a number of previous occasions to the chairman, I felt it was completely unnecessary to elaborate further.</P>
      <P>A prolonged discussion extending over three hours took place between myself and the authority, at the end of which the authority could not have been left in any doubt&mdash;and they were not in any doubt whatever&mdash;about where their duty lay in regard to the observance of the direction issued under section 31 of the Act as approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the course of this prolonged debate reference has been made to the dismissal of the RTE Authority at such short notice.  I am at a loss to understand how long notice the Deputies felt the authority should have been given, when, after the previous reminders, they had failed again in their duty to carry out their statutory obligations. There has been a great deal of talk in this debate about the vagueness of the direction given to the RTE Authority under section 31 and their attempts to clarify what the direction meant and my reluctance to spell it out for them and to clarify it still further for them in words of one syllable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and others made the charge that the direction issued was phrased in vague language and that this was done deliberately to set a trap for the authority.  I feel sure that the Deputies, including the present Acting Chairman, who made the suggestions realise, as I do, that the <Col N="1363" /> charges they made are entirely without substance.  If there is any Deputy in this House who, setting aside nonsense and posturing, is in any genuine doubt of mind about it I must ask him is he convinced that this direction was contravened.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by several Deputies to a letter sent to me by the authority shortly after they received the direction on the 1st of October, 1971, seeking clarification of the direction. I regarded the authority's letter in relation to what was a perfectly clear directive as somewhat less than candid. Neither the authority nor any other responsible body of intelligent people would have been in any doubt whatever about the meaning of the direction. I am fully satisfied that the RTE Authority were under no misapprehension whatever, despite the pretence of their letter.  Nevertheless, in the course of my long discussion with the authority I underlined for them various ways in which I considered the authority, without actually contravening the direction, were sailing close to the wind.</P>
    <P>Deputy E. Collins of Waterford has mentioned a statement by Professor Moody saying&mdash;and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;If the measure of freedom that RTE has had is now to be drastically restricted one of the first casualties will be truth.&rdquo; The answer to this is simple.  It is that the measure of freedom that RTE has had is not going to be drastically restricted or restricted at all but RTE will be expected, as the former authority were expected&mdash;unfortunately, with excessive reliance on their recognition of the responsibility reposing on them &mdash;to carry out their duty in seeing to the implementation of the law as laid down by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Deputy E. Collins referred to a statement made by the former chairman of RTE about letters exchanged between him and me in an attempt to clarify the situation and to get guidance. Deputy Collins is a very innocent man if he accepts these statements as presented. May I bring the Deputy's mind back to the fact that long before the direction was issued, programmes had been put on by the authority which were calculated to encourage and support <Col N="1364" /> violent subversive elements in the community?</P>
    <P>For a very long time I held back from issuing any direction because of my reluctance to intervene in the affairs of the authority in regard to their programmes. As I have mentioned, there was the occasion on which, despite appeals to the authority from the Taoiseach, with all the special information at his disposal, to refrain from publishing a certain part of a programme publicising Provisional leaders, the authority decided completely to ignore and disregard the Taoiseach's advice.  On that occasion we did not do anything to prevent the programme from going out and no direction was issued.  But the Taoiseach, as I mentioned earlier, subsequently spoke freely and openly in this House about the dangers of the course the authority were following.</P>
    <P>Despite the statement by the Taoiseach, despite the views I had communicated to the chairman, the RTE Authority decided that their judgment on the safety of the country was better informed than that of the Taoiseach and the Government, and they put out the boadcast which led to the issue of the direction.</P>
    <P>Some months after the issue of that direction, I brought to the notice of the authority many instances in which they had been sailing close to the wind and where it was felt they were risking national safety.  I appealed to the members of the authority to give their personal attention to current affairs programmes on delicate national issues with a view to ensuring that matters dangerous to the welfare of the State would not be broadcast.  Nevertheless, as the culminating item we had this broadcast on 19th November, 1972, giving the substance of an interview with Mr. Mac Stiofáin.  While the authority are at all times formally responsible for the programmes broadcast, they had a special direct personal responsibility in relation to this broadcast in view not only of what had happened previously but also because of my request to them to take special care in regard to broadcasts on sensitive issues.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to give further publicity to what Mr. Mac Stiofáin <Col N="1365" /> said in that programme, but those Deputies who heard it know what was reported as having been said by him. I should like to assure the House that this is not a time for playing with words.  I am not interested in Opposition devices, speaking artificially about the vagueness of a direction.  The former authority themselves recognised and admitted that an error had been made which they delicately referred to as an editorial error.  They did not have the courage or the sense of responsibility to acknowledge that they and not subordinates carried the responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in the course of this debate that having admitted an editorial error had been made, the authority should have been excused from all responsibility.  The authority had been given an express direction, the only direction issued under section 31 of the 1960 Act, a fact which indicated the seriousness with which the whole matter was regarded.  Furthermore, in the course of a long discussion which I had with the authority, I reminded them of their personal and direct responsibility to see that the national interest was protected by carrying out the terms of the direction.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in the course of the debate that the authority, having admitted an editorial error of judgment, promised to take adequate steps to prevent a recurrence.  This is incorrect, and even if they had made such a promise I would not have been able to accept it.  The authority had displayed a continued failure to interest themselves personally, as was their duty, in seeing that the law was carried out, and it was too late in the day to accept new offers that in future the direction would be carried out.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all the facts leading up to the reluctant issuing of the direction, to the subsequent appeals to the authority to observe the direction, to the final blatant breach of the direction without a word or expression of regret by the authority for their total failure of duty, I make no apology whatsoever for having removed them from office.  They had proved themselves clearly to be unfit to hold office. I am sorry to have to speak in such <Col N="1366" /> strong terms about a group of people who had done much good work in the conduct of the affairs of RTE, but what was and what is at stake here was a matter of vital national interest affecting the lives and deaths of citizens of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies suggested that the re-appointment of the members of the authority last May indicated that I was entirely satisfied with the performance of their functions in the preceding period.  I fail to see how those Deputies arrived at that conclusion. Quite clearly with the Broadcasting Review Committee sitting and expected to report in a reasonably brief period, the balance of advantage seemed to be in re-appointing the existing authority, whether or not I had doubts about some or all of the authority members. I do not suggest I had such doubts but I was quite satisfied to re-appoint the members for a period of one year more.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by several Deputies that in connection with the dismissal of the authority I must have concluded that the members were either supporting subversion of the organs of State or that they were sympathetic to that point of view.  Those suggestions emanated from the Deputies and not from me.  I had every confidence that the great majority of the authority members were people with a high sense of responsibility and that they were very far from wishing to support elements in the community whose object is subversion by violence.</P>
    <P>I had to concern myself with how they carried out their duties, and however reluctant many of them would have been to lend support to the forces of violence in the country, the fact is that they failed in their duty to make such arrangements as would have ensured that RTE would not be used as a platform for these forces of violence.  Without reflecting at all on the authority in general as a body of responsible people, I am bound to draw attention to the fact that one former member of the authority within two days of his dismissal from that body appeared on a public platform of what is termed the Provisionals.  I am sure his new sympathies were not gained overnight.</P>
    <P>If time permitted, but it does not, <Col N="1367" /> it would give me great pleasure to analyse the various statements by members of the Opposition in regard to this whole matter.  They are so confused as to be totally baffling.  One would imagine on reading the contributions made by various Deputies, in particular by members of the Labour Party as well as some members of the Fine Gael Party, that the dismissed authority had not been appointed by the Government but were a group of people appointed by some different body and that the Government had stepped in to remove them and replace them by the Government's own nominees.  To such fatuities the Opposition Deputies have descended. They have been so carried away that they forget that the outgoing authority were appointed by the Government in exercise of the powers conferred by the Houses of the Oireachtas in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, that the authority were removed from office in accordance with the powers conferred and that the new authority likewise have been appointed by the Government in pursuance of these powers.</P>
    <P>I could go on at length to discuss the criticisms made by various Deputies of the action I have taken in this matter.  If time permitted, I should love to have the opportunity to deal with each Deputy in succession and the two-faced attitudes adopted and the internal contradictions in the statements made by different Deputies.  For instance, I could refer to Deputy Michael O'Leary's enthusiasm for the views expressed by Captain Brooke who appears to have endeared himself to that Deputy.  Deputy O'Leary apparently was very impressed by editorials in the British press expressing criticism of the Government's action.  It is too much to expect that Deputy O'Leary and other Deputies like him, particularly those in the Labour Party, would come around to thinking of Irish affairs in the context of Ireland without constantly looking over their shoulders at the British press and what the British press may think or pretend to think.</P>

      <P>We had Deputy Fitzpatrick worrying about the problems that the direction presented to the authority&mdash;how were they to interpret it?  He went on:</P>
      <P>It could be said I suppose that to broadcast anything suggesting that a person holds very strongly that violent means are the only methods of solving the problems in Northern Ireland would violate the direction.  I suppose that in a speech by a leading member of an illegal organisation to the effect that he believes the right way to unite the country was by physical force and the only way to get the British out of Northern Ireland was to bomb them out, the reporting of such a speech would be and could be regarded as violating the directive.</P>
      <P>Yet the same Deputy goes on to say that the authority got no proper direction from the Minister and that he was confirmed in his opinion that the Mac Stiofáin interview broadcast had nothing to do with the sacking of the authority.  This was Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, front bencher of Fine Gael from Cavan.  I do not know whether it is possible for a Deputy to become more two-faced and more hypocritical than Deputy Fitzpatrick showed himself in these statements.</P>
      <P>But almost all the Opposition, who criticised the action taken to implement the direction issued by statutory authority, agreed, as, indeed, they had to agree, that the RTE Authority themselves realised that the direction had been contravened.  Nevertheless, I confess to a feeling of disappointment that Deputy Tom O'Higgins should have largely re-echoed the speech of Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick.  Deputy O'Higgins suggested that the decision to dismiss the former RTE Authority had been taken immediately after the critical broadcast and before the authority were asked for their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe for one moment that Deputy O'Higgins believes this to be true, and I know that it is absolutely false.  The RTE Authority were given an opportunity, a full opportunity of stating what action <Col N="1369" /> they intended to take in relation to the broadcast which had been so wrongly put out, not as a first failure on their part but as the last of many failures, as I have already indicated. Deputy O'Higgins's suggestion is unworthy of him and I find it disappointing coming from a man of his stature and reputation.  Indeed, I would have expected that Deputy O'Higgins would have realised that the present is not a time for playing politics in the matter of the security of this country and the maintenance of order.  Maybe he had not heard Deputy Cosgrave's speech at that stage.  Nevertheless, Deputy O'Higgins went on to say:</P>
    <P>If you intend to get a new authority you must, first of all, have them ready and handpicked.  Some of the new authority that has been appointed say that greatness suddenly descended on them without any expectation, to their amazement, but whether it descended without any prior knowledge, the fact is that there is now a handpicked bunch to run Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>How the Deputy would have described every previous authority appointed in exactly the same way as this authority was appointed I leave it to the imagination of Deputies, and I am sure their imagination will not be over-strained. Quite obviously, if an authority are appointed by the Government they must be selected by the Government, and this crude reference to a handpicked bunch is certainly unworthy of Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>The members of the new authority have taken office in a situation of very great difficulty and at a time of great national trial and in order to do a duty to the nation.  I am very grateful to them for having accepted office which is extremely onerous and which I know has been accepted by them only out of a sense of national duty.  One does not mind the minor minions of the Fine Gael Party trying to score small political points but one is entitled to expect from Deputy O'Higgins some responsible attitude.  I am afraid he has betrayed himself.  His colleague Deputy Clinton said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> I, like many others, from time to time got the impression that there were certain people employed in RTE who felt that they and only they knew what public opinion was and what the right view was, and there is no doubt that they set out to mould and lead public opinion rather than report.</P>
    <P>He went on:</P>
    <P>I think that is a wrong function and I think those employees of RTE should be told that by somebody in a position to tell them.  I do not think it is the job of the Government.  If they appoint an authority, the authority should deal with it.</P>
    <P>I think it is reasonable to ask Deputy O'Higgins what he thinks the Government should do in such circumstances. Unfortunately, the rules of debate on my Estimate do not give Deputy O'Higgins the opportunity which I am sure he would very much wish to have to reply to my question, but I am confident that a man of his integrity will find another opportunity of doing so before long.</P>
    <P>At the risk of appearing repetitive, let me sum up the position in regard to this debate as I see it.  Members of the Opposition parties have accused the Government and myself of having acted tyrannically and in a spirit of panic in removing the authority for having failed to carry out the terms of the direction which was too vague originally and which I refused to clarify.  To me this seems to be the charge.  I want to rebut it totally and completely.  The facts are that before ever a direction was given to the authority and given most reluctantly, I had indicated to the chairman&mdash;and the Taoiseach had intervened to have indicated to the chairman&mdash;that a programme proposed to be put out in June, 1971, featuring prominent members of the IRA was contrary to the national interest.</P>
    <P>Despite all advice the authority proceeded, as they were entitled in law to do, however unwisely, to put out this programme.  Subsequently, there was a debate in this House on the whole subject in the course of which the Taoiseach indicated clearly <Col N="1371" /> his view as to where the authority's national duty lay in regard to violent and subversive elements in the community and their use of RTE as a platform for recruitment.  Again, after having sailed very close to the wind on a number of occasions and having been so informed by me in the course of a lengthy discussion in June of 1972, the authority thought fit to allow a situation to develop in which a broadcast was made on November 19th last which they themselves agreed should not have been broadcast.  Looking to the background it was their job and their job personally to see that this did not happen.  When questioned as to what action they proposed to take in regard to that broadcast, they returned a longwinded and waffling reply which admitted that the programme should not have been broadcast in the form in which it was broadcast but offered no apology, no expression of regret, no indication that the authority as such accepted responsibility and no adequate assurance that this sort of thing would not be allowed to happen again.</P>
    <P>This was the authority's attitude and so far as I was concerned and so far as the Government were concerned, this was not good enough. The authority had shown themselves in this respect quite irresponsible despite the many virtues they may have in other directions, and the Government, looking to the conditions in the country at the present time, had no alternative but to dismiss the authority and to appoint a new authority which it was hoped and is hoped confidently will carry out the statutory duties imposed on them by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The people will not be long sorting the Deputy out.  It might not be too long after Christmas either.  I take this opportunity of offering my thanks to one member of the Opposition and only one, Deputy Peter Barry, who had the graciousness to wish the incoming authority well.</P>
      <P>I have heard with regret, not to say disgust, of the deplorable attitude adopted by the Labour Party administrative council towards a member of that party who as a matter of national duty accepted office as a member of the RTE Authority.  We are accustomed to hearing the cries of horror from the Labour Party regarding suggested victimisation in various forms whether in relation to labour disputes or in the broader political field, but here in relation to this man who has shown a true spirit of patriotism in a time of national need, the Labour Party has nakedly shown its vicious vindictiveness.  The Labour Party administrative council have endeavoured to impose sanctions on a member of the party who has taken on a task of national importance.  This is really the jackboot attitude and I can only hope that the administrative council is not representative of the Labour Party.  I do hope and believe that this gentleman will realise how little value should be attached to the Labour Party's vindictive attitude.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary for me within the next few months, sometime after Christmas, to bring before the House a Bill in relation to the finances of Radio Telefís Éireann.  I sincerely hope that those Deputies who were carried away during this long debate and who expressed themselves unwisely and ungraciously in regard to the new authority will take advantage, as they should, of the opportunity to make proper amends to a patriotic group of men who, as I have indicated, have accepted office at an exceedingly difficult time and certainly under very difficult conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that, on this particular subject <Col N="1373" /> I should like to conclude my remarks. I hope and trust it will never again be necessary for me or, indeed, for any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to reply to a debate of the sort we have heard here over the past few weeks, to which I do not propose to attach any descriptive label.  Those members who have read the debate and those members of the public who may do so, may attach their own label.</P>
    <P>Moving on to general matters concerning RTE, several Deputies have commented on individual RTE programmes or series of programmes and matters of day to day administration which come within the bailiwick of the RTE Authority.  I have no doubt that all the suggestions made by Deputies will be more than carefully considered by Radio Telefís Éireann.  The question of unsatisfactory reception of Radio Éireann television in many parts of the country has been raised by many Deputies.  The solution of this problem is primarily a matter for the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority.  I have, however, a very great deal of sympathy with viewers in these areas and I have made it clear to the authority that I consider it important that this problem should be solved as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies favoured the establishment of a second television channel or multi-channel viewing in those parts of the country where reception of BBC and ITV is not possible at present.  Deputy Richard Burke referring to the present situation claimed rather touchingly that we were failing to observe the injunction that all the children of the nation should be cherished equally.  In advocating at very great length the provision of a second RTE television channel Deputy Burke failed to make it clear how this action would result in all the children of the nation being cherished equally.  Even if a second or, indeed, a third RTE programme were to be provided, the situation would remain that people living in the area of reception of BBC and ITV programmes would still have access to programmes not available to other children of the nation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned the possibility of setting up local radio stations.  He was also very worried, as <Col N="1374" /> I think was Deputy Burke, about what they regarded as the precarious state of Radio Telefís Éireann's finances. Deputy Desmond was also disturbed about the growing dependence of Radio Telefís Éireann on advertising revenue. He was, however, as usual, extremely coy about where all the money was to come from to relieve the financial straits which he described and to expand the television service.  He helpfully said:</P>
    <P>I believe the future financial needs of the authority will have to be effectively met by the Government.</P>
    <P>Rather unhelpfully, he did not mention where he expects the Government to find the money and, in particular, whether he favours a substantial increase in the licence fee to relieve RTE's dependence on advertising revenue and to improve its financial condition.  Deputy Burke likewise disclaimed any suggestion that he was advocating an increase in the licence fee.</P>
    <P>As regards the various suggestions made for radical changes in the control or operation of RTE, I have no doubt that the Broadcasting Review Committee will make a comprehensive review of the existing position and I should prefer to await its report before coming to any conclusions about radical changes but, off the cuff, I would say that I would be one of the happiest Members in the House if we had alternative viewing in the single channel area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond boasted that the Labour Party had made a submission of their views to the review committee. I assume that all the suggestions put forward by him during the debate have been brought to the notice of the committee.  He showed himself well informed about some of the committee's proceedings, which are, of course, conducted in private.  He berated the Fianna Fáil Party for not having submitted the party's views on the future of broadcasting to the review committee.  He apparently does not appreciate the fact that the Government and I as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs are members of the Fianna Fáil Party and that having appointed <Col N="1375" /> a very distinguished group of people to advise me on the future of broadcasting it would be impolite, to say the least, to turn around and offer to advise the review committee on this subject.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Burke felt it was wrong of the Minister for the Gaeltacht to have publicly criticised RTE in respect of Radio na Gaeltachta programmes. There was also criticism about the suggestion that Ministers might make representations directly or, as I think it was put, covertly, to RTE. So, it appears that some Deputies think that Ministers should be precluded from criticising RTE in public or in private.  For myself, I think every Deputy, every Minister and every citizen has a public right to criticise Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tom O'Donnell urged me to speed up the plans for providing improved reception of RTE sound programmes in Britain.  As already announced, the Athlone transmitter is being replaced by a more powerful one which will give improved reception of RTE radio throughout Ireland and in a large part of Britain.  I have already directed the authority to treat this as a matter of top priority.  I understand the new transmitter is expected to be in operation early in 1975.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Burke suggested that I should appoint an advisory council to which the authority or the director or both could turn for advice and referred to section 21 of the 1960 Act which provides for such a council.  If the authority consider that such a council would be useful to them, I shall, of course, be prepared to consider a request from them for the establishment of one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke also asked me when replying to let him know if it was my intention to extend the hours of broadcasting.  The short answer to that is that I have no formal proposal from the authority for such an extension.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke in favour of developing multi-channel wire television systems as a means of providing <Col N="1376" /> a choice of programmes in Cork, Waterford and other parts where BBC and ITV programmes cannot be received at present.  I sympathise with the desire to have a choice of television programme.  I must agree with Deputy Burke that the solution of this problem on a national basis is not to be found by extension of relay systems.  There are many difficulties in the way of extending multi-channel viewing facilities to areas which do not at present receive BBC and ITV programmes but I propose to mention only the main points here.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to permit multi-channel wire television systems in areas in which external signals can be received off the air but it becomes a different matter when the external signals have to be transported by micro-wave link or coaxial cable for distribution in other areas.  If this were permitted complicated copyright problems would arise and it is certain that wire television systems would be provided only in large centres of population because of the cost involved.  If multi-channel wire television systems involving the use of micro-wave links were provided in certain cities and towns the question would inevitably arise of giving multi-channel reception facilities to the entire country.  This would involve establishing a separate transmitter network for such external programme service to re-broadcast the signal.  It is estimated that the cost of providing one such service would amount to something like £4 million.</P>
    <P>Deputies Richard Burke and James Tully spoke about extending RTE television coverage into the North. This is something that I agree is highly desirable.  In order to avoid interference with other transmissions as far as possible, the frequencies, power and siting of transmitters are regulated by international agreement. The frequencies, <i>et cetera</i>, allocated to Ireland by international agreement. would not enable RTE transmissions to be received over the Six Counties in Northern Ireland.  Consideration is, however, being given at present to the question of finding a solution to this problem.  I should like to assure <Col N="1377" /> Deputy Burke I am actively pursuing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy L.  Belton used figures quoted in a newspaper report to suggest that if the permitted number of outlets per mast were increased from 500 to 5,000 the total capital cost per house for wired television systems would drop from £9 to 90p per house. The Deputy has obviously misread the article because the figure of £4,500 quoted in it was stated to be the cost of materials alone for the mast capable of servicing 500 or 5,000 subscribers. My understanding is that the total capital cost of wired television systems works out at an average of between £20 and £30 per house and that the cost of the mast represents only about 20 per cent of the total. Increasing the number of outlets per mast would result in some reduction in the cost per house but the reduction would be far less spectacular than the Deputy suggested.  Deputies Treacy and Belton felt that the present limit of 500 outlets for wired television system should be considerably increased.  As Deputies are aware, the erection of multi-channel wired television systems was virtually prohibited for many years.  Only systems servicing up to 10 houses or a single block of flats were allowed.  The main reason for this limitation was the need to protect the revenue earning capacity of the national television service which could be expected to suffer if its legitimate advantage of better quality reception were to be taken away.  An exception was made in 1966 for the Ballymun estate where special circumstances existed but it was not until March, 1970 that the Government decided to relax restrictions on multi-channel wired television development. I should like to emphasise that the position was to relax the restriction, not to remove it altogether.  It was decided at that time to permit wired television systems to cater for not more than 500 outlets each.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy in referring to wired television said that it was alleged&mdash; note &ldquo;alleged&rdquo;&mdash;that I had sabotaged RTE's plans to provide multi-channel reception facilities outside the present multi-channel area in a variety of <Col N="1378" /> ways, one of them being the insistence on a limit of 500 outlets per mast. This allegation of Deputy Treacy's is completely untrue.  The plans described in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> article of 20th October, 1972, which have been referred to during this debate, were never submitted to my Department. As I have said, the limit of 500 outlets per system was adopted on the advice of RTE.  I am well aware that individual systems can be designed to cater for more than 500 outlets each and that the existence of this restriction creates problems for those engaged in providing piped television systems.  The question of increasing the present limit is under consideration at present but I cannot say what the result of that consideration will be.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to colour television on RTE.  I have indicated on a number of occasions that I regard it as undesirable at present for RTE to introduce regular or studio transmissions in colour.  Apart from the immediate expense for the authority, account must be taken of the effect on the economy as a whole, for example, the dissipation of national resources on imported colour television sets.  The desirability was mentioned of producing a studio colour programme on special occasions, for example, for an important news conference.  I have no doubt that RTE can make suitable arrangements for occasions of this kind and I would not object to such special arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputies Begley, Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins and John O'Leary had some very hard things to say about Radio na Gaeltachta.  I am not responsible for the programmes or the day-to-day administration of Radio na Gaeltachta and I am naturally reluctant to intervene in such matters.  Moreover, allowance has to be made for the fact that Radio na Gaeltachta has been on the air only since last Easter Sunday and is still finding its feet, so to speak.  I am, however, concerned about the allegations made during the debate that the service is being used to cause mischief and disruptions in Kerry, that the programmes are very slanted and that there seems to be no editorial supervision.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind Deputies of the criticisms made by the Minister for the Gaeltacht on 19th August, 1972, in an address to Comhairle Radio na Gaeltachta.  He said that the anti EEC bias in Radio na Gaeltachta's treatment of the EEC referendum question was quite unrepresentative of the views of Gaeltacht people and aroused considerable resentment. He went on to say:</P>
      <P>I want to make it plain that people employed by Radio na Gaeltachta do not have a right to use the community-owned service to blatantly propagate their own particular viewpoint.  The radio service is not their property.  It belongs to the community and they have a right to expect a balanced and fair presentation.... It is not the aim of the Government nor, indeed, of any democratic party in Dáil Éireann to curb legitimate criticism or dissent. The Government do, however, have an obligation to the community to ensure fairness and balance and see that the broadcasting media are not monopolised by unrepresentative minority and sometimes subversive viewpoints.</P>
      <P>I propose to raise with the authority the criticisms made during this debate which concern the question of Radio na Gaeltachta's observance of the principles of objectivity and impartiality laid down in section 18 of the Act of 1960.</P>

      <P>Deputies Coughlan and Treacy referred to the break in television transmissions which RTE recently introduced on Sunday afternoons. They questioned the suggestion in a report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 12th November, 1972 that RTE's decision was the result of a refusal by me to authorise additional hours of television broadcasting on Sunday afternoons.  That is not correct.  Section 19 of the Broadcasting Act, 1960, provides:</P>
      <P>The periods fixed by the authority for broadcasting shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
      <P>In 1964 the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs authorised an extension of television broadcasting hours by 2¾ hours per week for eight months of the year so as to permit regular Sunday afternoon programmes during the period October to May.  In putting forward the proposal RTE had represented that otherwise there would be a gap between 2 p.m. and 4.45 on Sundays.  In August 1969 the Minister authorised a further extension of three hours television broadcasting on Sundays again for eight months of the year.  My approval was not sought for any alteration of the arrangements authorised in 1969 and RTE had no authority to make that change.  I took the matter up with RTE.  As a result they arranged that in future there would not be a gap in the Sunday afternoon programme.  Our thanks are due to Mr. Brophy of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> who brought it to light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coogan asked about the costs and results of the recent drive against TV spongers.  The drive is still continuing in some areas.  Final figures are not therefore available.  It is estimated that the total cost, including the pay of staff engaged on inspection work, will be between £60,000 and £70,000.  Over 18,000 unlicensed sets were detected and it is estimated that 21,000 new licences were taken out in the period from 30th October to 30th <Col N="1381" /> November because of the campaign. As an aside, we will have to get them to call on &ldquo;Wigmore&rdquo; of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> next time they are around.</P>
    <P>Deputy R. Burke suggested that the Trustee Act, 1958, may have been contravened when funds were made available from the RTE superannuation fund to help finance the new radio building.  It would be a matter for the trustees of the superannuation fund to satisfy themselves that they could invest funds in this way and I am sure the trustees considered this matter carefully before coming to a decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke spoke about the RTE Symphony Orchestra and inquired if any request had been made to have the cost of the orchestra subsidised in order to relieve RTE of part of the cost.  Requests of this kind have been made by RTE from time to time but such requests have always been turned down.  The matter was last mentioned in connection with RTE's application for an increase in licence fees in 1970 but I am still satisfied there is no case for a separate subsidy for the orchestra.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked if there were any plans for a shortwave station to broadcast to our exiles in other countries. In my opening statement on the Estimate on 18th November, 1971, I gave my reasons for coming to the conclusion that the provision of a shortwave service could not be justified and there has not been any change in the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke suggested a change be made in the date of taking out licences or, alternatively, that the RTE financial year should be changed to end on 31st July.  If RTE submit proposals on either of these matters they will receive consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke asked what efforts, if any, had been made to ensure that the National Savings Committee are given adequate facilities to publicise their activities in relation to the savings services.  The Minister for Finance is responsible for the savings committee and it is he who decides what amount they may spend on publicity. He also arranges to make available to the committee whatever facilities are needed.  The cost of publicity <Col N="1382" /> is charged to subhead B of the Vote for my Department, together with the cost of the Department's own publicity on savings.</P>
    <P>The savings services provided by the Post Office are performed on behalf of the Minister for Finance. I suggest that Deputy Burke's question regarding the contribution the Post Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks are making to the national economy would be more appropriate to the Minister for Finance.  Statistics for the business of the Post Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks are given on pages 25 and 26 of the notes circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy L. Belton raised the matter of payment of old age pensions and social welfare allowances through the post.  A change in the present method of payment would be a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare, but I am not sure what advantages the Deputy sees in the suggested arrangement. If cheques or pay orders were issued through the post, the recipients would be faced with the problem of cashing them and I am sure many would still be cashed in post offices. Deputies may be interested to know that more than 21 million social welfare payments were made in post offices in the last financial year.</P>
    <P>In replying to the debate for my Department, it has been my custom to try to cover as fully as possible all points raised by Deputies during the debate.  I am sure Deputies will understand that, because of exceptional circumstances this year which made it necessary for me to devote so much of my reply to the special affairs of RTE, it would not be possible to reply to all the points made with regard to my Department.  However, in relation to points I may not have referred to, perhaps Deputies would write to me regarding any subjects on which they require information and I shall be glad to help as best I can.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret to me that time did not permit me to discuss as fully as I would like the telephone service but I hope in the early months of next year to bring a Bill before <Col N="1383" /> the House which would enable capital moneys to be provided for telephone development in the next five years. The debate on that Bill will give me an opportunity to develop more fully my views on the position and prospects of the telephone service&mdash;a matter I know that is of great interest to Members of this House and to the community.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank all Deputies who contributed constructively to the debate and to renew my thanks to the staff of my Department for their excellent service during the past 12 months.  Finally, I think it is a shame and a disagree that we have not a few more people of the calibre of Deputy Cosgrave in the Fine Gael Party or Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the Land Commission could be divided into two main objectives: first, to allocate extra land to smallholders and those who need more land and, secondly, in the interests of the community and particularly of the weaker sections to maintain some degree of control over the land market.  On both of these counts there will be an enhanced need when we join the EEC for the continuance of the Land Commission or of some body with the power of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the suggestion that the Land Commission should be abolished, although I agree there is a case for a change in the structure of the Land Commission.  There may be a case for its amalgamation into the Department of Agriculture but I do not favour the abolition of the Commission. In fact, the activities of the Land Commission need to be extended considerably and I do not think the money they get to do their work has kept pace with increased land prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite clearly, in the EEC there will be great opportunities for agricultural expansion and there will be greater need for action in the land market by the Land Commission to ensure that small farmers are not deprived of land. The Land Commission must extend and improve their operations.  In his speech, Deputy L'Estrange mentioned that the Land Commission this year as against last year got only one-third of the amount of extra money necessary to maintain even last year's level of operation.  It is also the case that <Col N="1385" /> the amount of land they acquired is declining.  In the latest year for which figures are available, 1971-72, the Land Commission acquired only 16,000 acres.  They allocated 25,000 acres, so in that year the land pool was declining because they were getting rid of more land than they were acquiring.  That 16,000 acres was the lowest figure for land acquisition in any year in this decade; it represents virtually half of the amount acquired in 1968-69, which was 30,000 acres.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Land Commission. I note they are acquiring a higher proportion of land than they were at the beginning of the decade. The point is they have not got enough money to inspect and acquire more land.  The need for them to acquire more has in no way lessened in this decade.  The problem is lack of finance. This is something the Minister will have to attend to at Cabinet level.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what proportion of land marketed is represented by Land Commission acquisitions. In France, in 1969, the body equivalent to our Land Commission acquired 30 per cent of the land sold.  Could we have the equivalent figures for here? There is a grave lack of statistics in regard to the land market here.  We do not have any record of sales and no concrete indication of the price of land in different areas.  The Land Commission are in an ideal position to provide this basic information, information vital to agricultural policy.  In the post this morning I got figures from the French Ministry of Agriculture and those figures showed the average price of land this year and last year in every department in France.  This is important basic information and anyone who argues that land prices are not an important determinant in agricultural policy is wrong.  The Land Commission should provide this information.</P>
    <P>In regard to getting and allocating extra land to smallholders, there are a number of ways in which this could be done.  It could be done under existing Land Commission procedures involving the acquisition and re-allocation of land.  It could be done by giving pensions to older farmers who wish to retire and who may want to either <Col N="1386" /> lease or sell their land to younger small farmers and, at the same time, get a pension.  There is, too, the possibility of introducing legislation to allow of long term leases.  This was not adverted to by the Minister though it was recommended in the Scully Report published this time last year.  I shall come back to this later.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of pensions for those who wish to retire from the land, there should be no question of older people having to leave the land or being forced off the land.  This should never happen and I would be utterly opposed to any such policy.  We fought for the right of people to stay on the land.  However, older married farmers and single men, with no successors in many cases, are leading a miserable existence on the land without any incentive to work it properly.  They have to hold on because it is their only security.  If alternative security were offered they would take it.  The obvious solution is to provide them with a pension to supplement whatever they may get from the sale or leasing of the land.  The existing pension scheme has been a failure.  Its terms have been totally inadequate in that all a man could get was the sale price of the land.  That was no real incentive.  It is proposed by the EEC that the man should get the sale price or the lease value of the land and, in addition, a pension subsidised by the State plus any other benefits he may have under the social welfare code.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>The present scheme has been totally inadequate.  The proposed EEC scheme is much more attractive and we will be in a position to implement this scheme.  We will be eligible for 65 per cent aid from the EEC fund in regard to all areas designated backward areas.  On the criteria laid down it is probable we would be able to get most of the country so designated.  We will be able to operate this scheme from April next.  Under it the farmer will be able to do one of two things: he can sell or he can lease the land for at least 12 years; he will get whatever price he can and, in addition, he will <Col N="1387" /> get this indemnity.  Up to £375 in the case of a married man and £265 in the case of a single man may be indemnified as to 65 per cent by the EEC.  Of course, the Irish Exchequer can go further and provide extra, but it will not be indemnified up to 65 per cent in respect of that extra amount.  This would provide a worthwhile incentive and could result in the release of a great deal of land held down at the moment by people who are not able to use it properly.</P>
    <P>With more land available small farmers and their families would no longer be held back simply because they cannot get more land.  There is the problem that our legislation does not provide for the type of long term lease envisaged in the directive.  There were suggestions, originally from the Irish Farmers' Association and subsequently from Dr. Scully, that we should introduce legislation to allow for long term leases.  Because we have not done so there will be a term of this EEC pensions scheme to which I have referred which we will not be able to implement.  Is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, I am very pleased to hear it.  It is something I should have known and did not.  There is a problem in regard to the introduction of long term leases in other countries, and particularly in France, where they have found it necessary to introduce some sort of tribunal to ensure that fair rents are maintained.  I am not sure whether we have the machinery to do that.  In itself, that may be a disincentive to the institution of such a scheme.</P>
      <P>It was not clear to me when I read Dr. Scully's report that certain action by the Government was not necessary to introduce long term leases.  My impression was that he envisaged that a minimum tenancy period should be established, and that there should be a system for the establishment of equitable rents, and a number of matters such as that.  He also envisaged something which I felt was not very wise, perhaps, and which would involve too much bureaucratic interference, namely, the system of taking land back from people who have leased it and who are not working it properly.  If we are to get into the area of interfering administratively to that degree in the land market, there will be no end to the amount of civil service work which will have to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have been doing that all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in relation to every lease.  If every lease is to be supervised in this way&mdash;and I am not saying it is an undesirable thing in itself&mdash;the amount of interference in people's normal farming affairs would be such that they would be constrained to be very conservative in their outlook. This would not be for the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that is something of a digression.  The important point I am making is that funds are available up to 65 per cent for the establishment of a very attractive pension scheme, which is recognised by everybody as being desirable for releasing land held by people who are not working it to the best of their ability, and who would like to give it up if they could have the assurance of a secure and attractive <Col N="1389" /> pension scheme.  This money will be available from next April and, to my knowledge, the Government are doing little or nothing about getting it.</P>
    <P>Before the scheme comes into operation, it must be fully approved by the EEC, and it must be fully discussed with the farming organisations.  From the date of the submission of the proposal to the EEC they have a full two months to reply.  If the scheme is to come into operation in April, we will have to have our proposal in before February to get a reply from them by April.  Indeed, we will probably have to have it in by January if there is to be proper flexibility.  If we are to discuss it with the farming organisations and other interested organisations, or to discuss it in this House, or if it requires new legislation, how much time will be needed?  Surely the details of a scheme whereby the Minister proposed to implement the terms of this directive to get the 65 per cent aid, should be available by now.  If not, are the Government genuinely serious about getting the benefits from the EEC funds which they made so much of in the EEC campaign leading up to the referendum on 10th May?</P>
    <P>It is provided by the EEC that farmers should be encouraged to adopt a development plan which, over a six year period, would raise their income to an income comparable to that earned by non-agricultural people in the same area.  Farmers will be encouraged to adopt such a plan by two means.  They will be offered low interest loans, and the reduction of interest will be subsidised by the EEC to the extent of 25 per cent.  The remainder will be provided by the Irish Government. They will also get a priority in the allocation of any lands which are released under the pension scheme to which I referred.</P>
    <P>This development plan has been advocated by the committee on State expenditure in relation to agriculture, on the same principle as the small farms incentive bonus scheme.  Indeed, the IFA have advocated that, when land is being allocated by the Land Commission, it should be allocated to people who have a development plan, or who are prepared to produce a <Col N="1390" /> development plan on how they will use this land in the context of their enlarged holdings to increase their incomes over a period.  The discipline of producing such a plan would ensure that the best people were getting the land.</P>
    <P>As I say, we will get EEC money to get such plans going and this money will be available from April of next year.  If we are to get the money, a scheme has to be submitted to the EEC by February at least if we are to have a reply within the two months to which I referred.  We have no information whatever about what scheme the Government are putting forward to the EEC.  We have no idea of what they intend to do.  They have hardly discussed their ideas about implementing the directive with anybody.  Quite clearly, they are letting us down.  There is an opportunity to get EEC money for this very desirable development on which everybody is agreed and I fear that, because of the inefficiency and inaction of the Government, we will not get this money which we are entitled to get and which we should get.</P>
    <P>I have some worries about the operation of the directive as it is available to us.  The land consolidation measures which are envisaged provide for aid to be given from the EEC funds for irrigation but they do not provide for aid to be given for land drainage. Land drainage is very important.  We have had innovations in the field of land drainage with the introduction of the deep plough in Ballyferriter which, as has been shown, can turn very bad land in mountain areas into very productive grassland.  Obviously there is a great new field opening up there for improving bad land in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>If land consolidation measures are being undertaken in such areas, we should fight to get EEC aid for such land drainage works.  It is wrong that aid should be given for irrigation, which is of general interest on the Continent and which is not of interest to us here, and not given for drainage work which is a complementary activity, only on wetter land, which is carried out here and is not carried out to the same degree on the Continent. There is a bias in the directive in <Col N="1391" /> favour of Southern Europe in this context, which should not be there.  I hope the Minister will endeavour to have it removed.</P>
    <P>As I was saying, I have some worries that the smaller farmers will not be able to participate in this development plan.  To a significant degree this remains to be decided, because the Government have not yet produced their interpretation of the terms of the EEC directive.  The exclusion or otherwise of very small farmers from the aids available under these development plan ideas depends on how certain phrases in the directive are interpreted by the Government.</P>
    <P>There is one point here about which I am worried.  The basic criterion is defined in Article 4 (1) of Directive 72/159 EEC of 17th April, 1972:</P>
    <P>The development plan provided for in Article 2 (1) (d) must demonstrate that upon its completion the holding undergoing modernisation will be capable of attaining in principle for one or two labour units of least an earned income comparable to that received for non-agricultural work in the region.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government will have the job of defining what is a comparable income in the particular area and a lot depends on what they define as the comparable income and whether particular farmers should be excluded or included.</P>
    <P>It is also set out in Article 4 (a):</P>
    <P>The Member States shall fix an adequate return on the capital invested in the holding.</P>
    <P>Is this adequate return on capital to be something which must be made up in addition to getting a comparable income?  Must a farmer first get an adequate return on capital and then obtain a comparable income? If it is the case that a farmer has to achieve an adequate return on capital and comparable income as well, I can see difficulties in that many farmers would be excluded who might be able to make a comparable income if they were allowed to include as part of their income return <Col N="1392" /> on capital, but if they have to make a separate provision in relation to return on capital, the scheme could exclude a number of farmers.  If that is not the interpretation.  I would like to know what is the purpose of putting a provision for an adequate return on capital in the directive at all.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know what is going to be determined as a labour unit because a farmer has to obtain an adequate return on capital for each person working on the farm, and if a farmer has a son of 15 or 16 working with him on the land, will he have to earn two comparable incomes from the farm because his son is working on it or will there be some allowance made for the fact that the son is young and in any normal industry would not be expected to be earning the full rate of remuneration? A lot depends on the interpretation put on that provision.</P>
    <P>There is another point in relation to this provision.  If a farmer is to qualify, he must be able to obtain the comparable income in the six year period and must be able to show that he can do so before being allowed to participate in the scheme, if he can do it without working more than 2,300 working hours per year.  I would be very interested to know how it is to be worked out whether a person is working 2,300 working hours per year or not.  I can imagine that in relation to farming, it would be very difficult to determine how many working hours a man is going to do per year, and if this provision is included, I can see that it would allow for great difference in application in different parts of the country.  If you have an instructor who took a very rigid line, he could exclude many farmers from it on the ground that they would have to work 3,000 hours a year, whereas another man might take a more lenient view and allow many people in even though they might be working a larger number of hours on the ground that it really was not working but things they would have to do anyway.  There is also a provision in this directive that its terms can be varied from one part of the country to another by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> Information on all these questions must be available soon.  It may sound rather technical and rather boring material to be dealing with but this scheme should be in operation by next April.  Money will be available for its application from next April and it cannot be brought into operation until these points are ironed out, the scheme submitted to Brussels, the scheme approved by Brussels and any necessary legislative changes introduced here.  Only when all these stages have been completed can the scheme be introduced and all that has to be done between now and April, but the Government have given virtually no indication of what they are doing about it or whether they are going to endeavour to do it at all.  This is irresponsible on their part.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know how it is proposed to fit in the existing allocation policy of the Land Commission into the context of these development plans.  Will it be the situation in future that only farmers who are participating in a development plan under this directive will qualify for extra land or will land still be given to other farmers who have not qualified for these development plans?  To what degree will the adoption of this legislation in regard to development plans and incentives for older farmers to leave agriculture affect the operation of the 45 acres maximum which the Land Commission at present operate as the maximum level to which they will bring a farm?</P>
    <P>With regard to the one mile limit and the provision that a farmer can be allocated land only if he is within one mile of an estate, this provision to my mind is outdated.  It was a limit set in 1930, but transport and farm transport in particular has improved significantly since then and the man living two miles from an estate is just as well able to work it as a man living one mile away and he should be considered equally. I should like to know, if we adopt this new development plan concept in respect of land allocation, will the one mile limit be retained and will it be the position that only farmers with development plans within one mile of an estate will qualify?</P>
    <P>There is very great concern in the <Col N="1394" /> country at the moment as to the effect of the EEC on the buying of land by foreigners and in particular as to the buying of land by non-farmers who have maybe made money in other areas of activity and who in this era of inflation, see land as the most secure investment possible and are buying land as if they were buying stocks and shares, and at the same time depriving small farmers who need extra land of the opportunity of getting it.  We have a twin problem here.  I think that the operations of native speculators in land purchase are a good deal more harmful to the interests of small farmers than is or would be the problem of foreign purchasers.  I may be proved wrong in that but I think it is the native speculators who are even more dangerous to the interests of small farmers.  I feel that in the EEC it will not be possible for us to discriminate between foreign and native speculators in regard to agricultural land but we will be able to introduce some controls on speculation in agricultural land <i>per se</i>, regardless of whether it is carried out by foreigners or otherwise.</P>
    <P>As the Minister rightly says, the existing provision in regard to the purchase by nationals of other States of land in other EEC countries are reasonably favourable.  The present position is that nationals of one country can buy in another EEC country land which has been left abandoned or uncultivated for more than two years and nationals of one EEC country who have worked as paid agricultural workers in another EEC country for an unbroken period of at least two years have the right to acquire farms in the latter country.  As everybody knows, there is not much land left abandoned or uncultivated in this country for more than two years and there are not very many foreign speculators who would be prepared to come here and work as agricultural workers at our rate of pay for two years in order to be able then to acquire land.</P>

      <P>It says that nationals of one EEC country who have worked in another EEC country as paid agricultural workers for an unbroken period of at least two years have the right to acquire a farm or farms in the latter country.  I take it that is in that other EEC country.  However, if Deputy Tully's interpretation is correct I hope the Minister will indicate clearly that this is so because if the Deputy is correct we have reason to be worried.  However, I do not think he is right although he has been right on occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to introduce some form of control to deal with speculation in agricultural land. The existing position in relation to the purchase of land by non-nationals, which is reasonably acceptable from our point of view, is not likely to continue indefinitely because there is a draft directive before the EEC giving full right to non-nationals to buy land.  This was regardless of these conditions and was submitted to the Council in January, 1969.  As the Minister says, it is not likely to come up for decision until we are full members but if it were put through in its present form, it would mean that people could come in here and buy land easily.  If we are to prevent that we should have some form of control in existence prior to such directives being agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that whatever controls we are to have are not introduced after the EEC have agreed on this directive because if we wait until then, the EEC will say that we are only introducing them to defeat the purpose of the directive which they had agreed. They would say that in introducing <Col N="1396" /> such legislation to counter the effects of the directive they had agreed we were acting in a fashion which would be out of line with the spirit of the community and they might well rule that our particular legislation, designed to control speculation by foreigners in particular, was against the spirit of the Community.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister on this aspect.  This area is a very difficult one and I would not like to condemn the Minister for being cautious in regard to it because there is a strong tradition here in this regard and people have fought for the right of free sale of land.  That was one of the &ldquo;Three Fs&rdquo; and if we interfere with the right of people who wish to sell their land and get a good price for it, there will be an outcry.  It is very important that we balance the right of the seller to sell at a good price against the right of local small farmers who wish to acquire extra land.  Every landowner is anxious to know that should he wish to sell, he would be able to command a reasonable price.  Therefore, we must balance the two interests while preserving the basic interest fought for by the traditional Land League to establish the right of free sale.  A possible way in which this problem could be approached is that areas in the country could be designated as congested areas, not in the sense in which they are designated at present, which is unduly rigid, but areas where there is a particularly high concentration of small farms could be designated as such and in these areas the only people who could buy land would be people who met one of the following four criteria: (1) that they were existing farmers in the area in question; (2) that they were people from outside the area who had completed a year's training in agriculture or who had completed some form of improved course in agriculture; (3) that they were small farmers who were prepared to adopt a development plan as proposed here, or (4) that they had some other particular proposal for the setting up of an enterprise on the farm that they proposed to buy which was unique and one that could not be carried out by the existing farmers in the area.  This might provide some form of check on speculation in land in areas <Col N="1397" /> where small farmers need extra land.</P>
    <P>There are some who would say that this goes too far in imposing control on the sale of land while there are others who would say that it does not go far enough.  I do not know which criticism would be the more correct but no doubt certain criticism could be levelled at each of the four proposals that I have put forward.</P>
    <P>I propose to devote the next section of my speech to long-term land leases.  The Minister has said there is nothing to prevent such long-term leases from being set up.  If that is the case I will be anxious to hear why everyone is setting land on the 11-month lease even if they intend setting it for, say, four or five years in succession. There must be vacant possession for one month each year. Surely there must be something preventing people from setting land on a long-term basis.  I thought I knew what was the reason but I am afraid I do not.  Is there anything the Land Commission can do to encourage farmers to lease land on a long-term basis?  If a man has land for only 11 months he is not in a position to make any proper investment in it.  It is probable that he will run it down in trying to get the best from it without putting anything into it in the nature of fertilisers. If he were to carry out any improvement works he would need to know that he could have the land for about 12 years in order to get a return for any such work.</P>
    <P>There is the problem also that many small farmers cannot get enough land because the only way of getting it at the moment is either by leasing it on the 11-month system, which is unsatisfactory as I have indicated or, alternatively, buying land and if they buy land they must raise so much money to meet the purchase price that they have no money left to invest in working the land properly.  The obvious answer to that problem is that, instead of having a huge outlay on the purchase price, they should be able to lease the land for 12 years or some such period.  It has been found all over Europe that long-term leases are the answer.  We need to know why long-term leases have not developed here. I suspect that there is something in <Col N="1398" /> the operation of the law that prevents this happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to introduce some way of encouraging more people to do that.  Maybe it is this lack of encouragement that is preventing this being done now because there is not some encouragement for them to do so.  I feel also that there is a need to bring more influence by farmers and people directly involved in agriculture to bear on the operations of the Land Commission.  It was suggested by the Irish Farmers' Association that there should be a number of farmers as Land Commissioners.  This would bring people who have practical knowledge of farming into the Land Commission at the highest level.  That might be considered in any restructuring proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In France there is a body equivalent to the Land Commission which works on the basis of regional authorities responsible for a group of three or four departments.  These regional authorities are in the form of limited companies. The people who run them are farmers in the area.  Land allocation is made by farmers in the area.  They do not make allocations in small areas, but in very big regional areas.  Local farmers in a particular parish would not be allocated land in that area.  In a province like Connaught there would be a board of farmers from that province who would make decisions.  The obvious danger is that they would be open to pressure and charges of favouritism. Land Commissioners are not open to such charges.  On the Continent the farmers are asked to make a decision on a particular case.  They are told the facts of the case, told of the merits of the applicants and details of the size of the estate, but they are not given the name of each applicant or the location of the estate.  They are told that X estate is to be divided between applicants A, B, C, D, and E.  They are asked whom they would choose on merit.  This system has been found to work well in France.  It may be a scheme which would not work well <Col N="1399" /> here, but perhaps we should ask why it has worked so well in France.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the people who understand agriculture best are those engaged in it.  These people should be involved in the allocation of land.  The policy of the Land Commission should be integrated into some form of rural development authority operating not only the functions of the Irish Land Commission but also those of the land projects, farm buildings schemes and advisory services.  Such authorities should operate in each region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The setting up of such an authority, which would give farmers a direct say in the running of the Land Commission, is the policy of my party and is something which should be considered at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to group farming. The Land Commission have initiated an experiment near Athboy among a group of four farmers.  They are proposing to set up another experiment near Kilcock.  These are good developments.  I welcome this action of the Land Commission.  These farms could provide examples to farmers who might wish to come together voluntarily. They would have these experimental farms to refer to.  They would be able to see the Land Commission project and how their farms are worked; and without the intervention of the Land Commission they could form groups with other farmers in their own areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a theoretical criticism of that.  It is that they are experimenting <Col N="1400" /> with complete integration of the whole holding.  They have one set of farm buildings all held in common and the land is worked in common.  The Land Commission should consider experimenting also with less developed forms of grouping.  Where the Land Commission are allocating an estate to three or four farmers they might set up a joint milking parlour solely to see how it would work in that particular enterprise.  That would provide another form of co-operation which could be seen as a pilot scheme and could be examined by farmers interested in that form of limited co-operation. Different levels of group co-operation should be set up in different parts of the country.  Different experiments would then be available to farmers for examination.  If we are anxious to get group farming started, co-operation should be on a small scale, perhaps in relation to one particular line of operation on a farm rather than by farmers coming together and pooling their whole operation immediately.  If the Land Commission are interested in providing a showcase for group farming the most relevant form of showcase would be one involving a limited form of co-operation which small farmers might be able to adopt immediately. The Land Commission should consider that.</P>
    <P>It is also to be noted that in France there has been a tendency for the number of farmers involved in the group to get smaller.  Originally there were five or six farmers in each group. Now the average number of people participating is two or three.  The existing group of Grennanstown, near Athboy, consists of four farmers.  I understand that another group is to be set up near Kilcock, and is also to consist of three or four people. Some new form of grouping consisting of two farmers should be experimented with.  This would have the added benefit of leaving additional land available for local people who need additional land in a particular area.  There are many local people who need extra land.  If a group farm is to be set up a small farm should be set up which would provide information <Col N="1401" /> on group farming with only two people involved.  This would leave a certain amount of land available for allocation to other smallholders.  That would be desirable.</P>
    <P>We must look at the problem of commonages.  This is not a problem which affects my constituency to any considerable degree.  It is something which was mentioned in the Scully Report.  It was mentioned that there were tremendous problems in areas where there were commonages which were not properly used just because they were held in common.  If people owned them they would obviously have much greater interest in developing them properly.  It was shown that in Galway only 22.7 per cent of the farmers make full use of available grazing rights.  It was also shown that on average land held in common is worked to a less intensive degree than land owned fully by an individual.  I wonder if the Land Commission can do anything about this problem.  Many of these commonages would consist of the sort of land which would lend itself to intensive reclamation.  The Land Commission could, possibly, find agreement for the acquisition of these commonages with a view to their reclamation and reallocation in parcels to local holders who had rights on the commonages and who were interested in getting some of the reclaimed land.  Persons who have rights on the commonages but who are not interested in getting any of the reclaimed land could receive some cash compensation for giving up their rights.  I am surprised that this problem has been referred to in the Scully Report as a serious problem. Could the Minister tell me what he proposes to do about it?</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I would say&mdash;and this is the important point I wanted to make&mdash;there is money available from the EEC for land re-allocation and for improving the structure of land.

To the best of my knowledge, we are in danger of not getting that money because the <Col N="1402" /> Government are not doing the necessary ground work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is possibly one of the most important Estimates to come before the Dáil.  Land is costing from £500 to £600 an acre.  If the Land Commission purchase land at that price on the eastern seaboard future allottees will find themselves in the position of having to pay £50 an acre.  Deputy Tully last night referred to figures of £20 and £25 an acre.  I do not know where the Land Commission could allocate land at that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers will find themselves in an impossible position unless the annuities are halved as is the case in the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have been reading the Official Report and I notice that Deputy Donnellan said on 5th December at column 1121:</P>
      <P>Although part of the land west of the Shannon is of poor quality, there are many areas where the land is as good as in any part of Ireland but the Land Commission do not appear to make any effort to acquire that land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is getting back to the 1965 Land Act.  Farmers in the west of Ireland still get the privilege of paying half the annuity.  This is something that I do not agree with.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  There should be total halving of the annuity. Even £25 an acre is too much.  In a case where the Land Commission pay £500 an acre for land the annuity is <Col N="1403" /> £50.  I doubt if any farmer would be in a position to pay that amount.</P>
    <P>At column 1084 of the Official Report of 5th December, Deputy L'Estrange said:</P>
    <P>The halving of the land annuity was one of the biggest boosts to Fianna Fáil in the past.  It certainly helped them with the farmers.  In the 1965 Land Act they changed that so far as people getting land outside the congested areas are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went on to describe people coming from the west of Ireland to Longford and Westmeath where the annuities are halved for them but where local farmers have to pay the full annuity.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have a further look at this matter.  The halving of the annuities must be extended to all farmers.  I refer to land that is costing £500 or £600 and which will cost more in future.</P>
    <P>Now I want to deal with the subject of payment by the Land Commission for land in land bonds.  I notice in yesterday's paper that 9¾ per cent land bonds are bringing £96 per £100.  If paid in such land bonds the farmer will lose £100 on a £10,000 deal.  That is most unfair and unjust.  Even the Minister for Finance will not recognise them.  They will not be accepted for death duties.  This is unjust.  The sooner land bonds are scrapped or at least people are guaranteed par for them the better.  Prior to the 9¾ per cent land bonds people were getting only, perhaps, £80 per £100 worth of bonds.  The Land Commission should pay for land they acquire for cash or at least guarantee par for land bonds.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the Minister thinks about the price being paid for land on the open market. If the Land Commission pay £500 or £600 per acre for land how does the Minister expect farmers to pay £50 per acre for it unless he halves annuities?  This is something the Land Commission will have to face up to in the future because land prices are going up day by day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton spoke about our <Col N="1404" /> entry to the EEC.  I understand a decision was recently taken in the Department of Lands that they will still continue to recognise 45 acres as an economic holding.  I have been told this on good authority.  The Land Commission must have gone daft.  I would like to see some of the people who made this decision living on a 45 acre farm and expecting to have an income comparable with that of their counterparts in industry or anywhere else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably right but a former Fianna Fáil Taoiseach said that anyone who could not make a living on 10 acres was not a farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the future, not going back into the past. The Minister in 1970 at the Ard-Fheis said that he considered that an economic holding at that time was in the region of 70 acres.  I am talking about first-class arable land.  If the Land Commission still recognise 45 acres as an economic holding I do not know where they are going.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Land Commission are making a mistake in regard to the division of land.  If the Land Commission acquire a 20 acre holding and there are two local farmers with perhaps, 25 acres each, the Land Commission's policy has been to divide that 20 acres between the two farmers, leaving them with a total of 35 acres each.  There is the possibility that they will never get another acre of land. This looks good politically but it is ludicrous.  The Land Commission should give all the land to one farmer and give the other one an economic holding somewhere else.  We are lucky in the constituency which I represent in that we have no migration into it from outside counties.  There are always sufficient suitable applicants for land within the county.  To give a farmer with 25 acres ten more on which to rear and educate a family in this day and age is not right.  It is suicide as far as the farmers are concerned. The purpose of the Land Commission is to create economic <Col N="1405" /> holdings but instead of that they are creating more uneconomic holdings. I do not think there is a future for 25 and 30 acre farmers and we might as well face up to this and be honest. The Land Commission are deceiving small farmers by dividing land in this way.  It looks good politically to give a man five or ten acres but it is putting a noose around his neck for his lifetime if he is not to get any more land in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission are doing one good thing and that is in regard to co-operative farming.  This must be encouraged. We all accept that a landholder, a man who owns two acres upwards, is a proud man and, rightly so, but farmers in the future will have to pocket their pride.  The idea that Johnny down the road who has 20 acres has a tractor and I must get a tractor, too, should be discouraged. This sort of thing is uneconomic.  The Land Commission must be commended on creating co-operative farming in Meath and I understand they are setting up one or two other co-operatives.  This should be given every chance.  Whatever chance small farmers have it is through co-operation.</P>
    <P>In the past when the Land Commission acquired a farm and set it for perhaps, five or six years by the time they divide it, it had run out completely. I am glad to see that now at long last they are putting the land back in proper heart by manuring <i>et cetera.</i> It is not before its time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position in relation to the purchase of land by foreigners. Many people are under the impression that foreigners will not be able to buy land here in the future.  I am referring in particular to farms of 100 or 200 acres and I should like to know if foreigners will have the right to purchase land after we enter the EEC. There is the impression among certain people that the 1965 Land Act will prevail and that foreigners will not be allowed to purchase land.  This matter is of some concern to farmers and perhaps the Minister would clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> With regard to the Forestry Division, the Minister has stated that the gross area acquired during 1971-72 was the largest to date.  After 40 years negotiation the Forestry Division acquired the Blackstairs Mountains in my constituency and I am wondering if that acquisition has accounted for the large area that was acquired.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the grants for tree planting have been increased but I do not think that the amount is adequate. There is a considerable area of bogland that is privately owned and it would be helpful if the grants were increased to a more realistic amount.</P>
    <P>With regard to the J.F. Kennedy Park, the Minister stated that arrangements are being made for an extension of the arboretum within the park formerly reserved for a horticultural college.  This is a disappointment because many people thought a horticultural college would be established in the area.  I should like to know the reason for the change in plan.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister could tell the House the number of visitors who visited the park during the past year.  The Forestry Division must be commended for their work in this park which has been the subject of favourable comment by all who have visited it.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Department have acquired sufficient land in the North Slob area in County Wexford for wildlife preservation and I should like to have the Minister's views on this.  I should also like to hear the Minister's comments on the work that has been done in this area on wildlife preservation because I do not think it has been quite as successful as we had hoped.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask the Minister to examine the question of land bonds and also the future of the Land Commission and their activities regarding the purchase of land.</P>

Repeated demands have been made <Col N="1407" /> to the Government and to the Minister to bring this Bill before the House.  It is needed urgently; otherwise much of the wildlife will be extinct by the time the Bill is published and debated.  The Minister promised the Bill in mid-1970 and surely the draft has been completed now.  It is about time the phantom Bill of 1970, 1971 and 1972 was published and circulated to Deputies.  Even if it is done now it cannot be adopted before 1973 and, therefore, it should be done as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if any estimate or study has been made of the effect of recent increases in land values on the impact of estate duty in forcing farmers' sons who succeed to farms to sell them in order to pay the duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is constantly under review.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence that lands have had to be sold or are being sold because of the impact of estate duty. If the Deputy would give particulars of any case in which it is claimed that land has had to be sold for the sole purpose of paying estate duty, the matter will be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is difficult to get these cases because people are not prepared to disclose personal information of this nature?  Is he also aware that the increased value of stock has meant that <Col N="1414" /> more and more farms are likely not to be in a position to avail of the artificial valuation and, once that happens, increased values in land, which are also taking place, will mean that the amount of duty will increase at a very dramatic rate as compared with what it was two years ago? Would he agree to have a special study made into this matter in the light of the constantly increasing value of stock and land values as a result of EEC entry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, this matter is kept constantly under review and will continue to be kept under review.  The reviews carried out up to now show no evidence whatsoever of people being forced to sell land because of the incidence of estate duty and that is why I said, if there are details available of such cases, I will be glad to get them and have the cases investigated.  It is true that increases in the value of land will bring more farming cases into the estate duty net.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that up to now the number of farming cases coming into the estate duty net was extremely small.  When any property increases in value it becomes either liable to duty for the first time or, if already in the net, liable to more duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall economic situation is kept under continuing review by the Government and any further action necessary will be taken if the situation should so demand.  As to the position generally, I would refer the Deputy to my budget statement of April last in which I indicated the broad lines of the economic policy being followed this year.  With regard to prices, I would remind him of the valuable work being done by the National Prices Commission.</P>
      <P>As to the specific points mentioned by the Deputy, he will appreciate that, in France, even after the reduction from 7½ per cent to 7 per cent announced on basic necessities generally, the rate of VAT on these commodities will still be appreciably higher than that of 5.26 per cent which applies in Ireland.  As to a further large national loan, the Deputy will be aware that the most recent loan, which closed on 24th November, raised £35 million&mdash;by far the greatest amount taken up by a national loan.  In addition, extra branches of existing stocks are continually offered for sale on the market; because of this, funds which become available for gilt-edged investment are being absorbed and consequently there would be little justification, or, indeed, scope, for another major national loan at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the paper referred to by Deputy Desmond. I should point out, however, that the statement in the paper referred to by the Deputy is based on an analysis of estate duty statistics which, the author admits, relates only to a small sample of the total population.  In addition, the author indicates that there are a number of further limitations in any approach based on such statistics. Accordingly, the conclusions reached in the paper, while a useful contribution to studies in this field, must be approached with caution.</P>
      <P>The redistribution of wealth&mdash;and income&mdash;in the community is an important function of the taxation system as a whole, and the question of how that function might best be achieved is subject to continuing review.  I do not propose to establish a committee, as suggested by Deputy O'Connell, to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, notwithstanding the limitations on the estate duty data available which, in general, are the most authoritative data available, there is a growing number of reasonably authoritative reports available now to the Government, which indicate that the relative distribution of wealth in the Republic is much more inequitable than it is in Northern Ireland or Great Britain and, as such, warrants a serious examination by the Government? I strongly commend this to the Minister.  It would be well worthwhile undertaking it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider getting his own Department to undertake an inquiry into the question of the distribution of wealth? Perhaps this might be more revealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, this matter is kept under continuing review. The statistics which are available either to my Department or to individual researchers are limited as regards their value in giving an accurate picture of the distribution of wealth.  I would question the accuracy <Col N="1418" /> of the statement by Deputy Desmond with regard to other studies revealing a great discrepancy between the distribution of wealth here on the one hand and in the North and in Britain on the other hand.  As I have indicated, one of the major functions of the taxation system is to deal with the redistribution of wealth and income, and this is constantly kept in mind by the Government in deciding on taxation measures.</P>

      <P>I should not like it to be thought, from the gloss which Deputy O'Leary is putting on this, that I suggested there was anything partisan about these figures.  On the contrary.  I said that I thought this represented a useful contribution to studies in this field but that results have to be treated with caution for the reasons I and the author indicated. This is true of statistics in this area which are available in this country and in other countries.  The Deputy can rest assured that any information which comes to light from this or other sources which assists in assessing the problem, is taken seriously by the Government.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands the changes he has in mind in regard to the law governing Irish land buying and land tenure to conform with the EEC rules regarding freedom of establishment and free movement of capital; and whether he will consider putting curbs on foreign speculative capital being invested in Irish land because of the effect this has on rising land prices to levels which the majority of farmers anxious to enlarge their holdings find impossible to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with the position about freedom of establishment <Col N="1421" /> on land in the EEC context on many occasions, the latest being last Tuesday week during the course of my opening statement on the Lands Vote for the current year.  I said then that to date only a very limited measure of freedom of establishment on land embodied in five existing directives is operative in the EEC and such will not pose any serious problem for this country.  Regulations under section 45, Land Act, 1965, are at present being drafted which will have the effect of bringing these directives into operation here as from January, 1973.</P>
      <P>I said too, that the draft directive providing for full freedom of establishment on land which has been with the EEC Council of Ministers since January, 1969, will not be adopted before our accession.  After accession, of course, we will be in the position, as one of the member states of the Community, of having a full voice through our representative on the Council of Ministers and he can be relied upon to ensure that our special interests are taken fully into account.</P>
      <P>At all stages of the negotiations for entry we have indicated quite clearly to the existing EEC countries our very serious concern about the possible extension of the right of establishment on land and stressed the need to maintain sufficient control over the disposal of land to enable us to pursue policies to deal with our serious structural reform problem.  After our accession the existing control of non-national land purchases&mdash;except for the five directives mentioned&mdash;will remain in full force until such time as the EEC move on the draft directive before them since January, 1969.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any contingency plan in his Department to deal with the situation which would arise if the EEC Council were to adopt a draft directive which would allow complete freedom of establishment in land?  Has he any contingency plan to curb the speculative buying of agricultural land?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have put a good deal of thought into this.  Our basic posture is that it is a matter of <Col N="1422" /> vital national interest and therefore one in which once we would be in the EEC would be regarded as a veto situation for us.  We have contingency arrangements also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, to talk about a veto situation is really a misnomer.  I am merely saying that our posture has always been, and will continue to be, that this is a matter of vital national interest to us because of our peculiar situation, and it would be basically inimical to our interests for the directive to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <P>As regards Question No. 19, I have no information regarding the amount of money collected by An Taisce for the purchase of items from the King's Inns Library, but, in any event, I am not satisfied, as I said on a previous occasion, that considerations of the national interest would arise to an extent which would warrant a contribution from the State towards the expenditure which An Taisce incurred in the matter.</P>
      <P>Following is the list referred to:</P>
      <P>LIST of Books or Documents from the Library of the Honorable Society of King's Inns in respect of which applications for Export Licences were made to the Minister for Education and in respect of which such Licences were issued by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether he will make a detailed statement clarifying, for the guidance of the County Limerick creameries which have always supplied milk to the Lansdowne processing plant, the significance for them of his policy announcement of 10th October on creamery rationalisation and milk processing; and whether he will indicate how the revised creamery rationalisation proposals subsequently published by the IAOS are likely to affect the position of those creameries in regard to the continuance or otherwise of their supplying milk to Lansdowne.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Fahey) (for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the statement of 10th October referred to by the Deputy, I indicated that the position of the County Limerick co-operative societies which have been supplying milk to the Dairy Disposal Company's processing plant at Lansdowne is tied up with developments in County Clare.  I said that the choice of Cratloe as the location for the new processing plant for County Clare was made on the <Col N="1430" /> basis of those Limerick societies continuing to supply the Lansdowne plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary would not like to hand in the reply and have it published in the Official Report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As production increases, their additional supplies of milk could be economically handled at Cratloe along with the supplies from County Clare as a whole.  In my statement I pointed out that existing processing facilities and employment in any area must be utilised to the full before public funds could be expended on grants for further processing plants.  I also said that, if the County Limerick societies concerned should not wish to support Cratloe, the Limerick grouping to which they may decide to transfer would have to take over and assume responsibility for supplying and operating the Lansdowne factory.  I would like to emphasise this latter point.  I pointed out in the statement that as a matter of policy I could not agree to any creamery amalgamations or changes which would have the effect of reducing the milk supply to existing processing factories, nor would State grants be recommended for the creation of new processing facilities which would be likely to have that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the document on creamery rationalisation in the south which was published by the IAOS on 18th October, all of the County Limerick co-operative societies supplying milk to Lansdowne are visualised as being absorbed into other large creamery units.  Indeed it is envisaged that one such unit would take over all but two of those societies.  In visualising such a summary disposal of the sources of the existing milk supply to the Lansdowne plant, the IAOS made no provision for the future of that plant; they merely stated that it creates a problem and that &ldquo;there is no ready solution to this problem and it is obviously one which would have to be discussed with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Dairy Disposal Company.&rdquo;  I should explain that the IAOS document represents the view of the IAOS committee <Col N="1431" /> and does not claim to have the agreement of the co-operative societies in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in my statement of 10th October, creamery amalgamation is a voluntary matter, no individual creamery society being forced into an amalgamation against the wishes of the majority of its members. The Limerick co-operative societies which have been supplying milk to Lansdowne have first to decide for themselves whether they will (a) continue to supply Lansdowne or (b) amalgamate with another creamery group such as is visualised by the IAOS.</P>

      <P>It sets out the position in relation to the Lansdowne plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These creameries, and any group which may seek to absorb them, must however realise that, if the supply of milk to Lansdowne were to be prejudiced because of creamery amalgamation, public funds could not be expended on processing facilities elsewhere for handling milk supplies hitherto sent to Lansdowne.  If the Limerick creameries concerned decide to continue to supply milk to Lansdowne, they might well consider the <Col N="1432" /> advisability of their getting together with the aim of ultimately taking over, in conjunction with Clare creamery suppliers, both the Lansdowne and the Cratloe processing plants.  A final decision by the Limerick creameries in regard to their future arrangements and the basis of continuing supplies to the Lansdowne plant, which must be kept in operation as an integral part of the dairy industry, is now essential and I would urge them to come to such a decision without further delay.</P>

      <P>The milk suppliers to the Dairy Disposal Company's creameries have benefited, in the same way as all other creamery milk suppliers, from the arrangements for Exchequer support for the dairy industry, but the company itself does not receive any State subsidies and has no access to State grants other than those equally available to co-operative dairy societies. Such grants paid to the company, being almost entirely IDA grants, amounted to less than £10,000 in 1970 and less than £12,000 in 1971.</P>

In the enlarged EEC the present UK customs duty on imports from New Zealand and other countries, except Ireland, will be adjusted upwards over the transitional period to full alignment with the common external tariff in 1977.  The same will apply to Ireland's import duty on mutton and lamb but in our case imports, other than from Northern Ireland, are prohibited and we will of course have in EEC the continued import control on veterinary grounds provided for in the Accession Treaty.</P>

I understand that the British have been seeking to have a distinction made which would enable more New Zealand lamb to be brought in than would be brought in if the same tariff was applied to both frozen and chilled lamb.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell me if any negotiations in this regard have taken place since the Treaty of Accession was signed?</P>

      <P>Although, as indicated in a reply given on 16th November, 1972, to questions of a similar nature from Deputy Bruton, disease incidence has decreased over the past three years, I am not satisfied with the pace of its reduction.

When the Department see that there is a need for a further increase, steps will <Col N="1437" /> be taken to implement such increase. Also, this special committee which were set up to look into the question of a reduction of the incidence of TB are presumably having a look at the question of price with a view to having it reviewed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Parliamentary Secretary that among the small farming community in particular an outbreak of this disease in cattle can be a great burden because the farmers are forced to sell their affected animals at a period which is not sufficient to replace the animals?  The fact is that people cannot afford to co-operate in the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The net profit before taxation for Irish Steel Holdings Ltd., was £174,997 for the year <Col N="1448" /> ended 30th June, 1972, compared with £361,567 for the year ended 30th June, 1971.</P>
      <P>This unsatisfactory result has been attributed to a fall in the domestic demand for steel reinforcing bars and sections and to the inevitable disturbance to production due to the installation of new plant.  In addition, the company, like others, were affected by increased labour costs.  I am hopeful that, when the new plant is in full production the company's financial results will improve significantly.</P>
      <P>With regard to market conditions in the European Communities, I am satisfied that the company's present development and future plans for expansion will enable it to continue to hold its share of the home market and to increase its exports.</P>
      <P>Under the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities Ireland may retain restrictions on the export of waste scrap metal of iron and steel until the end of 1977.  Consequent on its expansion programme, however, the company will also require to import a substantial tonnage of scrap. No difficulty is foreseen in obtaining these supplies or other raw materials, for example, pig iron and ferromanganese, when this country joins the EEC.</P>

      <P>No subsidies were given to the company by the Government in the form of guaranteed orders.</P>
      <P>There have been many consultations between officers of my Department and the company on matters arising from its trading position under Community rules and regulations, and representatives of the company and of my Department have had a number of discussions with officials of the Coal and Steel Community.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, concessions during the five years' transitional period have been secured for the Irish steel industry.

It is considered that the &ldquo;Buy Irish Campaign&rdquo; as at present conducted by the National Development Association, which is the successor of the NAIDA does not conflict with EEC obligations and there was, therefore, no need to issue any instruction to that body on the matter.</P>

On the day on which each monthly report of the commission was published, I indicated in a press statement that I had accepted the commission's recommendations for price increases for the firms concerned and that I would raise no objection to the implementation of these increases.</P>
      <P>In the period from 1st February, 1971, up to the date of establishment of the commission I indicated, in monthly press statements, that I had raised no objections to a total of 61 price increases involving foodstuffs.</P>

It will be appreciated that these figures are approximate since the prices of these proteins, particularly soya bean and fish meal, are subject to world market fluctuations.</P>

I should point out, however, that the Retail Price (Food) Display Order, 1972, at present in force in respect of certain foodstuffs goes a considerable way to meet the unit pricing idea in that it requires the display by retailers of the prices of the commodities concerned per normal unit of weight or other measurement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>On entry of Ireland into the EEC it will be necessary to align the protective element in our duties on imports of wines from Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Spain with the Common External Tariff of the EEC. This alignment will be achieved progressively by reductions in the difference between the protective element in our duties and the Common External Tariff, of 40 per cent on 1st January, 1974, 20 per cent on 1st January, 1975, 20 per cent on 1st January, 1976, and 20 per cent on 1st July, 1977.</P>
      <P>No trade agreements exist between the EEC and Bulgaria.  A trade agreement exists between the EEC and Yugoslavia but this agreement does not grant any tariff concessions in respect of wines from Yugoslavia.  A preferential trade agreement exists between the EEC and Spain, and, in the context of this agreement, the Community grants tariff quotas in respect of certain wines to Spain.  It is expected that this agreement will be re-negotiated to take account of the enlargement of the EEC but, at this stage, it is not expected that Ireland will share in the tariff quota allocations for Spanish wines before January, 1974.</P>

      <P>In the aftermath of the recent explosions, the Government decided to examine the question of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result, they have approved in principle of the introduction of a scheme under which persons who have suffered substantial personal injury and dependants of persons who have <Col N="1460" /> lost their lives through incidents such as recently happened in Dublin would be enabled to obtain compensation from State funds. Details of the scheme will be worked out as quickly as possible but, in any event, it is intended that the scheme will operate retrospectively to 1st October last.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances, the Government have regarded the matter of compensation for personal injury, which is not at present covered by law, as the first priority.  The question of amending the existing law relating to compensation for malicious damage to property is being further examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to be concise and to avoid repetition of what has been said.  Every Deputy, particularly every rural Deputy, has had experience of dealing with the Land Commission in relation to problems of acquiring and subdividing land in their constituencies.  I am very disappointed by the progress made by the Land Commission and I believe some change is necessary.  We must realise the magnitude of the problem which confronts the Land Commission at present.  I do not want anybody to get the impression that I am critical of the officials. On the contrary, I have had experience of dealing with local officials for many years and I have found them very helpful and courteous, but the system under <Col N="1464" /> which they work is completely outdated and a change is necessary.</P>
      <P>I have tabled questions on numerous occasions in connection with the acquisition and subdivision of land.  I can never understand why it takes so long to divide land acquired by the Land Commission.  The week before last I tabled a question in regard to land which was acquired in 1966 and which is still not divided.  Surely six years is too long.  In a congested area particularly, the only hope of farmers who are anxious to make their holdings viable is the Land Commission acquiring land and coming to their aid. They have not got the finance to buy land themselves.  When it takes six years to divide land circumstances have changed, people have got tired of waiting, particularly younger people who are anxious to settle down and get married and arrest the decay we have had in rural Ireland for a number of years.  Because of long delays these people lose hope and in some cases younger people emigrate and this is one of the contributory factors to rural decay.  For that reason the Minister and his Department have a fairly important role to play, even though I agreed with the Minister when he said some time ago that his Department should be abolished.  He said that, but unfortunately no progress has been made.  I believe this should be the function of the Department of Agriculture. I think they would be far more capable of dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hears suggestions coming from Ministers and from the Government of changes they would like to see made but the problem is that there is too much lip service paid to change without any real action being taken. I had a question down for today which was disallowed because it was supposed to be a repetition of a question asked some time ago in connection with the transfer of the Minister's Department to Castlebar, about which we heard so much some time ago.  The need is for Departments to take action to deal with the problems that confront the people.  The Land Commission is a classic example.  Whether it requires a change to the Department of Agriculture, or whatever is required, <Col N="1465" /> particularly with our entry to the EEC the aim should be to create as many viable holdings as possible in rural Ireland.  It is almost impossible to buy land at present and this situation has been aggravated by the Land Commission.  It would be far more effective, particularly with the inefficiency in the Land Commission, if we could induce people to buy their own land and provide capital for them at a reduced rate of interest.  This would be more effective than the system operating under the Land Commission.  I would make an urgent appeal to the Minister to get after his officials in the Land Commission and give them more liberty in the acquisition and subdividing of land. People have lost faith in the Land Commission.  The Minister has alluded to this before in this House.  He has said that he is not satisfied but there is no point in saying that he is not satisfied.  The onus is on him to do something about it.  I am sure the Minister, in the constituency he represents, has this problem as much as anybody.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a point in regard to controls on the buying of land.  The dearer the price of land the smaller will be the pool of people who can afford to buy it.  The Minister will admit that faceless men are buying up large amounts of land, and that people who are not farmers are investing an enormous amount of money in the purchase of land.  Consequently, land is passing into the hands of professional people and others to the detriment of the farmers. If we allow this to continue we cannot solve the problem of which we hear so much, namely, saving the west of Ireland.  If this uncontrolled purchase of land is allowed to continue we will find ourselves in the situation where a small percentage of people will own an enormous area and this is something I should not like to see happen.</P>
    <P>People in public life are well aware of the problem that exists with regard to the acquisition of land.  Frequently we are told that farms are for sale and we are asked to make representations to the Land Commission.  The seller of the land naturally is anxious <Col N="1466" /> to get the best price but the Land Commission haggle with him regarding the price and eventually when the deal is made the price will be paid in land bonds.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told the House that he would like to change the system. It is my belief that if the procedure involved were challenged in the courts it would be proved unconstitutional. I have come across many instances where there was a family settlement, the money to be distributed among the members of the family.  The Land Commission acquire the land but the land bonds are difficult to distribute. It is not the ideal solution for a family settlement and I should like the Minister to refer to this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>There have been reports on conditions in the west of Ireland and the high rate of unemployment has often been referred to in this House.  I should like to see every acre of land that is not suitable for any other purposes except afforestation put into the hands of the Department of Lands and money invested in planting it.  If this were done it would reduce the high rate of unemployment and help to solve some of the problems of the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am appalled to learn that since 1965 our forestry labour force has been reduced by 50 per cent and were it not for the intervention of the Minister it would continue to diminish. Afforestation would add to the beauty of the countryside and I am glad that the grant for tree planting has been increased.  This is long overdue but the conditions laid down are too rigid and perhaps the Minister would investigate the matter.  We should do everything possible to encourage people to plant land that is not suitable for any other purpose.</P>
    <P>We have considerable afforestation in my constituency but the mature timber and the thinnings are transported at much expense to Scarriff and to Waterford to the two chipboard factories. I know the Minister has been contacted on a number of occasions about establishing a chipboard factory at a central point which would eliminate <Col N="1467" /> transport costs.  If this were done, the preparation of the ground for planting, the actual planting, the care and maintenance of the trees, the work on the thinnings and the fencing and eventually dealing with the timber in the factory would provide worthwhile employment.</P>
    <P>Last week I asked the Minister for Lands a parliamentary question on this matter and the Minister agreed this could provide employment.  We should try to ensure that as much land as possible is bought for afforestation purposes.  There are thousands of acres in the possession of the forestry section that are not planted but I do not know the reason for the delay.  At one stage the Minister for Finance said in this House that he had given more money to the Minister for Lands than he was able to spend in that particular year so it appears it is not lack of finance that is causing the delay.  The Minister should give serious thought to an extensive afforestation drive and I hope he will refer to this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>Where mountain areas are acquired and where there is arable land adjoining them, it is the duty of the Land Commission to inspect those areas and to acquire them compulsorily in order to relieve congestion and thus help make uneconomic holdings viable.  If one had information about the work being done under the land project scheme and the land that is brought into full productivity, one could find out where land is planted.  There are thousands of acres suitable for nothing else and we are making very little progress in acquiring these and ensuring that we keep an increasing labour force in employment on this development, and without planting any arable land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred last night to commonages.  I do not know if the Minister has experience of these.  I certainly have.  I know cases in which there are as many as ten farmers with joint ownership of 1,300 to 1,500 acres of mountain.  Some of it could be reclaimed and put into good grassland but, because of the joint ownership and the number involved who will <Col N="1468" /> not do anything and who will, in fact, prevent others who are more industrious from doing anything to improve the fertility of the land in question, it is quite impossible to make this land viable.  I believe there is power to acquire such land compulsorily.  Is this land being acquired?  I know a farmer, as good a farmer as could be found in Cork, who has reclaimed his land but he has a one-third ownership in a commonage and he maintains that with drainage and liming this commonage could be the best grazing ground in the county for sheep; he cannot improve it because, if he does, the others will have the same rights as he has, but the others are not anxious to improve the commonage.  It would be desirable for the Land Commission to acquire this and divide it amongst the people concerned.  That would make small holdings more viable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey spoke last night about conservation.  It is important that we should protect our natural environment. This is something that could be overlooked in the process of industrial expansion.  Is there liaison between the different Departments involved? There is a classic example down in Cork.  The Lee was harnessed by the ESB some years ago and a vast acreage of land was acquired.  Included in it was the finest wild life sanctuary in the county on the tourist road from Cork to Glengarriff.  The ESB removed some of the timber.  When the valley is flooded it is all right, but last summer the area was dried out and it was the most appalling sight.  I do not know who is responsible but some responsibility should be placed somewhere for conservation and the protection of our natural environment.</P>
    <P>I understand grants are paid for the development of game and so forth. In my area there are game councils who do a great deal of restocking but, even with restocking, they claim there is a great scarcity of game. Game should not be allowed to be depleted to the point at which it is beyond redemption.  Game is an important tourist attraction.  We have had Frenchmen and Germans over here on a shoot three or four times a year.  That could be developed <Col N="1469" /> further provided we do not destroy the foundation stock.  The Minister should keep an eye on this.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will consider the points I have made.  I speak from experience.  The Minister could do a great deal more where conservation and the protection of our natural environment are concerned and I think that is a view held by practically every Deputy in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate so far has highlighted the many difficulties inhibiting the Land Commission and the Government from formulating a land settlement policy designed to provide as many families as possible with a reasonable standard of living in rural areas.  Almost every speaker up to this has put forward proposals suggesting how this could be done.  Many of the proposals made did not take into account what is really happening today from the point of view of the price of land and so forth.  The price of land has reached astronomical heights.  There is, too, the problem of what the small farmer would have to pay by way of annuity for such land if the Land Commission were to acquire it.  That brings me to what the real role of the Land Commission should be in the future.  Despite the quite justifiable criticisms made, in the past decade many significant advances have been made by the Land Commission.  Some 360,000 acres have been acquired and divided amongst some 20,000 allottees.  The best part of 2,000 dwelling houses and outoffices have been erected.  New homes and families have been established.  This was all achieved at a time when the price for agricultural land was at a pitch where the repayable annuities were within the capacity of the allottees to pay.  What for the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to consider introducing some legislation which will curtail the non-farming community, people who have no connection with the land, from purchasing land at enormously inflated prices, land which should be purchased by the Land Commission to relieve congestion.  In making this proposition I am aware that there could well be constitutional problems, <Col N="1470" /> and that the question of freedom of sale would also arise.  One has to try to balance what is appropriate to the common good with what would make it possible to give a satisfactory price for the land to the owner.</P>
    <P>In modern times it is a question of dog eat dog.  Where is it leading to and where will it all end?  Many farmers and their wives and families are worn to a thread on small uneconomic holdings.  They are trying to eke out a living at subsistence level, or barely at that level.  They constitute a serious responsibility for the Government. Land must be acquired and they must be granted extensions to their holdings.  In other cases it is necessary to provide part-time employment.  The Land Commission, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the advisory services and the Industrial Development Authority should have a closer liaison and more consultation to provide the right kind of job opportunity for people who cannot hope to get extensions to their holdings, at least in the near future.  They must have an opportunity to get employment off the land.</P>
    <P>These organisations should use their undoubted ability and expertise in formulating a policy for rapid industrial expansion in the rural areas and the rural towns to provide opportunities in forestry and in tourism for farmers and their families.  With the astronomical prices for land today, they cannot hope to get an economic or a viable farm unit and they must be helped to obtain a satisfactory living with part-time employment. These proposals can be helped out of the EEC agricultural fund.  Now is the time for this House to lay down the right type of criteria on which we can get expansion in these fields.</P>
    <P>The question of land bonds gives rise to many problems and inhibits the easy purchase of estates by the Land Commission. I have interviewed many people who would have no objection to the Land Commission purchasing their holdings to relieve congestion but they are frightened by the land bonds payment system.  In these cases the Land Commission should be empowered to purchase land on a cash <Col N="1471" /> basis, thereby encouraging land holders who would otherwise sell their land in the normal commercial way to give it to the Land Commission for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>The structure of many existing holdings makes it impossible for farmers to develop the full potential of their farms. There are many small disjointed holdings and the time lost by farmers in the operation of their units is very significant indeed.  Even if they started on a parochial basis, I should like to see the Land Commission organising existing small farms and helping to make exchanges possible, thereby providing a more compact farm unit on which it would be possible for the individual farmer to expand to the utmost.  This applies particularly to dairy farmers.  If a dairy farmer is to build up his stock and get the kind of income it is possible for him to get, his farm unit must be as compact as possible.  No other organisation has the capacity and the expertise which the Land Commission have, and which they gained down through the years, in creating a climate of opinion in which farmers will accept this type of proposal.  I know there are traditional barriers, and social barriers, and sometimes psychological barriers, which will have to be overcome but, in the long run, the exercise would be worthwhile.  Many farmers realise already&mdash;and others who may be reluctant will realise in time&mdash;the merit in these proposals.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the type of problem which most Deputies come up against from time to time, that is, the allocation of farms.  In the past few years on some occasions I have disagreed with decisions taken by the Land Commission.  I do not say this in any critical sense because, no matter who tried to allocate land for the relief of congestion, somebody would be found to disagree with him.  I have in mind a few special instances.  For instance, when a husband dies the widow is inhibited from working the farm to its full potential.  Some time later the Land Commission may be dividing a farm within one mile of her farm, and the policy of the Land Commission would be, normally, that she would <Col N="1472" /> not be entitled to land because her existing unit was not being fully utilised. She may have a young family growing up of two or three young boys who, in four or five years, would demonstrate beyond all shadow of doubt that they could fully utilise the existing unit, and also work the extra acres granted to them.  In instances such as these the Land Commission should have a little more flexibility in ascertaining what the real future potential of a farm might be.  This would often take into account what the family situation might be, not only today but in the future.</P>
    <P>It has been argued against that by the Land Commission that they must take the situation as they find it, and we all appreciate that if that is the position.  There are some farmers today &mdash;a minority, I know&mdash;who did get an extension to their holdings but who have shown that they were possibly not the best persons to get such an extension. We know of people who have not fully utilised the land they have got, while others who would be much better able to manage it have been passed over.  I make this point because I have a special interest in a few of these cases where I believe that if the Land Commission were to continue operating the policy of dividing land on the basis of what is happening on a particular farm at a given time and not taking into account what may well be the position in a few years, mistakes can readily be made, mistakes which can never be rectified.</P>
    <P>I would point out also that when a scheme of division is being framed and where it is obvious that a majority of the applicants will qualify for land, some indication should be given to those farmers that they will, after the ultimate division of the farm, qualify for land.  This would encourage them to retain breeding stock in their herds or to operate whatever farming enterprise they have with this expansion in mind.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the point of the length of time it often takes to divide a farm.  I know that there can be extreme and great difficulties, particularly where exchanges have to be arranged, and I know that the Land <Col N="1473" /> Commission in recent years have cut down considerably the length of time involved.  They are to be congratulated on this and we can only encourage the Land Commission to go on reducing the time-lag as far as possible so that the farm will not be run down and the farmers who will benefit by its subsequent division can go ahead with the expanding process and development of their farms.</P>
    <P>The scheme which the Land Commission operate in relation to pensions for elderly and incapacitated retiring farmers has obviously not been a success. There are, I suppose, many reasons for this, such as the great attachment of people to land generally and their reluctance to give up that traditional hold on land.  Possibly the more attractive proposals in EEC conditions will encourage more people of that category to make available their farms to the Land Commission and we can only hope that will be the position.</P>
    <P>It was encouraging to hear of the increase under the Forestry Division in the amounts for private planting. In recent years there has been a growth in interest in these plantations and the increase will help to induce more people to undertake private plantations.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer very briefly to a complaint made to me by some gun clubs in my area in relation to shooting lettings in the hands of the Land Commission.  I am informed that in some cases these gun clubs have not been given an opportunity to tender for these lettings and this, if it has taken place, is a regrettable development. Many of these gun clubs have been very conscientious in the way they have helped sanctuaries to be built up, and if there are private individuals who can readily afford to pay much higher rates for such shooting rights, the Minister would be well advised to look into the matter.</P>
    <P>I come back to the point at which I commenced, the purchase of land by people not connected with land.  It cannot be socially desirable and it must inevitably run into a situation in which we will return faster to the <Col N="1474" /> ranch type of farming, where possibly the owner is not even farming.  I would like to see the Government considering a curtailing type of legislation so that this undesirable development, as I see it, will not be carried too far into the future because it will bring in its train a kind of problem which we do not want to see arising.  For my part I would support whatever proposals were put forward to prevent its happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity which this debate presents to make a few points in relation to the activities of the Land Commission. I will not insult the Minister's intelligence or that of his Department by labouring what I have to say but one does get the feeling, when speaking in Estimates debates, that one's words might sometimes as well be spoken to the wind.  I suppose that is inevitable having regard to the system but one can only hope that some of them will land somewhere and, possibly, bear fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree completely with Deputy Smith in regard to the growing evil&mdash; and I do not consider &ldquo;evil&rdquo; to be too strong a word&mdash;of the large-scale purchases of land by non-farmers. Our farming industry is too important and our land is too scarce to permit it to become the hobby of rich men but, unfortunately, that has been happening with increasing frequency during the past couple of years.  We have seen it happen in Westmeath which is part of the constituency that I have the honour to represent.  We have seen non-farmers, principally businessmen from this city and, more particularly, men engaged in the building industry, paying very large sums for very large tracts of land.  This move has certain ill-effects.  First, as Deputy Smith has said, it inflates the price of land because if a man in one part of a county sells land at £400 or £500 per acre, the next man to offer his land for sale expects to receive the same price so that there develops a psychological compulsion to ask for and give these inflated prices.  This effect ripples out over an area much wider than where the purchases take <Col N="1475" /> place and begins to affect the price of land throughout the country generally. It is a bad thing that land should be inflated to such an extent that the genuine <i>bona fide</i> farmer who wishes to expand his holding, is not able to pay the inflated price.</P>
    <P>Another ill-consequence of this development is that it is giving rise to much rural discontent.  In my county and in County Longford we have seen the growth in recent years of a body called the Land League.  I have great sympathy with the objectives of the members of this organisation.  I know that in the case of most branches of that league, the activities are based on a genuine concern to rectify what they see as a social injustice.  They see land being purchased by people who are non-farmers while they, who are depending on farming as their sole means of livelihood, are left by the State to try to make their living on holdings that are inadequately sized.  It is no wonder, then, that they form themselves into pressure-groups to have the State acquire these large farms that are being used by non-farmers.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that when such agitation begins, persons of ill-motivation may take advantage of the front presented for the purpose of agitating merely for the sake of agitation. I have no doubt that this has happened in some cases and the policies pursued by certain branches of these land leagues in some areas have not been happy.  They have tended to be intimidatory.  I have warned any members that I have met that they should not spoil the justice of their cause by using methods that are unlawful and unjust.  By and large I find they are very conscious of this.  However, the fact that they have been forced into those organisations presents an opportunity for subversive groups to take advantage of the front and try to cause mischief in our society.  There would be no need for these fronts if there were a policy of control of entry into the farming industry.  Our land is much too valuable an asset to allow it to become available for sale to any speculator who fancies himself as a gentleman farmer and who has the <Col N="1476" /> status of an estate down the country with which to impress his friends.</P>
    <P>In this connection I know that in some cases justification is based on these purchases by pretending&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;pretending&rdquo; advisedly&mdash; that the farms are being turned into stud farms.  This is a loophole that will have to be plugged.  It is not good enough to put one or two brood mares on a farm of 500 or 600 acres and call it a stud farm.  Some criteria must be established so as to ensure that only <i>bona fide</i> farms can escape any action by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I have found, too, that in cases where such purchases are brought to the attention of the Land Commission, the Land Commission find that they are unable to move to acquire these large holdings from these non-farmers because it may be the case that, for historical reasons, there are no congests within a mile of the area. The field staff find themselves, then, in an impossible position before the Commissioners when the objection to the acquisition is being heard.  If there is no congestion the Commissioners are more or less coerced into allowing the objection and to restoring the land to the <i>nouveau</i> rancher.</P>
    <P>While there might not be congestion in the immediate vicinity of such a ranch there is no part of this country sufficiently far away for one to be able to say that there is not congestion which could be relieved by acquiring the farm concerned.  I see this to a very sharp degree in my constituency. In Westmeath I see tracts of land of up to 1,000 acres in the hands of individuals while not ten miles away in County Longford there are men trying to rear families on holdings of 15 to 20 acres.  It is very difficult to explain to these people the technical reasons that inhibit the Land Commission from acquiring these ranches. I am sure they regard my explanations as hollow and cannot comprehend them.  I sympathise with their lack of comprehension because the illogicality of the explanations I give is apparent to me.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to give urgent priority to devising some control on the entry of non-farmers into <Col N="1477" /> farming.  It is a matter of great social consequence and one which, if not controlled, could lead to most undesirable and possibly violent or semi-violent agitation.  The fact that very little violence has occurred to date in this regard is commendable and reflects great credit on the restraint of persons who are deprived of land and who are endeavouring to eke out their living on uneconomic holdings while this scandal is taking place within their knowledge, either in their own county or in adjoining counties.</P>
    <P>These large ranches would be ideally suited for acquisition and division among migrants from congested areas.  At this stage I would make a special plea in regard to the problems in Longford-Westmeath in this regard.  I would urge that when farms are acquired in Westmeath the migrants be taken from other parts of the county or from the adjoining county of Longford.  Very often they are taken from the west or south-west and this is hard on the people in the immediate adjoining areas who cannot understand why persons from the west should be given preference while they themselves who are in a similar position and who are close to the land being distributed are overlooked.  It would be less of a social trauma to move people from Longford to Westmeath than to bring migrants from, say, Galway and Mayo to the midlands, where the way of life is different in many small ways.  There can be difficulties of adjustment and of becoming assimilated into the community. Many of these difficulties could be avoided if migration was confined to the immediately adjoining counties.  Land was divided in Westmeath not so long ago and several holdings were earmarked for migrants from the west of Ireland.  This caused considerable acrimony among smallholders in the area.  They could not understand why they were not qualified to get land; they were working their farms economically and were married with wives and families to support.  It is difficult to explain this situation in terms of the national <Col N="1478" /> policy of the Land Commission.  I could not explain it to them.  It was not enough to say that it was Land Commission policy to bring people from the west and to give them these holdings in the midlands.  If the people in the midlands were satisfied that would be all right, but there was demand and need in the midlands and it was considered that the people there should get preference when land was being divided, because they would settle more easily and adjust more easily.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak particularly of Longford/Westmeath.  I make no apology for speaking about this area; that is what I am here for.  There is a vast problem about land, particularly in County Longford.  There are small-holdings there and holdings which are often very fragmented so that in the absence of a massive scheme of re-arrangement the problem is insoluble. Such re-arrangement can only be achieved where there is adequate staff available to do this work.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter by way of supplementary question to the Minister some days ago and he invited me to raise it on the Estimate.  I do so now, with pleasure.  The staff in Mullingar have to deal with two counties.  There are particularly severe land problems in the area.  There is one acquisition inspector there and three inspectors available to deal with allotments and re-arrangement.  This staff is hopelessly inadequate.  It is impossible for that office to inspect all the land that comes for sale and to process the purchase of it.  It is quite hopeless for the three remaining inspectors to deal with the amount of land that becomes available, having regard to the utterly fragmented condition of the county.  To try to deal with it with that staff and in isolation is only toying with the problem. The problem will never be solved this way.</P>
    <P>This is a serious social problem.  It is important to the country that the problem is not being solved.  This is being highlighted now by our accession to Europe where the value of agricultural land is appreciated.  It is becoming apparent that we are not utilising our <Col N="1479" /> resources fully.  It is not a question of making good land out of bad land or of being handicapped by the land's physical characteristics.  All the problems can be solved by man provided the drive and energy are there and thought is given to the problems.  I do not want to be taken as being critical of the staff in the Land Commission offices throughout the country.  My experience of these men is that they are dedicated officials carrying out their work with a sense of vocation, but they are strangled by a system which does not allow them to acquire the land they need and which is slow to operate, cumbersome to manage and unduly bureaucratic in its approach. The requirements of accountability, particularly financial accountability, impose limitations but the operation of the Land Commission in practice far exceeds any requirements in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if the mass of practical knowledge and enthusiasm that is to be found in Land Commission offices throughout the country could be harnessed by the central authority of the Land Commission in Dublin worthwhile schemes and plans would quickly emerge and these would go a long way towards alleviating many of the glaring and long-standing problems.</P>
    <P>We have been an independent State for the past 50 years.  The Minister indicated some time ago that his Department might be redundant.  I beg leave to disagree with him.  There is a serious problem in regard to land structures.  This problem must be solved.  One tremendous aid now available is the incentives provided <i>via</i> the EEC for elderly farmers to retire and to make their lands available for younger men who are prepared to use the land in accordance with proper development plans.  Some years ago the Land Commission on their own initiative produced a type of retirement plan but it never got off the ground; it was regarded with suspicion by farmers.  It seemed to be financially inadequate.  The facilities made available by our membership of the EEC appear better financially and appear to <Col N="1480" /> be of a kind that could be &ldquo;sold&rdquo; to the type of farmer whom we would like to see retiring and handing over his land to more go-ahead younger people.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that the retirement is completely voluntary and that there is no element of compulsion in this scheme.  In order that this retirement scheme might work successfully it would have to be &ldquo;sold&rdquo; successfully to the persons for whom it is intended. I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the persons not to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; such a scheme are the officials of the Land Commission, because so far as the farmers are concerned they are &ldquo;them&rdquo;, not quite their opponents but somebody with interests that might be in conflict with the farmers' interests. These schemes will have to be encouraged by the farming organisations themselves such as the IFA, Macra na Tuaithe and Macra na Feirme.  The local authorities, via the county committees of agriculture and the instructors who are friendly, familiar figures to many of the farmers, could be utilised to explain the benefits of these schemes.  This is an area where sensitivity is demanded and in the absence of that sensitivity this scheme, which has a tremendous, far-reaching and beneficial potential, might not get off the ground.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which deserves very serious consideration.  The Government might be able to devise a way out of their dilemma in regard to the termination of non-incentive payments to farmers, in other words, the dole.  I understand that there would be no objection under the terms of our membership of the EEC that payments be made to small farmers to supplement their income, but that these payments will have to be in some way incentives and tied to production.  The present system of paying a deontas will have to come to an end.  I do not think any self-respecting person entitled to these payments would be disappointed if his payment were tied to his farming activities.  If he has any self-respect he cannot object to that.</P>
    <P>I realise that this politically is a delicate area, but I look to a Government secure in their support from the electorate, <Col N="1481" /> to have the courage to deal with this delicate problem firmly and quickly.  I understand it is a problem that will have to be dealt with very quickly if we are not to lose a lot of money from the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>I now come to the acquisition of land and the machinery for it.  Land acquisition is a tedious process.  Very often the delay is due to legal complications which may result from a title not being in order.  Difficulties in putting it in order may result from difficulties in solicitors' offices&mdash;I will not put it differently from that.  Very often it is compounded by the extraordinary procedures that have to be adopted in the Examiner's Branch of the Land Commission when the sale is a compulsory acquisition and the title has to be shown via the Examiner's Branch.  I cannot see any justification for continuing that procedure any longer.  I do not see why conveyance to the Land Commission, whether by way of voluntary sale or compulsory acquisition, should not be conducted, like any other conveyance, through the Land Commission Solicitor's Office where the procedure is as speedy as in normal commercial circles.  It would ease many problems and would help the reputation of the Land Commission in rural Ireland if acquisitions could be completed speedily and if payment does have to be in bonds that the bonds would be handed over straightaway.  I know that they are placed to credit and the person owning the land receives the accumulated interest in due course but invariably income tax has been deducted and there is the further practical difficulty of having to reclaim the income tax.</P>
    <P>Again, if land bonds are in a falling market or if by the time they come to be allotted as opposed to allocated or allocated as opposed to allotted&mdash;I am not sure of the technicalities the Examiner applies in this regard&mdash;they may have fallen and there may be a capital loss.  The Examiner's Branch is now archaic and the persons in it, who are all lawyers, could do their conveyancing via the Solicitor's Office in the normal way of conveyancing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> I should like to turn briefly to the Minister's remarks on the Forestry Section of the Department and to mention a couple of points in relation to that section.  The first is in regard to the grant which is now being made available for private planting.  This grant used to be in the sum of £20 per acre payable as to £10 on planting and payable five years afterwards as to the balance of £10.  The grant has been increased to £35 payable as to £20 on planting and the balance of £15 seven years after planting.  I do respectfully suggest to the Minister that a grant, part of which will not be paid for seven years, is psychologically useless to the farmer who is getting it.  It is very much a case of live horse and you will get grass.</P>
    <P>If the farmer plants his acre of trees and does it competently he should be paid the full grant there and then.  If the trees do not develop due to some fault in his husbandry the State should be prepared to accept the occasional failure but when a tree is planted it requires very little agricultural expertise to make it grow.  It will normally grow without any more work on the part of the farmer.  To inspect seven years afterwards and see how the crop has done and then pay the balance of £15 is, I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo;, but it verges on that. Having regard to the comparatively trivial amount, I do not see why the whole grant would not be paid.  The motive is to encourage private planting. Give the grant when the trees are planted and let there be no more about it.</P>
    <P>Again, I might mention a point I made here some time ago on an Estimate for the Forestry Section.  I suggest the grant should be payable, or a lesser scale of grant should be payable, in respect of planting smaller areas. There are comparatively few farmers who would have as large an area as an acre for planting or who would have the interest in forestry to plant an entire acre but there are many farmers who would be anxious to plant odd corners of wasteland, who would be anxious to plant boundaries between fields, and they should be assisted to plant in that fashion.  In particular, <Col N="1483" /> they should be assisted to plant hardwoods. The balance as between hardwoods and evergreens is too lopsided. There is not sufficient planting now of hardwoods.  We will never see the result of hardwood planting that is done now but some future generation may see it and, perhaps, would thank us who had the foresight to encourage it at this time.  When we look at areas like the Phoenix Park or other areas of hardwood we give thanks to the generation of a century or more ago who had the foresight to engage in that type of planting.</P>
    <P>Much of the country lacks hardwood cover.  Hardwood is scenically nicer and ecologically desirable and should be encouraged by the Forestry Section. The encouragement may possibly have to take the form of some small grant for separate trees.  If you depart from a grant based on an area of land you get down to difficulties of measurement. If a person is prepared to plant 12 or six or several dozen hardwood trees on waste spots on his farm he should be encouraged to do so.  I should like to see a change of approach here.  It is an environmental thing but that is one of the duties of the Forestry Section, a duty which, by and large, they have discharged with care for the country. It is something they would be pleased to encourage and if they did encourage it they would find a ready response on the part of farmers.</P>
    <P>In regard to the planting of evergreen forests on hills and wasteland, I note from the Minister's speech that the rate of acquisition is encouraging and satisfactory and that a suitable land bank is being maintained.  There was some doubt about that some time ago and I think it was due to the fact that the prices being paid were totally inadequate.  I know the type of land being bought is not valuable but having regard to the way the speculators to whom I referred earlier have increased the farmer's notion of the value of his land, it may be difficult for the Forestry Section to get land at the old price.</P>
    <P>The Minister used the expression &ldquo;gross areas acquired&rdquo;.  I do not know <Col N="1484" /> exactly what that means.  The area secured in 1970-71 is 34,436 acres, whereas I understood that some time ago the area acquired around that time was 20,000 or 25,000 acres.  I do not know what &ldquo;gross&rdquo; means in that context but the Minister, I assume, is happy with the amount of land being acquired and is satisfied that a land bank to meet future requirements is being maintained.</P>
    <P>In connection with the planting of vast areas of hill, this is something that will have to be approached with care from the point of view of the change that it will make in the appearance of large areas of our countryside.  Bare hills and vistas that can be opened up can be quite dramatic and are very Irish in their appearance but if mile upon mile of mountain is going to be covered by anonymous evergreens a lot of harm visually could be done to important tourist parts of our country and this is something that has to be very carefully considered at this stage by the Forestry Section in regard to future planting operations.  There are many areas of no visual amenity where planting can go ahead apace but in the tourist areas of the country and in the mountainy tourist areas it is very important that some of the spectacular views of which we are justifiably proud should not be unwittingly cut off by forests.  I noticed particularly in west Cork certain areas where young plantings had recently been sown.  They were not impeding the view but there was no doubt that when they would reach maturity some very spectacular views would be obscured.  Granted we have to balance the preservation of those views with the benefits to the economy of large forests but I would ask the Department in their planting policy to be very conscious for the need to maintain a balance.</P>
    <P>I do not know if recruitment of professional foresters is satisfactory from the Minister's point of view.  He did not mention it.  He mentioned the question of foresters trained within the Department.  I am talking of graduates and persons of that status. It is important that the numbers be maintained because of the growing importance of the forestry section not <Col N="1485" /> merely in the technical timber operation but in regard to its responsibility for wild life, for the development of forest parks and such things.  Persons of the highest technical and professional qualifications should be recruited. It is important that there should be no shortage of staff to ensure that this country which is, in my opinion, physically the nicest in Europe will remain so and that the many physical attributes we have will be preserved and extended wherever the work of man can successfully do so.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the wonderful job which has been done in the Rockingham estate outside Boyle.  This is an amenity of tremendous value and of wonderful scenic beauty and much commonsense and sensitivity has been used in its planning. The one black mark is that the mansion is gone but I know there are arguments on both sides as to why that should be.  I think there must be opportunities in other parts of the country to produce similar developments. They should be sought out and examined and brought into being as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to complain about the delay in bringing in the Wild Life Bill.  As long ago as March 1970 it was indicated that the detailed outline of comprehensive legislation was in the course of completion.  That was March, 1970, and this is December, 1972.  It will soon be three years since that legislation was in the course of completion.  I realise that the legislative programme which the Government have to bring before the House is varied and there are many demands on the Government's time but I do think that having regard to the importance of this piece of legislation to the future shape of our country, it is time it was brought in here, debated and became part of our law without any further delay.  I would ask the Minister to do what he can to achieve that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate I should like to refer particularly to problems which I have come across in my constituency.  People who are <Col N="1486" /> not too well acquainted with Kildare might think that we would not have many land problems there, that with racing interests, <i>et cetera,</i> we might not be too concerned with land, but I can assure the Minister that if I were to pick out any one Department which has given me more headaches than any other in my brief term here it would be the Land Commission.  I realise that it is practically impossible for them to keep up the land pool and divide an equal amount each year.  With prices ranging from £400 an acre for agricultural land and more recently over £600 an acre in south Kildare it is not possible for the Land Commission to acquire land and get tenants who are prepared to pay £40, £50 and even £60 per statute acre a year.  The problem is that there are too many people looking for too little land.</P>
      <P>My frustration with the Land Commission is tempered by the realisation that their difficulties in handling certain problems are not altogether their fault but they are not carrying out their work as I would like to see it carried out.  I can quote examples in my constituency during the last few years to prove that.  One which I have raised here and which has not been resolved concerns a Land Commission holding which was divided 15 years ago.  Some migrants and some locals were put on that land and given lots of 33 acres each.  A well-known local racing personality acquired one of those farms and he is in the process of acquiring another.  Those on the 33 acre holdings look upon this as their last chance of ever improving themselves and getting viable holdings. While a sale has not yet been completed, I cannot understand the delay in dealing with this.  The Land Commission cannot say they have no hand in the matter seeing that they put those people there.  Something must be done to improve their lot and that something must be to acquire land that is on the market.  The fact that they have cheap land already would entice them to take land even at a dearer rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to say that migration into Kildare has now stopped.  We have had many migrant farmers <Col N="1487" /> brought into Kildare.  Many of them are excellent farmers and good friends of mine but I, like the previous speaker, find it very difficult to explain to constituents of mine a policy which allows further holdings to be created not for locals but for outsiders.  Only last year the Land Commission brought a migrant from County Kerry into Kildare and there seemed to be no liaison between the Land Commission inspectors in the two counties.  This man gave up a holding in Kerry.  He made a cursory examination of the holding in Kildare and seemed to be happy enough.  He was getting 43 acres of good land, as he thought.  This estate before it was acquired was owned by one man.  It was a 90 acre estate and the owner found it difficult enough to live on it.  The Land Commission acquired it.  It was let in conacre for many years and finally they divided it into two 43 or 45 acre holdings.  That migrant finds that he is worse off in Kildare than he was in Kerry and that he can keep less cows. He also found that the land was not capable of being cut for silage.  We made a strong case to the Land Commission and, thanks to the Minister, an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of £100 was given to the migrant on condition that he laid down the farm in a proper manner.  This is an example of a disillusioned migrant who had hoped to improve his lot but who found that his last state was worse than his first.</P>
    <P>I do not know what machinery the Land Commission use or what legal tangles they get into but the restructuring of holdings is a cumbersome affair. I know of a case where a farmer had a small field that was land-locked.  Even though he made repeated requests to swop the land for an alternative area nothing was done about the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the scheme of grants for private planting whereby £20 is paid initially and a sum of £15 is paid after satisfactory maintenance is proved and seven years has elapsed. This is something the land project and land reclamation people could copy. I have seen many examples of land reclamation jobs that were allowed to <Col N="1488" /> lapse into their former condition for the want of ordinary farm husbandry.</P>
    <P>I am glad about the scheme which hopes to provide jobs in industry for small farmers.  I think the Minister at one stage mentioned that he considered 75 acres a viable holding.  Do the Land Commission consider a farm of 45 acres is viable or have they in mind a 70-acre holding?  I should like to compliment the Land Commission on the improvement of roads leading to farmhouses and on the improvement of houses and out-offices.  Some years ago we had trouble getting the county council to take over these roads but I am glad that we have no difficulty about this matter now.  The fact that the county council are happy to take over the roads is a tribute to the work that has been put into their construction.</P>
    <P>In Kildare we have only two forests where forest walks are set out.  During the summer in Cork I had a thorough appreciation of the work of the forestry people when I saw the forest walks in Gougane Barra and the amenities that have been provided.  I should like to compliment the Minister on the conservation work that has been done.  We have had experience of a Department working quickly when we requested that an area near Prosperous would be taken over as a preserve for mallard.  We got early action there and I can assure the Minister it was much appreciated.</P>
    <P>In Athy there is a wallboard factory which uses thinnings from forests. When we enter the EEC, this factory will face competition from plywood and chipboard factories in Sweden.  I am told the price charged for thinnings leaves a small margin of profit and I think we must consider this matter as it will be in the years ahead. In Ireland our forests are in the infant stage and while we are forced to use thinnings in Sweden they have mature forests and they have much timber.  Possibly we should subsidise this factory so that in 20 years time when we have mature forests we will have a factory that can deal with the raw material.  I know this factory could find itself in dire straits, especially if the price is increased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" /> I sympathise and agree with other speakers who referred to non-farming people who have acquired hundreds of acres of land.  I see this as the reason local land leagues and other organisations have been set up and although one does not condone their actions one can understand their feelings.  In the Athy area there is one farm where there are hundreds of acres, some derelict and most of them very badly farmed.  I understand the Land Commission are looking into the matter but there are many congests with small holdings who are anxious to farm and have proved their ability.  These people would be anxious to get additional land and they are ideal recruits for those who hold up the Land Commission to ridicule because of their lack of action.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission acquire land and do not divide it for some years, frequently it is eventually let in lots that are very large and do not suit local requirements.  When I mentioned this fact to the Land Commission I was told local people should get together, buy the lot and divide it among themselves.  However, this is not as easy as it sounds.  I have seen conacre and meadows being set in 50-acre lots.  Possibly one could excuse this for grazing but for meadows and tillage the Land Commission policy should be that small farmers in the locality who could take five or ten acres should get an opportunity of getting this land.  There has been an improvement recently in this regard but it is another cause of discontent among the farming community who hope to benefit when the Land Commission divide land but who are frequently left out in the cold when the land is set.</P>
    <P>I hope that in EEC conditions there will be an improvement in the calibre of people who acquire land.  I am pleased that new applicants for land will have to work out a development plan because this will do much good. We have had a considerable failure rate in many of the lands that have been divided; in some cases I could point to a 35 per cent failure rate and I think there must have been something <Col N="1490" /> wrong with the people who were allocated the land.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his somewhat radical approach to a thorny problem.  We realise there is too little land but I hope some of this extra money we have been speaking about and which we will get when we enter the EEC will be channelled towards promoting industry to areas where there is the greatest congestion.  The problem is that there has never been such pressure on land; too many people want to buy it and the price has escalated tremendously.  The Minister has a very difficult job.  He has made a good contribution in both Lands and Forestry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent the farming community in two counties, counties in which the holdings are small.  We have many, many problems in my constituency and throughout the West generally, more problems than they have in other constituencies throughout the country. The Forestry Division has done an excellent job and is still doing an excellent job.  People were anxious to dispose of land for afforestation and that land was bought and planted. Over the last two years there has been a noticeable change.  Livestock has increased in price and that, coupled with all the prognostications with regard to our economic well-being when we enter the EEC, has led to a reversal of the position that obtained up to two years ago.  Instead of people wanting to sell land they are now anxious to get land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately, the Forestry Division has been most understanding and land that might have been planted has not been planted.  The Minister and his Department decided that any land suitable for division amongst smallholders would be taken over by the Land Commission and divided.  This is an excellent gesture by the Minister and his Department.  We had been for a long time watching the flight from the land and homes closing up all around us.  Now there is a reversal of that situation and the people are once more growing fond of the land.  This is a <Col N="1491" /> welcome change.  Any land on offer finds a ready customer.</P>
    <P>There was a time when people were satisfied to carry on on a small holding. Now the cost of living and the cost of rearing a family is so high that people are only too anxious to get a few more acres on which to keep a few more cattle.  The whole situation is changing and the outlook for the small farmers is improving.  We are all glad of this.</P>
    <P>The argument was advanced on occasion that making land available to improve small holdings might mean the disemployment of one or two workmen employed by the Forestry Division. Our forests are now reaching maturity and there is not so much employment in them.  Surely employment could be found in other areas for those who might find themselves facing disemployment.  There should be no need to lay people off merely because land has been divided amongst local smallholders instead of being planted with trees.</P>
    <P>The Minister's offer of increased grants for private planting will, I am sure, give a fillip to this kind of afforestation.  Farmers are now waking up to the usefulness of timber and they will willingly plant two or three acres of land which are not of much use because of the dividend that planting will bring in the future.  I am sure the Minister will not be disappointed in the result.  Trees are very valuable. They give excellent shelter and a substantial financial reward.</P>
    <P>Landless men who are anxious to farm should get land.  Some landless men are better farmers than the actual farmers themselves.  This is a matter that should be considered by the Department and landless men in search of land should be considered in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Very often farmers are sadly disappointed at the delays in the taking over of land by the Land Commission. Somebody approaches the Land Commission and it may be three years before the land is taken over.  It could be another three, four or five years before it is divided and, by then, some of the people who hoped to get land when it was divided are dead and gone. <Col N="1492" /> I know there are many problems in connection with the taking over of some farms, but there are very few problems in the taking over of others. Taking it all in all, it is very hard to explain to the people why these long delays occur.</P>
    <P>I asked a question in this House about the Land Commission offices being under-staffed and I am still convinced that they are under-staffed.  Even one active elected representative in an area gives a considerable amount of work to a Land Commission office in connection with the division of land. Sometimes you find that there is just one clerk in an office and in others there may be four, five or six, but no more.  In county council offices and in agricultural offices there are several clerks and, even in the office of a committee of agriculture, there may be four clerks working.  To my knowledge in most of the Land Commission offices&mdash;and these are important offices &mdash;there is only one clerk.</P>
    <P>These men have to do the field work. They have to do the planning.  They have to interview many people.  They have so much to do in connection with the division of a farm that it takes up a considerable amount of their time. All the staff are out when the weather is fine and, if the weather is poor, they stay in the office to get on with the clerical work.  An increase in staff in those offices would speed up the division of land and encourage the people.</P>
    <P>I know a farm of land that was inspected.  The locals were interviewed. Some of them were confident that they would get land.  The report went from the local office to headquarters and I can say, without fear of contradiction, that it has been there for five or six months.  When a report goes up to headquarters a lot of work has been done on it in the local office, and it should not be so difficult for head office in Dublin to make a quick decision. Generally, the local inspectors know the situation and can make a correct decision.  If this work were speeded up, there would be less speculation and discontent, and people would not be wondering and watching to see who would get the land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> If the west of Ireland is to be saved under the EEC programme for this country, a considerable amount of money will have to be channelled into it.  If it does not receive special consideration, the small farming community will dwindle as time goes on. They cannot possibly cope with prices as they are rising today, as compared with a farmer with a viable holding who can keep a considerable amount of stock on his land and pay his debts.  The general run of farmers throughout the west will not be able to cope with rising prices.  Unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and other benefits kept them going for years.  Many homes would be closed today if those benefits had not been paid.</P>
    <P>At a lecture given in a reception room in this House today by the organisation known as CARE, it was pointed out that those benefits were not sufficient to cover the demands made on these families, and to enable them to keep body and soul together. Substantial grants will have to be given and all farmers will have to be treated as the farmers were treated in the pilot areas heretofore.  Part-time employment will have to be provided for the man on the small holding.  If these things are not forthcoming, the flight from the land will continue.  That would be too bad because, whatever progress we make, nothing can compensate for the loss of our people.  For some time now we have seen schools, homes, halls, railway stations, Garda barracks and even parochial houses closing down.  Let us hope, now that money is becoming more plentiful. that this will not continue.</P>
    <P>Part-time employment for boys and girls and substantial grants such as those given in the pilot areas would save the situation.  Industries must be established.  There is no point in the Government telling the people that, if they come up with a scheme, they will examine it and consider providing an industry.  We have enough officials to go into those areas in the west and see where an industry should be established. For years we have been told: &ldquo;If you present something feasible we will consider it.&rdquo;  That has not worked <Col N="1494" /> and that is why so many people are gone.</P>
    <P>There is not enough co-operation between the Department of Lands, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Finance and, indeed, the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  To my own knowledge we have thousands and thousands of acres that could be made very productive but for the fact that we suffer so much from flooding.  There are thousands of acres that could be made productive if they were given the right treatment.  Drainage is essential if we are to bring those acres into the condition in which they should be.  For years we have been talking about the acreage that should be drained and manured.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter which I often discuss with the Land Commission is this question of small holdings and plots of four, six and ten acres which may be removed from the main holding.  In my constituency, from Enniscrone down along the sea shore and throughout the area, there are thousands of small plots of land, some of which are let on the 11-months system, some sadly neglected and some which will not be taken over by the Land Commission.  The Land Commission answer is that they are too small.  The Land Commission do not buy land for the purpose of giving it to an individual.  They usually buy land to relieve congestion and I agree thoroughly with this policy.  I know the Land Commission could not buy land to hand it over to an individual, <Col N="1495" /> but the Land Commission should examine the situation over a few years and see if it is possible to do something about these small holdings with a view to handing them over to an individual because there are many factors which prevent a local man from getting them&mdash;his neighbour may not be on friendly terms with him or somebody else may be watching it.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission were to move in with their ways and means of buying land and purchase this land to give it to one individual, they would be doing very useful work. Any time I have inquired about this, however, I am told that the Land Commission do not buy land to accommodate one person except in very rare circumstances.  I would like to see the day when the Land Commission could move in, buy these plots and say to a man: &ldquo;We are going to accommodate you on that.&rdquo; The difference between buying for one and buying for two would not be very great and the Land Commission would get their money back in the long term.  They should look at the position in a constituency such as Sligo/Leitrim and all the constituencies in the west because we have very large numbers of these plots.</P>
    <P>Another problem which is worrying many farmers today is the situation in which people are waiting anxiously for the division of land and somebody with a big purse, for the sake of security, privately and quietly buys up this land at a price one and a half times or twice the value of the land.  If this is allowed to continue, it will undermine the purpose of the Land Commission.  There is no public representative who has not been told by people: &ldquo;We cannot compete with the man with the big purse and this land will be bought up if the Land Commission do not act quickly.&rdquo;  I asked a question here about protection for our local farmers in EEC conditions and while we were given to understand early on that the Irish farmer had nothing to worry about, the answer I got from the Minister was not so clear.  If these people are <Col N="1496" /> allowed to move in and buy up these small farms&mdash;20, 40 or 60 acres&mdash;and stock them, it will disappoint these local farmers who have been so anxiously awaiting the division of the land.  Even the Land Commission must find themselves in difficulty at this stage because they may have been asked about certain land and may have had a look at it and the next thing they discovered was that it was gone.  The Department should be very watchful in relation to the purchase of such lands because the matter is causing quite a lot of discontent.</P>
    <P>The matter of payment in cash instead of in land bonds has been raised by several Deputies and will continue to be raised.  It is all right for the Department and the Land Commission to say that land bonds are just as good as cash.  That argument will never register with the many people down the country who are anxious to sell their land.  They will always sell to the person paying cash. They are not a bit happy about being told that they will be paid in land bonds.  The Land Commission would have less trouble buying many holdings today if they could make a decision on this and say that people will be paid cash for their land.  It is very disturbing to many of our farmers today that they will be paid in bonds instead of cash.  It is well known to public representatives that people go quietly to the solicitor and make a deal privately, with the result that the farm goes at a very high price.  I know that it is difficult for the Land Commission to go much over the value of the land or to interfere with such a sale, and neither I nor Deputy Esmonde would like interference at that stage, but in time something should be done to prevent this happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker that this question of holding land causes a lot of complaints from time to time but, on the other hand, the Department justify this on the grounds that by holding on to such lands in the hope of an addition to them, the result will be much better for those who are to <Col N="1497" /> buy the land.  Such argument must be accepted until the result of the work is finally available but I would suggest that in the interim the Land Commission can go some way towards solving this problem.</P>
      <P>In many areas, the grass of the lands held by the Land Commission are let by way of public auction and more often than not the highest bidder happens to be an outsider.  This causes much anger and frustration to the people for whom the lands were acquired in the first place.  There is nothing to prevent the Department from deciding on what is an economic letting of such lands.  Of course, they may consider it an obligation on them to take in the highest amount of money possible but it must be remembered that the land was acquired for the benefit of the people in the adjoining area. Therefore, these are the people who should be given first preference when land is being leased.  They should be notified that a certain amount of land is available for letting and the rent should be indicated so that if they wish they can avail of the opportunity to lease the land.  I understand that the Land Commission lease lands on a ten-month basis and not on the 11-month system as applies in outside transactions. They should extend this period and if they decide that lands may not be divided for two years, the letting should be for those two years.  This would give the local person an opportunity of doing some development works on the land.  Perhaps, too, such an arrangement would relieve the Land Commission of some of the pressure to divide land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that under Common Market conditions, farmers who wish to acquire land must be working according to a plan.  One way of integrating them at an early stage in such a plan would be by my suggested system of leasing whereby they get the option on the land, and they will have it for a period of two or three years so that they can integrate it with their farm plans.  In this way the local people would not consider themselves to be cheated.  It is difficult to state to what extent they may be cheated but when it happens it causes much anger and <Col N="1498" /> much criticism of the Land Commission. Naturally the outsider coming in with plenty of money to take over grasslands is a problem that faces the Land Commission throughout the country.  Under our present free-sale system it is very difficult to say what might be a solution to that problem.  However, I cannot understand that, since the Department who control my profession can bring in laws to limit or restrict my work, and since the Department of Local Government can introduce laws in regard to the planning of land for building or industrial purposes, why the Department of Lands cannot acquire powers to ensure that land in a particular area is used for farming purposes.  I would go so far as to say that they should be in a position to indicate to whom land should go.  This is linked to EEC conditions but not as extensively linked to those conditions as I would wish.</P>
    <P>Deputy McLaughlin referred to the question of a small piece of land about which the Land Commission consider it uneconomic to bother.  This may be so and I suppose we must accept it as being good husbandry on the part of the Department but if my suggestion were adopted, the Land Commission would be in a position to designate land for farming purposes only.  Regarding the idea of the integration of the different bodies dealing with lands&mdash;the Department of Lands and Forestry, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Agricultural Credit Corporation&mdash; money should be made available by way of loans to local people for the purpose of purchasing land so as to keep out the man who has already plenty of land but is seeking more.</P>
    <P>Figures published some time ago indicated that 5 per cent of the population own 70 per cent of the wealth of the nation.  It is difficult to accept those figures but at the same time it is obvious that those who are wealthy have no difficulty in becoming wealthier.</P>
    <P>There may be administrative difficulties in the proposals I am making but I would urge that some consideration be given to them.  Some people <Col N="1499" /> may believe that there is no future for the small farmer in the Common Market because of economic conditions and pressures but be that as it may, there is an obligation on us to ensure in so far as it is possible that those who wish to stay on the land can do so.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to raise is the question of land bonds.  State and semi-State bodies can borrow money.  The ESB do it, Bord na Móna do it and the building societies do it and why can the Land Commission not borrow money to pay for lands acquired rather than continue the system of land bonds?  I would like to hear from the Minister in this regard.  These land bonds have been the cause of many complaints.  They have caused much anxiety and worry to people who wish to sell them at some particular time. This is a matter that needs to be considered thoroughly.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have not stated, to my satisfaction at any rate, that the large amount of land coming on the market will be made available for farming.  This is stated quite definitely in relation to the small farmers who are in areas where other farmers give up land by reason, perhaps, of some incentive such as the pensions scheme that is in operation for them, but there is no stated policy so far as I know on the bigger question surrounding the large farm of, perhaps, 200 acres in an area where there are no congests and where there is no one who is prepared to work a farm plan. What will happen to such farms?  Will the non-farmer, say the professional man, be allowed to buy them?  This should not be allowed to happen.  The Land Commission should indicate positively that they intend acquiring such lands which they would distribute among, perhaps, apprentice farmers rather than among migrants, although I am not against migration even if it is a very expensive operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate and who made very positive and useful contributions which will be of <Col N="1500" /> considerable help to me and to my officials in the deliberations that we will have in the near future in regard to what has become a progressively more difficult problem.  It is true to say at this time that this debate takes place against a background of unprecedented difficulty where the Land Commission are concerned.  This is so primarily because of the extraordinary escalation in the price of land in the recent past. Members of the House will realise that the 60,000 acres of land which the Land Commission now have cost a very great deal less than they would cost were the Land Commission to purchase that same area of land today. The attendant problems are also going to be difficult to solve.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies referred to the question of the possibility of subsidising the annuity that will be inevitable where land is purchased by the Land Commission in the first instance at a figure of £500 or £600 an acre.  The question as to whether or not it is desirable that an annuity should be subsidised is a very large one and one about which there are very strong arguments on both sides.  There is also the question raised by almost every Deputy, including Deputy H. Gibbons a short time ago, about the activities of the so-called land speculators who, in the main, are our own citizens rather than foreigners.  It is interesting to me to note that in the course of the past two years the emphasis has shifted from foreigners to our own nationals purchasing land in their capacity as speculators. I can certainly undertake to bring to the notice of the Government the almost universal feeling of the Members of the House in regard to these activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that I am considerably less optimistic about our being able to devise a suitable scheme to counteract this development.  Deputy H. Gibbons said that the medical profession can control the entry of people into the profession.  That is so.  The legal profession have been doing this for many years.  I should like to think that there would be an equally facile way of deciding who should or should not be allowed to purchase land, and who should or should not be allowed to purchase <Col N="1501" /> additional land if he already has some land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the EEC structures scheme provides a possible solution in that it establishes criteria about whom land can be sold to and about people who can get pensions?  The criteria may not be applied generally for the sale of all land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does provide a help.  The Deputy is talking about the structural reform programme based on the development plan.  This is certainly a help.  This is a problem which has blown up over the past 12 months and has become quite acute in that time.  I cannot think of any ready solution to it.  It is a situation to which we will give deep consideration and which I will bring to the notice of the Government, together with the unanimous views of the Members of the House who have spoken on this problem.</P>
      <P>I said in this House some years ago &mdash;and I believe it is still valid&mdash;that any approach to the question of solving our social problems which concerns itself merely with land is not a valid one and that, on the contrary, the adoption of a vigorous regional policy for the creation of employment outside farming for the younger people who wish to retired from farming is the most vital activity in which we could be engaged.  Only when that is done will we have a situation where a young man will have a genuine choice between remaining in farming under a development plan or becoming primarily a worker in industry or in a service or in some other activity, while he at the same time owns a few acres of land as a sideline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, to some extent, putting the cart before the horse if we continue to talk about development plans and about the division of land when there is not yet in many areas of the country a real alternative to offer to a person who may wish to retire or not to enter farming in a serious way at all. Deputy L'Estrange in a speech in the early part of this debate asked what <Col N="1502" /> has happened about the suggestions I made three years ago.  The Government have intensified their efforts to provide industry in the rural areas. The IDA have published a positive policy for the creation of a definite number of jobs in each of the regions defined in their programme.  They also gave a specific pledge to each of the areas that none of them would be neglected in the fulfilment of this programme over the next five years. Very recently&mdash;and I referred to this briefly in an interpolation in my opening statement&mdash;the EEC have set aside a large amount of money which is designed to subsidise the creation of employment in poorer agricultural areas so as to give that genuine choice of which I have spoken to the young people in the future.  I think the amount mentioned is £90 million or £100 million.  It is only when the unnecessary pressure which is now exercised on land has been removed that we can genuinely look forward to giving a meaningful exercise in activity to the much maligned body called the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In this House from time to time one hears a suggestion that a 50 or 60 acre farm which is available for division should be divided into three-acre lots and given to the owners of plots of one and a half to nine acres.  This is surely a ludicrous proposition.  It is not one which would enable the recipients to become farmers in any real sense, and would only effect the destruction of one viable farming unit and the creation of nothing with any meaning for the recipients of the small plots.  In another way the EEC development plan will be of help to the Land Commission and that is because those who are involved in the development plan will have made a firm decision that they wish to remain in farming and intend to practice farming as a full-time operation.  The end product of their six years' activity will be that at that stage they will have an income comparable with that of any other section of the community in any other form of activity in the locality.  They will, by being in the development plan, also have prior right to the allocation of land which may become <Col N="1503" /> available through the operation of the incentive to leave farming directive which will be in operation next year.</P>
    <P>In this connection I do not accept the strictures of Deputy Bruton that we have not taken the necessary steps.  We have done all that has been open to us in consultation with the representatives of the EEC in the course of the past six months and they did make it clear that any plans that we put forward would be dealt with but that the existing members of the EEC would have priority over us and that the effective date so far as the new members of the EEC are concerned will be 1st January, 1974 rather than 1st April, 1973.  However, we will have our plans ready; we will submit them and we hope they will find acceptance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying what I understand.  If they are completed and in, priority will be given to consideration of the plans of the existing rather than the new members.  In any <Col N="1504" /> event, as I say, it will be a considerable help to the Land Commission that the farmer himself will now have to make the basic decision that he is going to stay in farming and that he has adopted a development plan.  In that way the situation which has been spoken about by several Deputies during the debate, and which has caused great difficulty to the Land Commission, will be removed and that is giving out land to all the people in a locality even though experience has suggested that some of them will not make a serious effort and, therefore, will not make a success of their farming activities on the additional land.</P>
      <P>I have some doubts about the initial success of the directive as regards the incentive to leave farming.  I can only hope that it will be successful and that it will have the desired result, namely, of releasing a very substantial quantity of land for the improvement of the younger farmer.</P>
      <P>One point here that should be stressed is that it is up to the member State, to ourselves, as far as Ireland is concerned, to decide what the level of the pension will be.  As I pointed out in my opening remarks, the subvention forthcoming from the EEC funds will be limited but there is obviously no limit put on what the appropriate pension to be paid by the State itself should be.</P>
      <P>Whether or not the whole development plan idea will be capable of being put into operation properly depends to some considerable extent on the success or failure of the retirement incentive scheme.  It also, obviously, depends on the creation of alternative employment for those who do not wish to stay in farming but under present circumstances are remaining in subsistence farming which they would much prefer to abandon.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised the point that under our existing legislation there is a gap at ages 65 to 70 between the situation that obtains here and the situation in the mainland countries of Europe because our old age pension begins at age 70.</P>

This is so and the only way in which we can tackle that problem is by progressively reducing the age at which one qualifies for the old age pension from 70 to 65.  Indeed, I recall the Minister for Social Welfare making a commitment that this was the general aim of Government policy and that this would be realised progressively by reducing the age over the next few years.</P>

      <P>The question was asked as to what was the situation of the non-development person.  It is important to point out that there is no question whatsoever of his being forced out of possession any more than there is any question of forcing elderly or incapacitated persons out of possession.  The EEC scheme is an entirely voluntary one and the fact that this is so is implicit in the use of the word &ldquo;incentive&rdquo; in the directive itself.  Similarly, nobody will be forced out of a small farm even though he is not in a development plan and, indeed, it will be up to the member state to decide what aid of one kind or another he will qualify for as distinct from the established aids to which the development plan farmer will be entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Continuing to deal at this stage with the Land Commission activities, the situation in regard to the use of <Col N="1506" /> land bonds has again been brought into focus.  Over the past two years much of the criticism of the land bond has been rather unfair because during that time when interest rates have been relatively stable so also has the standing of the 9¾ per cent land bond which is at present in operation. It has stood at or very close to par at all stages and the fact that it is now ex dividend and was quoted at £96.50 on yesterday's paper does not take away from the validity of what I say. On 29th November the price was £99¼ and, generally speaking, throughout the year this particular bond has been standing at or around £99.</P>
    <P>However, it is accepted that the image of the land bond as such is not very good and in consultation with the Minister for Finance I have been discussing the question of land purchase by the Commission for the year 1973-74.  There are many situations, and this is accepted, where payment by bonds may be unsuitable.  To provide the Land Commission with more flexibility in procuring land for land settlement and to implement the EEC structural reform programme, the Minister for Finance has agreed to give £1 million for the year 1973-74 for the purchase of land in cash.  This will enable the Land Commission to bid for suitable properties coming on the open market and in particular facilitate the purchase of smaller holdings especially where these are owned by farmers who wish to retire.  I am sure the House will be very pleased to hear this and nobody more so than Deputy L'Estrange&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  It is five times as much as last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who has been quite properly arguing along these lines for some time now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I turn for a moment to the question of leasing land?  This is a system which operates quite extensively on the Continent but is virtually nonexistent in Ireland where traditionally we have operated agistment and conacre lettings on the old 11 months' system which seems to have remarkable power of survival.  The fact is that it is not necessary to introduce new <Col N="1507" /> legislation to enable us to go in for leasing of land on a long term basis. The necessary legal machinery for this is already in existence.  The practical questions are (a) will it be possible to persuade people traditionally operating the conacre and grazing letting system to change over to a leasing system and (b) what incentives will be required to bring a long lease system into fairly widespread use?  There are two schools of thought as to whether long leasing of land will take on in this country to any extent in the near future.  Deputy Bruton is optimistic on this matter.  So, indeed, were the representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association with whom I had discussions about six months ago. I sincerely hope that both are right and I mean that.  We can all see how useful a leasing system would be in the future.</P>
    <P>I myself am less optimistic because the inherent conservatism of the Irish farmer is, I think, unique in Europe. I do not say that in adverse criticism of the farmers.  It is due to well-known historical reasons and we are, as yet, too near the events which developed that attitude for people to discard it. All I can add is that I personally and my officials and I think the Members of this House as well will do our best to try to get rid of what is surely a very bad system of land use.  Indeed, it could be called land misuse, because it is well known that where 11 month lettings are concerned there is no incentive for the person who has the letting to make an investment in the land, to put the land into good heart, but there is every temptation to leech out of the land the maximum that he can over the period of the letting and then let the owner or whoever succeeds make the best of it afterwards.  I am sure I speak for everybody here when I say that we look forward to the day when that particular tradition will have vanished and when both the lessor and the lessee, as well as the owner, will, on the one hand, be suitably rewarded for having parted with his land and, on the other, will have some guarantee of getting it back in good shape and heart.</P>
    <P>The suggestion again occurs of taking land off people who have not farmed it successfully.  This is not on <Col N="1508" /> except within the terms of reference of the Land Commission as they exist now or as they may be amended.  Subject to that, there is no question&mdash;I hope there never will be a question&mdash; of the conditional award of land to anyone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed asked about interference by the Land Commission with a testator's dispositions under a will or with the divisions of land under an intestacy pursuant to the Succession Act.  I did not hear the Deputy very well and I may have misunderstood what he said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that was what the Deputy said but possibly I was not listening as carefully as I should have been.  I have come across this problem where the Land Commission and the Succession Act in certain circumstances can be at variance.  It is a legal problem which I do not think we should pursue now but it is interesting both as a legal and a human problem.</P>
      <P>During the debate several speakers commented on forestry matters. Deputy Creed mentioned a chipboard factory for the Cork area.  All I can say about that is that my advice is that the existing facilities for the manufacture of chipboard are sufficient and we will not have adequate supplies to cope with another chipboard factory in any part of Ireland for some considerable time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Creed also referred to the retaining of land which might be more suitably used for straightforward agricultural purposes.  It is true that it is difficult to get back land from the forestry section once they have acquired it.  That is because they go to a great deal of trouble to establish that it is suitable for forestry.  In the course of acquisition proceedings they have discussions with the Land Commission with a view to finding out before acquisition if the land would be suitable for the Land Commission.  Once the final decision has been made the discussion process is complete and, as I understand the situation, it is fairly exhaustive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> I am not suggesting this in regard to Deputy Creed, but it appears some Deputies are under the mistaken impression that land which is to be planted is virtually useless and that if it has any real value it should not be planted.  That is not the case.  Different types of timber require different types of land; where certain timber is concerned relatively good land is needed, otherwise the trees will not flourish.  In this matter I have no evidence to suggest that the forestry section adopt an unfair attitude and I have no evidence that they take over land which should be used for straightforward agricultural purposes.  If there are any such examples Deputy Creed would like to bring to my notice, perhaps he would be kind enough to do so.  Generally I find that the forestry section go to considerable trouble to establish the quality of the land, the type of timber which should be used, and they do not take over land which could be better used for Land Commission purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney raised the matter of stud farms and mentioned the necessity for establishing a new criterion which would avoid the situation where a person who had one stud mare could regard himself statutorily as a stud farmer and, therefore, get away with the ownership of land which would otherwise be divided among local smallholders.  I think the Deputy has a point here.  I intend to have the matter examined and to report to him in due course.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Smith in the course of a useful contribution mentioned the necessity for more liaison between the various organisations associated with land and the IDA.  I have dealt with this matter and the fact that I agree with the Deputy is implicit in the remarks I made earlier.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to local gun clubs and said they were by-passed by the Department of Lands where shooting lettings are concerned.  I want to assure him this is not so and I would ask him to get in touch with me and to let me know of any case where this has happened.  It could be that shooting lettings owned by private interests have not been offered to gun clubs in <Col N="1510" /> various areas but obviously this is something over which the Department of Lands have no control.  I want to assure the Deputy that so far as lettings by the Department of Lands are concerned where there is a suitably organised local gun club they are given every opportunity in preference to everyone else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney asked what was meant by &ldquo;gross acreage&rdquo;.  It simply means that there is a small area of land acquired each year which is unplantable; usually it is included with land that is acquired and subsequently used.  There is a figure some place of the amount of land owned by the Land Commission which will never be used. I have forgotten the exact figure but it represents bits and pieces of rocks or foreshore and other useless residues of estates and farms throughout the country.  These pieces of land remain on the Land Commission books as rather useless statistics.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney also mentioned the possibility of having more hardwood trees planted and asked if it would be possible to make grants to farmers for the planting of small numbers of hardwood trees.  On the face of it this does not seem to be feasible, but we will certainly have a look at it to see if there is any possibility of doing it. Like him, I hold the view that planting small numbers of trees here and there makes for greater visual enjoyment and, if there is some way of advancing that which does not now exist, we will be glad to fill the vacuum.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey mentioned the conservation aspects of the activities of the game development and management service.  I should like to express my appreciation of the comments he made in the course of his very excellent contribution.  It was good to hear him in action again.  He said that we should have a progressively expanding programme for conservation.  Within the limits of our powers and resources we have a progressively expanding programme and I wish to pay tribute to my officials on the scientific, research and educational side who have got this <Col N="1511" /> programme well under way.  When we submitted a draft Bill to the Government, the draft Bill about which Deputy Desmond spoke so disparagingly this afternoon, the Bill was rejected by the Government and, in the result, the major responsibility in conservation matters is now discharged by the Department of Local Government and the responsibility of the Department of Lands is confined to those areas of game, wild life, flora and fauna with which we are directly concerned.  Nevertheless it gives us, and will continue to give us, considerable scope and I thank those Deputies who paid tribute to the work done in Lough Key in Roscommon and in other parts of the country.  The programme continues to expand.</P>
    <P>I should mention that under subhead H, to which Deputy Haughey referred, we have an expanding programme here too and we will be in a position to finance it.  Even though the figure in the Estimate is lower than last year the programme is bigger.  The financing, like so many other things, falls to be paid at certain stages and will not require as much actual hard cash this year; hence the apparently reduced programme. The fund is reduced, but the programme is actually expanding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen&mdash;I think he was joking &mdash;suggested that the acquisition of a mountain some place was the reason why we had acquired more land for forestry last year than at any time in the history of the State.  I am sure he was joking.  In fact we acquired only 68 acres in that particular place.  I should, I think, mention my own county here because, if I am not mistaken, Mayo set up a record of something of the order of 7,000 acres in 1972 and is entitled for that reason to honourable mention.  The intake of land for forestry purposes represents a record in the history of the State.  It is a sizeable record in every respect. We are hopeful that the intake will continue at or near that level so that the necessary land bank for forestry purposes will remain and enable us to continue to plant up to the target level of 25,000 acres a year.  We achieved <Col N="1512" /> that last year for the first time for a very long time and we will achieve it again this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned redundancy. His basic proposition, as I understood it, was that seniority should be virtually the only factor in a redundancy situation.  I do not accept that this is right, fair or proper.  It is one factor, and an important one, but it is not the only factor by any means.  Discussions are still going on between officials of my Department and the unions concerned and other issues, such as protective clothing and so forth, are being actively pursued.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey also mentioned shooting facilities for tourists.  He disagreed with the situation in which Bord Fáilte and my Department get together for the purpose of providing shooting facilities for visiting sportsmen. He believes the needs of our own people should be paramount.  I trust I am not misinterpreting what he said, but I want to make it clear that the arrangements for the provision of facilities for visiting tourists are made only after due and proper provision has been made for native shooting interests.  There is a high degree of control in most parts of the country through the operation of the regional game councils.  This control is essential. Given the continued support of native sportsmen, I believe a programme for visitors can be continued without detriment to the interests of our own people.  I should not like a situation to develop in which we could be accused of being so selfish as not to be willing to allow any strangers at all to visit our shores.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the provision of wild life sanctuaries.  No praise could be too high for the work that is being done in this sector. During the past few years the number of wet lands for which protection orders have been made has increased from ten to 26.  We expect to add some further areas to the list in 1973. The ultimate objective here is to provide a countrywide network of sanctuaries which will not only provide refuge for the wild birds, both game and non game species, but also, and, <Col N="1513" /> perhaps more important, set aside a variety of wild haunts for public education and enjoyment.  I had the pleasure of visiting a number of these sanctuaries during the year, and formally opening some of them, and I was greatly impressed by their educational and recreational potential.</P>
    <P>Since my proposition that the Land Commission should more properly be under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries does not seem likely to find acceptance, another idea may be more feasible, that is, that under the Department of Lands should also be placed the land project and drainage operations generally, so that a coherent land use policy can be formulated and put into practice, and the decision as to which lands should be put into agricultural use, and which reserved for wet lands or for rough, wild scenery, and so on, could be made within the ambit of one Department. This was at least hinted at by one Deputy who spoke in this debate and who suggested that efforts should be made to avoid duplication of activities in the operation of Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I would see a good deal of sense in an approach along the lines I have mentioned.  Indeed, it was interesting to discover recently that in Sweden which, of course, is in a very different situation from ours economically, and demographically, and in every other way, they are now spending vast sums of money on flooding land which they spent huge amounts of money draining 30 or 40 years ago.  This again brings up the question of proper land use and proper policy.  Perhaps those who think it worthwhile considering what I have suggested, would let me know what they think about it.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that all of us are in for a very interesting period, not least where land is concerned, beginning on 1st January of next year.  In the long run, and provided we have a vigorous regional policy in operation, and a sensible land use policy, we can look forward to a time when the present absurd pressure on land will cease to exist, and when the role of land will have assumed its proper perspective, and <Col N="1514" /> when the population of the rural areas will have been stabilised in circumstances which will give everyone in those areas the same or, at least, a comparable way of life and living and environment with those of people in any part of Europe or, indeed, in any part of the world.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £35,810,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1973, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>A supplementary Estimate has been circulated for a token sum of £10 to enable money to be provided for the purpose of restructuring the wool textile industry.</P>
      <P>In the Book of Estimates the net Estimate of £35,810,000 for the year 1972-73 compares with a sum of £33,842,000 granted in 1971-72&mdash; including a Supplementary Estimate of £5,019,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In round figures the principal increases arising in the current year include £511,000 for the Industrial Development Authority to cover <Col N="1515" /> Administration, £61,000, and capital expenditure, £450,000; £345,000 for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards; and £275,000 for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, of which £200,000 is for grants to industrialists.  There is an increase of £246,000 in the provision for Córas Tráchtála.  The provision for salaries and wages of the staff of my Department, including technical advisers shows an increase of £82,000.  Other increases are £50,000 for shipbuilding subsidy; £93,000 for the payment of interest subsidy to Shipping Finance Corporation Ltd; £37,000 in the provision for repayment to the Central Fund of advances under the export guarantee arrangements; and £41,000 in the provision for the purchase of equipment, <i>et cetera</i> for the Geological Survey Office.  Other subheads show a net increase of £26,000.  There is thus an increase of £1,706,000 in the expenditure subheads to which must be added the falling off in Appropriations-in-Aid which are expected to be some £262,000 lower than in 1971-72.</P>
    <P>The net increase in the Estimate is, therefore, £1,968,000.  It has been the practice, when introducing the annual estimates, for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to cover in considerable detail most of the various functions and areas of responsibility with which his Department is concerned. I feel it would be more appropriate in present circumstances if I were to concentrate my remarks on a relatively few key matters which are of major concern.  The matters I propose to deal with are industry and industrial development, mineral development, prices and the broad field of consumer protection.</P>
    <P>It is customary also to report on the results of the previous year.  I believe that it will be more useful if I speak only briefly of what happened in 1971 and try to deal rather with the present situation and the outlook for the future.</P>
    <P>First, I must mention the one dominant factor which affects the work of every section of my Department, as <Col N="1516" /> of other Departments, I mean, of course, our entry to the European Economic Community on 1st January, 1973.  Our membership of the EEC is the end of one stage of development and the start of another.  It ends a phase in which great progress was made but one which we must now go beyond if our standards of living are to be raised to the level of western Europe generally.  From now on our industrialists must be outward-looking as never before.  The traditional home market horizons will be expanded to the frontiers of the new Community and beyond.</P>
    <P>We enter on this new era with the great psychological advantage that we know we are taking a step which the vast majority of Irish men and women have endorsed.  The people did not take this historic decision lightly, but rather after careful consideration of the pros and cons of EEC membership. The result was an overwhelming response from the people in favour of joining Europe next month.</P>
    <P>What happens from January next; can we sit back and wait for the benefits to fall into our laps?  Of course not.  We must determine to work harder and more effectively than ever before to convert the many opportunities of membership into achievements. On the industrial front, this effort will be required equally of management and workers.  One complements the other.  Consumers, too, have their part to play by continuing to support Irish goods, and this applies equally to the individual consumer buying goods for his own use and to the industrial consumer purchasing goods for conversion. We will progressively reduce our tariffs on imports from other Community countries, but we must not let the novelty of new sources of supply blind us to the quality and value of our own produce and manufactures.</P>
    <P>The advantage likely to accrue to Ireland in the industrial sector on accession to the Community have already been spelled out on many occasions and I do not propose to go into detail here today.  Suffice it to say that membership should mean more jobs, the widening of our industrial <Col N="1517" /> base and greater export opportunities. Membership will bring a challenge in the form of foreign competition, but it can, I am confident, be successfully met by the fruitful co-operation of mangement and workers.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry is as confident as the Government and the people of Ireland that EEC membership will be the best thing for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>Is the Minister sure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, sir.  On the crucial question of whether or not the terms negotiated for entry will provide us with a better economic environment for future development, the Confederation has said: &ldquo;It is very clear that the balance of advantage for Irish industry lies inside the European Community&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The rate of economic growth improved in 1971, principally because of a faster rise in industrial production. The 3 per cent economic growth in 1971 reflects an actual rise in the volume of output of both manufacturing and transportable goods industries of 4 per cent.  This rise in production is due to an extent to a recovery from the effects of industrial disputes of 1970.  Not surprisingly, in view of the strike in the cement industry in 1970, the industrial group to which this industry belongs recorded the largest increase in output, 38 per cent, in 1971.</P>
      <P>In 1971, industrial exports, with which I shall deal in more detail later, maintained their steady increase of the past years, rising by £32 million the equivalent of 10 per cent.  This rate of expansion was achieved in spite of the depressed state of some of our main export markets and the sharp decline in exports of metal ores.  Industrial exports constituted 52.6 per cent of our total domestic exports, which themselves grew at the rate of 15.2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past year has been a difficult one for Irish industry.  A number of firms were forced to close, with resulting unemployment, while in other cases firms encountering difficulties were obliged to reduce their work force to prevent complete closure.  The number of workers becoming redundant in the <Col N="1518" /> year ending 31st March, 1973, is estimated at 11,000, a very high figure. Fortunately the establishment of new industries and the creation of new jobs has continued.</P>
    <P>Factory closures get their fair share of publicity from all the news media and this is only right, but I think Deputies should know that there have been many cases where firms encountering difficulties have been saved by the remedial action taken by my Department and the State agencies concerned, notably Fóir Teoranta.  These intervened in many instances to assist firms which, though potentially viable, were in danger of closure through inability to raise finance from commercial sources.  The outcome of these efforts is frequently unpublicised in contrast with the publicity attached to factory closures.  Indeed, in many instances the maintenance of strict confidentiality was an important factor in the success of the rescue operation.</P>
    <P>Remedial action of this kind depends on sufficiently early notice being received by my Department or the IDA that a firm are in difficulties and willingness on the part of the management concerned to make the necessary efforts to continue in business.  The Government, however, cannot force firms to reveal in time that they are in difficulties; we can only encourage them and their advisers to be more ready to do so.</P>
    <P>The causes of redundancy in industry are many and complex, and there are no ready-made solutions to the problems that may be encountered. Too frequently, free trade is named as the main problem.  Undoubtedly, our tariffs against Britain have now been substantially reduced as a result of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, but it would be much too facile to blame free trade for our problems.  Ireland more than most countries depends on foreign trade, both imports and exports, for a high standard of living. Many sectors of Irish industry and many firms already depend on export markets for their prosperity, and it is clear that Irish industry as a whole must look to export markets for substantial <Col N="1519" /> growth.  We cannot expect to have access to growing export markets without giving in return access to our market to other countries.  Free trade must be seen therefore as a tool for growth something to be used, not something to be feared.</P>
    <P>Our recent difficulties in industry have been caused by slackness in our main export markets, fluctuations and uncertainties in international exchange rates, and above all by cost inflation. To an extent this cost inflation has been imported owing to rising prices elsewhere and also to the floating of the pound, but a major element has been the high rate of growth in wages and salaries in Ireland, unmatched by corresponding rises in productivity. When wages and salaries here rise faster than they do in other countries, our firms lose their competitive edge and become at one stroke more vulnerable to imports and unable to develop their sales to other markets.</P>
    <P>The pressure of cost inflation has thus been a major factor in causing redundancies.  It has pinpointed and aggravated the weaknesses in different firms, some of which were compelled to close, others to cut down costs wherever possible by rationalisation, by discontinuing uneconomic lines of production and so on.</P>
    <P>When the reasons why a particular firm have got into difficulties are examined, it is often found that difficulties stemming from the general economic situation have been aggravated by local management deficiencies. Inadequate financial and cost controls, and failure to move with the times in regard to marketing and product policy are frequently noted. This has been highlighted in the COIP reports and elsewhere.  It is very disturbing, indeed, that firms can find themselves in severe difficulty without apparently having been aware of the situation which was developing, let alone alert others to their problem. This lack of proper management accounting is a serious problem especially in smaller firms.  In the absence of proper accounting and cost procedures, a firm may not know from <Col N="1520" /> one end of the year to another what their situation is.  I suggest that this is a problem to which the accounting profession and also the banking institutions might give increasing attention with a view to helping their clients.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the importance of timely adaptation or diversification. The Government have made very considerable efforts by way of grants, the extension of the services of State agencies and the creation of new ones, and by general exhortation, to get industry to adapt to changing conditions.  By and large these efforts have been fairly successful but it has to be recognised that they could not of themselves guarantee the survival of every manufacturing firm.  In the last analysis this depends on the efforts which the firm make.</P>
    <P>The response from the different sectors of Irish industry to the challenge posed by the changing trading situation has varied.  Some have been less active than others in their preparations, and within sectors the reaction of firms has also varied. Experience has shown that it is difficult, whether through adaptation associations or otherwise, to get sectors to take an initiative on an organised basis&mdash;or indeed to accept initiatives taken from outside.  The experience in getting action on recommendations of the COIP reports is no more encouraging than in the case of the reports by the Committee on Industrial Organisation which operated in the early sixties, despite the fact that there is less time left for action now.  I repeat that Government Departments and agencies can only help and encourage and cannot compel.</P>
    <P>One of the principal means for helping industry to maximise its level of efficiency is the technical assistance scheme.  Under this scheme, grants are made available to manufacturing industry towards the cost of engaging the service of business consultants who provide expert advice on matters affecting the improvement of productive efficiency and also on aspects of distribution and sale of goods on the home market.  Grants are available also to the distributive trades on a <Col N="1521" /> group basis.  While use of the scheme was fairly limited in the early years, the pressure of competition on the home market has caused more and more firms to turn to the scheme in an effort to streamline production and sales and to reduce overheads.</P>
    <P>Since 1957 my Department have paid out more than £2 million in respect of these activities.  I am satisfied that the expenditure incurred both by firms and the Government has proved useful in achieving a state of preparedness in industry and distribution to meet the challenge in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the highest standards of technical efficiency in industry must be a continuing priority, never more important than at present. The need for advancing our industrial technology and efficiency to the highest possible level has been kept before the eyes of industry by myself and others over the past number of years, but, while great progress has been made, I am afraid it is true that there are still firms, and indeed sectors of industry, where the level of technological advance is not yet satisfactory.  I rely principally on the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to preach the gospel of technology to industry, to help industrialists to maintain the level of efficiency of their plants in line with the advance of technology in world industry, and to introduce the new products, or the new methods of producing traditional products, which research and development continually offer in different fields.</P>
    <P>The institute have prepared a five-year plan for their development during the years 1971-76.  This plan has been examined in detail and generally endorsed by the National Science Council, and returned to me for my consideration. I have in general accepted the proposals in the plan which envisage that an increasing proportion of their resources will be devoted to research and development.  I am glad that I have been able this year to increase the institute's grant from £948,000 to £1,293,000, this latter sum including a provision to enable a start to be made on a comprehensive building programme.</P>
    <P>Increased productivity by workers <Col N="1522" /> can also help Irish industry to improve its competitiveness.  This is the special concern of the Irish Productivity Centre &mdash;formerly known as the Irish National Productivity Committee.  This body are representative of employer and labour interests.  They are financed mainly by way of grant-in-aid under the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, and concern themselves with the identification of factors which impede the growth of productivity, pinpointing areas where there are significant productivity gaps and taking steps generally to bring about improvement in those areas.  In 1971 the committee completed an appraisal of their structure and function following a survey carried out by the European Association of National Productivity Centres. When I introduced the token Supplementary Estimate for £10 on 11th July, 1972, necessitated by the change of title of this body, I outlined the circumstances leading to the change in the structure of the organisation.</P>
    <P>The pressures of cost inflation are still with us, and rationalisation of industry is still very far from complete. Although there are signs of a slowing down in the rate of redundancy, it would be foolishly optimistic to expect that the difficulties of Irish industry will not continue somewhat longer. Recent studies of particular industries have shown that there will be further redundancies.</P>
    <P>I will continue, by the forms of assistance which I have mentioned and by any other means which circumstances may show to be desirable, to afford every assistance to industry, particularly those sectors which are at present going through a difficult period.</P>
    <P>Last year I expressed particular concern about the situation of the wool textile industry, which at the time was suffering very much from short-time working because of the world-wide recession in wool textiles over the preceding year.  I pointed to the excess capacity which existed in the industry and to the lack of response by firms to promptings repeated over many years, that rationalisation of production was necessary.  Since then I have had a consultancy survey of the wool textile <Col N="1523" /> sector carried out with a view to determining the extent of restructuring required if employment is in the long term to be maintained at the highest level consistent with sound business operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The survey covered the position of 20 firms engaged in spinning and machine weaving whose business is for the most part based on the home market.  The consultants confirmed that the sector was in a very weak position and that an immediate programme of restructuring was essential to avoid a situation whereby closures could occur on a far greater scale than would be the case if early action was taken.</P>
      <P>To secure restructuring of the industry in a way that would provide employment opportunities at the highest level consistent with viability I have set up a task force under the chairmanship of an executive director of the Industrial Development Authority. This task force, which is already operating will work in conjunction with the consultants and with both sides of the industry.</P>
      <P>As an exceptional measure, in the special circumstances of this industry, and having regard also to the representations made to me by both sides of the industry I have agreed that limited and short-term financial support should be provided where the task force considered it appropriate, or necessary, to those firms assessed as not viable and which otherwise would have to close immediately or in the very near future.  The purposes of such assistance are :&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to facilitate the orderly restructuring of the industry and to enable the resources of the firms to be deployed to the best advantage;</P>
      <P>(ii)  to faciltate the retraining of workers for new industries which may be provided in the affected areas;</P>
      <P>(iii)  to ease any difficulties which might arise for Irish clothing firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Support will be limited to the <Col N="1524" /> amount needed in any particular case to maintain activity at not more than its present level and to discharge only those obligations which will arise during the period of support.  It is for this purpose I am taking the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are probably aware, receivers have been appointed to three firms.  In each case it had become apparent that there was a grave danger that the firm would be forced to close at a very early date with considerable local disruption.  In order to avert sudden closures, the task force made arrangements with the financial institutions concerned for the appointment of receivers.  Thus the situation in each mill has been stabilised and they are in a position to remain in business for a period of time during which outstanding orders can be met.</P>
    <P>During this period the task force, which includes representatives of the IDA, AnCO and the National Manpower Agency, will be giving priority to the provision of alternative employment in each area.  I am happy to report that prospects for the establishment of new industries in the areas affected are encouraging.</P>
    <P>I found it necessary to have the industry examined by consultants because efforts down the years to get the industry reorganised did not achieve the desired results.  The consultants' report has confirmed what was generally known.  We had in the sixties the Committee on Industrial Organisation Report and earlier this year the report of the Committee on Industrial Progress setting out the position in broad terms.  Indeed, the latter report stated plainly and I quote chapter 7, paragraph 7.5:</P>
    <P>reductions in the number of firms in the industry and in the level of employment are inevitable.  We would urge that this be regarded as a fact of life in the industry, by trade unions and in official circles and that every effort be made to anticipate this situation and to plan for it in an orderly way.</P>
    <P>That is what I am now seeking to achieve.  In making arrangements to have the industry examined with a <Col N="1525" /> view to formulating a scheme for its restructuring, I was, to a considerable extent, acting in conformity with suggestions from both sides of the Industry.  An impartial examination was required if the industry was to break out of the old mould.  Now that the restructuring proposals have reached the implementation stage I would ask all the parties concerned to continue to co-operate to ensure that the measures being pursued to put the industry on a solid footing will succeed.</P>
    <P>In regard to pressure for the publication of the consultants' report I wish to place it on record that whilst the report has been furnished to the management and trade union interests concerned it has not been issued generally for the reason that to do so could result in closures and loss of jobs which may otherwise be avoided.  Both sides of the industry have been fully informed of my views on this.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have raised in the House the question of circulating the report to individual Deputies representing constituencies where woollen mills are located.  I have, as promised, given consideration to this request but I have reached the conclusion that it would not be proper or in the best interests of the industry&mdash;including the interests of the workers&mdash;to provide copies as requested.  The report contains recommendations involving fairly substantial restructuring.  These proposals will necessarily involve detailed consultation with and between the parties concerned and such consultations would best be carried on in conditions of ordinary commercial confidentiality. Publication of the report would, without doubt, make the task of securing restructuring infinitely more difficult.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have it.  I am sure Deputy Tully has it too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No problem.  I would like to emphasise that the purpose of the restructuring exercise is to save jobs, and to safeguard the greater part of the sector, not to create redundancies. Factories are not being closed by my Department or by the consultants. <Col N="1526" /> Where they do close it is due to the pressures of commercial realities.  Indeed, some of the mills at present facing closure have been kept open this long only because of the support provided by the Government.</P>
      <P>The programme of industrial development approved by the Government calls for the creation of new jobs, through the establishment of new factories and the growth of existing sound firms, on a scale sufficient, not just to compensate for the redundancies, but to provide for a substantial net increase in industrial employment over the next five years.</P>
      <P>The principal impetus to industrial growth continues to come of course, from the Industrial Development Authority and, in the mid-west region, from SFADCO.</P>
      <P>Our entry to the EEC should, in the long term, enhance the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for foreign investment. It is, accordingly, of paramount importance that these bodies should increase their efforts to realise this investment potential.</P>
      <P>To prepare for this development, the Industrial Development Authority have intensified their marketing and promotional activities and have augmented their offices at London, Paris, Cologne, New York and Chicago, and have now opened an office in Tokyo. The authority are carrying out research studies to ensure that maximum benefits are being obtained from their considerable investment deriving from the capital budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £1,363,000 is provided in the Estimates before the House to meet the administration and general expenses of the IDA, as compared with £1,302,000 for 1971-72.  A sum of £28.2 million is provided to meet the capital expenditure of the authority, as compared with £27.75 million for 1971-72.  Capital expenditure by the authority consists mainly of grants towards acquisition and leasing of fixed assets and the cost of development of industrial estates, the building of advance factories, and the acquisition of factory buildings, sites, <i>et cetera.</i>  Provision is also made for the <Col N="1527" /> payment of research and development grants, interest subsidies and for the acquisition of shares in industrial undertakings.</P>
    <P>The broad categories of expenditure are&mdash;grants to large and medium industries&mdash;£17.3 million&mdash; re-equipment grants&mdash;£5.6 million&mdash; and the industrial estates and advance factory programme&mdash;£3.5 million.  The provision for administration and general expenses of the Industrial Development Authority has had to be reviewed upwards and I shall be coming to the House for a Supplementary Estimate when the precise requirements of the authority are finalised. The additional moneys will be required to enable the authority to increase intensive promotional and direct campaigns in order to generate more serious industrial enquiries and step up the rate of job creation in the present situation.  Despite the EEC referendum decision, the marked up-turn in the US economy and the authority's intensive promotional and direct compaigns there has not been the expected up-turn in the number of serious inquiries now being received by the IDA. I consider that the increased efforts of the IDA to remedy the current situation are absolutely essential if we are to meet the employment targets set by us.</P>
    <P>The IDA's regional industrial plan for the five years from 1973 to 1977 proposed the creation of 55,000 new jobs in industry in that period.  Allowing for projected redundancies of 17,000 in the same period, the target for the net increases in industrial employment was 38,000.  Because of the higher rate of redundancy which we must now expect, the number of new jobs created must be increased above the 55,000 proposed in that plan.  It was because of this and the sluggishness in the receipt of new inquiries, partly no doubt due to the situation in Northern Ireland, that the decision to intensify the promotional campaign of the authority has been taken.</P>
    <P>During the year ended 31st March, 1972, 67 new industries with an estimated employment at full production <Col N="1528" /> of aproximately 8,100 workers were approved for grant assistance.  The IDA investment in these projects is estimated at £12.3 million towards a total capital investment of £39.5 million.  It is estimated that projects approved under the small industries programme during the year will provide an additional 1,200 new jobs, while re-equipment grants towards modernisation of factories, plant and equipment are reckoned to provide employment for about 1,000 additional workers.</P>
    <P>Development of the industrial estates at Galway and Waterford and construction work on the advance factory programme continued successfully during the year.  Expenditure amounted to approximately £1.85 million and a total of 202,000 square feet of factory space was completed.  A further 54,500 square feet are at present under construction at the Waterford industrial estate and 160,000 square feet at 13 locations under the advance factory programme.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Act, 1969, assigned to the IDA the additional objective or regional industrial development.  The authority have established an office in each of the nine planning regions&mdash;except the mid-west where the Shannon Free Airport Development Company act as the agent of the IDA and where a plan is already in operation.  These regional offices, in addition to their development role, are part of the IDA's aftercare service to manufacturers&mdash;to help them overcome any difficulties they may encounter in the early years of operation.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited administer the affairs of the mid-west region, which involves Clare/Limerick/North Tipperary, as well as the affairs of the industrial estate.  Progress continues to be made in the region and while the industrial estate has recently passed through a very difficult period due mainly to a recession in two key markets&mdash;the USA and the UK&mdash;the position has already started to improve and future prospects are good. Known incoming industry and expansion of existing industry are expected to provide upwards of 1,000 new jobs by the end of 1973.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> For the current year the company are to be given a non-voted capital allocation of £3.74 million in addition to the moneys voted to them in my Department's Vote.</P>
    <P>It will be seen then, that very substantial funds are being devoted to the vital area of new job creation. However, the attraction of industrial investment is now a highly competitive international business.  Success cannot be assured simply by increasing the amount of money available to pay grants or to provide advance facilities.  Foreign firms with plans to expand their activities can shop around and there is no shortage of national agencies anxious to convince them what the country of their choice should be for their new factory.  Many factors influence investment decisions of this kind.  Wage levels, labour availability, political and economic stability, market access&mdash;these are all important factors which sometimes weigh more heavily than the package of financial incentives available.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that industrial exports maintained their steady increase in the past year.  This rate of expansion was achieved in spite of difficulties in some of our main export markets which I have mentioned earlier and despite also the sharp decline in exports of metal ores. Industrial exports constituted 52.6 per cent of our total domestic exports. Manufactured goods maintained a strong upward trend, rising by £32 million.  Major contributors were textiles and apparel, transport equipment, tyres and tubes and professional and scientific equipment, but most other classes of goods showed increases also.</P>
    <P>Of our main export markets, Britain and Northern Ireland took some 66 per cent of total exports.  Manufactured goods exports to this market increased by about £19 million.  In the second half of 1971 a small favourable balance resulted from trade with Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the USA, our second largest market, a tendency to seek protection against imports, and particularly the import surcharge during part of the <Col N="1530" /> year, made conditions difficult for Irish exporters.  As a result, exports to the USA increased only slightly overall; manufactured goods exports to this market increased from £34.6 million, to £34.9 million.</P>
    <P>Exports to the EEC showed a decline, explained by the drop of £4 million in exports of ores and concentrates, caused chiefly by a fall in prices.  However, manufactured goods exports to these countries were £30 million, as against £27 million in 1970.  It is clear that this rate of increase should be greatly improved when duties against us come down following accession to the enlarged EEC.</P>
    <P>To sum up, it is encouraging that the growth in exports of manufactured goods has continued despite difficulties in some of our markets.  As regards the situation in 1972, the first nine months' trade figures show a continuing upward trend in manufactured exports.  If we can continue to keep cost increases within balance I am confident that the results for the whole year will be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>While in no way neglecting other export markets, Córas Tráchtála are naturally concentrating much of their effort on preparations for exploiting the opportunities in Europe which accession to EEC will present.  The recent opening of their new Brussels office is a major step in a programme which includes special market studies in EEC countries, seminars and lectures for exporters at home, group participation in trade fairs and numerous other measures, directed by a special headquarters section for EEC matters and backed, where necessary, by CTT's incentive grant schemes.  The board's planned opening of an office in Milan in due course will give extra impetus to this work.</P>
    <P>In their advice to exporters on preparing for European free trade Córas Tráchtála continue to urge the enormous importance of product development and adaptation to meet market requirements, of sustained promotional activity, market research and design improvement.  Córas Tráchtála are of course, also continuing and increasing where necessary, their promotional <Col N="1531" /> efforts in other promising markets including the USA and east Europe.</P>
    <P>The development of our mineral resources should also benefit from EEC membership.  In this field there has been no slackening in interest in exploration and development.  Some 770 prospecting licences were current at the end of November, 1972, compared with about 650 at 31st December, 1970.  Exploration activity is now becoming intensive with companies concentrating on the detailed investigation of small areas rather than general surveying of larger areas.</P>
    <P>Total production of concentrates in 1971 at the lead/zinc/silver mines at Tynagh, County Galway and Silver-mines, County Tipperary and the copper/silver/mercury mine at Gortdrum, County Tipperary amounted to 281,603 tons and was approximately 70,000 tons short of the production figure for 1970.  Due to a sharp decline in metal prices, marketing difficulties experienced by one mine and another mine being out of production for part of the year because of an explosion and a strike of workers, the financial return was less than anticipated.  The value of exports of metal ores and concentrates in 1971 was £14,415,000 compared with £18,500,000 in 1970. Metal prices are now showing signs of recovery.  Production commenced in mid-November, 1970, at the reopened copper/pyrites mine at Avoca, County Wicklow and the mine is trading.  To supplement the underground source of ore, the operators have proposals to mine open pit material from one area of the deposit.  Other discoveries, including a promising lead/zinc deposit at Nevinstown, County Meath, are still under detailed investigation.  The value of exports of barytes rose from £929,710 in 1969 to £1,122,000 in 1970 and amounted to £1,107,000 in 1971.</P>
    <P>I am, perhaps, expected to comment on criticisms this year of mining policy though some of the more extravagant statements have received already more attention than they merit. It is desirable and, indeed, necessary to say once again that expropriation <Col N="1532" /> of private property advocated by some of the critics is not a policy of this Government and I am quite sure that it would find no favour with our people.  It is necessary to put this on record because so much of our recent economic progress and the expected development in the future depend on our attracting to this country foreign capital, knowledge and experience to supplement our native resources in these fields.</P>
    <P>I have already said in the House that I have set up an inter-departmental committee to review royalty and taxation arrangements for mining.  I considered this necessary as it appeared to me that existing arrangements which had evolved over the years needed to be looked at in the light of increasing evidence that, contrary to what we had been led to believe, the country was in fact a rich source of minerals.  I am, of course, anxious that the State should get an equitable share of increasing mining profits without, however, inhibiting the continued development of our mineral resources.  The report of the review body will help me to achieve this aim. While on this subject I may say that any estimate of the return to the State from mining enterprises not yet the subject of leases from me is mere speculation.</P>
    <P>There is considerable interest in petroleum exploration and development in the country's area of continental shelf.  Under the terms of the 1959 oil agreement, as amended, Marathon Petroleum Ireland Ltd. hold exclusive petroleum exploration and development rights in three offshore areas.  Following completion of detailed seismic surveys, the company were granted petroleum leases, one in 1970, another in 1971 and two in 1972 in respect of areas off the coasts of Cork and Waterford.  Drilling is proceeding. One more lease is in process of being granted.  None-exclusive petroleum prospecting licences for general surveying of the balance of our designated shelf area have been issued to 20 companies. I have approved the grant of licences to a further 16 companies and applications from 13 other companies are being processed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> Reorganisation and expansion of the geological survey to meet the present and future needs of mineral development in this country is proceeding satisfactorily.  An item of interest is that a complete aerial photographic survey of the country is to be undertaken shortly.</P>
    <P>The last of the major topics which I propose to deal with at this stage is prices.  Deputies will be aware of the developments which have occurred in relation to price control.</P>
    <P>In October, 1971, I established the National Prices Commission to keep under review the prices of commodities and the charges for rendering services and to advise me in relation to those prices and charges.  All price increase applications received by me are referred to the commission for their advice.  The commission have also initiated many investigations and surveys of their own.</P>
    <P>The commission have to date issued 11 reports, at monthly intervals describing the very considerable progress they have made.  As the commission circulate copies of these reports to Deputies, they will be well aware of the wide-ranging nature of the commission's activities and of the nature of the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>Many of these recommendations made by the commission will not be welcomed by some people but they will certainly be welcomed by others. This is in the nature of price control; that to be popular it must also be unpopular. For my part I am glad to pay tribute to the impartial way in which the commission have performed a difficult and thankless task.</P>
    <P>The Prices (Amendment) Act, 1972, became law on 24th July, 1972.  This amending Act widened considerably the scope of the prices legislation to embrace many activities not covered by the Prices Acts of 1958 and 1965. The Act has greatly extended the range of activities which at present come within the purview of the National Prices Commission.  With a view to assisting housewives to identify where best value for money is available and, thereby, to improve the quality of competition in the retail trade, I have <Col N="1534" /> made, on the advice of the National Prices Commission, the Retail Price (Food) Display Order, 1972.  The order came into operation on 1st July, 1972.  It requires all retailers to display prominently in their premises their prices for specified weights and measures of flour, butter, eggs, potatoes, beef, mutton, bacon, pork and oranges.  I intend to maintain a rigorous enforcement of this order.</P>
    <P>I have also made, on the advice of the National Prices Commission, the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, 1972, with effect from 20th November, 1972.  This order requires the prominent display in all licensed premises, including hotels and off-licensed premises, of the tax inclusive prices at which all intoxicating liquor and non-alcoholic beverages are sold whether for consumption on the premises or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Prices, like taxes, affect us all in a very sensitive area&mdash;our pockets.  It is understandable that there should, in the present inflationary climate, be widespread concern about price increases and, indeed, the problem is a worldwide one at the present time.</P>
    <P>However strongly we may hold views on the subject of price control, we must accept certain hard facts.  In the present circumstances, with domestic costs and wages constantly increasing, with the impact of market forces at international level on agricultural and other products and with the effects which world wide inflation and currency variations are having on the cost of imported materials, increases in prices cannot be avoided.  Anyone who reads the published monthly reports of the National Prices Commission will see that, even after the most careful and critical scrutiny by this independent body, increases on wide ranges of products have to be authorised if the production and employment of the Irish firms concerned are to be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Price control at retail level is, by definition, extremely difficult.  In one of its first monthly reports, the National Prices Commission dealt at length with this problem and concluded that anything approaching rigid control over a wide range of commodities would not be practicable. <Col N="1535" /> The vast number of retail outlets, the variety of products, packages and quantities offered for sale, the normal competitive practices which produce variations from shop to shop and even from day to day on the same premises&mdash;these are only a few of the many problems which arise.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned these and other factors because sometimes the public may be led to believe that everything would be perfect if we had more orders, more inspectors or if other, less orthodox, forms of control were tried.  This over-simple approach is no help to anyone.  On the other hand, well-publicised public concern and the efforts of various responsible organisations and bodies to induce the public to resist unjustified price increases are valuable weapons in our campaign to moderate increases.  I intend to maintain and strengthen our price control efforts in every reasonable and feasible way open to me and to the Government.</P>
    <P>I have recently received the interim report of the committee of inquiry into the insurance industry in regard to motor insurance.  I propose to have the report published.  It has been sent for printing and I expect that it will be available generally in about a month's time.  I have requested that the report should be examined in my Department as a matter of urgency. The committee will now concern itself with an examination of the other classes of insurance.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset of my remarks, I regard the topics I have dealt with as being of particular importance at the present time&mdash;certainly, they are the matters with which I have been mainly preoccupied in recent months.  There are, of course, many other important matters with which my Department is concerned and I have no doubt that, if any Deputy wishes to have information on a particular question which I have not covered, he will raise it with me.  I shall do my best to deal as fully as possible with any matters so raised during the course of my reply to this debate.  I commend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the <Col N="1536" /> Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I am moving this motion because the Minister has read out a diatribe given to him by a number of civil servants and he has not expressed himself on policy as he should have had. In Parliament some of us have no power.  We on this side of the House have no power.  Others have power. Those of us who have no power take a certain advantage in that we can say what we would like to do, knowing that we cannot do it but if I were in the Minister's shoes I would take the criticism and the praise that might come from it and I would produce a speech on the Estimate.  He has not done that. He has said exactly what I would expect him to say.  He has not prepared a speech himself but has taken it from his advisers and that is not the way to do it.  He has to vote himself probably before next May and other people have to vote for him.  He has to &ldquo;cock himself up&rdquo; as Minister for Industry and Commerce, as somebody who is going to do something about it.  He has not done that.  He has read a speech which was prepared for him.  He probably never saw it until he stood up to read it.  It is very difficult to criticise that speech because the best brains in the Department of Industry and Commerce prepared it so obviously it is not a bad speech.  It is a very good speech.  At the same time, you have to think about brains for a start and a bit of guts as well and decide whether or not you are with the faceless men who produced this speech and then you have to decide which way you are going.  I intend to decide about this one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed that all the brains of the Department of Industry and Commerce have stultified themselves by not once mentioning the Dublin Stock Exchange.  My view is that the day when the fellow who is earning £20 or £30 a week happens to buy £500 worth of a certain share to lose or win is the day when Irish industry will be on a sound basis.  You can take all the Industrial Development Authority grants you like and all the Industrial Credit Company loans and you are talking about something that is <Col N="1537" /> far less than the amount of money passing through people's pockets which is available for investment.  I am amazed the Department of Industry and Commerce have not adverted to this.</P>
    <P>This is a private enterprise society. We have got on the Minister's side and on our side various people who have an idea that you can do things in another way, that you can, say, not have a private enterprise society, not pay taxes and at the same time carry on.  This is not on.  This is a private enterprise society and this country must expand, look after itself, employ people on the basis that it is a private enterprise society and they must pay their taxes.  That is highly important.</P>
    <P>We have had statements from the Minister and the IDA but we have not heard anything about the Irish Stock Exchange.  What is the position when a man wishes to invest £100, £200 or £300?  In New York he would not have any trouble in putting in or withdrawing that money.  If Irish industry is to succeed it must depend on the Irish people.  In Denmark if one wants to invest one can put 1 per cent of profits into a fund and in the following year this amount can be increased to 2 per cent or 3 per cent. After about five or ten years the workers own the industry but I do not think that is on for this country. I should like to have worker participation but we must remember this is a private enterprise economy, as in France, Belgium, Italy, the United States and Britain.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of insurance, I should like to point out that a series of questions by me in this House got scant coverage in the Press. At the moment young people cannot get car insurance and I think the Minister will have a lot of trouble on his hands.  The Minister sits and does nothing about the matter; in fact, he appears to be happy with the situation. In 1964 there was an Act whereby all the insurance companies paid for the one company that was not able to pay.  This might happen again and I warned the Minister two months ago about the matter.  The young people who need motor insurance must get it <Col N="1538" /> and it is the Minister's job to see that they obtain insurance.</P>
    <P>With regard to redundancies, may I repeat what I have said previously, namely, there is more joy about five new jobs than there is in saving 1,000 existing jobs.  I am sure the Press will not print that statement because it is not colourful enough but it is a statement of fact that cannot be denied. This year 11,000 people were declared redundant.  We voted for entry into the EEC and we must accept that there will be redundancies.  It is my view that it will not be possible to create new jobs to match the number of redundancies.  The IDA programme for 1973-77 is clear but in the first few years we will take a terrible beating. In making this statement I am trying to be helpful to the Minister.  We will not win this year or the next year but in the following year we should get to the stage where we can match redundancies by new jobs.  However, it will cost an enormous amount of money.  We must accept that we will lose this year and most of the following year but after that things should balance.</P>
    <P>I have quoted <i>ex tempore</i> article 1, subsection (5) of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and Article 236 of the Treaty of Rome.  I would ask the Minister if he has read those articles?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the articles but I cannot quote them <i>ex tempore.</i> However, I am willing to hear what the Deputy wants to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can read the articles before he replies and he will find I am right.  Article 236 of the Treaty of Rome provides that the small countries can do their job on getting a little bit of privilege on their employment situation.  Quite clearly&mdash; I have said this before&mdash;if we have not got backroom boys in the Department of Industry and Commerce deciding how we can under the Treaty of Accession, the Treaty of Rome, the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and under the article to which I referred, organise to ensure that not one job will be lost then, like the law, we are an ass.  I understand we have not got them.  We are an ass if we <Col N="1539" /> have not got these people organising to ensure that the very best shall be got for the most humble worker in the most out-of-the-way part of the country.  That is what we have got to do and I am not satisfied that it is being done.  I am dissatisfied with the situation.</P>
      <P>I accept that under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the Treaty of Rome there are probably 11,000 redundancies on the cards. What is the Minister doing?  The situation would be very sad for the 11,000 affected.  This is something few people would say, but I acknowledge that this is the situation the Minister will have on his hands.  It is a problem. I do not wish to take advantage of it. It is one of those things we have to live with.  But what are we going to do about it?  The lark of the Minister going down and opening a set of petrol pumps, and all that kind of cod, is over.  How can we face the fact that 11,000 redundancies are on?  What are we going to do?</P>
      <P>I believe it is a question of work by the Minister, by his staff and by the various Government agencies who will have to do their very best to produce 11,000 new jobs to cater for these redundancies.  I do not believe they will succeed.  This would be a three to four year task.  Possibly I am now letting the Minister off the hook, but we, on this side of the House, are concerned with the truth, and my boss told the truth a week ago.  It is clear the Minister cannot replace 11,000 redundancies with 11,000 new jobs.  The Minister may contradict me and say that it will not take him three to four years to carry out this task and that he will do it in two years or 18 months, but my considered view, as a businessman, is that the Minister cannot do it.</P>
      <P>I come now to the local situation.  I represent Louth.  I believe I will head the poll at the next election.  I believe I will be around 1,500 votes ahead of the Minister for Education.  That is the normal number of votes I get over him because of my work.  No problem, as the Minister for Transport and Power would say.</P>

      <P>The colleague was shot in 1916, or something, and, when he is gone, it will be a different ball game.  I was chairman of the Louth County Council and a member of the regional development organisation for Louth, Monaghan and Cavan and of the health board for Louth, Meath, Monaghan and Cavan and over the last several months I have been reminded very forcibly of the situation of the infrastructure.  The infrastructure is quite clearly a matter of roads, telephones and water.  The supply of water in Dundalk, with a population of 20,000, is quite inadequate.  In Drogheda, with a population of 18,000, all the water required is available.  We have done a very good job on the new £11 million cement factory.  In two years' time Drogheda will be home.  It is a different story in Dundalk.  They have not got enough water.  The chairman of Dundalk Urban District Council opened a new water scheme with, I may say, great aplomb and dignity and it was believed everybody would have enough water.  The fact is we have not got enough water and the proposal now is to flood 45 acres and produce water from Lake Muckno, the Lake of the Swimming Pig.  That will produce enough water for Dundalk and for all the industries that can be placed in Dundalk.  If this is the course of events it will be a very good thing.  The infrastructure of roads, telephones, <i>et cetera</i> is very important.  If I speak about telephones I will probably be a bit off the Estimate.</P>

      <P>Yes, but he could not get one to Dunleer or to Drogheda. It is all right for the Minister to be smart.  At 8.30 this morning I put through a call to Rhum.  I got it within three minutes.  It was to a gentleman called Stevenson.</P>

What will a businessman do if he has to decide whether he will take a grant here and enjoy the tax benefits until 1980?  I can telephone Rhum in five seconds but I cannot get through to Dublin.  The Minister's party are responsible for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years ago a certain port was not going so well owing to a certain situation and I advised the investment of certain funds.  We did not succeed in getting it going.  I was not involved in it but if it had been done and if the Minister could get the people of Ireland to put money in, believing in the situation as it is, there would be real industrial development in the country.  I had certain views about six months ago and I decided I would take a certain line.  I borrowed some money and removed a certain sum from where I had it and invested it in a certain company.  I was right.  What I should really like to see is the ordinary person down the country becoming interested in Irish industry and investing £50, £100, £150 or, perhaps, £200.  In the place from which I borrowed the money to invest I was told that if I knew anybody willing to invest he would be given an attractive <Col N="1542" /> interest rate.  I put £6,000 from the parish of Monasterboice into that business, money that had been lying in the bank and in saving certificates. That is the place to put it and it will make the Minister and the Department do their job.</P>
    <P>There must be capital investment but, first of all, there must be the infrastructure. All that was contained in the Minister's introductory speech was stuffing.  I am very fond of turkey stuffing and all other kinds of stuffing but not of the kind contained in the Minister's speech.  He read out what he was given to read and expressed no opinion of his own.  More companies must become public and more people must invest. If a man takes home £10 and spends £9 he should invest the remaining £1.  That philosophy is accepted in New York, Chicago and Boston but there they have reached the stage where they are gambling.  That should not be the position here.  At the same time, if we are to have a private enterprise economy we must take our chances when we invest.  The Minister has not even talked about that.  As far as he is concerned it is a closed shop. We have Guinness's shares, the Dublin Port and Milling Company shares, Allied Irish Investment Banks shares, and so on, and no one in Killarney ever heard about them.</P>

He has just read out what the boys behind the rail told him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dundalk AnCO are starting a retraining centre.  Retraining is most important. I have accepted that the number of redundancies, 11,000, is a fact of life.  We must think about the retraining of workers.  I brought eight people <Col N="1543" /> to a certain company and I think I have replaced them.  People who are not up to scratch cannot be replaced by me or by the Minister.  We thank the Minister for the AnCO retraining centre which is starting in Dundalk. We are not churlish about that.  The AnCO operation is highly expensive.  I would say that in certain situations the AnCO levy on profits or on turnover, is far above the net profit.  It is very easy for civil servants, or for the Minister, or others, to say that AnCO is 1 per cent off, but it is very difficult to pay this money.  Sometimes it is not only difficult but improper.</P>
    <P>The Prices Act, 1972, was introduced by the Minister and then he removed section 3 under which the price of houses was controlled.  I am not interested in whether a £20,000 house is controlled.  I am interesed to ensure that the boy and girl who want to get married, and who have very little money, will not have to pay too much for a house.  Section 3 of the 1972 Act provided that a house was a commodity and, therefore, could be controlled.  I could not care less if a person who wants a £20,000 house has to pay £30,000 for it.  I am interested in the young married couple who have very little money.</P>
    <P>As I said, section 3 defines a house as a commodity which can be controlled. It was removed three weeks before the Mid-Cork by-election. During the Mid-Cork by-election I saw one of the biggest builders in the country canvassing with the Minister for Local Government.  How mean can we become?  If I were looking for a grant or a loan, I would not think of going within 1,000 yards of the man who might be deciding whether or not I would jump into the River Liffey this evening.</P>

      <P>The Minister is responsible for the Prices Act, 1972.  As spokesman on Industry and Commerce for Fine Gael, I am also responsible, and I will accept my responsibility. <Col N="1544" /> I will not accept that the Minister is the boss, that he does the job, and that is that.  The two of us have a responsibility.  As well as being responsible I am also disgusted at what happened.  The Minister for Local Government said that he would not pay the grant, even though the measurement of the house was correct for grant purposes.  I do not agree with that because I think that the number of people who are going to buy houses, the boys and girls who are married or intend to marry and to buy a house, and who will buy them at the price offered to them, will be affected to an extraordinary degree by the removal of section 3 of the Prices Act.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about that section. Why can the gentleman on the Press Gallery go down to the General Office tomorrow and ask for the Prices Act of 1972 as introduced and find that section 3 defines a house as a commodity and then find that at the last stage section 3 is removed?  The Minister's party have been very lucky inasmuch as the mid-Cork by election produced a great avalanche of ideas and news, with the result that this was put in the background.

      <P>I want to find out something.  I do not care if I am out of this House tomorrow&mdash;I would be very much better off.  I am the third generation without a break in politics and having said that, I want to say that for a Minister of State to be seen with a person who had an interest, walking around in a by-election, would in Britain be a reason to resign.  I am being quite specific in what I am saying, putting it word by word and letter by letter.  If in the Prices Act a house is defined as a commodity&mdash;I suppose there are a million or nearly a million <Col N="1545" /> houses in this country&mdash;and if I find that one of the biggest builders of houses&mdash;and I am a private enterprise man, utterly and completely&mdash;can be seen during a by-election with the Minister for Local Government, who has the right to decide whether or not on appeal planning permission will be given for 100, 300, 500 or 2,000 houses, it is time the Minister or the man in charge of the Act, the Minister opposite, or the Government should resign. It is for them to decide what they will do and they can do what they like, but go to section 3 of the Act of 1972 and you will find a house is defined as a commodity.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I was at a board meeting of a certain company and I found that a commodity had had a 90p increase, and a 25p increase, and I think a 38p per ton increase.  I asked if they had increased and I was told &ldquo;no, they have not but will in the next fortnight; we have some stocks and we are carrying on&rdquo;.  That is the sort of discipline we are subjected to but why is it that the boys and girls of this country have to find themselves in the situation in which a house is a commodity and then it is not?  What do we wear?  What do we eat?  What do we live in?  I do not care about the £20,000 or the £30,000 house&mdash;these people can pay £22,000 or £32,000 or £18,000 or £28,000&mdash;but I do care very much about the real price of the normal three-bedroomed house in which boys and girls getting married are going to live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer you, Sir, to section 3 of the Prices Act, 1972, and you will find that I am right.  You realise that during my 18 years here, I have always been entirely subject to the Chair and always with the Chair, but I refer you, with respect, to section 3 of the Prices Act 1972.  This was the greatest sin ever committed in my time in Dáil Éireann.  That the biggest builder in this city and in Cork was canvassing with the Minister for Local Government, with section 3 of the Prices Act, for which the Minister is <Col N="1546" /> responsible, removed one week before the mid-Cork by-election, to me was a horrifying situation.  Knowing the man well I went to him and said: &ldquo;Will you for God's sake have a bit of sense and go home?  Whatever has happened, forget about it and go home.&rdquo; I will not mention his name.  He did not go home but I do not think he understood what he was doing.  We think about the situation in England and the last occasion which gave rise to a resignation, the previous one being the John Profumo matter.  These resignations were on the basis that people who were in government had behaved improperly.  What annoys me is that the Minister continues in office and takes no account of what has happened in relation to the Prices Act, 1972.  If I found myself in that position, I would relinquish my office immediately. Let us consider what happened in relation to section 3 of the Prices Act, 1972.  I have been in politics long enough to know that when it is proposed to introduce a Bill, the proposals are circulated to every Department of State.  Therefore, the proposals for the Prices Act, 1972 were sent to the Department of Finance and Local Government among others, they having emanated from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The source of power is the Cabinet meeting at which the views of the different Ministers on any proposal are made known.  Then, if there is no objection to the proposals, the Bill is brought before the House. In my view, the Prices Act, 1972, was not a bad measure but, having said that, we must consider section 3 of the Act.  In this section a house was defined as a commodity.  The Minister accepted responsibility for the circulation of the Bill as it was then.  Of course, it is for the Cabinet to reach a decision on any proposal and sometimes they can avail of the opportunity of reaching decisions that are popular.  On the basis of the control of prices, the Minister is entitled to some praise for the Prices Act but in respect of section 3 of that Act there is no praise due to him.  One reaction to the Bill was that builders who were constructing, say, 10,000 houses in this city, were capable of saying to the <Col N="1547" /> Minister that he is only a small man and that section 3 of the Bill must go. During the by-election campaign in mid-Cork I found a person who must be the biggest builder in Dublin or in Cork, canvassing with the Minister for Local Government.  Section 3 of the Prices Act, 1972 has much relevance to what I am talking about although it is possible that what I am saying will not get into print.  The point I am making is that the ordinary three-bedroomed house, of which we see hundreds in a row and into which young couples go in the hope of being able to leave them after five or ten years, is the type of house that has been excluded and which is no longer defined as a commodity. This is a public disgrace, the greatest disgrace that we have ever known.</P>
      <P>I mentioned speculative gains tax and in this respect I wish to define my party's position on this question.  Press reporters are a group of decent fellows but there are times when one must decide whether what is published is true.  Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to define my party's position in respect of capital gains tax.  As we said in 1965 and in 1969 that we would look at the situation but the Press reports of this suggested that we would produce a speculative gains tax.  I do not think that the Minister will take advantage of me on this matter when he is replying because neither he nor I take advantage of each other.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael will look at the situation regarding speculative gains tax but they have no definite commitment to produce such a tax. Regarding wages and salaries and management, we hear many young mohair-suited moguls saying that management is wrong, that the old boy is always wrong and should be got rid of.  This may be true in some cases but it would be very wrong to adopt such an approach in general.  There are certain people in all political parties who can produce statistics and figures, but their conclusions are not <Col N="1548" /> always right.  People who have served in the hard school of experience can often find a way through difficulties. In this country industry is dependent on the management teams.  I am nauseated at the way people say &ldquo;Paddy Lalor is no good, and Paddy Donegan is no good, and Jimmy Tully is no good.  Get rid of them all.&rdquo; These statements are not necessarily true.  This morning I dealt with a situation where I was told to get rid of a certain person and a factory would do better.  I do not agree with that.  It is not that simple.  Older men have often expertise which can be used to good effect.</P>

      <P>It is unfair that Fóir Teoranta or the IDA should walk into factories and say that one should get rid of a certain old person and that the situation would be all right then.  The man I am thinking about is the &ldquo;whole guts&rdquo; of the concern.  He is the fellow who insists on the men coming in and starting at 8 a.m. and who insists on a check on output. It is being said that he should be forced to take £500 a year less and that he should be demoted.  It was suggested that he should leave at 65; he has three years to go.  There are people even in the Fine Gael Party who might act as advisers on industry.</P>

We are as good as possible and do not wish to be seen with the whizz kids unless they really are whizz kids. Many of them are no good.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied with Fóir Teoranta or the IDA.  They are great at ensuring that they have security and at organising somebody to go into a sinking company.  Then they organise a good meal a fortnight later and the job is done.  I am not satisfied with industrial policy at the moment.  I am not here to ensure votes for Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.  I am interested in industry.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to a statement in the <i>Financial Times</i> which said that in Denmark 1 per cent of the net profit is put into a fund and that workers become shareholders.  Our country is a private enterprise country. In Britain there are the coal, steel and different industries and a huge number of industrial workers.  There is also colonial wealth, particularly in the South of England.  One can see a Left and Right situation.  One can win or lose an election on that basis. We here are in a hotch-potch situation. There are not enough industrial workers to make a difference or enough farmers either.  This is the crucifixion of the Labour Party.  There are not enough shades of society to make a difference in so far as industry and commerce are concerned.  We must be pragmatic here.  If there is a chance of ten or 100 jobs in a certain place it could not matter less whether that industry was financed by an individual with the aid of grants or whether it was financed by the State.  In my view it would be better if it were financed by the individual. Where the persons £1 is on the floor he is more likely to pick it up than if it is the State's £1 that is on the floor.</P>

The Northern Ireland Government decided that they would not continue to have their trains, wagons and carts built or repaired there.  That decision caused 1,000 redundancies.  The late Seán Lemass when Minister for Industry and Commerce decided that something <Col N="1550" /> would have to be done about the situation. At that time Taiscí Stáit or Fóir Teoranta had not been set up.  Mr. Lemass, on behalf of the Government, underwrote £1,800,000 which remained on the balance sheet of the Industrial Credit Company for four years.  I am an expert on the subject.  I have only to go to EEI of Ireland which is at a distance of four miles from me.</P>

      <P>In that case the Minister for Education, Deputy Faulkner, and I should be the experts on this. In that case also we had to face up to a rescue operation.  The Minister should alert himself about this.  I am not too happy about it at the moment.  Have I conveyed the message to the Minister?</P>

      <P>We were in the situation that 1,000 people in this company could pressure the Government.  I could give other examples.  Deputy Peter Barry, Deputy Cosgrave and I went to Verolme in Cork during the mid-Cork by-election.  I was told there would be redundancies in the industry.  Forty-eight hours before the by-election the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was saying &ldquo;no redundancies&rdquo;.  Then the redundancies occurred.  Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and Deputy Meaney put down a question about three weeks ago in regard to the redundancies in that industry.  I knew before the Cork by-election that the redundancies would occur.  I was told so by the executives of the industry. Deputy Peter Barry and Deputy Cosgrave were told so.  If you want to get to the stage where Fianna Fáil and their Ministers can do what they like, then you are back to section 3 of the Prices Act, 1972 or to that sort of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were a Minister I would resign within five minutes if I did that sort of thing.  I would not have any part in it.  I cannot use the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; but I can use the word &ldquo;untruth&rdquo;.  I used it here the week before last.  The Press Gallery did not know it happened and the Minister was laughing the whole <Col N="1551" /> way back to his constituency.  How is it that a serious allegation against a Minister of State goes unreported in the papers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

      <P>Do you mean to say that a serious allegation against a Minister of State in regard to the question of whether or not there would be redundancies in Verolme is not relevant to this Estimate?  With respect, I say that, of course, it is.  Before the mid-Cork by-election, Deputy Peter Barry, Deputy Liam Cosgrave and I were told that redundancies would occur and we never opened our mouths.  We did the decent thing.  Then there was the parliamentary question put down by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and Deputy Meaney about ten days ago, when I asked supplementary questions in order to get them out of trouble, to try to correct the position.  They had let the people of Cork in for redundancies and did not tell them before a by-election that redundancies would occur.  How mean can one get?</P>
      <P>Last week, on the Imposition of Duties Bill, the question of footwear was discussed.  The year of review under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement&mdash;Article 1 (5)&mdash;started on 1st July, 1971, a year in which difficulties could be discussed.  The Minister did not explain why he opened the discussions in April, 1971.  He did not explain why he had not done it a year before or why he is doing it at the last minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in a footwear factory in my constituency within the last 36 hours.  This is an industry exporting exclusively to America.  We can get away from the rat race on footwear but what about the people who just cannot get away from that rat race, the people who have a factory and cannot change their whole trading?  About two years ago I was talking to the top man on footwear in the Common Market in Brussels.  His name was M. Goretti.  He told me that the biggest factory in Belgium was a privately owned factory. It was not absolutely privately owned but the shares in the factory <Col N="1552" /> were largely in the one family.  He told me that because of their size and because of Italian imports and other problems they could not change quickly enough because they would lose so much money in changing over to a different style of manufacturing that the whole thing would not be viable. The biggest factory in Belgium was condemned to extinction and the best brains in the world could not change that.  If 30 people or 50 people were concerned it could be done.</P>
    <P>For instance, Father Campbell of Dundalk, a few other people and myself had a decision on a company called Castle Shoes which employed about 20 or 30 people.  We invested very small sums in it and Castle Shoes is at the moment doing very well.  It is all right to change when you are small.  In the Common Market people say the big thing must succeed but that is not true.  An té nach bhfuil laidir ní folair dó bheith glic.  The bigger industries in very sensitive lines such as textiles and shoes will have a very difficult time indeed, not because of their excellence, not because of their administrative ability, not because of their lack of it, but because big bodies move slowly.  In my constituency there was a grant for a shoe factory of £1,300,000.  I am sure that people who have not heard that before are inclined to turn handsprings.  Does the Minister know that?</P>

      <P>That factory is exporting to America.  It is producing shoes of the very best quality.  I was in the factory the other day and if I had the moral courage I would have said that I would have a pair of shoes myself at the price for which they are being sold to America.  The mark-up in America is colossal.  The man who really makes money in America is the middle-man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to talk about the situation in my local area of Louth-Monaghan-Cavan. Deputy Bruton speaking last night, or the night before, in the west said that it is very stupid to have the health boards embracing certain areas and the regional <Col N="1553" /> development organisations embracing areas which are not similar. I agree.  We should have the same areas for all these things.  The infrastructure is the main thing&mdash;roads, water, telephones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not very sad?  It is most important that we should have a good training establishment in the various areas.  The Minister for Labour is responsible for AnCO but if the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not get a number of people coming forward from the AnCO training establishment he will be in a sad state indeed, in so far as new industry is concerned.  We agree that we must replace the 11,000 jobs that have been lost.</P>
      <P>On the question of mining, the policy of Fine Gael is quite simple.  We believe that the State should get its fair share.  We believe that prospecting licences should be granted to those who have the money and expertise to prospect.  They should be given mining licences quickly so that we can get the very best out of this country by mining. With regard to Tara Mines, there is a law case outstanding and a judge of the High Court is considering his decision.  Eighty-five per cent of the Tara Mines area is on one side of the river and 15 per cent is on the other side.  The area in question happens to be on the 15 per cent side and the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to decide if he will give a mining licence on the basis of certain royalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1554" /> A year ago in this House the Minister told me that this was a very good strike and that the royalties should be high and I agreed with this.  The State should demand royalties on each ton of ore produced.  About 20 years ago if anyone said that there was a zinc, a gold or any other mine in Ireland he would be considered a lunatic. However, it is now realised that we have precious metals but it is simply a question of whether it is a commercial prospect to extract these metals and to use them.  In this case I would mention Arklow where the price of copper rose from £180 per ton to £340.</P>
    <P>Zinc is the principal mineral in the Tara Mines.  Portugal has considerable zinc resources and there is an agreement with the Common Market countries with regard to the zinc output. Zinc is a mineral that is subject to market fluctuations and it is important that we get into the trade as soon as possible.  The Minister has not done his job.  He should have grasped the nettle firmly and should have decided to give a mining licence to Tara Mines, leaving out the 15 per cent that is on the other side of the Boyne.</P>
    <P>The Minister has his advisers and I am sure the legal situation is considered very carefully.  However, as a certain man said a week ago: &ldquo;I am not accustomed to being told by solicitors what to do; I am accustomed to telling them what to do and then paying them.&rdquo;  The Minister should take that line and make up his mind.  A sum of £2 million is spent at the port of Drogheda. Some 500,000 tons of ore are exported.  We do not want to export this because if we can increase the amount we can process it in this country with consequent work for Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Minister had plenty of legal advice but I wonder if he has courage. He should grant a mining licence to Tara Mines and allow them to produce zinc which could be shipped out of Drogheda.  Perhaps in a year or two we may be able to process the ore in this country.  If we do not take some steps Portugal and other countries will supply the zinc and we will be too late.  If this happens the Minister must bear responsibility.  It is <Col N="1555" /> essential to take decisions in business. I realise that a decision taken today may be the wrong decision tomorrow but if the Minister will not make any decisions, if he is content to get blueprints from his advisers but to do nothing about them, he is merely a rubber stamp.  The Minister should make a decision one way or the other. The silence of the Minister on this matter, the fact that we have a few million pounds invested in County Meath but we cannot take out the goods, is a blot on the Minister's political expertise.  If the Minister does not want to give a licence he should state his reasons and I am inviting him to do so.</P>
    <P>We have agreements with the EEC regarding the supply of zinc but the Minister will do nothing.  If they supply the zinc, Tara Mines will be a much less viable concern.  What I would wish for, instead of the Minister across the way, is a man like the late Deputy Seán Lemass or the late Deputy Sweetman.  They would decide in five minutes what it takes the Minister a year to consider.  All I can do is try to bestir the Minister into doing his job.  I can do no more.  All the expertise behind the Minister is wasted.  In my opinion the Minister, from the point of view of mining, is a disaster.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with gas and oil exploration off our coast.  Fine Gael were well in front of the Government and everybody else, including the Labour Party, in regard to exploration for both oil and gas.  The safeguarding of the people's rights is very important.  People know very little about these things and the Minister has made no effort to inform them. The country owns up to 300 metres depth around our shores.  Taking into account the Continental Shelf, this represents a vast area for exploration. What has the Minister done about it? With whom is he negotiating?  The truth is the Minister has done very little about such exploration for gas and oil.  He could issue prospecting licences and charge royalties on the gas and oil extracted.  Why should we not emulate the sheiks of Araby? Why not fortify the below-the-line <Col N="1556" /> expenditure in the Budget with money from somewhere else?  The people should reap the benefit of the country's unnatural assets.  Oil and gas could be a gold mine if only the Minister would bestir himself.  If I were in his shoes I would work myself to the bone.  The Minister just sits there like a nice, easy bloke&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the question of regional policy in the EEC, it would appear that we have a good chance of getting some money for the designated areas.  We, in Fine Gael, produced what I believe is a sensible policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the regional development of industry, which is a very important matter indeed. If industry is not developed in designated areas the taxation levied on those living in areas which are not designated will be a truly intolerable burden.  Money will have to be found for amenities such as roads, hospitals, Garda barracks, and so on, in the designated areas and, unless these areas are themselves industrialised, the burden of taxation in the non-designated areas will be quite impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must concentrate on a crash programme to industrialise the areas west of the Shannon.  I know the Minister will have trouble in getting the necessary finance from his colleagues in the Department of Finance.  As an aside I would suggest that in the Fourth Programme for Economic Expansion, not yet available, the Minister for <Col N="1557" /> Industry and Commerce should have provision for a crash programme to industrialise the areas west of the Shannon.  That would not be agreeable to Deputies in the east of the country &mdash;I include myself in this&mdash;but it is the only way in which we can achieve a true programme of private enterprise economy.</P>
    <P>On the question of Fóir Teoranta, I agree with the element of gamble in the work they are doing but I sincerely hope there will be no large failures such as Potez.  At this point I should like to give a little advice to the Minister. If I were Minister for Industry and Commerce I would sack immediately one-third of the work force the Minister now has.  I particularly know one of them: I had a business association with him&mdash;and I would sack him in five minutes.  He knows that I know that he evaded customs duty on certain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very careful not to create a situation through which any of the four civil servants in the House beside the Minister could be affected.  Perhaps the Minister could identify the person I have been speaking about.  If I were in his position I would sack him in five minutes.  I had begun to speak about Fóir Teoranta and about the element of gamble in their make-up.  In my constituency they have helped considerably and we hope they will do so again.  Having said that I think it was remiss of the Minister <Col N="1558" /> not to have devoted more of his introductory remarks to that important Government agency.  His speech was produced by somebody in the Department and it was not a politician's speech.  I should like the Minister to have said what I have said about Fóir Teoranta, Taiscí Stáit, Potez and the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
      <P>Last Monday, as chairman of Louth County Council, I had lunch with the local director of the IDA because I knew I would have to speak here tonight. When I returned to the county manager's office I found that what I had been told at lunch was being discussed. The plans were on infrastructure for industry, not for houses, not for people.  The suggestion was to harness Lake Muckno, the lake of the swimming pig.  It is said that when a black pig swims across Lake Muckno the world will end.  The town of Dundalk will have more water than it ever had for industry from Lake Muckno.  It will cost a colossal amount of money.  I was talking on Monday afternoon about flooding 50 acres to provide water for industry in Dundalk. I have reached the conclusion that if you took away the grants and the tax free concessions and put in the telephones, the roads and the water you would get industry.  It is as simple as this.  If you put houses in a certain area, people will populate the houses and then they will find jobs.  This is a simple fact.</P>

      <P>I sought permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment <Col N="1561" /> because of the difficulty I have been experiencing by way of the unsatisfactory replies I have been receiving to questions regarding what action the Government intend to take to assist thalidomide victims.  I have been raising the matter here since 1966 but to no avail.</P>
      <P>Anybody who read this week's <i>Sunday Times</i> will know that that paper indicated our Government for their apparent callousness in not giving attention to this problem.  During the next few minutes I hope to be able to illustrate that these unfortunate thalidomide children and their families have not been treated with the greatest sympathy.  We are all aware of the dreadful deformities attributable directly to the drug, thalidomide, but because of the reticence of the Department of Health and of the Government's decision to refuse to allow publication of a report on this matter, we do not know exactly what is the extent of the deformity of the 84 children concerned.  The thalidomide disaster was peculiar in so far as the deformities were specific to that drug. Apart from a few cases I am not aware of the extent of the deformities here but I would suggest that babies were born here without limbs, some deaf, some blind, some mentally deficient and others with internal abnormalities. These babies of 1962 are now becoming the deformed teenagers of 1972.  This human tragedy is of a lifelong duration both for the victims and for their parents and other members of their families.</P>
      <P>In addition to discussing the gross deformities of the victims I wish to discuss also the emotional and financial burden to the families concerned. We know of the continuing heartbreak of mothers who are experiencing the result of this tragedy. Many children are without limbs, some have bone deformities while others are minus some bones.  These defects require hospitalisation.  Many of the defects were discovered some years after birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the Minister many times whether he would consider ensuring that every thalidomide victim was afforded free, all medical and hospital <Col N="1562" /> services and surgical appliances but I could get no such assurance from him.  The tragedy in Ireland can be attributed in no small measure to the negligence of the Department of Health who allowed, under our laws, the dispensing of this drug over the counter. The labels on the containers of the drugs carried a note which said that the drug was safe for mother and child. The Department allowed those labels to be put on the containers.  When suspicions were first aroused, no effort was made by the Department to stop the sale or distribution of the drug. They did not act in November of 1961 when the deformities attributable to the drug were made known first in Germany and in Britain.</P>
    <P>As the <i>Sunday Times</i> pointed out, two further months elapsed before any action was taken by the Government or by the company concerned in withdrawing the drug from the market here. Because of this I have no hesitation in indicting the Department of Health for their seeming negligence in this regard.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister if he would consider publishing the report of the survey that was carried out into the extent of the deformities but he told me he would not do so.  As the <i>Sunday Times</i> pointed out also, the doctor who carried out the survey was forbidden by the Department to publish the scientific report.  This was against all principles where scientific reports are concerned and I see it as an effort by the Department to cover up the extent of the deformities.  In Britain and in all other countries where there are thalidomide victims such scientific reports were published.  The lame excuse given by the Department for their refusal to allow publication of the report was that it might identify the victim.  Scientific reports are published regularly involving people but the question of identification has never arisen.</P>
    <P>I deplore this action by the Department and by the Minister who must accept responsibility for it.  There is no valid legal or moral reason why the report should not be published.</P>
    <P>When I asked the Minister what was the cost to date to the State in respect <Col N="1563" /> of these children, he told me that it would not be worth asking the health boards to provide the information because they could not identify the children.  Yet, the Minister knows that there are 84 victims purporting to have deformities that are attributable to thalidomide and as every doctor knows, the deformities are specific to that drug because it was one of the interesting aspects of the drug that it produced specific deformities.  Therefore, there is no difficulty whatever in recognising the particular conditions but I cannot accept the Minister's reply to the effect that there is difficulty in establishing the identity of children whose handicaps are due to their mothers having taken this drug. The Minister told me that it would take too long to establish the frequency and cost of the services provided. This would be very necessary information in giving us an indication of the extent of the deformities and of the extent and frequencies of hospitalisation for these children.</P>
    <P>Time and again the Minister has told me that the matter is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is merely acting on behalf of the Minister for Health, who must accept the responsibility for this tragedy, and who is trying to evade his responsibility when he says that the matter is one for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The only positive step taken by the Minister or his predecessor was the insertion in the national newspapers of an advertisement asking the parents of these victims to notify the Department of the degree of the deformity so that the information could be passed to the German company but they made it clear that any claim on behalf of the victims was the responsibility of the claimant.  The Department denied any responsibility in this regard and would not undertake any action on behalf of the parents in their claim for compensation. This is a deplorable situation especially in view of the tragedy involved.  The insertion of the advertisement could not be construed as being positive Government intervention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> There has been no effort to my knowledge of medical assessment in this country by doctors on behalf of the German company.  I would have thought that this would be a very constructive gesture on the part of the Government to insist on this being done by the German medical assessors so that we might be able to decide what compensation would be due to the victims.  If the Minister says that the <i>Sunday Times</i> article is incorrect or that the paper is irresponsible in its statement, he has not issued any official denial of the facts that these people will not receive proper compensation. I heard tonight that the British distillers' company have announced that they are setting up a fund to provide £12 million during a ten-year period for 242 victims.  This amounts to £50,000 per victim and if this is accepted by the claimants the sum of £2,500 will be paid immediately in respect of each victim.  This is positive action but so far as we are concerned we do not know whether any money is to be made available for victims here. This is where I say the Minister has contradicted himself.  He says that the Department are not responsible and that the people concerned must make their own individual claims.  Despite this he said on the radio the other night that the Department of Foreign Affairs were negotiating with the German company on behalf of the victims. I would like the Minister to clarify this point because there appears to be a contradiction in what he said.</P>
    <P>It would appear from what the <i>Sunday Times</i> has stated and from their research work into this matter that the <i>ex gratia</i> payment to these victims will be minimal.  We have a greater obligation than this to these people who through no fault of their own are victims of this great tragedy.  They trusted the directions and felt they had some security in purchasing a drug which was freely available over the counter.  I indict the Department of Health for negligence in this matter and for treating these people with complete indifference.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is sympathetic to these people but I think he should accept, first, full responsibility for the legal cost for these people.  We have <Col N="1565" /> no free legal aid in this country.  It has been pointed out that legal costs for these people is enormous.  Secondly, the Minister should make a declaration that medicines, hospitalisation and all surgical appliances will be supplied free for these victims, irrespective of the income of their families.  This should be for the rest of their lives because they will need continuous care, attention, artificial limbs and other appliances.  There is a moral obligation on us to provide these for them.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I would like to see the Government set up a trust fund similar to that provided by the British Government to assist with the financial burden involved in the welfare of these children for the rest of their lives.  This would not be a great burden on the State as we have spent money foolishly in the past.  It would be a great help to thalidomide children and other children disabled as a result of congenital abnormalities.</P>
    <P>The assistance we are looking for is not specifically for thalidomide children but was prompted by the thalidomide tragedy.  The Minister for Health should not state that he will ask the Government to set up a fund to provide for these children.  This would be a very humane gesture to these people.  We cannot solve the problems for them; we cannot restore limbs which have not grown or are deformed; we cannot restore normality to them but we can ease their burden, let them know there is national sympathy for them and we can ensure that there is no financial burden on them for the rest of their lives.  We should ensure that the welfare of these children is provided for under a proper trust.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister seriously to consider the points I have raised.  It should not be a party political issue. I also ask him to reconsider the question of passing the responsibility to the Department of Foreign Affairs. I would like him to state that he and his Department will accept full responsibility and that the Department of Foreign Affairs will only act as his agents in negotiating on his behalf. The cases should be tried in the Irish courts and there should be some <Col N="1566" /> means of having representatives of Chemie-Grünenthal subpoenaed to attend the Irish courts so that those cases could be resolved here.  The Minister should seek legal advice on this matter.  These people have enough tragedy in their lives without having to go to Germany where they have a serious language problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy O'Connell in urging the Minister to do something for these children.  The thalidomide disaster represents a human tragedy which is very hard to imagine.  It has meant that malformed babies were born and they have a life of handicap ahead of them.</P>
      <P>We are among the consumer countries in relation to many of these drugs.  We do not have&mdash;I am not in a position to question whether we can have&mdash;the means of applying proper standards.  It is very much a matter of trial and error.  In this unfortunate incident an omelette was made and it is very hard to unscramble that particular omelette.  The unfortunate people are there and they are the victims of something which went wrong.</P>
      <P>I would like to join with Deputy O'Connell in urging that we should not pass the buck from one Department to another.  We suffered, in relation to this, comparatively more than Britain.  There is a problem here and it should be a Government responsibility.  The Minister ought to take this matter up with the Government, get legislation, if necessary, or establish a fund and I am certain the people would support any such move.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the observations that have been made here tonight I want to say that I have already dealt with this matter in great detail in connection with a number of parliamentary questions. I do not know whether I am supposed to go over all the ground again but I have answered a great number of questions on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I would like to say that there are children born each year with severe congenital deformities apart <Col N="1567" /> from thaliomide.  There are blind and deaf children born each year, whose mothers did not take thalidomide. There are children born with deformed limbs.  I want to contradict what Deputy O'Connell said when he suggested that the characteristics of thalidomide deformities were entirely specific and entirely apart from any other deformities.</P>
    <P>I also awant to make it clear that the thalidomide drug at the time when it was being used was considered a very safe drug.  It is completely a hindsight sensationalist attitude on the part of Deputy O'Connell to suggest that the label had anything to do with the subsequent information as to its harmful effects.  The company stopped the distribution of thalidomide in December, 1961, within one month of the dangers being established.  Then the national drug advisory boards were formed both in Britain and in this country and greater steps are now taken to prevent the issue of drugs that have not been properly tested, although there will always be some cases where boards may perhaps not make a right decision, but so far as I know this has not happened.</P>
    <P>Do I have to go over again what we have been doing about it?  We received an offer of compensation by the German manufacturers of thalidomide which should apply to Irish children born with defects attributable to the drug.  We also issued advertisements inviting parents and others to furnish particulars of the cases for transmission to the manufacturers, and 84 parents replied to the advertisements.  We do not know how many of those will be admitted as being parents of children who suffered as a result of the intake of thalidomide prior to the birth of the child.</P>
    <P>Then we translated all the documents into English that were required relating to the claims and we circulated the translations to the claimants concerned, and we assisted in providing information to the voluntary association of parents involved in claims on behalf of their children.  Not all the parents belong to this association. There is a group of about 20 parents. The others apparently think they are <Col N="1568" /> able to pursue their claims without needing to belong to the association.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs are keeping in touch with events in Germany and I have to rely on them as to whether there is any purpose in their making any further representations in relation to the amount of compensation to be made available.  It is a fact in regard to the persons who have been recognised to have suffered from taking thalidomide and who had deformed children that the amount of compensation per child is just half in the case of German and Irish children of what it is in England.  I have asked the Department of Foreign Affairs to see if anything can be done in regard to this. I doubt very much if anything can be done.  The terms proposed under the German settlement are a capital payment varying from £130 to a maximum of £3,250 and a monthly pension of £13 to £60, depending in each case on the degree of severity.</P>
    <P>There are matters in connection with which we are in touch with the Department of Foreign Affairs and one is whether, due to the inflationary effects that are taking place, it would be better if the whole of the amount was paid in the form of capital.  I received representations from a representative of the 20 parents of these children asking me to approach the Minister for Finance in order that when the income becomes available it will not be subject to income tax.  I have also been approached to request the Minister for Justice to see that, if the compensation is made through the wards of court, the minimum of legal costs will be involved.</P>
    <P>This representation did not make any other request to me, except of course that if the Department of Foreign Affairs believed that they could secure better compensation terms from the German Government and the company concerned, they should do so.  We are always in touch with the Department of Foreign Affairs and I think they can do this work far better than my Department in this case.</P>
    <P>In regard to the treatment of these unfortunate children, they have been supplied with special artificial limbs; training has been given to the children <Col N="1569" /> in the use of the appliances, and schooling is being given, where special facilities are required, and then, of course, there is the question of vocational assessment and placement service where this is applicable.  I have had no complaints about the training or about rehabilitation or about the supply of appliances from anyone; nor have I had any complaint that those in the upper income group have had to pay too much, that the cost was burdensome to them.  It may be that in some cases those who are at the lower end of the upper income group were able to get a contribution from the health boards on a hardship basis which, of course, can be done in connection with very expensive medical or hospital services in the upper income group.</P>
    <P>As I have already told the House, I am considering whether there should be some form of disability assistance to the families where children suffered permanently from severe congenital defects. If this were to be done it would have to apply far beyond the thalidomide range of defects.  It would have to apply to families of all children who suffered from congenital defects and would have to be examined very carefully to see how we could operate such a scheme.  On a population, <i>pro rata</i> to the British Government scheme, the cost of a scheme <Col N="1570" /> of this kind would be of the order of £200,000.  Every year we have provided additional sums of one kind or another to help people in trouble.  It is simply a question of trying to do the best we can with the available financial resoures.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that if I thought the Department of Foreign Affairs were being lax either in not ensuring that the claims would be assessed and examined as rapidly as possible or in not taking any action which they should take in order to persuade the German company concerned that they ought to pay more compensation to Irish parents than to German parents, I would naturally make representations to them.  However, as the House must realise, it would be very difficult for the Department of Foreign Affairs to secure for the parents of these children more funds than the parents of German children will receive.  If it is to be said that the social services in Germany are superior to ours, then that is one reason why I am having the question of some form of assistance to parents, where they need it, provided, and I will make the decision about that as soon as possible.</P>
