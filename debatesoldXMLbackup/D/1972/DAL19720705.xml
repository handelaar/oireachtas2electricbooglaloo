      <P>I think it was agreed that at 11.30 a.m.  we would being the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  Unfortunately, we had to ask for this last night because our spokesman would not be ready until 11.30 a.m. We asked that Local Government be put in this morning for one hour to be followed by the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. If we continued with Local Government all day we could not finish what is on the Order Paper for today.</P>

      <P>The difficulty in taking the Finance Bill at 4 o'clock is that the Public Accounts committee are meeting today to complete their present business and conclude their work and they are scheduled to meet if necessary until 7.30 p.m.  Hopefully, it will not take that long but there could be a problem about that.  Perhaps this could be settled through the Whips in due course.</P>

      <P>The position is that I notified the particular problem of my side.  The other committee meets regularly at 4 p.m. and is known to do so. It would be unfortunate if the Dáil tried to take the Finance Bill, Committee Stage, in the absence of the two Opposition spokesmen on Finance.  I think some adjustment should be made. The Finance Bill is rather technical but I do not think it will be a very prolonged business.  I suggest the Whips should consult further on this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I spoke about some problems affecting housing and water schemes in County Monaghan and in that context I want to refer to the ESB.  I was glad to hear Deputy Dowling express his views last night in regard to the ESB.  The experience of the housing section of Monaghan County Council is similar to that described by Deputy Dowling.  If an old person, for example, applies for a mobile home, before the county council can proceed with the development of a site they must first consult the ESB and find what their terms are for providing a supply to the proposed site. This situation has come about because in the past we found that if an applicant provided a site and the council developed it, placed a mobile home on it and then applied to the ESB for connection, in most cases exorbitant figures were quoted, £400 or £500, for <Col N="660" /> connection, practically as much as the mobile home cost.  The Minister should ensure that some sort of agreement is arrived at with the ESB.  The ESB seem to be a law unto themselves. These small houses are very dangerous if they have not got ESB current.  We have had in our county, and this is not uncommon throughout Ireland, experience of mobile homes going on fire and the unfortunate occupants being burned.  This, I suggest, would not have happened if there had been an ESB supply.  It happens because people are using oil or gas stoves for cooking, or oil lamps.  If there had been an ESB connection these deaths would not have occurred.  The provision of electricity also delays the whole procedure of providing a person with a home.  We consult the ESB and it naturally takes some time to quote a price for connection.  If it is found to be, as it is in most cases, exorbitant another site must be found and another price got from the ESB.  This may have to be done a number of times before a suitable price is worked out. This has the effect of delaying the whole scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would request the Minister seriously to consider the problem of planning, ribbon development.  I admit that planning is very necessary, that one cannot permit all sorts of buildings to go up one after the other. However, if a farmer has land along a main road and his son, say, applies to erect a dwelling on a site provided by his father it is very unfortunate if that landowner's son cannot get permission to build a house there.  It is very unfortunate if the whole machinery of planning compels farmers' sons to leave rural areas and buy sites, already developed by councils or local bodies where planning permission is available, in, or adjacent to, urban areas.  If this is allowed to continue it will have the effect over a number of years of compelling many people, who would normally reside in the country, miles from towns, to move to towns for planning permission purposes and this will result in rural areas being denuded of population.  If it is necessary to prohibit people from making entrances on to main roads the Minister must consider <Col N="661" /> some scheme whereby money is available to make one entrance through property which is suitable for development thereby reducing the number of exits to the main road.  This is one of the big problems we are facing in Monaghan.  There must be some way around this.</P>
    <P>We also have problems of sewerage and pollution.  In Carrickmacross there is an old, open sewer running as a boundary to a new housing scheme with close on 200 houses, between council and private houses.  It runs a few yards from tennis courts and other recreation amenities and it finishes up in a lake.  Old sewers like this must be filled or some other method used for the disposal of sewerage.  This cannot be allowed to continue especially in a built-up area. It also leads to pollution.  Pollution seems to be becoming a bigger problem every day.  I fail to see why there is not some means of dealing with it.  If a person notices pollution, to whom can he turn for assistance?  I know of cases where fishing clubs and gun clubs have paid the Inland Fisheries Trust to kill off and take out all coarse fish; they have then stocked up rivers with trout and other fish and then pollution has occurred, coming perhaps from some factory upstream. To whom can such people turn for assistance?  There are so many bodies which appear to be dealing with pollution it is difficult to know to which one to turn.  From my experience there are very few people dealing with it effectively.  I know of a factory who were fined recently for polluting a river.  That factory did not give an undertaking that pollution would not occur in the future.  It would be far more satisfactory to have some method of dealing with pollution rather than imposing a fine on a factory and allowing them to continue polluting the river or lake.  I would not like anybody to think that I am opposed to industry and factories; a person who is opposed to pollution is not necessarily opposed to the growth of industry, because if there were proper planning in new factories pollution should not and would not arise.  In factories which have been <Col N="662" /> established for a long time, where methods of waste disposal are not available, there should be some means of compelling them to install some method of disposal or treatment of industrial waste.  I understand that grants are available from the IDA for such schemes but there should be a law to compel factories to treat industrial waste.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no co-ordination between various bodies such as the ESB, the gas companies and local government.  We see from time to time new streets and new roads being laid at great cost to everybody.  Within a few weeks we find compressors, jack hammers and workmen ripping up those new surfaces which can never be replaced in the same condition as they were before they were broken up. There should be consultation between those various groups and local government when a new road is being laid to see if the ESB or the gas company will require to dig it up again within a few weeks.  It would be better to wait until they completed their work before new roads were laid.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to something which affects County Monaghan and other Border counties.  It is in regard to a decision taken recently by the courts against the county council for malicious damage caused by explosions on Border roads. The Minister should ensure that local authorities are compensated for money which they must pay out to repair buildings and for damage caused.  I raised this matter some time ago and got assurances from the Ministers concerned that they were looking into the matter.  It is now about six months later and I have not noticed any move being made to alleviate the sufferings caused by those deeds along the Border.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister really understands the problem and the hardships caused in some of these areas.  This is caused to residents of this State by people outside the State.  There is one case in particular where great hardship was caused to two old aged pensioners living in a house a few yards from the Border.  Their house was severely <Col N="663" /> damaged and was left like that during the winter.  Those people live on the road and it is a shame that nothing has been done to help them.  They should not have to put up with the damage which has been caused.  Roofs have been damaged on many houses but this damage is easier to rectify.</P>
    <P>During the last war we had legislation whereby the county councils were in a position to repair the damage caused and recoup the cost from the Government.  I wonder why no legislation was brought in on this occasion, or why those people are allowed to remain living in this condition during the winter.  The Minister should explain why he has failed to take action in regard to this problem.  When Nelson Pillar was blown up the Dublin ratepayers were not asked to bear the cost. I suggest that the ratepayers in Border counties should not be asked to bear the cost of the repairs which have to be carried out on their property.  The Minister should state if it is his intention to indemnify the county councils against the cost of any damages which they have to repair.  I would ask the Minister to reply to the few points I have made, particularly regarding compensation for people along the Border who have had property damaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In looking at the Minister's brief with its vast amount of detail and very useful information one might almost refer to it as the &ldquo;Encyclopedia Hibernica.&rdquo; The great pity is that this is not circulated outside the House except through press reports and newspapers cannot possibly publish all of it.  It would give the people a much better understanding of the problems of local government and let them know what has been done to overcome them.  I know that no matter what the Minister says and how much the newspapers publish of the report we will always have people, in Dublin particularly, who will persist, when they are referring to the Dublin housing position, in stating that we have got 10,000 homeless families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For years we have contradicted this and have pointed out that Dublin Corporation have not even got 10,000 <Col N="664" /> applications for dwellings.  I say to Members of the House who persist in using this untrue statement that it is being used outside the country to blacken the name of this country.  All political parties in this House are tarred with this brush by the enemies of the country.  They point out the terribly miserable conditions under which those 10,000 homeless families live.  I would appeal to the agitators outside the House to think before they use this figure and to read the report of Dublin Corporation housing or the Minister's statements from time to time.  They will then get a true picture of what is being done for housing.</P>
    <P>This year we will spend £87 million on housing.  The Minister has the unique honour in that we have now built in the last year more dwellings than were ever built before.  At the same time I want to mention a few points which are important.  It should not be taken that there should be any complacency regarding the housing position all over the country, but particularly here in the city.  There are many factors in the housing situation which are difficult to overcome.  With the progress made over the last few years in Dublin and the rest of the country, our standards of housing compare very favourably with those of other European countries.  Other countries had not to clear off a backlog of slum dwellings.  There are only a small proportion of the old slum dwellings left now.  There is a problem of overcrowding in existing dwellings.  The target of 17,000 dwellings a year is a good one.  The problem of overcrowding will escalate unless we take steps to overcome the difficulties.  The population is rising and people are seeking a higher standard of housing.  The demand for houses will increase.  We must provide more houses.  Much misery is caused because families find themselves in bad housing conditions. It is bad for a young family to have to live in one room or in a private flat for which they are paying exorbitant rent. If they live with in-laws the situation may be difficult.  Human nature being what it is, it it hard for old people and young married couples with children to live together in harmony.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> We need more special dwellings for old people.  They have special difficulties and usually do not wish to be moved away from the areas in which they have spent most of their lives. The Minister might consider providing special houses for the aged in central city areas.  We should have a number of special dwellings for the old people.  These dwellings should have every modern amenity needed by the old.  The old people would be attracted to surrender houses which are too big for them and go to live in specially-designed chalets where they would have some supervision by a competent person like a nurse.  I do not want to see old people in institutions, but they should have supervision so that they will get attention immediately if they become ill at night.  Many old people live in houses on their own.  These houses could accommodate a family, but the old people naturally refuse to leave.  They do not want to be sent three or four miles away from their old habitat.  If there were attractive modern flats locally at very reasonable rents, they might be tempted to move to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine carefully the needs of the old.  There are various bodies such as the Catholic Housing Aid Society, the Methodist Church authorities, the Presbyterian Church authorities and others who are interested in this matter.  The Methodists have a scheme for the old. The Presbyterian Church have also opened a scheme for old people.  The Minister was present at the opening ceremony.  I am sure he was impressed by the high standards provided for the aged.  While each of these schemes is operated by church authorities they are not in any way sectarian.  The old people must have comfort, but we should try to attract them from houses into specially-designed old people's dwellings.  The Minister should take steps in regard to amenities for disabled people.  It can be a great handicap to a person already disabled if he has not got easy entry to his house.  I compliment the Minister on what has been done already in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is occasionally agitation about <Col N="666" /> the rents in local authority houses.  In Dublin city the corporation own over 55,000 dwellings.  This is a large number for any one authority to own. There is a purchase scheme which has been availed of to a great extent.  The rent problem could be solved by further encouraging tenants to buy their own houses.  It is good social philosophy for people to acquire some property.  The corporation scheme, although it is not perfect, is working well and should be accelerated.  People living in flats and houses which they do not want to buy sometimes complain about the high level of rents.  The rents scheme is initially a matter for the local authority.  Local authorities could help by giving greater relief to young couples with children.  If a man is earning good wages he can pay rent quite easily, but a man in the lower income group, with five or six children, is badly hit.  Greater allowance should be made by local authorities in cases where there are young children.  This is essential in our society at present.  People should not be penalised because they have large families.  We should show that we appreciate the importance of all the children in our community.</P>
    <P>Corporation tenants now pay rates. There are special problems about young couples and old people paying rates.  The Minister knows of these problems.  The rates burden may play a tremendous part in causing tension and unhappiness among young couples trying to purchase new houses.  They have a difficult job trying to find the deposit for a house.  I know that they get part-remission of rates for ten years.  The Minister should speed up the work of the inter-departmental committee on rates.  He should finalise, so far as he can, the proposals or suggestions in the White Paper on local authorities.  Rates, for thousands of families all over the country, cause tremendous problems.  I suppose we must have some form of rating system, but it must be remembered that the committee, in their first report, stated that the present system was inequitable and should be replaced.  I am sure the Minister and everyone else in the House will agree that this is true. <Col N="667" /> Therefore, we must ask ourselves: how are we going to ease this rates burden?  I want to mention in passing that the local authorities in Dublin Dún Laoghaire and County Dublin, and I am sure in other municipalities, have brought in a scheme for rates waiver particularly for pensioners and this is a tremendous boon.  However, the point is that this is being done at the expense of other ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I have suggested before, although it is not quite relevant to this Estimate but rather to the Health Estimate, that if the health costs could be taken off domestic ratepayers only, this would help.  I know this committee which the Minister has set up will present a good report on the rates system, but the time factor is very important indeed.  I would ask the Minister to try to hurry up the report in conjunction with the White Paper on Local Government.  An examination of the whole system of local government is needed.  While it has worked fairly well, there are obvious defects in it.  In the future you may well not get men or women to go into public life on a local level unless council are given greater power than they have at the moment.  Section 4 is probably the only effective weapon the local authority have, but notwithstanding a vote by the members under section 4 that the city manager or county manager should do a certain thing, it must still go to the Minister with that same city manager's or county manager's report before him.  In these days when there is so much talk about involving people in government, both at national and local level, this must be borne in mind when the new legislation on local government is being drafted. In any event, there must be a speeding up of the decision on the rating problem so that we can hold out some hope to those young couples who are buying their houses, or to the old person, for example, the widow whose husband, in what he thought was his wisdom, left her a house and thought that, if he should die, she would be quite safe from want.  This house has really become a burden on her now. She has to meet some frightful rates bills and, of course, should she decide <Col N="668" /> to take in paying guests she may well find her valuation increased because of that.  It is a vicious circle.</P>
    <P>For the urban dweller, the Minister might take a look at the legislation which derated agricultural holdings under £20 valuation.  There must be some class in the urban areas who compare with the small farmer under £20 valuation.  At the time the budget was introduced I expressed the hope that the urban dweller would be given some such concession.  I cannot find words adequate to stress the seriousness of the rates problem as it affects young couples and old people.</P>
    <P>Last year I had a question down to the Minister on the progress of the Dodder Valley drainage scheme.  The answer was quite consoling in that that scheme costing almost £3 million is now moving to its final stages.  There is another scheme which runs from Tallaght right down to Ringsend&mdash;and Ringsend comes into my constituency &mdash;and we have there already at the Pigeon House the huge sewage treatment works which, due to the growth of the city, the corporation had to install.  There is a great deal of talk today about pollution of waters and of the atmosphere, and I would like the Minister to ensure that the new treatment works at the Pigeon House will be adequate for the huge task to be carried out.  I would hate to think that in a few years time somebody would say: &ldquo;We thought at the time they were adequate.  Now we find they are not.&rdquo; Then the pollution would be increased not alone in the Liffey and the other rivers in the city but in the whole of the Irish Sea.  The sludge should be treated properly.  It is unfair that we should dump the sludge in the Irish Sea so that when the trade winds are blowing from west to east this matter would drift over to Liverpool or to the Welsh coast.  In regard to pollution no country is an island, and if the Welsh coast or the Lancashire coast is affected, then our eastern coast will also be affected.  I know the corporation are preparing these plans and I am sure the Minister's engineers will ensure that they are adequate, but I mention it so that there will be an added voice to the demand to ensure <Col N="669" /> that the new treatment works at the Pigeon House, which cost millions of pounds, will be adequate to serve the southern and south-western side of the city.</P>
    <P>A relevant matter in that connection is the condition of this city of ours, its untidiness and the litter problem.  It may be said that the Minister is not responsible for that and I do not suggest that, but as this is a debate on the Local Government Vote, it is the only opportunity I shall get to mention it.  If one looks around one sees that the streets are littered; that the ESB transformer boxes&mdash;which, with due credit to the ESB, are kept in very good condition&mdash;are covered with posters advertising anything from pop bands to protest groups.  In my own area there is a huge corporation dump which must end soon.  We just cannot go on reclaiming land which is in an amenity area.  I wonder when this is stopped how can we dispose of the refuse.  I have suggested before that the Corporation of Dublin and other corporations should be looking to the Continent where some cities have brought in massive means of disposing of rubbish by way in incineration.  While these incinerators destroy a vast amount of rubbish, they are left with a one-third residue, but at least that residue is not causing pollution.  This could be dumped somewhere where it would not be a source of pollution, and where it will not be an unsightly mass. We must get the co-operation of all the people in the war against litter.</P>
    <P>The Metropole building will be knocked down soon but, in the meantime, in our main street must we have a frightful looking display of vulgar posters?  Some of these posters are provided by commercial concerns who make a profit on them.  It seems that without let or hindrance they can destroy the appearance of our principal street.  One protest group showed some civic spirit recently.  They did not paste on the bills but used staplers. If they would take them down after the protest meetings are over this would be a help.  The vast majority of our citizens resent this aspect of their behaviour also.  If we are to preserve Dublin as a place in which people can <Col N="670" /> live, let us make sure that its appearance is not destroyed by litter louts and poster louts who have no regard for the community in which they live.</P>
    <P>I come now to fire precautions.  The Minister's statement covers every aspect of local government.  We have had serious fires in this city in recent times and, indeed, last night 30 people died in a fire in the neighbouring island. Certain standards of fire precautions are laid down but the human element enters into it.  Unless we are vigilant, especially where children and old people are concerned, we will have disastrous fires.  I am a member of an association which sent a memorandum to the Minister and we believe that, if it is adopted, we will have a force to educate people in fire prevention.  This is absolutely necessary even from an economic point of view.  Apart from the human lives lost, which is the most important aspect, we must remember the vast amount of property that is destroyed, for which somebody has to pay, and the people who are thrown out of work by fires.</P>
    <P>In Britain and most other countries they have associations like the one of which I am a member.  The law can deal very effectively with industrial safety.  Perhaps because of the fact that we are not an over-industrialised country we have not come to grips with the terrible catastrophies which can be caused by major fires.  It takes something like what happened in the city some months ago, or something like the fire in Dorset last night, to bring home to our minds that fires maim and kill people.  I hope the Minister will find time at an early date to examine the memorandum sent to this Department by my association on the question of fire prevention.</P>
    <P>The Minister has paid great attention to road safety.  It is a terrible reflection on each of us that we must face the possibility that 700 people may die on our roads this year.  It may be said that our roads are not good, but I am inclined to think that, while that may be a contributory factor, it is not the complete answer as to why we should have this frightful total each year.  In one European country where they have the best roads in the world, <Col N="671" /> they have a very high accident rate. It comes back to the behaviour of individuals on the road, whether they drive a car, or ride a bicycle, or are pedestrians. There is much indiscriminate parking of cars which may lead to accidents; not so much in the city where it is now very hard to park a car without being at a meter.  At weekends thousands of people go to the mountains to enjoy the fresh air.  Despite the fact that Dublin County Council provided good car parks, people who should know better park their cars at corners.  It is no wonder that we have a high accident rate because some drivers do not seem to care what they do.  The best driver in the world can have an accident.</P>
    <P>I do not want to start preaching but, apart from a legal obligation to drive with proper care, to park their cars properly, and to take every possible precaution to ensure that they will not injure their fellow men or themselves, people have a moral obligation also to remember that they may maim or kill their neighbours through carelessness.  Some time ago the Minister had safety slogans erected on the roads, and very attractive they were. I often wonder are road signs a distraction. If you are driving along and you see a rather attractive slogan you look up at it quickly, and perhaps a driver coming towards you has a look at the one on his side of the road at the same time.  Road signs, apart from direction signs, should be kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>We should also tackle the problem of what are called billboard alleys leading to cities or airports where there are frightful displays of posters advertising all kinds of goods.  You would think on some of the approach roads to Dublin that you were going into a shanty-town.  They are ruined by posters advertising all kinds of commodities. They are attractive only in their vulgarity.  I do not know why the planning authorities give permission for the erection of these things.  I think all such advertising signs should be removed from our main roads.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Cúis áthais dom an Bille seo a thabhairt ós chomhair na Dála.  Sé an cuspóir atá leis ná ceart vótála a thabhairt do ghach saoránach a bhfuil ocht mbliana déag slán aige.  Má ritheann Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann an Bille roimh saoire an tsamhraidh, agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh siad amhlaidh, beartaíonn an Rialtas an tairiscint a chur faoi bhráid na ndaoine ag reifreann a tionólfar i rith an fhómhair.  Táim cinnte go gcuirfidh Teachtaí fáilte roimh an mBille agus is léir ón méid atá ráite cheana ag Teachtaí ó gach pháirtí go bhfuil muid go léir ar aonghuth faoin gceist seo.

      <P>The Constitution confers on every citizen who has reached the age of 21 years the right to vote at Dáil and Presidential elections and referenda. This Bill proposes to amend the Constitution by reducing the voting age to 18 years.  Introduction of this Bill represents the first step in the process by which the wishes of the people in relation to the voting age will be ascertained.  If both Houses of the Oireachtas see fit to pass the Bill before the summer recess, the issue will be put to the people at a referendum in the autumn.  It is my sincere hope that the people will approve of the proposal and indeed, I have every confidence that they will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a very simple one, consisting basically of a single section.  It provides for the amendment of Article 16.1.2º of the Constitution by the substitution of &ldquo;eighteen years&rdquo; for &ldquo;twenty-one years&rdquo;.  This Article deals with elections to Dáil Éireann but because the Constitution indicates that every Dáil elector has the right to vote at an election for President and <Col N="673" /> at a referendum, the amendment will reduce the age for Presidential elections and referenda as well as for Dáil elections.</P>
    <P>If the people at the referendum enact this Constitution Amendment Bill, it will be necessary to introduce a short Bill to make the necessary consequential changes in the electoral law. Deputies will recall that an undertaking was given in this House that the voting age for local government elections would also be dealt with in that Bill. I can assure the House that this commitment will be honoured.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me at this stage to advance arguments in favour of lowering the voting age.  These have already been put very ably and convincingly by Deputies on all sides of the House.  This is one question on which we are all agreed and I would ask Deputies to unite in urging the people to come out and vote in favour of this worthwhile proposal on referendum day.</P>
    <P>This is a small Bill but it is important and, indeed, historical because it proposes to widen the parliamentary franchise which has remained unaltered since the early days of this State.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): As I was saying, this party feel entitled to welcome the Bill because it is as a result of a campaign commenced by this party several years ago calling for the involvement of the younger people in our Parliamentary democracy that consideration was given to the proposal, consideration which has now ended with the introduction of this Bill.  For the benefit of Deputy O'Donovan I might point out that at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis in 1965 a resolution was passed calling for an alteration in the electoral laws so that persons who had reached the age of 18 would be given the vote.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan has just claimed that it was part of the Labour Party's policy at the last general election that the voting age should be 18.  I agree with that but I do not think that Deputy O'Donovan will quarrel with me if I claim the right to put it on the record of the House that the trail was blazed at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis in 1965.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Indeed, it is not the first time that policies initiated by the Fine Gael Party have subsequently been taken up by the Government and enacted.  As I say, it was at the 1965 Fine Gael Ard-Fheis that this matter was first mooted. It is correct to say that the matter was considered fairly fully by the Committee on the Constitution set up in 1967. That was two years subsequent to the Ard-Fheis.  It is a fact that arguments <Col N="675" /> were put forward then in favour of reducing the voting age to 18 years.  The first argument was that, as a general proposition maturity in all matters was now reached at an earlier age.  That must be accepted.  It was also pointed out by members of the 1967 committee who supported the change that at 18 years of age persons could enlist in the Army, pay taxes, get married, and that it was inconsistent that they should not have the right to vote.  Other arguments put forward in favour of the proposal that persons of 18 years of age be given the right to vote were that they would become more interested in the political affairs of the country and would become involved to a greater extent in the running of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Of course, he was not the only member. There is nothing controversial about this.  I am adopting a certain line here because I shall make a proposal later on.  I am not rehashing the arguments for the sake of rehashing them. I would be obliged if the Minister would bear with me and let me follow the line that I want to follow.</P>
      <P>Certain arguments were put up then against the proposed change, the major one of which is not now valid.  The major argument then was that certain highly respected democracies still held that persons should be 21 years of age before being entitled to vote.  That has all been changed.  Since then, not alone has the Minister followed the advice of the Fine Gael Party, but the United States of America and Great Britain have also taken our advice and have reduce the age limit considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments that were valid in 1965 and 1967 about young people maturing at an earlier age are infinitely more valid now because in the five years since 1967 there has been a complete transformation in the <Col N="676" /> approach towards youth and, indeed, in the approach of youth to the community in general and to the world in general.  In the last five years youth has claimed the right to emancipate itself and has made its thinking felt in many walks of life.  Not alone has youth moved in that direction but the community has recognised youth.</P>
    <P>We now find students taking their places on the governing bodies, the controlling bodies, the administrative councils, of universities and I read recently that in some of the councils of Maynooth College students are now being given a say, a seat, and are playing their part in the administration of the college.  That in itself would appear to me to demonstrate that things have moved very quickly, that there has been a complete change both in the approach of youth to the affairs of nations and in the approach of communities in general towards youth. Therefore, I say this Bill is several years overdue.</P>
    <P>It is also desirable, as I pointed out on a previous occasion, that teenagers should be given a say in the election of a parliament and the formation of a government because unless they are given a platform, unless there is communication between the establishment and young people, it is obvious that young people will resort to other means to put their points of view across and to have their voices heard. Unfortunately, in the age in which we are living we have too much of the protest, too much of the unlawful demonstration.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill is a move in the right direction and that it will provide a platform for youth or at least that it will involve young people of this country in the serious business of electing a parliament and of forming a government.  Let us turn to the Constitution and see exactly what we are doing in this Bill and what we are leaving undone.  Article 16 (1) lays down that every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of 21 years and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by the Constitution or by law shall be eligible for membership of Dáil Éireann. Article 16 (2) states:</P>
    <P>Every citizen without distinction <Col N="677" /> of sex who has reached the age of twenty-one years who is not disqualified by law and complies with the provisions of the law relating to the election of members of Dáil Éireann, shall have the right to vote at an election for members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is the latter sub-clause we are altering. We are proposing to change the law so that the age limit of 21 set down in that sub-clause of Article 16 shall be reduced to 18 years.  This means, in effect, that when the law has been changed a person of 18 years will be entitled to vote, but we are leaving sub-clause (1) stand which means that although a person of 18 years will be entitled to vote, he will not be entitled to offer himself for election to this House or to take a seat in this House.</P>
    <P>I think we have reached the stage when we should go the whole hog and amend sub-clause (1) of Article 16 as well as the second sub-clause and confer on all citizens of this country who have reached the age of 18 years the right to elect Members to this House and also to offer themselves for election and to take seats in this House.  In doing that we would be no more than consistent because if one refers to the Constitution one will see that the 1937 document was clearly consistent in prescribing the same qualifying age for the vote as for membership of the House, and although in some other countries there are different ages for qualifying for the vote and for membership of parliament, on the other hand there are countries where people are entitled to vote at a lower age than 21 and to take their seat at the same age.</P>
    <P>One country is Switzerland, a country regarded as stable with a stable government, a highly respected nation. I do not know for how long, but there citizens are entitled to vote and to sit in parliament at 20 years of age.  As we know, a great many other countries up to the present&mdash;Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Great Britain, Finland, Norway&mdash;have the qualifying age for voting at 21 and the taking of a seat in parliament at 21.  The point I want to put across is that in the great majority of countries at the present <Col N="678" /> time the qualifying age for voting and for membership is 21 years.</P>

Up to a short time ago, like ourselves, they had a similar age for voting and for taking a seat in parliament, and that age was 21 years. Why we have to wait until other countries make a change I do not know.  We on this side were advocating in 1965 that the voting age should be reduced to 18 years but the Government did nothing about it until they got the example from Great Britain and, perhaps, the US.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Government here are taking exactly the same step as has been taken across the water, and not one step further.  I believe we should lead the way.  Indeed, we should follow the example of Switzerland and a number of other countries and give the right to sit in parliament at the same age as the right to vote.  I cannot see anything inconsistent in that.  On the contrary, I can see a great deal of consistency in it.  It does not seem to be consistent to say that, while a person shall have the right to exercise the franchise, he shall not have the right to become a member of parliament.  If he is entitled to <Col N="679" /> play the one role, then he should be equally entitled to play the other.  If the Minister does some research he will find that there are quite a few countries in which there is one age for voting and another age for membership of parliament; he will also find that there are quite a few countries where the voting age is lower than 21 and the sitting age is also lower than 21.</P>
      <P>We should be progressive.  If we do as I suggest, I believe we will encourage young people to become actively involved in politics, in the art of government and in the democratic institutions of the State.  Every argument that can be put forward in favour of reducing the voting age can be put forward with equal force in favour of reducing the qualifying age for sitting in parliament.  This may appear to some a startling departure; it is no such thing and there is no likelihood of these benches being occupied by large numbers of people under the age of 21.  That is not likely to happen. There will be a cross-section of the entire electorate.  The important thing is that those who have the right to vote should also have the right to offer themselves for election.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposal will confer the vote on something in the region of 140,000 extra people.  That is the best estimate I can get.  It will increase the Dublin city electorate by something like 9½ per cent and the electorate in the rest of the country by something like 11 per cent.  This vote will be spread all over the country.  It will not be concentrated in any particular constituencies. There is no likelihood, therefore, of our getting what some might consider a completely immature assembly.  There will be a cross-section. The argument that a person of 18 pays taxes, enlists in the Army or gets married has been used in favour of reducing the voting age; it can be used with equal force in favour of reducing the age for entry to this House.  A very simple amendment would achieve what I want.  All the Minister need do is write into subsection (1) &ldquo;eighteen years shall be substituted in subsections (1) and (2)&rdquo; of the text.  That will achieve what I want to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> The time has passed when we should blindly follow the lead of our immediate neighbour and we should make up our minds on the advisability of changing the law and, if we come to the conclusion that it should be changed, we should change it in a way that is in the best interests of this country.  I believe the legal majority age will soon be reduced.  At the moment a person is not legally regarded as being of full age until he reaches 21.  It would be interesting to know when that magic age was fixed. It was probably hundreds of years ago. The Minister for Justice at the time, Deputy B. Lenihan, when introducing a Bill dealing with the right to make wills some years ago, certainly considered reducing the age for making a will to 18, but I do not think he did anything about it.  The trend at the moment is towards reducing this magic age of 21 as a qualifying age in many respects.  A man under 21 years of age, who meets with a serious road accident, has to sue in his father's name or he must have a next friend.  There is no obligation on the next friend to support his wife and family, if he happens to be married.  If he wins damages, the money must be lodged in court until he reaches the age of 21.  I believe that in a few years time the age qualification will be reduced from 21 to 18 years.</P>
    <P>In putting forward this proposal I am not advocating a radical change in the Constitution which would provide the parliament with 50 per cent or 75 per cent of its members in the 18 to 21 age group.  For many years the qualifying age has been 21.  Yet, it is news when Deputy Bruton is elected at 23 years of age.  To those more conservative people who think that there would be a risk involved in electing people to this House who are between the ages of 18 and 21, I would say that there is no risk but that it is desirable that there be members of parliament in this age group.  However, it is extremely unlikely that there will be an appreciable number of persons within this age group in the House for some considerable time yet.  I would ask the Minister to do some research for the purpose of ascertaining how many people between the ages of 21 and 25 <Col N="681" /> have been elected to this House during the past 50 years.  He would find that the number was small.  The Minister may say that if that is the case there is no necessity for a change because it would not be availed of.  I would say that he would be wrong there too. My purpose in putting forward this proposal is to give to young people who, as everybody knows, are maturing at an earlier age now than in the past, a sense of responsibility, to let them know that they are treated as mature people and to encourage them to play a part in the democratic machinery for electing representatives to this House. This, then, is a sound amendment.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that it will be only a short time until the age for legal maturity will be reduced from 21 to 18.  It is high time that we stopped taking sections of Acts of Parliament from the parliaments of other countries and began thinking for ourselves.  We should make up our own minds on the merits of changes such as the one proposed here and we should do so in the light of conditions prevailing in this country.</P>
    <P>I propose on Committee Stage of the Bill to table an amendment on the lines I have indicated by including subsection (1) of section 1 of Article 16. I welcome the Bill in so far as it goes but it is a few years overdue.  It is in line entirely with Fine Gael policy but I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to the point I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the change proposed in this Bill.  It will bring this country into line with the minimum voting age at parliamentary elections now in operation in Northern Ireland, in the UK, in Germany and in Luxembourg. I am pleased in particular that it will bring about a uniformity in the parliamentary franchise minimum voting age in both parts of this country.  We expect our young people to join the Army at 18 years of age and to risk their lives for the security of the State.  People of that age may be sent to prison for breaking the law. A young man or woman may be paying <Col N="682" /> their full share of income tax at 18 and also their full share of social insurance.  They may purchase intoxicating liquor.  They may drive cars. Many people at that age are already married and there are many thousands of Irish women who, at 19 or 20 are rearing children.  Yet, we do not give these people the simple democratic privilege of voting in an election. There are very many other obvious reasons why this measure should obtain widespread national support.</P>
      <P>If, for example, young people are considered old enough to look after the aged and the sick in our community, they should certainly be entitled to vote.  Also, if they are old enough at 18 to undergo training as airline pilots, surely they are old enough to vote in parliamentary elections.  I would point out to the House that in practice the 140,000 young citizens who will be put on the national voting register as a result of this measure will, on average, be about 20 years of age before they exercise the right to vote.  I recall that I was more than 23 years of age before I voted in a general election. Only a small number would be voting at the age of 18 or 19.</P>
      <P>It is important that the people of the country as a whole should appreciate the feudalistic background to the decision arrived at originally to permit parliamentary votes at 18 years of age.  That was laid down originally as far back as 1696.  It was in section 7 of the Parliamentary Election of Members Act of that year.  It is rather a poor reflection on our society that it has taken until 1972 to change that Act.  It was laid down that no person under the age of 21 would be allowed to vote in a parliamentary election.  The age of 21 seems to have been based on an old Anglo-Saxon system whereby a young merchant's son became of age as soon as he could count properly; a peasant's son became of age as soon as he was 15 and the son of a knight became of age at 21.  By all accounts, that is how the age of 21 was decided on for parliamentary elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are not many sons of knights in this House at present or on the parliamentary register and in that context it is overdue that we should change <Col N="683" /> the legislation.  It is also undeniable that young people today mature at a much earlier age.  Their incomes are increasing rapidly and their increased spending power has given them a much greater responsibility in the community. I think it is also true that young people now, with what one might call the educational emancipation which has occurred in the past few decades, are showing much greater awareness and interest in public affairs, in political affairs and in Dáil Éireann itself.  It is, therefore, eminently fair that they should be given the democratic means to express their particular interest.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the 18-21 population group is subject to greater pressures than any other in our community and no segment of our population is more uncertain about its domestic, financial, legal and political status.  This is universally true.  The community at large are continually exhorting the 18-21 age group towards responsibility and encouraging them to take the fullest possible advantage of higher educational opportunities.  Simultaneously, they are being coaxed, cajoled, blackmailed by the commercial world now only too well aware of the enormous purchasing power of this age group.  In many ways, and rather superficially, other sections of the community and other age groups frequently attack the 18-21 age group because it allegedly fails to live up to the conventional norms of behaviour and adult attitudes.  We expect a great deal more from our young people than ever before and, if so, we should place responsibility on them in the form of parliamentary franchise.</P>
    <P>Unless this is done willingly and openly by the community at large in a referendum in October&mdash;and I hope every adult citizen will vote in that referendum&mdash;the genuine eagerness and concern of young people in respect of political issues could very easily be frustrated, lacking the means of self-expression socially and electorally, and this could induce cynicism and distrust among young people.  Our society has brought about a great change in the social consciousness of young <Col N="684" /> people particularly through educational emancipation.  The next stage is political emancipation of young people and it is right that we should give this ultimate recognition to their new status and give them the opportunity to choose their own leaders and initiate control over their own affairs.</P>
    <P>I am sure we now see the anomaly in our parliamentary structure whereby a person aged 18 will have the right to vote in parliamentary elections but cannot become a Deputy or Senator or local councillor until he or she is 21 years of age and cannot stand for the Presidency until the age of 35 years. We have rather different age groups of political responsibility.  Our party is at present considering the position in relation to this Bill as to whether we should put down an amendment to enable young people to become local councillors at the age of 18, and stand as candidates for the Dáil and Seanad also at that age.  We should consider this matter in the light of the anomalies I have pointed out.</P>
    <P>Many people seem to assume rather superficially that because we have votes at 18 automatically we shall have a large body of young radical, utterly progressive persons either entering Leinster House or voting in the constituencies. There is a great deal of fresh political idealism in young persons but it is also true that many, in fact, do not vote in parliamentary elections.  This has been shown in the UK elections.  Young people are very mobile and although on the register may not necessarily vote and a high proportion of them do not.  It is also true, and it has been shown to be particularly true in Britain, that many, notwithstanding the alleged progressiveness, vote in accordance with family patterns, and vote as their parents voted.  I state these reservations but we welcome the fact that we shall have an extra 3,000 to 4,000 electors in the three or four seat constituencies or an increase in these constituencies of from 5 per cent to 7 per cent on the register.</P>
    <P>Finally, I urge that there should be further consideration by the House of the amendments urgently required in parallel legislation.  In Britain, not only <Col N="685" /> was the parliamentary franchise introduced at 18 but they also brought in the Family Law Reform Act, 1970.  It is a bit ironic that we give votes at 18 and, at the same time, if a person wants to sue for damages arising out of a car accident he must sue through his father.  There is the question of the entitlement of a person between 18 and 21 to take out a house mortgage. There is the question of owning a house at 18.  If you give people the parliamentary franchise, why should they not be in a position to own a house?  Should they not have the right to give jury service, to enter into contract with the growth of hire purchase <i>et cetera?</i> Surely it is ridiculous that a person can vote at 18 and yet cannot make a will?  Many people between 18 and 21 are married.  Should they not have the right to have a passport? These are matters which should be the subject of extensive family law reform legislation which I hope will go through this House in the near future.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will get a speedy passage through the Dáil and Seanad and that we will have the referendum in September/October.  I hope the new electoral register for 1973-74 will contain the 140,000 new parliamentary citizens.  I extend a welcome to them and a welcome to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to place on the records of the House the fact that the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party and the whole structure of the Fianna Fáil national movement is behind this Bill.  It has received extensive discussion throughout the length and breadth of our land and at all levels of our organisation&mdash; cumann, comhairle ceanntair, comhairle dáil cheanntair, national executive and right up to the parliamentary party.  I want to assure the nation that we are whole heartedly behind this Bill. Here we have an opportunity of giving young people a stake in the community, giving them something to which they are entitled.  One of the most important entitlements of any citizen is the franchise and the exercise thereof.  If people are being asked to pay taxes at 18, and, indeed, younger, if they are being asked to take on the <Col N="686" /> responsibility of marriage, if they are being asked to join the Army, the Garda, <i>et cetera,</i> then they should be granted this entitlement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond, who represents the same constituency as I do, said that the question of entitlement to stand for election as Teachta Dála at 18 should be included in the Bill.  I would urge him to take the view that we should go to the country on a single issue and that issue should not be confused with other matters of the nature he suggested.  I agree that there is a certain anomaly in the concept of votes at 18 and young people not being entitled to seek election at that age.  However, my information is that in all other parliaments the general view is taken that people should have votes at 18 but not the opportunity to seek election.  I do not accept that this is a good precedent.  I think we must make our own rules.</P>

It is an important issue from <Col N="687" /> the point of view of the 100,000 people who will come on the electoral roll if this is passed.  We as Deputies will not be entitled to vote in the Dáil on this. It is the people who will decide this. I would urge those who believe people should have a vote at 18 to come out and lend their support to the political parties.  This involves a commitment. I would strongly urge those who support this Bill to align themselves with the political parties.  They may not be in favour of a particular political party but on this issue the three main political parties will be at one.  The young people should get out and show that they are as anxious for the vote for themselves as we are to give it to them.</P>
      <P>Only two months ago I had the pleasure of seeing the Wisconsin Primary where Hubert Humphrey was unexpectedly beaten by Senator George McGovern.  Having been with the campaign for almost a week in the Humphrey camp, on the one hand, and in the McGovern camp on the other, it was absolutely thrilling to see the thousands of young people who followed the McGovern camp.  This has now turned into a landslide.  It was wonderful to see people between the ages of 14 and 25, maybe 30, out and about knocking at doors and so on.  I would ask the young people of this country to give the same commitment to this proposal and to urge people to support them.  I just introduced the Wisconsin primary as an aside because it was the beginning of the McGovern landslide towards the democratic convention.</P>

It was interesting to note the difference between the support Hubert Humphrey had and that which George McGovern had in that context. Senator Humphrey had not got young people supporting him in his election drive to any great extent.  As I say, this was the beginning of the McGovern drive towards what we assume will be his election at the democratic convention in Miami next week.  However, maybe Mr. Daly, the Mayor of Chicago, may have something to say about that.  I am not entering into the arena of American politics.</P>

      <P>It still is but we have to adjust our cloth according to our measure.  In the early 1930s there was one situation.  We are living in a different era now and this is another reason why we should support votes <Col N="689" /> at 18.  I do not intend in any way to be critical of those times.  On the contrary, those people made a tremendous contribution. People are more emancipated nowadays.  The important thing is to give these young people a stake in society.  The final stake, as I see it, is the exercise of the franchise, to say what government they will have or what government they will not have.  If they do that, they will be doing a good job for themselves and for the country generally.</P>
      <P>I agree that young people can be impatient of the wisdom of the old but that is reasonable.  Young people are inclined to go through rather than around a situation sometimes to the detriment of the final conclusion which they seek.  This is another aspect of the problem of the impatience of the young about which I have been speaking.  My main reason for speaking very briefly so as to let the Minister in, I hope, is that the Fianna Fáil national movement is totally behind the idea of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>

      <P>If this cross-talk would cease for a moment I should like to say a few words.  I said on the Local Elections Bill, and I want to repeat it now, that it was grossly unfair to tax by way of income tax the young people of 17 and 18 years and not give them a vote.  We all know that the American revolution was fought on the principle of no taxation without representation.  As an example, let me cite the case of a young lad of 17 years.  He had a very large income but could not assign portion of it because he was only 17 years.  He was one of a family of 11 and the father's income was only about £12 a week.  Anybody over 21 can assign some of his income but this young lad of 17 years could not assign any of it to a brother or sister so that he could get rid of this awful income tax liability which amounted to several hundred pounds a year.  He should have been entitled to do this the same as any wealthy person is entitled to do it.  This is an example of taxation without representation.</P>
      <P>I hope that when the young people get the vote they will get the ordinary civil rights they should have had long ago.  It is also true that our party made the most fuss about this.  Deputy Fitzpatrick claimed that it was Fine Gael.  It reminds me somewhat of Deputy Garret FitzGerald's suspicion of the Prisons Bill on which he made a long speech.  His suspicion was just talk because when it came to voting on it he voted for it as did all the other members of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party in opposition is one thing.  They are the progressive party but the minute they get into office all the progressiveness is sacrificed for the benefit of the property-owning classes.  I will define it that way.  The Government are very much in favour of the property-owning classes and we take it that the Government are not really in favour of people under 21 years of age.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donovan has his own ideas about government and they are very different from those of the Government.  Let us leave it at that.  I am certainly no fascist but there is a fascist element in both big parties.  The Minister and his advisers are well aware that if we give votes at 18 years the vote will not be exercised by the bulk of people until they are 20 or 21 years of age.  When votes were given in England at 21 years it was thought they were the flapper votes.  Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned Switzerland, a country in which you could become a member of parliament at 18.  Switzerland was quoted as being one of the most progressive countries, yet it is only recently that women got the vote there.</P>

That will still not prevent people from having their first vote at 24 or 25 years of age.  I hope that young people will come out and make the case for themselves if we implement this provision.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the House for the welcome given to the Bill.  Several reasons why it is a good <Col N="694" /> Bill have been enumerated, and why it is good to extend the franchise to people between the ages of 18 and 21 who are at present excluded from voting in elections.  I do not wish to deal with the reasons again.  They were dealt with by the 1967 Committee on the Constitution and on a number of other occasions in this House.  They are good and valid reasons.</P>
      <P>I have always strongly favoured the granting of the vote to persons of 18 years and upwards.  I am privileged to be the Minister introducing this Bill. Efforts have been made by Fine Gael and Labour speakers to try to claim some credit for the introduction of this Bill.  I wish to point out to the Deputies on the Opposition benches that, so far as I am concerned, I indicated my own feelings on this matter as far back as 2nd July, 1970, when I stated in the House that I was strongly in favour of granting the right to vote at 18.  On 9th March, 1971, I formally announced that the Government were in favour of the age reduction.  I fail to see how the debate last week on the Local Elections influenced the introduction of this Bill as Deputy O'Donovan tried to imply.</P>

      <P>One of the strongest reasons which influenced my thinking in regard to the reduction of the voting age from 21 to 18 was my personal experience as a TD in dealing with various constituency problems.  I was impressed by the large number of young people under the age of 21 who were married and who, in many cases, had a child or even two children, and who were living in very bad housing conditions and paying exorbitant rents for that accommodation.  These young people had a personal interest in decisions that local and central authorities made, especially in regard to housing. I felt it was strange that these people who were so dependent on the decisions of elected representatives on the local authorities and in the Dáil and Seanad did not have any say in the election of the people making decisions which would greatly affect their lives. They should have the right to go and <Col N="695" /> cast their votes and decide on whom they wished to represent them on these bodies.  There are many reasons why I would urge the people when the opportunity is presented to them&mdash;and it is expected to be in the autumn&mdash;to come out in large numbers and to give a satisfactory result to this referendum, an overwhelming majority in favour of the amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan, speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, made an effort to show how that party had in some way influenced the Government decision.  The Deputy gave the impression that Fine Gael were always in favour of granting votes at 18.  The Fine Gael Party participated with other parties in two coalition Governments, but they did not avail of these opportunities to introduce such a change in our Constitution and electoral laws.  We will be able to judge Fine Gael sincerity in this matter at the time of the referendum when we can see for ourselves how they act in putting this question before the people.  I have only to remind Deputy Fitzpatrick that they will certainly want to put up a better show than they did in the recent referendum, when they were very scarce on the ground&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a point at which I am rather surprised, but if I am misquoting him <Col N="697" /> he can correct me.  I think he said there was a complete transformation in the youth of Ireland, and went on to indicate what he meant by this, that now they were taking their place on the governing bodies in universities and in other such places of decision-making where they have not played a part before.  He tried to give the impression that the youth were changing. I am surprised at that, because that is not the way I see the situation. I do not think it is the youth at all that have changed; it is the elders who have changed and who have given them this place.  The youth have always shown that they were interested in national affairs.  In nearly every revolution carried out throughout the world where major change has been brought about the youth have played a very important and vital part.  We need only go back to the events in our own country in 1916 to see the part that youth played in it.</P>

      <P>Previous generations had denied them the opportunity and we are giving it to them now.  On this question of the age for membership of the House which Deputy Fitzpatrick has now introduced, I think it is significant that, although this question of the voting age has been discussed here on a number of occasions, not one Deputy until now has referred to it in any of the debates that have taken place.  Again I doubt the sincerity of Deputy Fitzpatrick on this question of reducing the age for membership of Dáil Éireann.  Is he speaking on behalf of the whole Fine <Col N="698" /> Gael Party on this matter or, as I suspect, is he just throwing in a red herring to see what the Minister will do?  He went on to try to make a case for this by quoting countries like Switzerland where he said the voting age was the same for sitting as a Deputy and for voting in the elections. Of course, the voting age there is 20.</P>

We are proposing in this Bill to grant votes at 18 in Dáil and presidential elections and referenda, and we have indicated our intention to extend that to local authority elections if the referndum is carried by the people.  In other words, we are prepared to implement the wishes of the people.  If it is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to votes at 18 we shall also grant it for local elections.  What I want to ask Deputy Fitzpatrick is: are the Fine Gael Party now asking that 18 year olds be given the right to stand as candidates in elections and to sit in the Dáil here as TDs?

Is there any reason why we should go to the four corners of the earth looking for precedents?  Have we no minds of our own?  Let us hear the arguments against it in conditions prevailing here.  As I said, there is far too much of going over to Great Britain when they pass an Act of Parliament, taking a section out of it&mdash;they do not even have to redraft it&mdash;and sticking it in here. It is good enough for us ten years after it has been done there.</P>

I can give some examples to contradict the impression which Deputies tried to convey that I was surprised that this point was brought up at all.  I have studied it on a number of occasions and I am quite satisfied that what we are doing <Col N="701" /> is right: to introduce a Bill on voting only.  In the UK, where the voting age is 18 years, they did not reduce the age for membership of parliament to 18 years, as the Deputy suggested.</P>

In the UK the age for voting is 18 years, and the age for membership of parliament is 21 years.  In France it is 21 years for voting, and 23 for membership of parliament.  In the Federal Republic of Germany it is 18 years for voting, and 21 years for membership of parliament.  In Denmark it is 20 years for voting and 21 years for membership of parliament.  In the United States it is 18 years for voting, and 25 years for membership of the House of Representatives and 30 years for membership of the Senate.  In Italy you can vote at 21 years and over, but you cannot be a member of parliament unless you are 25 years or over.  In Sweden you cannot vote unless you are 21 years, and you cannot be a member of parliament unless you are 25 years.</P>

      <Col N="702" /> The Deputy says my figures are out of date, but they certainly are not. The mistakes have all been made by the Deputy.  He said that in Norway one could be elected to parliament under 21 years.  My information does not confirm that.  You must be 21 years of age to be elected to the Norwegian Parliament but you can vote at 20 years or over.  I have listed enough countries to show the thinking in other parts of the world, and to show that we are not unusual here. There is nothing terribly anomalous in having a lower voting age than the age for membership of parliament.  I have dealt with that in sufficient detail.</P>

      <P>I often heard it.  On the question of the European Parliament, a draft convention submitted by the Parliament to the Council of Ministers about ten years ago suggested a minimum voting age of 21 years and a minimum age of between 25 and 30 years for election to the parliament.  These proposals have not yet been accepted by the Council, which is the decision making body. The only reason I am quoting those figures is to show that here again the thinking was that there should be a lower voting age than the minimum age for membership.  I know that a resolution has since been adopted to reduce the 21 years to 18 years for national elections.  It was not proposed to reduce the age for membership to anything lower than what was originally suggested.  There is nothing unusual or anomalous in what we will have if and when this Bill is passed, and the referendum is passed, and the electoral law is changed to provide for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the age of majority and the legal limitations imposed by it which were listed by some Deputies, this is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  I am sure he will consider the points that were made quite legitimately here.  We are modernising our franchise law and we look forward to the full support of the community when they get the opportunity <Col N="703" /> to vote on this Bill.  If the House deems it proper to pass it and, if the Seanad pass it before the summer recess, I hope that will be some time in the autumn.</P>

      <P>In page 8, lines 16 and 17, after &ldquo;participation in which&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, in respect of units first issued after the commencement of this section,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage discussion an approach was made to me by one of our insurance companies, Irish Life, who had taken over a trust, the Shamrock Trust.  They pointed out that participation in trusts of that nature can only be obtained now by effecting a life assurance policy.  When the company was taking over the unit trust originally it was open to non-policy holders and, as a result, the scheme they now operate includes some unit holders who have not got an assurance policy.  Arising from the doubt, as they saw it, as to whether the scheme qualified under section 6 (4), as amended on Committee Stage, for exclusion from the scope of the Bill, it was considered advisable to amend the section to leave the matter beyond any doubt.  This is why I am suggesting the insertion of the words &ldquo;in respect of units first issued after the commencement of this section&rdquo;. My understanding at the time was that that was acceptable to the spokesman on behalf of the leading Opposition party.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after line 48, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e) In considering the granting of an exemption, the Minister shall have regard to the general content of the publication exempted, with particular reference to papers dealing mainly in financial matters.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister is in some agreement with this amendment. There was discussion on this in the Seanad and in the Dáil on Committee Stage.  Most people were aware of the danger of what are sometimes referred to as quality papers, papers of high quality content, ceasing to circulate here if the section were enforced as drafted.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment in Deputy Donegan's name.  I think the Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would be willing to go some of the way towards meeting Deputy Donegan on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw the Deputy's point of view and I endeavoured to convey at Committee Stage that it was my intention under subsection (2) (a) of this section to cover the ground that Deputy Donegan was anxious to have covered.  Deputy Donegan asked me to have regard to the views expressed by him.  I indicated that subsection (2) (a) allowed the Minister to meet the requirements that he was anxious to build in by the insertion of this amendment. The amendment seeks to insert that in considering the granting of exemption the Minister shall have regard to the general content of the publication exempted, with particular reference to papers dealing mainly in financial matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had explained to the House, previously to the Seanad, that the purpose of subsection (2) (a) was to enable me to make provision arising from <Col N="705" /> applications made to me by publishers of these papers to exempt them if it transpired that the cost of producing a special edition of that paper or periodical for this country meant that they could not have the paper circulated here, with the result that business or other interests might be deprived of the benefit of the paper.  The amendment mentions papers dealing mainly in financial matters.  This widens the scope of the amendment. The Deputy said that he was particularly anxious about the <i>Financial Times.</i> The <i>Financial Times</i> contains a literary section, a news section and it could possibly be argued that it does not deal mainly with financial matters.  I could find myself precluded from giving favourable consideration to an application from the <i>Financial Times,</i> which has reasonably limited circulation here which could justify an application for exemption.</P>
    <P>One of the problems I am faced with here is that in my efforts to retain investors' money within the country, I do not want to find myself, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, being accused of acting as censor by specific reference to the purpose for which I want power, to prevent general circulation of the general run of papers trying to attract investors' money here into unit trusts elsewhere.  The situation at the present time is that Irish advertising of unit trusts in the UK is not allowed.  Our daily newspapers circulating in the United Kingdom are not allowed to advertise investments here. I do not think there is anything specifically wrong.  Deputy Donegan, on Committee Stage, indicated that he would put down this amendment for Report Stage but that if I could give him an assurance that I had seen his point of view and was willing to take due regard of it in the consideration of applications under section 8 (2) (a) this would meet his requirements.  This is what I undertook to do at that time.  I had an amendment which held up the passage of the Final Stage of the Bill on that day and, as a result, Deputy Donegan's amendment and my own amendment have appeared today.  I am satisfied that what Deputy Donegan intended to achieve by the amendment can be achieved under section 8 (2) (a).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been discussing the problem of roads.  I had mentioned the colossal death rate on the roads and what could be done to reduce that frightful toll.  We spend millions of pounds on the improvement of existing roads.  We must face the fact that, as the volume of traffic increases, we must not only improve existing roads but must also provide new ones.</P>
      <P>What I have in mind is that in all our cities the traffic problem is growing and so is the danger to life on our roads, despite the best efforts of local authorities and the Department.  We must appreciate fully the dangers and realise that something drastic must be done, that flyovers and underpasses must be provided to curb the amount of traffic using the one surface.  I suggest that this must be considered as the only remedy in cities like Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment the average annual death rate is 500 and it is growing despite our best efforts.  We must do our utmost to cut down this terrible loss of life.  Therefore, any investment we make in easing traffic flows will be an <Col N="707" /> investment in the safety of our people. For instance, I must compliment CIE on increasing the number of suburban trains and particularly on the reopening of the Sydney Parade station.  They might consider also reopening the station at Sandymount.</P>
    <P>Of course the increase in the number of suburban trains will mean increased delays, and more of them, at level crossings with consequent pile-ups of traffic on either side of crossings.  However, more trains will help people to travel to the city without having to use their cars.</P>
    <P>Preparations are well under way to provide a new bridge across the Liffey. It will cost a lot of money and I am sorry the authorities, while they were at it, did not go all out and provide a tunnel instead of a bridge.  It would cost more money but on the other hand we would be avoiding the opening up of a further surface on which road traffic can travel.  The new Liffey bridge will mean that most cross-city cars will travel on it.  From that point of view I suggest we should examine the possibility of a tunnel even if it were financed from a source other than the Road Fund.  Posterity would thank us for our foresight and since such a tunnel&mdash;it could also provide for a link rail service&mdash;would benefit posterity it would be no harm if posterity were left to pay some of the cost.  At the moment the cross-city rail junction at the Custom House is a monstrosity which obscures the view at the Custom House and gives one on Butt Bridge a feeling of claustrophobia.</P>
    <P>The provision of better facilities for traffic is one of the most important tasks before the Minister and he should do all in his power to encourage local authorities to take drastic action not only to give easier passage to motorists who, after all are paying heavily in taxes, but to provide more safety for pedestrians.  We have only to look at America and Europe to see how they are endeavouring to control traffic by the provision of flvovers and underpasses. We could take a lesson from them and, as I have said, we would be investing in greater safety for our people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> Dublin Corporation are daily extending the areas in which parking meters are being provided.  It is a pity to see meters in Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square.  If you drive east along Merrion Square at the moment there is barely space for one car to get through because of the double and treble parking.  The beauty of these squares is being taken away.  We know parking meters are a necessary evil but we should concentrate more on providing multi-storey parking lots.</P>
    <P>Parking towers are no solution to the traffic problem.  That has been proved by the experience in the United States of America.  There, you have a stream of cars to the towers in the early morning, a stream of cars away from the towers at lunch-hour, a stream of cars to the towers after lunch and a stream of cars out again in the evening when the workers are returning home.  These towers are, as I say, no solution.  The only solution is to encourage motorists not to bring their cars into the cities and towns.  Arrangements should be made for parking at railway stations and bus depots and, concommitant with those arrangements, a satisfactory schedule of public transport should be provided to enable these people to reach their destinations with the minimum of delay.  A double-decker bus holds 78 passengers. Most of the cars have just a driver, perhaps sometimes a passenger as well; 78 cars as against one double-decker bus is bound to lead to traffic confusion. Of course, the reason why there are so many cars on the road is because people find that public transport does not bring them to their destinations with the rapidity they desire.  This is not the fault of the public transport system.  It is the fault of the general confusion caused by too great a density of traffic flow at peak periods. Perhaps an improvement could be achieved by making every street within one mile of the centre of the city a clear way except for public transport, ambulances, delivery vans and so forth.</P>
    <P>The slaughter on our roads must be ended.  I pay tribute to the Minister and his Department for their efforts to achieve greater safety on the roads.  Were it not for their efforts the <Col N="709" /> toll would be worse.  If 500 people died every year from disease a great deal of money would immediately be channelled into research.  Something is being done, I admit, about the slaughter on our roads, but it is not enough.  Apart from the 500 killed, thousands are maimed and injured. The toll will have to be reduced and the Minister should have the assurance of the House that any money necessary to reduce the toll will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>With regard to planning, for some years past there has been controversy about planning and the demolition of buildings of historical or aesthetic value.  I am not opposed to office blocks; office workers are entitled to decent accommodation.  However, the housing situation is such, that we really cannot afford to lose dwellinghouses merely in order to facilitate the erection of office blocks.  With proper planning we could have both office blocks and dwellinghouses, but the latter must always have priority.  It is very sad to see a row of houses taken over by a developer and left there to run down until such time as he is ready to go ahead with work on the site.  In most of these cases developers are generous in their efforts to compensate those who had been living in the houses, but that is not the point.  In many cases if these houses had not been allowed to deteriorate so much it would have been possible to maintain them as dwelling units.  Under the 1969 Housing Act the local authorities can exercise control over the demolition of houses.  They retain the right to review permission for demolitions but I do not know whether the Act is adequate in this regard. Some time ago I was concerned with a case involving three houses which, admittedly, were not in very good condition but in which three families were housed.  The houses were purchased with the intention of demolishing them and building small office blocks on the site.  The purchaser received permission for their demolition. One of the families concerned have moved out to a house provided by the developer which is much better than the original one but the other two families do not wish to leave.  I would support them in this.  Why should these people who are good citizens, <Col N="710" /> who have been paying rent for their houses and who have kept them in good repair to the extent that they were liable to do so, be forced to move out?</P>
    <P>In speaking in this manner one takes the risk of being labelled a preservationist. I am not a preservationist in the classic sense of that word but it is my opinion that we should be diligent in preserving any dwelling house.  Of course, if possible houses should be preserved for their historic or aesthetic value but our primary concern must be the preservation of houses in which people can be accommodated.  For that reason everything possible should be done to maintain houses in good repair.</P>
    <P>I am not against the building of office blocks but I would emphasise that dwelling accommodation must come first.  We must realise that buildings do not last for ever but at the same time their life span can be prolonged by keeping them in good repair.</P>
    <P>While disappointment may be expressed with some of the decisions reached by the Department in respect of planning permission we must remember that nobody outside the Department can have at his disposal the amount of information that is available to the Minister in each case.</P>
    <P>Because of the demand for housing local authorities are forced to build in the suburbs in order to accommodate people from the city.  Economists condemn the use of arable land for housing purposes.  Perhaps they are right but a housing authority must bear the human element in mind in all these matters. However, it would be a good policy to make it more difficult for developers to obtain planning permission for the building of office blocks in the city centre.  I realise that it is necessary to have public buildings and office blocks but I would advocate having mixed accommodation in the city, that is, housing and office buildings.  I have referred before to the mistake made in cities across the Channel in allowing huge areas to be developed for office blocks only.  Those areas are deserted from 5 o'clock on Fridays to 9 o'clock on Mondays.  They are dead parts of cities at week-ends.  The ideal situation in any city would be to have available <Col N="711" /> good housing in the city centre as well as the necessary office accommodation.</P>
    <P>I realise that some of the accommodation in the centre of this city is not good but those agitators who, on every occasion possible, decry the fall in population in any of these areas take no account of the conditions in which the people lived there.  We know that if an area within the city is cleared to allow for improvement in housing only one-third of the people who moved out will come back.  The reason for this is that there was great density of population in the old accommodation but the redeveloped accommodation allows for much better standards and more space. The other two-thirds will be given good housing elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Office building in the city should be in proportion to the amount of living accommodation provided.  For instance, if 4,000 square feet are devoted to the building of an office block, we should ensure that in that vicinity there are 30,000 square feet devoted to housing. A recent trend on the part of developers is the provision by them of living accommodation.  This may be good in its own way but it does nothing to ease the housing problem because those flats are usually in a luxury bracket and might be used as a town dwelling by some of the wealthier people.</P>
    <P>The local authorities, with their power of compulsory acquisition, must ensure that office blocks are not built at the expense of housing.  If people wish to remain in the areas in which they were reared, we should do everything possible to ensure that that is possible for them.  There is talk of urban renewal.  To me that means the replanning of housing areas in the city. In this city there are some old schemes of flats that were built during the last century.  The toilet facilities in these flats are totally inadequate.  I commend the Minister on his action in regard to the Benburb Street flats.  Already the corporation have plans for the redevelopment of that area.  The new flats to be built there will be of a high standard.  This decision on the part of the Minister indicates that he is watching the housing situation very closely.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> There are at least two other places which must be redeveloped.  I am sure the Minister will, as he has done in Benburb Street, ensure that the flats will not be simply swept away and the people housed in the suburbs, but that more flats will be built there and so keep the city alive by having living in the city centre those who want to live there: some will want to live in the suburbs.  The possibility of being housed in the suburbs is, I think, ten times greater now than that of being housed in the inner suburban area, not within the canal zone but in the older suburbs of Ringsend and Inchicore.</P>
    <P>I know that the great problem is to find land suitable for building without having to clear the site.  Some years ago Dublin Corporation had less than 60 sites for redevelopment but the cost of clearing them at that time was estimated at £5 million.  The Minister has made land available in the suburbs to the local authority and, in fact, the Department have given over £4 million for the purchase of land in the suburbs. This is good but I wonder if the Minister would, under existing legislation or, if necessary, by means of new legislation, make land available in the inner city area for housing development by letting developers know that he will not welcome or even tolerate commercial or industrial development in these areas where housing is needed?  The economics of housing favour inner city development.</P>
    <P>Recently I appeared at a public hearing for an area only a quarter mile from this House where the local clergy wanted flats built instead of commercial development.  There was a drop in population there first, because of bad housing which had to be swept away and, secondly, because of the encroachment of light industry and commercial interests.  We do not want Dublin to become a dead city from Friday afternoon until Monday morning.  We should profit by the mistakes made in other countries and ensure that the first priority in our planning will be the person and the family and that people who have lived all their lives in the city centre shall be enabled to go on living there if they want to do so.  We should also ensure that the numbers do not become <Col N="713" /> static.  If there are 100 dwellings in an area we should aim not only at preserving that number but increasing it.</P>
    <P>Close to us we have what is known as the vanishing parish of City Quay. I compliment the Minister on touring that area with myself and others.  He saw the place at first hand and I know he welcomes any housing developments proposed in that area.  It is a very difficult area because there are many small enterprises there with which one does not want to interfere. Perhaps action should have been taken many years ago before the dwellings were swept away or converted into workshops or small factories, before the 1963 Act came into force.</P>
    <P>City Quay is some 300 yards from O'Connell Bridge and much nearer Butt Bridge and is an ideal place for people who wish to live in the city close to their work, such as south side dockers.  Yet every year there is a fall in the number of dwellings there.  I suggest that some property owners in the area should cede their property to the corporation for housing development, not as an act of charity, because the corporation will pay a realistic price for the land, but in the society we are trying to create property owners might well make the gesture of selling to the corporation sufficient space to provide dwellings for, say, even 100 old people or 100 young families.  There would be no loss involved as the corporation would pay a fair price for the land.  I am sure the Minister would welcome such a development.  If property owners in the City Quay area wish to make a contribution to society they could do so in this way.</P>
    <P>One meets many people disappointed at being refused planning permission.  Everybody who applies naturally thinks he has a very good case but there are many factors involved in planning.  There are many derelict sites, particularly on the north side of the city.  Under the law, if the roof is off a house one does not pay rates on it.  In some American cities in order to encourage quick redevelopment they make their citizens pay rates on a building even though <Col N="714" /> it is derelict.  That may seem harsh but at least there will not be many derelict sites.  I understand the State has power to acquire agricultural land which is not fully used and a local authority have power under compulsory acquisition procedure to acquire land for houses, but the cost is enormous.  Land prices are very high in Dublin at present so that very often local authorities are unable to compete in the open market for land suitable for building.  If changing the law would improve the position I would be in favour of changing it.  I am not so much in favour of compulsion but I appeal to property owners to contribute to the general wellbeing without financial loss to themselves by ceding land for dwellings to local authorities.</P>
    <P>One cannot conclude without referring to pollution, a problem common to all countries.  The US spend millions every year in this connection but perhaps in proportion to our means we spend as much.  We shall have to spend much more money in future in educating people on how to prevent pollution in our cities from reaching the stage of being almost a death-point in some communities.  We are very fortunate in Dublin and in Ireland generally.  I suppose because we are an island nation we do not have the huge concentrations of population of other countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister took a very simple action recently which was a good pointer to what can be done.  I understand that cleaning of the Liffey at Heuston Bridge was undertaken at the Minister's request.  Some Deputies have cleaned rivers in their own areas, not in order to act as scavengers, but to try to encourage people to ensure that rivers are kept clean and do not become junk repositories.</P>
    <P>On the question of pollution, I should like to refer to the case of an American firm who were prosecuted for polluting the air by the emission of dangerous fumes.  This firm tackled the problem with their engineers and they invented equipment which removes dangerous fumes.  It was so successful that they received so many inquiries about it that they started to <Col N="715" /> manufacture the apparatus and now an industry has been formed in that town for the manufacture of anti-pollution equipment which is being sold all over the States.  Our pollution problem is smaller than the European one but Europe became so polluted because the people were not aware of the problem. We have no such excuse.  We have seen what happened in other countries and therefore we must tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about refuse disposal.  Rubbish was dumped 200 or 300 years ago where this House stands at present.  The sea came to Merrion Square at that time.  Reclamation proceeded down through the Beggars Bush area, the Irishtown area, Ringsend and Sandymount.  In the old days you only had sloblands but nowadays at Sandymount there is a strand which is a good lung for the people, particularly on the south side.  Under the town plan the corporation have prevented further reclamation.  I often wonder what the corporation will do to get rid of the city's refuse in the future.  Will we have to do like some of the English cities and get a train to take our rubbish miles away?  When we get it miles away what will the people there think about it?  I think the only solution we have is that of massive incineration where each city will have one, two or three massive incinerators to destroy rubbish.  It may be said that these will give off fumes but at least they will be concentrated in certain areas and smoke is not an insurmountable problem if properly tackled.  We will have to invest in incinerators to destroy the vast amount of rubbish.</P>
    <P>Last week a doctor said that Grafton Street was not a healthy place to walk in because of the emission of fumes from vehicles.  I do not doubt the doctor's word.  I am sure he did some research on it.  The recommendation made by the Council of Europe on the matter of fumes from combustion engines was that when you are stopped in a traffic jam you should switch off the engine.  This would help to some extent.</P>
    <P>I want again to congratulate the <Col N="716" /> Minister on his success in housing.  He will go down in history as the Minister who saw the most houses built in any one year in this country.  This is a tremendous achievement but there must be no complacency because every Deputy knows that you come across some frightful cases of bad housing, mostly overcrowding.  The conditions under which some old people live are far from perfect.  In Dublin the requirement for an old person to get a dwelling is that the property is required by the corporation for somebody else.  Old people deserve the best of housing Though this is a matter for another Minister I want to mention that many old people are being tormented by irresponsible youths.  We should aim not so much at the temporary chalet for old people, though some of them are quite nice, but at a housing scheme for old people which would not be a part of the general housing but which would be integrated into a housing development.  Each housing development could have a portion for old people, one for families and one for the middle-aged group.  There is more to housing schemes than bricks and mortar.  I want to congratulate the Minister on the progress he has made and I hope he will bear in mind the few points I have made.</P>

      <P>This is an Estimate in which many Deputies have an interest.  Most Deputies are members of local authorities and they like to air on this Estimate many of the problems they meet.  Local government covers many areas and I suppose determines the type of environment in which we will live over the next number of years. However, almost every Deputy spoke first about housing which would indicate that this is the biggest problem. In my area it is a grave problem. Listening to the debate here one would almost get the impression that the only place in which there is a housing problem is Dublin.  I can tell Dublin Deputies that in the country this problem is every bit as severe.  I read that the new mayor of Waterford condemned the fact that four years have passed without a local authority house being built in Waterford.  We in Kilkenny are not quite as bad as that but we have a <Col N="717" /> housing list of over 300 people.  When the new housing list comes out I am sure there will be 400 people on it.  The Minister has been complimented on the number of houses he has built and on the work he is doing in this direction. I agree to a certain extent with those comments, but I would not go all the way with the speakers who have complimented the Minister on housing. We must remember that there was a big backlog of houses to be made up, due to the fact that this vital area had been neglected for a number of years.</P>
      <P>We had a discussion at our council some time ago and it was said that for a period of ten years there was nearly a standstill on the house building programme at council level.  This is a grave problem and it will take drastic measures to overcome this legacy of a lack of houses which was left to the local authorities and to the Minister by past Ministers and past authorities. We cannot be complacent.  We cannot be satisfied with a fair effort.  We must make a much greater effort to house people.  The Minister said that the least everyone deserves is shelter.  I can tell the Minister&mdash;he knows it himself; he is a member of a local authority and I am sure he is in close contact with the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>People are living under desperate conditions in my area.  This is one of the greatest social problems we have.  Kilkenny is renowned for its social services and for its awareness of social problems.  We have a very go-ahead bishop and we have helpers there who have done wonderful work in the social services sphere.  Our biggest problem is a lack of houses&mdash;and this is the case throughout most of the country&mdash;because it creates the social problems of broken marriages, people taking to the bottle, and the other problems which arise when people are living in very bad conditions.  If we are to get the best out of our people we must house them properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> We are now facing entry into the EEC.  We are told to tighten our belts and pull up our socks and get production expanded.  How can we expect unfortunate young married men, young men in full bloom, who are the sheet anchor of our work force, to expand production when they are living in dreadful housing conditions?  I do not think that is possible.  Therefore, a much greater effort must be made to solve the problem of the housing shortage all over the country.</P>
    <P>I notice that the emphasis has gone off council houses and on to houses for purchase under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  Last year 12,000 houses for purchase were built and 5,000 local authority and council houses were built.  I am not in agreement with that.  In my local area there are many young men who have been waiting for quite a long time to be housed.  They have become exasperated. To try to keep their marriage intact, and to keep their families together, they have gone into some of these houses and they cannot afford them. They have put themselves in debt and they will have financial worries for many years to come.  More council houses should be built for which people could pay a rent they can afford.  They should be given a house they can live in and enjoy their young lives without these awful financial worries hanging over them which people have at present.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to deal with is the provision of houses in rural areas.  It is now said that generally people are inclined to live in towns and that they do not want to live in the rural areas, but there are young people working in towns who would like to live in the rural area they come from, where their families are living, and where there are people who could baby-sit for them and help them out in any trouble.  They must live in towns because houses are not being built in the country.  Local authorities are not tackling this problem. I do not blame them.  I have sympathy for them.  There is such pressure on them to provide houses in towns where there are long waiting lists that the country areas are forgotten.  About 50 per cent on the waiting lists are people <Col N="719" /> from rural areas who cannot find flat accommodation or room accommodation in the rural areas.  But for that they would stay in the rural areas. They must go into town to get a flat or a room to live in, and then they go on the town's housing list.</P>
    <P>If the local representatives throughout the county press for houses to be built in the rural areas they are asked to produce a waiting list showing the number of people waiting to be housed. Very often they can only produce a very short list because the people who should be there to be housed, and who want to be housed in the rural areas, have gone into the towns and cities.  As a result we are denuding our countryside and creating ghettoes in the towns and cities.  The Minister should have a look at this problem and try to give some incentive&mdash;I will not say directive&mdash;because we get too many directives from the Department &mdash;to local authorities to build houses in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am glad that local authorities can build up to six houses without going to the Department for sanction.  This may be an incentive.  Perhaps the Minister might consider &ldquo;upping&rdquo; the grant for houses built in rural areas, or in villages within striking distances of towns and cities, so that these people could be housed and live among their own people where they were born and reared.  By doing this we would be bolstering up the countryside, keeping the people there and keeping the schools and churches open.  If we do not tackle the problem the schools and churches and the areas will become derelict.  We must start by providing houses so that people will live in these places and keep them viable.</P>
    <P>All the local authorities are frustrated by the length of time it takes to have a housing project passed by the Department.  I do not blame the Minister for this.  He has only so much money to spend.  He should make his case to the Minister for Finance for more money.  This must be done.  There is an obligation on him to do it.  Local authorities send housing plans to the Department. <Col N="720" /> Other speakers have mentioned this but I think it should be repeated.  Intelligent local representatives and top-class local officials should not be treated in the way they are being treated by the Department.  Projects for housing, water supply and other schemes are sent to and from the Department for years, in some cases ten years, to have minor alterations made.  The Department will have to cease this practice.  Money should be allocated to local authorities on a five year basis.  There must be forward planning and forward financing.  The local authority should be told what the allocation will be so that they can plan and go ahead with schemes.  The valuable time of local officials and of departmental officials should not be wasted in sending plans backwards and forwards.  This causes frustration among local representatives and will lead to the situation where the right type and quality of persons will not seek election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy acknowledged that we have made a start in trying to delegate decision-making to the local authorities when he referred to the six houses.  With that go block allocations to each local authority. This is a small beginning.  If it is successful it will be extended.  The six could be extended to 12, depending on experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have acknowledged this.  The situation is bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will apply it to other schemes also if my experience with the local authorities is satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that, because it is one sphere in which the frustration draws off members from local councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to the question of the type of house built.  Over a number of years the Department had in mind, and I agreed with them, the provision of houses which did not at first glance appear to be council houses.  We had got to the stage where we were providing semi-detached houses in nicely located and landscaped schemes.  I was hoping for further development in this direction.  I am afraid that in connection <Col N="721" /> with the last scheme which we had in Kilkenny the plans went backwards and forwards and, eventually, when the plans were passed, it meant the erection of 18 to 20 extra houses on the site, which brought us back to the old council house situation where there are eight or ten houses in a block with no access from the rear.  This was a pity.  Regardless of the extra cost involved, we should have stuck to our guns and provided a good class house in a good class area.  Over-crowded sites create problems and in the long run the houses will be more expensive by the time the problems are solved.  I would ask the Minister to consider this aspect in regard to future schemes.  We should not revert to the old system of building a row of council houses recognisable from a distance as a council estate.  We were getting away from that concept but unfortunately in regard to the last scheme in Kilkenny there was a reversion to the old system.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the situation arising in the case of local authority houses that have not got a bathroom. Even though there is a long waiting list for houses a person who has any hope of being housed within a reasonable period would almost prefer to camp out for a year or two rather than go into a house that has not got a bathroom.  Indeed, the demand now is for central heating.  Bathrooms should be provided so that the houses can be put to better use and the local authority will be able to get more rent for them.  The provision of bathrooms would create more demand for these houses.  Young persons are not prepared to take a house without a bathroom.  You may get elderly people who are prepared to move into these houses from other houses that have not got bathrooms.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to houses built by the NBA for local authorities.  Very careful inspection of these houses should be carried out.  In some cases they have provided a poor quality house, badly finished. Complaints that arise are not dealt with.  In connection with one scheme people refused to sign over supplementary grants to the National <Col N="722" /> Building Agency.  They were perfectly within their rights.  Under pressure from certain sections many of them agreed to sign.  One man who resisted had to be given financial compensation before he would sign.  Such a situation should not arise.  The quality of house being provided should be very closely watched.</P>
    <P>I was glad to read on this morning's paper that loans for houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts have been increased by £400 and that the income limits for loans and grants have been increased.  This was not before it was time.  The Minister did not go far enough.  Housing costs have increased so much over the last couple of years that it would be difficult to give the necessary increase in grants and loans.  The Minister should have brought the figures nearer to the point at which young persons could afford a deposit.</P>
    <P>This is the big trouble at the moment.  Even with the £400 increase it will still cost anybody who wants to buy this type of house at least £1,000, and this in most cases is a year's income. Such people will be putting themselves into debt and into shocking hardship trying to raise this money from banks and trying to repay capital and interest on the deposit as well as capital and interest on the SDA house. The amount should have been increased further.</P>
    <P>Another odd situation arises in regard to people's eligibility for loans and grants.  A man with four children and an income of £1,500 is entitled to a grant but not a loan, and a man with £1,750 is entitled to a loan but not a grant.  The Minister should urgently look into this situation and have it straightened out.  It has obtained over the years and it should be remedied so that a man entitled to a loan would be entitled to the grant as well.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the raising of the deposit on a house is a great hardship on young people who are anxious to purchase SDA houses.  I often wonder whether the Minister, in collusion with the Minister for Finance, should not devise some saving plan to allow young people to start saving early for at least the deposit on a house later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> Young people are earning good money now at the age of 18.  They are not inclined to work overtime because of the tax situation, but if the type of scheme I am advocating could be made to carry a remission of tax it would mean young people would be encouraged to save early, they would accumulate at least enough for a deposit and would thus be relieving themselves and the local authorities of anxiety in the matter of the provision of houses.  I would further suggest that such a scheme should carry some small rate of interest which could be allowed to accumulate with the capital.  Housing costs are increasing at such a rapid rate that some such scheme should be devised without further delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be in favour of providing more and more purchase houses.  Some people have difficulty in getting loans for these houses.  Last year I came across a young man whose house cost him £300 extra because he could not get a loan and had to get a bridging loan for a year.  Some of the bigger groups of builders are tying up the building societies and making it difficult for ordinary people seeking loans to have the money made available. We should go all out to make it easier for young people to get housing loans.</P>
    <P>I wish to complain about the directive sent by the Department to local authorities prohibiting development along national primary roads.  I describe this as the big stick because I do not think the Department should have issued a directive of this nature. Both local representatives and planning officers are responsible people who would not allow overdevelopment along arterial roads.  They have proved this throughout the years, certainly in Kilkenny where a section 4 prohibition has been imposed only once and that has been since the directive came from the Department.  In the coming months quite a number of section 4 restrictions will be imposed because people will have been refused planning permission because of this directive.  Local planners could make it possible for people to build in proximity to primary roads <Col N="724" /> and still abide by logical considerations. However, the Department have told councils that if any number of buildings are erected along these roads, road grants will be withheld.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to repeat what other Deputies said in this respect.  The effect of this will be to take a lot of the land bank from housing and it will put the price of housing land up.  Water and sewerage services have been provided along these roads where no further development is being allowed.  It means that local authorities will have to provide more services along secondary roads and those secondary roads will have to be developed further to carry the heavy traffic which new development on them will create.  I am not advocating unlimited house building on arterial roads.  There are instances in which a good engineer could devise a scheme which would eliminate danger for motorists using the roads by the provision of an extra outlet and the proper channelling of traffic.  A number of engineers agree with me on this but they are hamstrung at the moment and they cannot do anything about it.  The Minister should look into this.</P>
    <P>There are cases in which those concerned are actually creating dangerous situations.  Recently a man applied for planning permission for a development on an arterial road.  There was 150 to 200 yards vision on each side of the proposed entry.  The exit was to be located on the widest part of the particular section of road.  It looked a fair proposition but the planning officer said that it could not be allowed under the regulation; he pointed out that there was a byroad at the back and he could come out on to that and from there on to the main road.  Fortunately the developer did not own the field beside where the development was taking place because, had he owned it, a grave hazard would have been created through very large trucks coming out at the end of the premises, with no vision at all on one side and about 50 yards on the other.  This would have been a ludicrous situation. The planning officers should be treated as responsible people, competent to deal with situations.  We must repose trust in our local planners and in our <Col N="725" /> local representatives.  That is what it boils down to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is concerned about this, then I would suggest as essential reading the Foras Forbartha report on roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I cannot understand how the Deputy can continue with the kind of argument he is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister understand the creation of a hazard in order to comply with a regulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to restriction on development alongside arterial roads and the creation of new openings on to arterial roads.  I am strongly opposed to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, too, up to a point.  The situation has gone too far and I think the Minister has read more into the Foras Forbartha report than should be read into it.  The Minister referred to the figures for deaths on our roads.  The report mentioned by the Minister shows a very close connection between access points to these roads and deaths on the roads. Proper vision is not provided.  Nothing has been done to cope with the situation of fast moving traffic and to ensure that there will be no danger to those using these roads.  It should not be beyond the skill of our engineers and planners to provide proper access.  The Minister should have another look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is delay in sanctioning group water schemes and people become frustrated as a result of that delay.  In some cases the people are afraid to embark on this kind of project.  If there is a hold-up they are timid about pressing their case.  There should be more flexibility.  Many people are disappointed by the failure of local authorities to extend existing regional water supply schemes.  These schemes could supply larger areas. There are many schemes in the Minister's Department awaiting sanction and there is no sign of any sanction forthcoming.  It would be better if the Minister told the people that there is <Col N="726" /> no intention of extending schemes, if that is the policy, rather than have the people waiting and waiting.  In some cases sanction has been awaited for five and six years.  In some cases, because the people have no water, they are using the river.  In one case they go to the river at six o'clock in the morning before the cattle get in and muck it up.  The regional water schemes should be extended to these people.  If it is not the intention to extend these schemes, the people should be so informed to enable them to go ahead with a group scheme. There is one regional water scheme from which a small extension would supply 14 homes consisting of 67 people.  I refer to Cloncurry, Piltown. This extension should be sanctioned. It would be a tremendous boon to the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred at some length to pollution.  I wholeheartedly agree that we must keep our country clean.  We must tackle this problem before we reach the stage that has been reached in other countries in this respect.  I know the Minister is concerned with the problem and has studied it in depth but, at the same time, I wonder whether he is really serious in his efforts because he allows the situation to continue whereby untreated sewage in local authority areas is flowing into our rivers.  The treatment works have become obsolete and the sewage that passes through them cannot be regarded as being treated.  If we expect such people as farmers and industrialists to co-operate in dealing with the problem of pollution, is it not only right that the Department should put their house in order first?</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on industries to tackle this problem also.  There are ways and means of doing so.  The equipment required is expensive but perhaps the Department of Finance would give an incentive to industries to instal it.  We still have a relatively clean environment but we must be diligent in ensuring that it is maintained. It is easier to lead people than to drive them.  Therefore, aid given to industry for the installation of equipment to deal with pollution would be well worth while.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> Regarding local authorities generally I would say that they should be given more responsibility.  The six-house rule is very welcome and I welcome also the news that the Minister is expanding this.  It is a step in the right direction.  The more responsibility that can be given to local authorities, the better will be the returns.  In the first place, a better type of representative will be attracted to local bodies.  In the present situation a local representative has no responsibility.  He can be regarded merely as a rubber stamp. Therefore, any man of intelligence will not be attracted to serving on local councils.</P>
    <P>If the Department allocated to each local authority the amount of money on which they would have to manage for the next five years and told them to spend it to the best advantage of their localities, there would not be any money spent foolishly.  Schemes would be considered in great depth before councillors would reach any decision regarding the allocation of money.  In any case, local authorities must have more power.  If they have power they will have also responsibility and this would make for harmonious working relations between local authorities and the people.  It would provide a PRO system which we have not got now. It is essential that the people should be told why specific decisions are taken.  They should be told why they have to pay extra rates or rents and what advantage that will mean for themselves and their children.  We seem to have moved away from the idea of bringing the people into our confidence and letting them realise that they play a very important part in all decisions.</P>
    <P>At present relations could be much better between the Department and the ordinary citizens.  In particular, relations could be much better between the Department and the tenants of local authority housing.  At present there are rent strikes in many parts of the country.  Thank God there have not been any in Kilkenny but there is unrest among tenants in various parts of the country because of the differential rents system.  The Minister should meet these people and bring <Col N="728" /> them into his confidence.  He should listen to their representations and, in turn, tell them what are his intentions in the matter.  It is no credit to the Minister that he has not met these people.  He should not give the impression of being a dictator.</P>

I submit to the Taoiseach that, where an agency of this kind is disseminating information in releases across the world, the least the Irish taxpayer, who is paying, might have available to him is a copy of these releases. That is the least that might be available to this House if not to individuals, certainly in the Library so that we can assess whether or not this contract should be renewed next year. Many of the Members and many members of the general public, and journalists in particular, have very grave doubts about the wisdom of renewing this agency contract.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to answer this question with confidence because other considerations also enter into the determination of hospital size including the population which can be conveniently served and the provision of other specialties such as obstetrics.  A further factor having a bearing on this is the level of expertise in hospital management. Figures around 500 to 600 beds have been mentioned and, in our circumstances, perhaps the lower of these could be regarded as the answer to the question.  The Deputy will be aware that the consultative council on the general hospital services considered that over a wide area of the country, where the population is relatively sparse, the minimum viable size for a general hospital including obstetrics would be 300 beds serving a population of at least 120,000 and staffed by approximately 12 consultants and the appropriate number of anaesthetists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the immense disappointment that it has taken over two years to implement even some of the more modest recommendations contained in the Kennedy Report and that it is this sense of frustration which has led people to draw further attention to this matter in this publication which emphasises that there are over 6,000 children who are deprived of some of the essentials of life, some of the very fundamentals to something more than a mere existence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The community services which I have been making every effort to expand in every area will be able to supply some of the needs of these children, the development of social service councils and the development of social workers.  The work of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has been growing in content and the society are now subventioned by the State.  That kind of work has been going on constantly. The Deputy will also be aware of the steps taken to implement the recommendations of the Kennedy Report on industrial schools that were referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education on 31st May&mdash; Volume 261, column 866, of the Official Report.  He made a statement indicating that there has been very considerable progress in regard to this matter. <Col N="738" /> I do not think I need read the whole of what he said but there has been continuous progress in developing both the teaching arrangements and also providing for the buildings that were recommended in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister agrees that all the bodies he has mentioned and all the reports unanimously agreed that there should be a full-scale rationalisation between Health, Education and Justice and that there should be a separate child care division set up under one Government Department? Surely in the light of the unanimity and widespread agreement within such reports and bodies this decision of the Government should not cause any agony on his part?  After all they have now been thinking about it for the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that a decision has to be made.  For example, in connection with the provision of education and health facilities for mentally handicapped persons I would regard as fairly satisfactory the co-ordination between the Department of Education and my Department.  I am not arguing from that that a decision might not be made following the recommendation of the report.  I am merely saying that we have done a great deal of work in establishing a combination of health care facilities and schools for mentally handicapped, the two Departments working closely together through a co-ordinating committee.  So it is not impossible to effect useful work through the operations of two separate Departments.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> Aer Rianta, in conjunction with Aer Lingus, Bord Fáilte and local tourism interests, are continuously seeking to promote the use of Cork Airport.  These bodies co-operate in such measures as the sponsoring of visits by foreign journalists to promote the airport as the gateway to the south-west and in circularising foreign travel agents about the advantages of using the airport. For the 1972 summer season Aer Lingus have organised and are operating a series of additional charter flights to and from Cork.</P>
    <P>It is not at present possible to make any assessment of the implications of EEC membership for Cork Airport. It is, however, to be expected that there will be some growth in traffic to and from the airport arising from a growth in commercial and tourist activity and in this connection Aer Lingus will be alert to any possibility of developing additional economic air services between Cork and EEC countries.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> As regards Irish Shipping Limited, three vessels costing £5.6 million and totalling 83,063 deadweight tons have been built for the company by Verolme Cork Dockyard since 1962.  In the same period three other ships totalling 60,540 deadweight tons have been built abroad at a cost of £4.49 million.  Two of the vessels built abroad totalling 31,340 deadweight tons and costing £1.95 million were initially ordered by Irish Shipping Limited from Verolme Cork Dockyard.  At the request of the Cork yard, the orders were transferred to the Verolme yard in Holland to enable the Cork yard to accept a more beneficial foreign order.  Four bulk carriers of 26,000 tons each are at present under construction at Upper Clyde Shipbuilders for the company.  The order for these ships was placed abroad after consultation with Verolme Cork Dockyard.</P>
    <P>Since the B &amp; I Company was acquired in 1965 two ships costing £3.6 million with a total gross tonnage of 8,289 tons have been built for the company by Verolme.  In the same period two vessels totalling 8,916 gross registered tons have been built for them in Germany at a cost of £5.14 million. One of these ships was already under construction at a German yard when taken over by the B &amp; I in 1967.  The other is a sister ship to one built for the company at Verolme Cork Dockyard in 1968-69.  That yard is not in a position to build a second ship for delivery by the required delivery date.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that it is the policy of both companies to give the maximum possible volume of business to Verolme.  As already announced, I have recently approved of the placing of an order with Verolme for a new unit-load ship for the B &amp; I, while a proposal by Irish Shipping Limited to build a further cargo ship at the yard is under examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister assure us that in future all vessels required by the Irish shipping companies will be built in Verolme Dockyard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained to the House that in some cases orders placed with Verolme were transferred at Verolme's request, and in <Col N="743" /> other cases they could not offer suitable delivery dates, for example, for two vessels of 50,000 deadweight tons. Every effort is made to find as much business for Verolme Dockyard as possible. In fact, one thing that was not mentioned in the reply was that one of the ships built by Verolme for Irish Shipping Limited was duplicated for an outside carrier through the intervention and help of Irish Shipping Limited.  Another ship was built to the same pattern and at the same price for a company working abroad.  Every effort is made to have collaboration between the Irish shipping companies and Verolme Cork Dockyard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to ask the Minister a question in regard to any recent constructions but, before 1969, Harland and Wolfe were given the opportunity to tender.  I have no reason to suppose that that situation has changed.  The Deputy will have to ask the Minister for Transport and Power to give a specific reply on that subject.</P>

With regard to (b) the additional cost is estimated at £16,000,000.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>The velocity of money has been calculated by dividing gross national product (GNP) at current market prices by the total money supply.  As shown in the table velocity rose from 3.47 in 1960 to 4.00 in 1969, viz., an increase of 15 per cent over the period.  The range of variations was from a low of 3.40 to 4.00 in 1969.  Figures for total money supply for 1970 are not available due to the bank dispute and necessary data are not yet available for 1971.</P>
    <P>The data for currency in issue are compiled from Central Bank records and those for Associated Bank current accounts are compiled from the monthly returns submitted by these banks to the Central Bank.  Figures for the non-associated banks are not included but as the total amount in current accounts in these banks has never exceeded £20 million their exclusion has no significant effect on the velocity figures.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works, in consultation with An Bord Fáilte and the National Monuments Advisory Council, have selected a number of important national monuments in their charge <Col N="751" /> for special attention in regard to standard of presentation and the provision of visitor facilities.  Clonmacnoise is one of the national monuments selected and the facilities to be provided will include interpretative literature.  The planning of the visitor facilities is proceeding in collaboration with the Offaly County Council and An Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary say at this stage what are the likely additional facilities to be provided at Clonmacnoise in view of the fact that the existing facilities fall far short of normal requirements? The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that even on Sunday last there were a number of bus tours to Clonmacnoise and there were neither restaurant facilities, toilet facilities nor suitable guides available. There is a caravan there and there is a highly efficient lady present there to supply information but only four to six persons could stand in the caravan at a time and there were bus-loads of people anxious to get information. Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that such a situation is desirable to Clonmacnoise?</P>

      <P>I accept what the Deputy says, that a great deal needs to be done.  It has to be done in collaboration with Bord Fáilte.  We have some ideas now and are in discussion with the county council.  Until such time as these discussions are concluded I cannot say exactly what facilities will be provided.  The lady the Deputy referred to and the Midland Regional Tourism Organisation have produced a guidebook.  It is a privately produced document.  The guide book referred to is a presentable document and the people responsible for it are certainly to be congratulated.  I agree that the sooner the State can proceed the better.  We brought out a booklet recently on Dublin Castle.  We are <Col N="752" /> bringing out an improved edition of that booklet.  We have one for Newgrange.

      <P>May I inquire if the Parliamentary Secretary is correct in saying that the delay in this case is due to discussions with the Offaly County Council not having concluded?  Might I inquire the nature of the discussions?  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary realises that such discussions could be concluded in half a day if the county council, the engineering staff, the county manager and the other officers concerned were present?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary endeavour to have the discussions concluded within a week or ten days so that work can be put in hands for this time 12 months?</P>

    <P>Investigation of applications takes these matters into account and approvals <Col N="760" /> are withheld until maintenance is attended to or until lands not requiring reclamation are being effectively utilised.

    <P>A recent survey covering some 40,000 of the most recent applications indicates that the vast majority of applicants during the past two years either already had a satisfactory standard of maintenance and usage of their lands or were in a position to reach such a standard in a very short period.

A revised draft has not yet been finalised because of the necessity to co-ordinate the legislative proposals here with a proposed EEC regulation on producer groups, which has not yet been enacted.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This section corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 1 which was passed by the House on Budget day.  It is the charging section providing for the imposition of income tax and surtax on a permanent basis for 1972-73 and subsequent years.  The rate of income tax remains unchanged at 35 per cent and the rates of surtax also remain unchanged.  Of course, the making of these taxes into permanent taxes does not in any way preclude any future adjustments in the rates of income tax or surtax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The making of this tax into a permanent one is only a matter of being realistic.  It was odd that the rate of tax had to be re-enacted each year in the Finance Act.  The change is desirable.  However, it is important that on the discussion of the Finance Bill each year it should be open to Deputies to discuss the burden of existing rates of tax even if no changes are proposed. I hope that this change will not mean that discussion of existing rates of tax will be ruled out in the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 8, lines 24 and 25, to delete all words after &ldquo;accident&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;occurring during his service and for no other reason&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The drafting in this subsection gives rise to some problems.  The amendment was tabled in order to overcome difficulties arising from the question of accident cover arranged by companies in respect of their employees. This kind of cover is 24 hour and when it is arranged for one year's remuneration, the cash benefit under the Occupations and Pensions Scheme has to be cut back to three years' remuneration.  If the employee dies from natural causes his widow would be at a disadvantage to the extent of one year's remuneration by comparison with those who are not covered by accident benefit.  In the UK Finance Act of 1970 provision is made for this.  This is the reason why benefits arising by reason of death or disability resulting from an accident occurring during the services of the deceased are excluded in that Act.  Clearly we do not wish to do this.  Indeed, a provision of this kind could have been seriously detrimental to the widows of a number of people who were killed in the recent air disaster.  None of us would want, unintentionally, to do anything that would have that effect.  The amendment is necessary to achieve this result.  Unless I misunderstand the position it is necessary to make a change of this kind in order to prevent the difficulty which I have mentioned arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem to which <Col N="773" /> Deputy FitzGerald refers here can be solved readily by employers and their advisers if they arrange to have the accident insurance cover for their employees restricted to death or disability arising out of or in the course of their employment which, of course, is the prime purpose of the insurance in question.  If they do this the problem referred to by the Deputy does not arise.  If, however, the cover extends beyond that and if we were to accept this amendment we would be importing an illogical aspect into the whole structure that is involved here.  Indeed, to some extent it could be said that we were giving either an unfair advantage to one class of member of a superannuation scheme or, alternatively, that we are being unfair to those who cannot benefit in this way. The real issue here is if there is insurance cover for employees provided by their employers, that cover should relate, strictly speaking, to an accident arising out of or in the course of employment. In so far as it is so restricted, there is no problem but if it goes beyond that it is taken outside the code with which we are dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must accept that it would be wrong to put an employee's widow at a disadvantage because the company which employed her late husband either inadvertently or out of goodwill arranged accident cover more extensive than that defined narrowly by the Minister. No widow should be put at a disadvantage on that account.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that the firm ought to express the extent of the cover as being limited in this way but they may not do so.  Not every firm, and there are thousands, will read this debate.  By not making this change the Minister is putting at risk a large number of widows whose position will be affected disadvantageously by reason of the failure of the employers of their late husbands to narrow down the insurance cover either inadvertently or out of goodwill.  It cannot be the intention of the Minister that a widow should be penalisd because the employer made a mistake. The UK Finance Act makes provision <Col N="774" /> for dealing with this problem.  Why should we have a bias against widows?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any particular reason why the amendment cannot be accepted or why the Minister cannot undertake to introduce an amendment which would achieve the same results? What Deputy FitzGerald says seems reasonable, or is there something in it that I fail to detect?  It appears that this is an unnecessary penal clause against widows.  I am sure this was not the intention of the Minister.  Would the Minister not consider introducing an amendment of his own if he is not satisfied with the wording of the suggested amendment, for, as it seems, two reasons, one, that somebody has not included what he could have included or, alternatively, that he is attempting to assist the widow in the event of the death of the worker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly not intended to introduce some penal restriction against widows.  The effect of doing what is proposed in this amendment would, in fact, be to discriminate, if I may use that word, as between on the one hand widows whose husbands die by natural causes, or widows whose husbands are insured against accident arising out of or in the course of their employment and, on the other hand, widows of husbands who were insured against accident whether arising out of or in the course of their employment or not.  What we are endeavouring to do is to treat widows in such circumstances on the same basis.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister, because I find it difficult to interpret, is it the situation that under the Bill as drafted, if an employee dies by natural causes, not as a result of an accident, his widow will be at a disadvantage to the extent of one <Col N="775" /> year's remuneration simply because the employer covered her husband against accident even though an accident never happened?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could assist the Deputy on this.  The four years apply in any event but if, in addition, there is an insurance policy which is restricted to &ldquo;an accident arising out of or in the course of employment&rdquo;, that can be added and does not affect the four year situation.  It is exempt. The only problem arises where the policy covers an accident arising other than in the course of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the four year limitation applies in all circumstances but you could have a situation in which a superannuation scheme might provide that in the event of death by accident of the employee the amount of benefit payable under the superannuation scheme would be for three years and one year coming under the accident policy.  To that extent you could get a situation where the benefit is cut back to three years but as far as the recipient is concerned it is still, in fact, four years because she either gets four years under the scheme or three years under the scheme and one year under the accident policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested to me that a situation could arise where you would be cut back to three years by virtue of the existence of the accident policy; but the death might be such as not to come within the accident policy and you would not get the money from the accident policy but would be cut back by virtue of the existence of such policy to three years.  I do not read the wording that way but I am informed that is, in fact, the effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case the Deputy has in mind what would happen is that the superannuation scheme itself would provide that in the event of death the benefit would be three years.  If the scheme so provides there is nothing we can do in income tax <Col N="777" /> law to change that.  This may be what the Deputy has in mind, that a scheme might so provide, but it is not the Finance Act which would solve that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What was put to me was that most companies arrange accident cover on a 24-hour basis but the cover may be arranged for one year's remuneration and in that case I am told the death cash benefit under the occupational pension scheme, if it is to be approved, must be cut back to three year's remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This gets back to what I was saying that in any event, no matter what happens, the limitation is four years so that in the case envisaged by the Deputy the scheme might provide specifically that only three years would be paid in the case of a death by accident in the course of employment. But as far as the recipient is concerned she is, in fact, getting four years, three years under the scheme and one year under the insurance policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is if the scheme is to be approved by the Revenue Commissioners it must cut back the occupational pension scheme to three years' remuneration.  That having been done, if a person dies by natural causes the widow gets only three years.  Only if he has an accident does she get four years?  In order to deal with this accident case the Minister is forcing firms to cut back the benefit to three years; otherwise the scheme will not be approved.  That is what I have been told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, as I understand what the Deputy has in mind, is that where an employer insures the employee say for one year's remuneration, that would then restrict the benefits under the superannuation scheme to three years, making four years in all. This is largely a question for decision really in relation to each particular scheme but if they restrict the insurance policy as I have indicated to death or disability arising out of or in the course of the employment then this problem does not arise.  If they do not restrict it in that way I agree that a <Col N="778" /> problem can arise.  It is largely a question for decision in relation to each particular scheme and it is one which does not have to arise by virtue of the provisions of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making a little headway.  We are discovering there is a little more to this than met the eye at the beginning.  My suggestion that I was a little wrong in this was not sound.  If a firm have the practice of arranging accident cover for their employees covering a year's remuneration and if that accident cover is designed to catch cases which may be marginal from the point of view of the accident occurring in the course of his employment, and for no other reason, if the firm feels an obligation to do that, then the scheme they put forward will only be approved if they cut back the benefit under the ordinary arrangement for three years. Many firms feel it necessary to insure their employees against accidents on a fairly wide basis because the interpretation of whether the accident occurred arising out of or in the course of their employment is a very complex legal point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a variety of decisions on this and there are cases where many of us would feel in commonsense that the person would not have met with this accident had he not been an employee of his company and yet the accident did not occur strictly and legally, within the narrow definition of the law, in the course of his office or employment.  Any decent firm will want to ensure that their employees do not suffer because of this.  They want to make sure that no legal quibble by an insurance company will exclude an employee from benefit for an accident which might occur when he was somewhere he would not have been had he not been an employee of that firm but when he was not actually in the course of his employment.  What the Minister is doing is to say that any decent firm which tries to insure against the legal quibble adversely affecting an employee in the event of an accident will be forced by the Revenue Commissioners to cut back his normal occupational pension <Col N="779" /> scheme to three years.  The point I made originally is therefore valid.  If I had not persisted and been reluctant to accept the assurances which the Minister gave me quite innocently, not intending to mislead, this thing might have passed.  Now that I have a fuller understanding of the point, and that he has, I should like to press the Minister to look at this again.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the basic issue as to whether this is desirable at all or not, and quite apart from the risk that firms may inadvertently get themselves into difficulty by not knowing how narrowly they must define an accident policy in order to have their pension scheme approved and valid, the point I have now made is a very important one.  It is quite clear to the Minister now I think, as it is to me, that the English Act of 1970 had very good reason for widening this definition to accidents occurring during service so as not inadvertently to detach such cases, so as not to force pension schemes to be cut back in their benefit. Firms should not be put in the position of having to choose between either risking their employees losing the accident benefit because of a strict legal interpretation or, alternatively, cutting back the pension scheme provision. It is not the function of Parliament, the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners, to try to force firms to choose between two ways of disadvantaging their employees.  Our job should be the other way around, to try to get firms to look after their employees properly.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at this again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy FitzGerald is mistaken in a few matters.  I believe he is mistaken in reading such a great deal into the British provisions. I cannot elaborate on that but I believe he is.  Secondly, the fact is that provided the insurance policy is restricted in the way I have indicated this problem does not arise at all and there is no necessity to cut back from four to three years.  Deputy FitzGerald suggests that employers may do this indavertently. This is not so because in order <Col N="780" /> to have their scheme approved by the Revenue Commissioners they have to submit the scheme, together with any details of this kind of insurance that they would have, and immediately this matter would come to light.  It would not occur inadvertently.  It would occur only because the employer decided that this kind of insurance should be operated despite the provisions here.  Therefore, it is mistaken to imagine that this could happen inadvertently.  The practical operation of these arrangements results in the employer having his attention drawn to this situation.  Having had his attention drawn to it he has a remedy and on the general principle involved in this it seems to me that what we are doing is trying to treat all widows in the same way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think that is true at all.  So far as existing arrangements are concerned, and what is proposed here generally in relation to superannuation, there is very considerable liberalisation involved.  If an accident occurs to somebody outside the course of his employment it does not seem to me to be something which is relevant in any way to any form of superannuation which relates to his employment and this is the kernel of what is involved in this amendment.</P>
      <P>As regards the possibility of hardship being created.  I have demonstrated that this is not so.  If hardship occurs it will not have occurred by inadvertence, it will have occurred because there was a deliberate decision made to take a particular course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain?  The Deputy is not a lawyer.  The Minister and I have had various associations with the law going back some distance. The Minister has practised but I never did.  We are not, perhaps, the best people to try to explain the law to Deputy O'Donovan but, since we are the only people available in the House <Col N="782" /> at the moment, he will have to make the best of us.</P>
      <P>The position as I understand it from the vague recollections I have of my law, is that the question of what is in the course of employment can be very narrowly defined by the courts or more widely defined.  There are conflicting decisions on this point.  Suppose an employee is sent over to Brussels or somewhere like that and, while he is there on business, he walks down the street to buy a paper or something which is not required by virtue of his office or employment, but which he would not be doing were it not for his office or employment, if he has an accident he should not lose out on a legal quibble if the insurance company say: &ldquo;We will not pay.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Every decent employer seeking to avoid that uses the words in the policy &ldquo;during his years of service&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;in the course of employment&rdquo; because there have been so many cases where employees lost out.  What the Minister is doing in effect is saying to a firm: &ldquo;If you want to continue to ensure that your employees are protected when they are away and that they cannot lose out on a legal quibble, you must cut your pension scheme back for three years.&rdquo; That is precisely the effect of it.  I do not believe that is desirable and I do not really believe that the Minister feels it is desirable.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donovan put a specific question to Deputy FitzGerald.  As I understood him he asked: &ldquo;Does this mean that Deputy FitzGerald wants to have covered any accident that might occur to a person while he is in a particular employment?&rdquo; Since the Deputy has given an example, could I give an example of the kind of thing I think Deputy O'Donovan has in mind and ask Deputy FitzGerald if he agrees that this is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal course of his employment a man comes home from work some evening, has a meal, and goes out with his friends to a pub.  On his way home for one reason or another he is involved in an accident and killed.  In those circumstances would <Col N="783" /> not Deputy FitzGerald's amendment apply and mean that he would be covered for that as against somebody who died from natural causes without any accident at all?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The answer is that an inevitable by-product of trying to ensure that you cannot be done out of your money through a legal quibble is that you have to over-protect.  If we drew up some other form of words which did not say &ldquo;in the course of his service&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the course of his occupation or employment&rdquo; and we did not go as far as &ldquo;during the years of his service&rdquo; and used some other phrase that lay between them, the courts would again start making decisions and we would find cases where the man in the view of the firm was engaged in something he would not have been engaged in but for his employment with them and should have got the money but the insurance company would not pay.</P>
      <P>If we are to ensure that the insurance company will pay up in any relevant case we have to define it more widely.  I can see no great harm in doing so.  If somebody benefits by an accident which has nothing whatever to do with his employment, what harm is that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that in defining these things the decisions of the courts can appear to the layman arbitrary and, indeed, self-contradictory and conflicting at times.  I do not think we should start inventing new phraseology here.  There are two forms of phraseology established by law as <Col N="784" /> far as I know.  One is &ldquo;in the course of his office or employment&rdquo; and the other is designed to ensure that no case can go wrong and that, where any accident occurs, the person will get the benefit and cannot be done out of it by the insurance company taking a strict legal view.</P>
      <P>If we attempt to come up with some new definition not now known to law, we will start a whole new body of law on this point and still some people will be ruled out.  What for? Why should we go to such trouble to help the lawyers when, in fact, by putting in the words I have suggested, the words in the UK Act, we can cover the case?  Why should we be so anxious to prevent people from getting benefit that we should insist that this must be so narrowly defined that employers will be forced to chose between adequately insuring their employees under the law as it stands, or cutting back their pension scheme rights?  I do not see any argument for this.</P>
      <P>All this talk about some widow somewhere else not doing as well shows a bureaucratic attitude of mind which should not inform our legislation. Given that we have to err on one side or the other in order to make the position legally clear, let us err on the generous side.  What harm if some people insured by their employers, if they have an accident, get an extra year's benefit?  Why should we begrudge it to them?  I do not see why our practice in this matter should be so much narrower and more stringent than the practice in Britain.  I press this point on the Minister and hope that he will agree to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>Do I understand that the Deputy is arguing something I would be in favour of, that is, that insurance companies generally are doing extremely well in the present inflationary age and could afford this kind of thing whereas an unfortunate widow could not afford to be done out of her compensation through a legal technicality?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the fact that Deputy FitzGerald did not deal with this point that he is now accepting what I said when I suggested that this matter cannot occur by inadvertence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not deal with that.  It would not occur by inadvertence in the sense that every employer would be brought in and told: &ldquo;Show us your accident insurance policy. How do you insure a man going on a business trip to London?  Do not do it that way again.&rdquo; This appears to be what is proposed and it seems to be an extraordinary performance.  The fact remains that in any large firm it could very well happen that, at some subsequent time years after the pensions scheme was cleared, an official in the relevant department dealing with accident insurance might get on to the insurance company and say the wrong words on the telephone, and the terrible crime would be committed that we must at all costs guard against; the man might be insured against an accident occurring in the course of his service and as a result the whole system would be prejudiced. This can occur by inadvertence.</P>
      <P>You cannot assume that because something is clear to the Revenue Commissioners, for the rest of the history of that firm every employee dealing with insurance will be aware of these legal quibbles and the strictness that has to be employed in the form of words where accident insurance is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald has now been put to the limit of his very considerable ingenuity to produce an example of inadvertence.  The fact of the matter is that, as I have said, when a scheme like this comes to be approved the question arises and is brought to the attention of the employer as to what the law will be. He is given a choice as to what kind of insurance scheme he will operate <Col N="786" /> for the benefit of his employees.  If he operates an insurance policy which is restricted to death or disability arising out of or in the course of his employment then there is no problem.</P>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;arising out of or in the course of the employment&rdquo; is well settled and there are many decisions on it arising out of the workmen's compensation code and now the occupational injuries code.  Speaking from recollection, I believe that the vast bulk of the decisions on the interpretation of this phrase is very much to the effect of widening its meaning in layman's terms.  I have seen some decisions on the interpretation of this which certainly to any layman would not be possible.  In circumstances in which any layman would say that it was not arising out of or in the course of the employment, the courts have held otherwise on a strict legal interpretation of the phrase.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the argument that this is a very restrictive feature.  In fact, I believe that this very wide-ranging interpretation of this phrase is the law at present as administered by the courts.  I repeat that it is open to the employer to make the decision as to which kind of policy will be entered into.  I do not think it is good enough to say that this is simply a bureaucratic approach.  One can say that but what one is really describing is an effort to achieve equity between taxpayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald may put it that way, but in effect what he is saying really is &ldquo;If there is any doubt about this, forget about any restrictions; open it up&rdquo; and of course the next thing is that you have to open it up all round.  I do not think there is any hardship being done to anybody, because the principle involved here&mdash;and this is what is at stake&mdash;is: should there be a special benefit for people whose employers effect a policy of insurance which covers them in respect of something which has nothing to do with their employment as against those who are <Col N="787" /> either restricted under the terms of the policy on the lines I have indicated, or for whom no policy is taken out?  That in effect is what Deputy FitzGerald is urging.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a question of being generous.  What we are dealing with here is the question of a superannuation scheme and its liability to or exemption from tax, and the Deputy is well aware that restrictions are necessary in order to ensure that there is not wide-scale avoidance of tax.  Without restrictions, this would be so.  What is being done here is, to my mind, something which is right in principle and also acceptable in practice, and I do not think that <Col N="788" /> anything Deputy FitzGerald has said has really got around either of those two fundamental points.  He has had to try to think of the most extreme kind of case to justify the case he is making.  One can do this in relation to any provision virtually of any Act of Parliament.  One can think of a most extreme case and show that arising out of this case there will be what would apparently be an injustice done to somebody.  One has to look at the other side of the coin and see whether it is justice or injustice consciously to set out to treat people differently under this code.  I do not think it is justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I should like to raise on interpretation. At the bottom of page 7 &ldquo;final remuneration&rdquo; is defined as annual average remuneration of the last three years of service.  This can give rise to a number of difficult issues.  You get cases in which people get ill towards the end of their working life.  The humane practice in the United Kingdom is to make provision for these by varying the strict legal interpretation of the words here.  I could have put down amendments to seek to do this but it seems to me preferable to seek clarification on Committee Stage and an assurance from the Minister that there would be a degree of flexibility applied here, as there is applied in Britain, in  the application of this definition.  I am, accordingly, asking the Minister to consider whether, in fact, it will be the practice here to deal with problems arising towards the end of a man's career in one of a number of different ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Britain, I understand &ldquo;final remuneration&rdquo; is defined as the highest average remuneration of any three consecutive years of the last ten years of service, which is more generous and wider than what is here, to begin with; in fact, not alone is the definition wider and more generous, but the practice allows for an even wider interpretation. For example, where an employee's health deteriorates in the last few years, with a consequent reduction in remuneration in the final year of employment, the United Kingdom practice makes provision for the employee either working on the basis of the remuneration for any one of the five years preceding the normal retiring date, remuneration meaning basic pay, plus fluctuating pay averaged over a period of five years or, alternatively, the average of the total emoluments for any three, or more, consecutive years ending not less than ten years before normal retirement date and, in order to determine the cash sum payable, that is, four times the &ldquo;final remuneration&rdquo;, the practice adopted in the United Kingdom is to take the annual rate of remuneration at death rather than to enter into the delays of the occasion by seeking certificates for <Col N="791" /> the previous three years.  Now I should like to ask the Minister whether these various interpretations, including the basic interpretation which is spelled out in the British Act&mdash;that is, any three consecutive years in the last ten years&mdash;will in fact be the practice here?  Will it be the practice to interpret the definition in lines 45 and 46 on page 7 in that way and to give them the other wider interpretations where illness arises in the closing years of a man's working life?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 15 (4) the Revenue Commissioners will have discretion in the approval of schemes and it will be possible to permit schemes to adopt other bases than that set out here as the definition of final remuneration where the circumstances so warrant.  When Deputy FitzGerald said that he could have put down amendments, but did not do so, he was, I think, getting at a point which comes up again here in that one cannot provide for every possible circumstances in the Bill because, if one does, one then excludes other circumstances which one might not have thought of.  It seems to me the provisions of section 15 (4) are the only practical way to approach this problem.  On foot of that provision the Revenue Commissioners will, as I said, have discretion to adopt or permit to be adopted, a basis of final remuneration other than that specified in that section where the circumstances so warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4) of section 15 specifies that the commissioners may in particular approve, by virtue of the subsection, a scheme which does one of four things.  My recollection is that when you get a section or subsection in that form, followed by a phrase like &ldquo;the Revenue Commissioners may in particular do any of the following four things&rdquo; that particularisation can in fact confine the operation of the section to the things that fall within those four headings. Bearing in mind the risk of that legal interpretation which can arise&mdash;I do not know if it will here; it is a technical point with which I am not sufficiently familiar&mdash;it seems to me none of these <Col N="792" /> four seems to cover the case I mentioned because the Minister will see that, No. 1, It deals with the matter of a scheme which exceeds the limits imposed by the prescribed conditions as respects benefits for less than 40 years service, or which allows benefits to be payable on retirement within ten years of the specified age, or which provides for the return in certain contingencies of employees' contributions and payment of interest (if any) on the contributions, or which relates to a trade or undertaking carried on only partly in the State and by a person not resident in the State.  None of these relates to the matter with which we are dealing and may it not be the case that the particularisation under these four headings of the power of discretion of the Revenue Commissioners might narrow down that power of discretion and prevent it being used in relation to the matter under discussion?</P>
      <P>If the answer to that were positive and the Minister could give me an explicit assurance that this is not the case and that the legal interpretation of this subsection will not be as narrow and restrictive as I have suggested it will be, could the Minister indicate the intention of the Revenue Commissioners, under his guidance, in this particular matter?  He has said in his view they will be able to vary the definition of &ldquo;final remuneration&rdquo; but what I want to know is whether the practice will be the kind of practice I have indicated and that, in fact, any three consecutive years in the last ten years will be accepted, first of all and that where there is a question of deteriorating health and falling remuneration the remuneration for any one of the preceding five years preceding the normal retirement date can be taken, or an average of the total emoluments for three or more consecutive years ending not less than ten years before the normal retiring date.  Is it the intention to operate in practice along these lines?  We should have an assurance on this before we proceed any further.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the introduction into paragraph (a) of subsection (3) of section 15 of the words &ldquo;or on earlier retirement through incapacity&rdquo;. An employee who has the misfortune to be incapacitated, and thereby prevented from serving the full term to normal retiring age, should be given <Col N="794" /> a pension based on his potential service to normal retirement age.  This is the position which operates in the UK in their new code.  It is a question of how one deals with this.  There are various ways of ensuring that this is the practice.  My amendment is for the purpose of securing this result but before pressing it I would like to hear from the Minister as to whether it is necessary or whether, although these words are here inserted, it will be possible to operate the same practice as that operated in the UK in this matter.</P>

All of the amendments proposed by Deputy FitzGerald would in practice be approved under the discretionary powers of the Revenue Commissioners.  But as I said earlier, if we begin trying to spell out every possible contingency, not only will we finish up with extremely complex legislation but we may well preclude some possible case that we have not thought of and which is not specified.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The preliminary remark I wish to make about all of these amendments is that they involve the setting out specifically in the Bill of certain procedures which Deputy FitzGerald would wish to see the Revenue Commissioners adopt in particular cases.  In each of the cases envisaged in the amendments the procedure indicated in the respective amendments would be adopted by the Revenue Commissioners on foot of their discretionary powers under subsection (4). On that basis I suggest to the House that the amendments are not necessary because the power is there already for the Revenue Commissioners to deal with such cases in this way.  I am telling the House that the Revenue Commissioners would deal with them in the way indicated in the amendments.  As I have said, to spell out in the Bill every possible contingency could have the unfortunate effect of tying the Revenue Commissioners rigidly and thereby taking away their discretionary powers. This might have the result of creating a difficulty as a case might arise which had not been thought of, and so be incapable of being dealt with in a reasonable way.  On the specific terms of amendments Nos. 2 and 4, the amendments are directed to the same point and they seek to alter in a minor respect the conditions for approval of a retirement benefits scheme.  One of the conditions laid down in section 15, subsection (3) (a) is that the benefit for an employee should be a pension on retirement at a specified <Col N="797" /> age, the pension not to exceed one sixtieth of the employee's final remuneration for each year of service up to a maximum of 40 years.</P>
      <P>These amendments seem to me to be intended to secure that approval may be given to a scheme which includes a provision to the effect that in the case of an employee who retires because of ill-health before the normal retirement age, his pension should be based on his potential service, not determined by reference to his actual years of service.  In his case the pension would be two-thirds, that is forty-sixtieths of his remuneration at the date of actual cessation of work and not say, one-third, or twenty-sixtieths if he retired after 20 years service on the grounds of ill health.</P>
      <P>If Deputy FitzGerald will accept that the conditions laid down in section 15 (3) (a) are not rigid and unalterable he will see that this amendment is not necessary.  The provisions for discretion by the Revenue Commissioners are contained in subsection (4) and enable the Revenue Commissioners to approve a scheme notwithstanding that it does not satisfy one or more of the prescribed conditions. That discretionary power would enable the commissioners to approve a scheme having the kind of provisions that are envisaged by Deputy FitzGerald in these two amendments.  In practice a scheme including such provisions and complying with the other conditions laid down would be approved and in these circumstances I submit that these two amendments are not necessary to achieve the desired result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief on this.  I agree with the Minister that the commissioners have the power. They have too much power but it is not the power they have but how they use it that worries me.  They are in the same position as the Land Commissioners who, as far as I can see, can do whatever they want and nobody has any way of dealing with them. Their decisions are always loaded against the taxpayer and it seems we have no power at present to alter that position.  They have too much power and I do not agree with Deputy FitzGerald about giving them more power.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="798" /> There is no use in giving power to those who will make life worse for us. The more power we give them the harder it will be for us to live or to pay tax.</P>

What opportunity has the taxpayer of defending himself against them?  I see none.  I know what I have gone through and I have suffered over the years and I believe so has every Deputy who is here for any reasonable time.  I can see no reason, whatever Deputy FitzGerald may say, to give them any more power.  I hope he will do his best&mdash;and I shall support him&mdash;to take whatever power they have from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That leaves me in a position of virtue which I am sure I shall quickly overcome and find something to say on the amendment.  I wonder if we should not distinguish between cases where amendments have to be devised with great difficulty in order to achieve a particular result <Col N="799" /> leaving the situation still woolly and unsatisfactory, or perhaps tightened up too much unintentionally, and where an exercise of discretion may be the most appropriate approach and cases where, to my mind, an amendment can do no harm and must help the position. To give an example, I take the second of my two amendments, No. 4, which says:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4) (b), page 10, line 33, after &ldquo;age,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on earlier incapacity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The wording at present is that the commissioners may, in particular, approve a scheme which allows benefits to be payable on retirement within ten years of the specified age.  I put in there, &ldquo;on earlier incapacity&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt? I think that is a misprint because I think the amendment should come in after the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;or on earlier retirement or incapacity&rdquo;.  Otherwise, the Deputy's amendment would have no meaning: the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; must come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I thought it was in, that I remembered correcting it.  Perhaps I am wrong and the Deputy is quite right.  The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is required there.  But the existing &ldquo;or&rdquo; must remain as well for reasons of linkage.  The amendment should read:</P>
      <P>or on earlier incapacity</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That amendment specifically authorises the exercise of the discretion in question.  I do not follow the reasoning of the Minister when on the one hand he goes right down through (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 15 (4), particularising ways in which discretion can be used, although the Minister says it is not desirable to particularise because of the dangers, and then when I propose an amendment to one of these, which I think is entirely appropriate to the purpose and helps to make clear how the discretion should be used, the Minister says: &ldquo;Do not let us particularise.&rdquo; If the Minister did not have paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) in the subsection I could take his point.  If a general discretion were given in the <Col N="800" /> subsection and if I were insisting on listing the things it could do I could understand him saying: &ldquo;Do not particularise; let us leave the discretion open&rdquo;.  But when he has particularised and I merely seek to extend that to the specific problem of earlier incapacity and when no argument is put up against my suggested wording I do not understand the Minister's objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe they are because they lay down some basic principles that are involved but, as I pointed out earlier, the use of the words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; on longstanding interpretation does not limit.

      <P>The Deputy is sceptical, an attitude quite widely shared.  The Minister has given a non-answer. He says these four paragraphs provide basic principles or something like that.  But if it is not necessary to particularise and if particularising does not affect the generality of the foregoing I still do not see why they should be there.  If (a), (b), (c) and (d) are necessary and if in particular (b) is necessary, I cannot see how (b) could be necessary in order to permit a discretion in relation to benefits being payable on retirement within ten years and how it could not be necessary to make similar provision in respect of earlier incapacity.  The Minister cannot really answer the case.  Once he puts in (b) and says it is necessary <Col N="801" /> then the words.  I have suggested are also necessary.  In telling me that my words are not necessary he is saying that (b) is unnecessary.  I should like him to get himself off the horns of that dilemma before we go any further.</P>

      <P>Why does Deputy FitzGerald propose that &ldquo;or on earlier retirement through incapacity&rdquo; be taken out of subsection (3) (a) and at the same time propose that they be put in, I think correctly, in subsection 4 (b)?  I cannot reconcile this.  It may be my stupidity but perhaps Deputy FitzGerald will explain why he proposes this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can explain it very adequately but the position as I understand it is that by including the words there it in some way inhibits giving an employee who is incapacitated a pension based on his potential service to the normal retiring age.  It is necessary therefore to take the words out there and to put them into the discretionary clause in section 15 (4).  That is my understanding. If the Deputy asked me to spell that out in logic I am afraid I could not do so but I am advised that it is necessary to do this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought so.  I do not follow the explanation given by Deputy FitzGerald about the adding of years.  I believe Deputy FitzGerald can be taken off the horns of this dilemma very easily on the basis that each of the amendments that he has put down suggests that in certain circumstances certain provisions ought to be applied by the Revenue Commissioners in considering the particular case.  I have put it on the record of the House that (a) the Revenue Commissioners are advised that under the provisions of section 15 (4) they are entitled to exercise the discretion that would enable them to do this and (b) in practice this is what they would do in such cases.  That being so I suggest that none of these amendments is necessary.  If we were to <Col N="803" /> put these in but omit many others&mdash; and I could produce a list of others that would be in the same type of category, that is making some minor changes in the provisions of the Bill&mdash; we could end up in very serious difficulty. I would suggest that the practical approach is the one I suggest&mdash;to rely on the discretion being given to the Revenue Commissioners having regard to the fact that in regard to each of the types of case to which Deputy FitzGerald has drawn attention in his amendments I have given an assurance to the House that in practice the Revenue Commissioners would operate their discretion on the lines suggested in these amendments.</P>

      <P>After all the trouble I went to, to give the Minister a chance! Would the Chair permit me to read through them and see whether I am in a position to accept what the Minister says?  I will have to check each of them separately.  Perhaps I could take a couple of them together not to keep the House too long. Amendment No. 3 is designed to deal with a problem where a widow of a pensioner may be limited to receiving an inadequate pension where her husband had commuted part of his pension under paragraph (e).  Do I take it that the Minister accepted the point in the amendment in the statement that discretion will be exercised?  Will it extend to this kind of case?  The Minister has assured us that the Revenue Commissioners will exercise discretion to meet the points I am making.  As I have not yet made the points&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are not explicit in the amendments which merely open up a possibility of discretion but do not indicate the way in which I feel it should be used.  It is necessary for me to put the point to the Minister as to whether in this instance, in particular, this would cover the case where a husband had commuted part of his pension, and that discretion would be exercised to ensure that the widow was not limited to receiving an inadequate pension on account of that.

      <P>Coming to amendment No. 5 my understanding was that the provisions there were excluded by <Col N="806" /> section 15 (3) (f) which states very firmly, if I may say so to the Minister, that no other benefits are payable under the scheme.  It has been put to me that, if we do not make some exclusion there for pensions for children or dependants of the employee, paragraph (f) will prevent discretion being exercised because it is so explicit. Is that not the case?  Despite paragraph (f) it will be possible to provide benefit in the form of pensions for children or the dependants of the employee?</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister a question?  The position at present in the civil service is that a widow gets half the pension plus the children's allowances to which she was entitled.  Amendment No. 3a says, &ldquo;shall not exceed, in the aggregate...&rdquo; Is this to be understood as excluding the widow?  Otherwise there is a reduction in the benefit which civil servants get at present.  I admit that this is a cross current.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2a.</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (3), to delete paragraph (c) and to substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  that any lump sum provided for any widow, children, dependants or personal representatives of an employee who dies before retirement shall not exceed, in the aggregate, four times the employee's final remuneration,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There appears to have been an oversight <Col N="808" /> in the drafting of section 15 subsection (3) and, as a result, the limits on superannuation benefits specified in subsection (3) apply to benefits taken by an employee or his widow only.  If we did not amend subsection (3) on the lines suggested in these amendments, no, limit would apply to the benefits payable under a superannuation scheme to children, dependants and personal representatives.</P>
    <P>The aim of limits of this kind is to prevent the avoidance of tax which would otherwise be lost in terms of the reliefs given in section 16.  At the same time, we are trying to strike a reasonable balance in the interests of the members of superannuation schemes.  In these circumstances it is essential that limits which are commensurate with those applicable to an employee or his widow should also apply to children and other dependants for the purposes of this chapter of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am moving these amendments, to make it clear that the limits would apply not only in the case of the member himself or his widow but also in the case of children, dependants or personal representatives. As I have said, the limitations, one in respect of lump sum and the other in respect of pension, are in line with the limits which are proposed in relation to benefits which would be going to the member of the scheme himself or his widow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have two dissonant remarks to make.  The first of these amendments&mdash;I can only speak historically&mdash;appears to me to be unduly generous and the second to be unduly restrictive.  The lump sum shall be four times the employee's final remuneration. Things have changed a lot, of course, but my recollection is that it was one year's salary.  I appreciate that with the changed circumstances, in which a widow can get half, there must be a different approach, but it does seem to me that four times the final remuneration is very generous in the case of a man who dies while in the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the other, I make the <Col N="809" /> point which I made earlier, that the total shall not in the aggregate exceed one-half of the pension and at present, as I understand it, the widow gets one-half and still draws the children's allowances, if she is a person whose husband in the service was entitled to children's allowances.  I would like to hear the Minister on this four times the final remuneration.  In the age in which we live, one cannot look after pensioners too well, or it is very difficult to look after them too well or well enough, but one of these amendments faces one way and the other the other way and perhaps the Minister would clear it up for me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in regard to the lump sum provision, as the Deputy says, the limitation proposed is four times the employee's final remuneration, his annual remuneration in the last year.  Lump sum provisions in superannuation schemes could provide for payments to the children, dependants or personal representatives of the employee as well as provision for a lump sum to the employee, so that the effect of what we are proposing here is that the aggregation of these lump sums together will not exceed four times the final remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section slightly improves the schedule of rates of estate duty.  However, with the inflation in the market value of property which has taken place it probably is the case that it has not kept pace.  I know that in the case of agricultural land relatively small farms are coming within the death duty net now as a result of the operation of the existing schedule. While the schedule introduced in section 26 is an improvement, it will not go the whole way to meet the problem. It has been found in Sweden that the operation of estate duty combined with the capital levy has resulted in the extinction, practically, of small family businesses.  We should endeavour to ensure that this does not occur here.</P>
      <P>A way could be found around this problem.  A problem which arises most commonly in rural areas in relation to farms and, probably, also, to a degree, in relation to other businesses, is that the estate duty leviable is so high relative to the earning capacity of the estate on an annual basis that portion of the estate has to be sold.  A way has been found around this in Britain where they have formed an estate duty corporation.  I have a very rough notion of what this is but I understand that it can take an interest in an estate or, in fact, take over the part of the property which would normally be sold and completely alienated, and lease it back to the original owner and, over a period of years, can collect the death duty which would have been paid, thereby preserving the existence of the business in its original form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> It is desirable, particularly in rural Ireland, that we should preserve farms and not have them fragmented, which is the danger arising from the existing estate duty code.  A body in the nature of an estate duty corporation could be set up which could purchase or take over the segment of the property which it would be necessary to sell and lease it back to the farmer and collect the death duty over a period in the form of rent.  Such a device might be a way of getting around the problem.  I cannot say that I am an expert on the matter but it is common case throughout rural Ireland that estate duty is falling heavily on relatively small farms and is causing considerable distress and is leading to the position that farms have to be fragmented in order to pay estate duty.  I would ask the Minister to consider this question carefully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just add that it is quite true, as Deputy Bruton says, that the real difficulty is to get cash to pay the estate duty?  This has occurred long since in relation to private companies.  Indeed, I heard a man who in this House would have been regarded as a very wealthy man moaning, to the amusement of some of his colleagues, about his son getting married.  He was worried sick that he might pass away and about the load the son would have to pay.</P>
      <P>I know that in the past the Estate Duty Office were very reasonable in the kind of value they put on small farms. There were certain limitations.  I do not know whether that applies any longer. If the valuation of the farm was £25 or under, they multiplied it a number of times and assessed accordingly.  If that does not apply any longer it would be a very small farm today that would be worth £20,000 and that would pay 12 per cent, which is approximately £2,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been remarked to me that there are two parts of this country: there is the city of Dublin where there is one kind of income, and there is rural Ireland, where there is a different kind of income.  I am talking about income. I am not talking about the wealth question that we had recently. The difficulty in relation to estate duty <Col N="814" /> is to get hold of the cash.  It is well known that the return on agricultural land in the past was about 2 per cent. This was an accepted figure.  If you take any figure of this sort&mdash;I am not talking about exceptionally good farmers like the Brutons, able farmers; I am talking about the ordinary farmer &mdash;what kind of return can he get on the capital which his farm would make if it could be sold?  Of course, it cannot be sold: it is a family farm that has been in the family, perhaps, for 200 years.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister on this problem.  Assuming that estate duty is now levied on the basis of what the farm would make if it were sold, it is a great difficulty for any family or any person inheriting the farm, who has to live by the farm, to lay his hands on that amount of cash.  He will have a millstone around his neck for many years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton suggested the setting up of a corporation through which estate duty could be paid.  Again, my recollection of estate duty is that once it is owed for more than a year it is subject to 5 per cent interest.</P>

How will he manage it? Will he go to the bank and get a loan and pay the estate duty, assuming that there is that much cash around? Perhaps the Minister would tell us what he thinks about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  Now, to keep this in perspective, I have to repeat something I said here before; approximately 4 per cent of all the cases in which estate duty is paid are farm cases.  There is some significance in that.  It may be argued that, with the increasing value of land, that percentage will change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the pattern over previous years was the same, or worse, or better, depending on one's point of view.  There is no evidence over previous years that the farm percentage is high and this figure of 4 per cent is just a freak.  On the contrary, this pattern of such a small percentage of cases being farm cases is the regular pattern year after year.  As I said, it may be argued that, with the increase in the value of farms, that pattern will change.  I do not dispute that this is possible, but one must wait and see if it is true before one accepts that it is the evolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are factors that operate here, such as the artificial valuation, to produce this kind of result.  Also, and I think this is of some relevance, when the rate of interest on outstanding death duty was 4 per cent only one in eight of the farm cases elected to pay death duty by instalments.  This is another benefit available in respect of farm property; the duty can be paid by instalments.  Only one in eight elected to pay by instalments when the interest rate was 4 per cent so this would seem to indicate that, certainly up to now, duty has not been a major problem for the farming community. Although one hears people talking about farms having to be sold, or some portion of them, in order to pay estate duty, the Revenue Commissioners are not aware&mdash;they were certainly not aware up to a short time <Col N="816" /> ago anyway, and I put this qualification in, because it is some time since they told me this&mdash;of any cases in which a farm had to be sold in order to pay duty.  There are cases in which a whole lot of debts have piled up and death duties constitute the last straw; but that is not the kind of case most people are concerned with; we are concerned with the ordinary case in which the debts are of reasonable proportions.  We know of no case in which it was necessary to sell a farm in order to pay death duties.</P>
    <P>I should remind the House, too, that last year we increased the exemptions in respect of property passing to widows or to widows with dependent children.  We are proposing now in this section to increase the exemption limit, which was £5,000 in 1960, to £7,500. This involves reduced rates on estates between £7,500 and £11,000.  Again, I must remind the House that, in assessing this in relation to farm land, one has to take account of this artificial valuation, which does not apply in all cases, but applies in very many cases and, as Deputy O'Donovan said, has the effect of including all small farms. On the figures I have given it clearly excluded more than small farms from liability to duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any figures on the size of the farm which in normal practice is excluded and the size which is included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I said 4 per cent of all the cases and it is quite clear from that that small and medium sized farms are excluded because, if they were included, the percentage would have to be higher than 4 per cent.  Under the changes made last year and by the provisions in this Bill relating to property&mdash;it does not relate to farms only, but it includes farms of course&mdash;where a widow is the only beneficiary an estate is exempted from duty if its value does not exceed £17,750.  Where there are two dependent children the limit will be £25,500.  Where there are five dependent children the limit will be £35,700 and where there are six dependent children the limit will be £38,095.  It is clear, therefore, that what we have been doing is of considerable importance to the most vulnerable <Col N="817" /> person in a situation like this, the widow or the widow with dependent children.</P>
      <P>The whole question of liability in respect of farms seems to me to be one that tends to be clouded with a certain kind of misty thinking because, on the one hand, we find it argued that farming is a business and that the farm is the capital and, to some extent, the equipment available to the farmer to run his business and should be treated as such and, on the other hand, in the case of businesses other than farming this problem arises, as Deputy O'Donovan said, just as acutely and the normal method of dealing with this kind of liability is to take out an insurance policy in respect of the liability.</P>

      <P>This is open to farmers or anybody else worried about possible liability to duty.  Deputy Bruton mentioned the arrangement in Britain.  I understand it is called the estate duty in investment trust.  It is a consortium of insurance companies and it is confined to taking up shares in private companies, without taking directorships, to provide money to pay duty. That is one way of approaching it. The point is it is a group of insurance companies who are doing it and it bears out my point: the approach to this problem of liability for duty, if the contingency is substantial, is to ensure against the contingency.  In the case of substantial farms, where the liability could be substantial, this is the right approach.  It is the businesslike approach and the one we are entitled, I think, to expect from large farmers.  They are engaged in business on a large scale.  It is quite clear from the statistics and the results that the incidence of death duties on the farming population in general has been far less than the incidence on any other section of the community. Statistics bear this out.  Due to the size of farm and the increasing value of farm land, substantial liability for duty may now be facing some farmers <Col N="818" /> and to that extent their approach should be that of people engaged in other businesses, that is, to take out an insurance policy in respect of this liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This gives me an opportunity to protest again against the way aggregation works.  It involves considerable hardship and resentment and most people will regard it as iniquitous that the value of death benefits should be doubly taxed on the recipients, first, by their aggregation and liability to duty on the capital value and, secondly, by the fact that it is mandatory for the major portion of the death benefits to be converted into an annuity for the dependants which is also taxable.  To tax the same amount of money twice is something that we are trying to avoid under VAT.  It is a pity that we cannot apply the same principle here in regard to estate duties. There is a principle here which we should stand by.  I protest also against any arrangement under which property passing to a widow is liable for estate duty.  When I raised this on Second Stage the Minister denied that the rationale was to prevent capital accumulating from generation to generation. I do not think, however, that he developed the thought as to what was the rationale other than raising money for the Government.  Given the undesirability in general terms of taxing capital the only justification for taxing <Col N="819" /> capital is to prevent wealth accumulating. If the Minister has reasons for trying to reduce the amount of capital by taxing it out of existence other than for the purpose of preventing the accumulating of wealth, I should like to hear them.  Capital must not accumulate in too few hands and, rightly, civilised governments tax capital in various ways designed to prevent that accumulation.  In our system that is done, not by taxing capital annually for which there is a lot to be said although there would be many problems attached to that practice, but by taxing capital as it moves from one generation to the next.  The taxation of widows is an anomaly in our system.  There is no case for it.  It is not that it is desirable to tax capital <i>per se.</i> It would be undesirable to do so.  It is not that it is undesirable to prevent it accumulating from one generation to the next because the widow is, <i>prima facie,</i> the same generation as her husband and it is only when capital passes to the next generation that it would be legitimate to tax it in that interest.  It is not because widows are particular accumulators of capital that their class must be tackled by special penal legislation to prevent capital accumulating among them.  They are not a particularly well known class of exploiters in the community, so why pick on them for special tax?  As there are no grounds, therefore, for taxing capital in general, there are no grounds for taxing it as it passes to someone in the same generation as the deceased.  There is no case whatever for taxing money that goes to widows so, perhaps, the Minister would give us his reason for this tax. In practice, money passes to the next generation except in cases where it goes to the widow.  The Minister's defence of this tax was extremely weak on Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also another possibility which apparently never enters the Deputy's mind.  The Deputy postulated before and again today that the rationale behind death duties was to ensure that capital would not be accumulated from generation to generation. If his version of the rationale were correct, there would be no duty levied on property passing to a widow but similarly there are to be no duties levied on property passing to a brother or a cousin or anybody of a similar generation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now changing feet.  That is not the case he made.  He poured forth on the basic rationale behind estate duty in this country which, he said, was to ensure the non-accumulation of capital in too few hands but also the passing on of wealth from one generation to another. His argument does not stand up but when I point that out to him now he talks about the special relationship between man and wife.  I confess that I am making a debating point because I think that is what the Deputy was trying to do.  There are difficulties, especially in our circumstances with the substantial importance of agriculture, in a proposition that property passing to a widow should not be liable to duty because in most cases farms would pass to widows who in many cases would be fairly old.  I doubt if Deputy FitzGerald would contend that this would be in the general social or economic interests of the country.  I am dealing with that merely as one of the many aspects of the matter that arise.  On this section we are proposing to do something that is in favour of the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is purely a technical section but it has very important practical applications particularly in relation to double taxation relief.  It provides that, as from the date of the passing of this Bill, foreign debts shall, for the purpose of estate duty, be deductible from all foreign assets.  That is the whole foreign estate, both real and personal, and not from foreign personal estate only as is the present law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A practical example of what can happen would illustrate what we are getting at.  If a person dies domiciled in England leaving personal estate here and if by reason of certain debts he had in Britain his English personal estate is deficient but his real estate in England is quite substantial, what happens is that the deficiency in the English personalty must be allowed against the Irish personalty even though there are sufficient assets in the form of real property in England to meet it. I do not know if that is clear but I can tell Deputy O'Donovan that because of this state of the law certain smart people have arranged or attempted to arrange their affairs so as to bring about a situation like this and thereby save very considerable <Col N="822" /> sums in estate duty.  What we are saying in this section is that where a person has property abroad which is liable to duty, all of that property should be subject to his debts abroad and, not just personalty abroad.  In other words&mdash;does the Deputy wish me to go further?  There is a danger that the further I go the more complex it will become.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand that because the explanatory memorandum refers to debts being deductible and this section appears to extend the scope of deductibility of debts.  Would I be correct in believing that it would be in the interests of the successors to the estate to extend the scope of the deductibility of debts so that in a case where, for instance, the debts on the personal estate might exceed the actual assets of the personal estate, while up to now they could not be used to subtract from the real estate they could, as a result of this proposal be so used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is quite right.  I shall try to give another example.  Assume a person dies domiciled in this State possessed of Irish personal estate worth £400,000 net and English personal estate worth £90,000 gross and English real estate worth £250,000.  If the debts in England, say, amount to £300,000, for instance, an unsecured bank overdraft, the British Revenue would then get estate duty on £40,000 made up of the £90,000 gross personalty in England plus the £250,000 realty, minus the £300,000 debts, and that, calculated at the appropriate rate of 24 per cent would amount to £9,600. Duty is payable here on £190,000 made up of the net Irish personal estate of £400,000 less the deficiency on the English personal estate, which amounts in this case to £210,000.  In that case no claim for duty arises here in respect of the real property situated <Col N="823" /> in England because of section 37 (2) of the 1971 Finance Act.  This £210,000 which was deducted both in England and in Ireland escapes duty here although there was sufficient English real property to meet it.</P>
      <P>This is a very highly artificial situation which arises from the present provisions.  In the case mentioned, £210,000 was allowed as a deduction in effect here although there were sufficient assets available in England to meet it.  By deleting the word &ldquo;personal&rdquo; from the relevant provision of the 1894 Act we get to the situation where we say that the property in England was sufficient to pay these debts.  We should say that unless the property in England or abroad was insufficient, then these debts should not be deducted against the Irish personalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for this section has become evident and in principle it is acceptable.  That does not mean it is comprehensible.  People more learned than I in these matters have described it as incomprehensible. In so far as one's limited understanding goes it appears to do something useful but there are some difficulties about it.  It appears that something similar was done in last year's Finance Act in respect of companies and that in it the words &ldquo;income or benefit&rdquo; were used and here the word is &ldquo;payment&rdquo;. It has been put to me that it is puzzling that where you are dealing with it from one point of view you use &ldquo;income or benefit&rdquo; and from another point of view you use &ldquo;payment&rdquo;.  The Minister might explain this to me.</P>
      <P>More important is the fact that what it does is to repeal a section of the 1965 Act which, like so many parts of that Act, has turned out to be unworkable. It must be the worst piece of legislation in the financial field this country has seen possibly in the lifetime of this State.  The fact that we have to keep on amending it year after year reflects no credit on it.  It was not one of the happier features of the Ministerial career of the present Taoiseach when he spent a brief period in Finance and left as his memorial this constantly changing edifice which has been chipped away at year by year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem which I raised on the Second Stage&mdash;I always believe it is useful to mention matters on Second Stage so as to alert the Minister and his officials to them&mdash;the fact that section 20 (4) (b) (i) of the 1965 Finance Act depends for its workability on section 21 (5) of that Act.  We are now getting rid of section 21 of the 1965 Finance Act and in so doing we are getting rid of the subsection upon which the operation of section 20 depends, section 20 being a continuing part of our legislation since it is not being amended or repealed.  Having got rid of it we are substituting something and it can be argued that subsection (6) of the section we are dealing <Col N="825" /> with in this Bill takes the place of subsection (5) of section 21 of the 1965 Act.  I do not know what principle of legislation there is that permits one to assimilate a somewhat differently worded and not specially identified subsection of a new Bill for a subsection of another Bill which is required for the interpretation of another part of that Bill.  It does not seem to me that legislation can be left that loose.  Secondly, the wording of this subsection does not seem to me to lend itself to the purpose of propping up section 24 (b) (i) because in line 5 of page 20 there is a reference to payment of income at an annual rate of six divided by the number of objects of the trust of full age including the deceased. That is something which cannot be used outside the sphere of persons. The idea of a company of full age is a novel one from the point of view of legislation.  It does not seem to me that one can use the new subsection (6) of this section to prop up section 24 (b) (i) of the original Act. I should like the Minister to explain whether he suggests it can be so propped up or is there not a need for an amendment to section 20 as well? Maybe there is a missing link I have not detected but I think there is a defect here that needs to be looked at.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (b) provides:</P>
      <P>...shall be deemed to be an annuity equivalent to the average annual amount received or enjoyed by way of income or benefits in the relevant period, that is to say, the period of five years immediately preceding the death of the deceased and in relation to the said interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not just occupation.  The Minister was misled if he was relying on that being the only phrase because it is &ldquo;occupation or possession&rdquo;.  We are talking of a case of the possession by a company of some property and we are asked to determine that by reference to a section which, as now amended, refers to the question of whether the objects of the trust are of full age.  If one of the objects of the trust happens to be a company I do not see how it can be of full age.</P>

      <P>Only one object of the trust has to be deceased.  The others do not and they could be companies and they could be companies in possession, not in occupation.  That is what it says here. If the Minister can explain how this could apply to a company, fair enough.  If not, an amendment is required to section 20 of the 1965 Act.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admits he is not clear and I will admit that I am not entirely clear either. I am trying to get it clear.  That is why I raised the matter.  I am quite open to being told I misunderstood it.  Subsection (4) of section 20 of the 1965 Act provides:</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the deceased had at any time, whether before or after the passing of this Act, made a disposition of property in favour of a company controlled by the deceased, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  he was at any time within five years of his death in receipt or enjoyment of income or benefits from the company other than dividends or interest...</P>
      <P>he shall be deemed to have had an interest ceasing on his death in the net assets of the company within the meaning of paragraph (b)...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> An interest in a company.  Paragraph (b) provides:</P>
    <P>The interest to which paragraph (a) of this subsection refers shall be deemed to be an annuity equivalent to the average annual amount received or enjoyed by way of income or benefits in the relevant period, that is to say, the period of five years immediately preceding the death of the deceased and in relation to the said interests the following provisions shall apply:</P>
    <P>(i)  where the benefits enjoyed consist of or include the occupation or possession of lands or chattels, the value...is determined under the provisions of subsection (5) of section 21 of this Act.</P>
    <P>These are benefits enjoyed by companies, I understand at this stage, and yet they have to be determined by reference to the question of the number of objects of the trust of full age. These objects of the trust could be companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now coming to the end of subsection (6) of the current Bill.  That is where the full age comes in.  In section 20 of the 1965 Act we are referred to a subsection of section 21 which is now substituted by this subsection.  It does not seem to me that we can use this subsection for that purpose where companies are concerned. I am not claiming to understand it fully, and I may have missed a point somewhere, but it all seems to me to be about companies, or potentially about companies, and they cannot be of full age.  I do not want to hold up the House.  Perhaps the Minister would look at it between now and Report Stage and he may be able to offer clarification and reassurance or, perhaps an amendment if I have a point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the House to bear with me for a moment.  I think I was tending to deal with other points. May I take it that the point being made by Deputy FitzGerald is in relation to the phrase at the end of subsection (6)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> The words in brackets are &ldquo;divided by the number of objects of the trust of full age including the deceased&rdquo;.  He is saying that one of the objects of the trust could be a company and, that being so, how would you determine the meaning of the words in brackets because you cannot determine whether a company is of full age, and, therefore, it is not applicable at all.  Is this the point he is making?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the net point because it relates back to the problem of operating section 20 of the 1965 Act. If the Minister can say that none of the objects of the trust could be a company, OK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I would say is that clearly, as Deputy FitzGerald says, the question of being of full age is meaningless in relation to a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I say the subsection is entirely inappropriate to be used to work section 20 of the 1965 Act.  That is my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the reasonable commonsense approach to this should be that, since you cannot determine whether or not a company is of full age, you relate the question of full age to persons, and if one of the objects of the trust is a company the question of whether it is of full age does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what a court would do&mdash;whether it would rule that it is so meaningless as to be inapplicable or that an object of a trust of full age can mean a company and that the question of the age of the company is irrelevant.  I cannot say what the court would say but our object should be to legislate with sufficient <Col N="831" /> precision, clarity and commonsense that the legislation is usable and meaningful to the people using it.  It seems to me much simpler to avoid the dangers inherent in this, where I might have one view if I were sitting in the High Court and the Minister another view, with it all depending on what the third judge decided, on which way he went, by simply putting into the Bill the appropriate amendment to deal with the problem in respect of section 29 of the 1965 Act.  The Minister could look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>
      <P>We should not waste too much time on a technical point but there is sufficient ambiguity involved and the whole link is so tenuous&mdash;the fact that you have to apply the Interpretation Act and see whether there is a subsection sufficiently similar in form to that in the original 1965 Act as to be usable for purposes of the Interpretation Act, and then examine it and if necessary assume that if the words &ldquo;full age&rdquo; are not there, it is inapplicable&mdash;that it should be looked at.  Why do it in that roundabout way, this devious way, instead of by means of a simple amendment to give effect to section 29 of the 1965 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find with some more bitter experience of the Finance Bill that, especially in relation to estate duty, to talk about making quite a simple amendment is far from what seems to be possible.

The Report Stage will be very brief and can be given next week but it would be quite wrong to put the Bill through without having time to consider the points made.

      <P>It does appear that the issue is not a matter of principle but simply whether or not the words mean what the Minister claims they mean and what Deputy FitzGerald claims they do not mean.  It is a question of fact and surely it would be foolish to hold up the Bill on that point, that the <Col N="833" /> Minister is attempting to do something and Deputy FitzGerald claims he is not doing it the right way to copper-fasten it and suggests another way. Surely the proper thing to do is to have the matter looked at and, if necessary, corrected?

There are other matters on which in the limited time available since the Bill was published, it was impossible to get sufficient advice and in respect of which I would have put down amendments on Committee Stage but had not time to get that advice.

      <P>I am glad Deputy Bruton raised this question because he reminded me of a point I wanted to make in reply to a point made by Deputy FitzGerald earlier and which I omitted to make in the rush of dealing with other points.  In fact, the amendment of this section became necessary because of a decision of the High Court in a particular case.  I do not know if it will mean anything to the House but in the hope that it will let me say that the net effect of the judgment is that property could be settled on trust for A contingently on his attaining a certain age and, on his failure to attain that age, for B, contingently on his attaining a certain age and, on his failure to attain that age, for C and D, contingently on their attaining the age of 21 years, with power to the trustee to apply the income at his discretion for the benefit of &ldquo;any person immediately contingently entitled to the capital&rdquo;; and no claim for estate duty would arise on the death of A before the specified age although he might have been in receipt of the entire income.  But, if the certain age were fixed high enough, duty could be avoided indefinitely; it is because of this High Court decision &mdash;on an interpretation of subsection (2) of section 21.</P>

I did say that he reminded me of a point I wanted <Col N="836" /> to make.  Deputy FitzGerald, in the course of talking about this section and making a number of rather more technical points, made a blatantly political point which I omitted to deal with and that was when he tried to make out that the Taoiseach was responsible, as Minister for Finance, for &mdash;I cannot remember his exact words but certainly the implication was&mdash;the worst piece of financial legislation we had in this country.</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is, and it is very important that it should be realised by Deputy FitzGerald and others, what really happens in relation to the tax avoidance measures in practice is that in Britain certain loopholes are discovered; legislation is brought in to close the loopholes; that draws the attention of certain professional people here to these loopholes and they start operating them.  When they do, we have to close the loopholes.  That is the pattern that goes on time after time after time.  This explains why people think that we are simply following British legislation in this matter.  The fact is that it is people who are trying to avoid liability for duty, income tax and so on, who are following the British and we have to follow it to close the loophole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble and they present us with this problem. Because of this it is inevitable that various Finance Bills, but particularly those which are designed to close loopholes on any large scale, will be the subject of numerous amendments time after time as further loopholes are discovered.  That is what happened in relation to the 1965 Act.  It certainly <Col N="837" /> is no reflection on the then Minister for Finance and it is a rather low point for Deputy FitzGerald to try to bring in in relation to the present Taoiseach.  It does not stand up to examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation about loopholes that it is designed to close.  I do not think that could be seen as explaining all the additions to section 21 of the Finance Act of 1965 but, then, I cannot query the Minister too deeply on this matter because of lack of knowledge.  It seems to me that problems may arise.  It seems that the word &ldquo;deceased&rdquo; used here and in the definition in subsection (1), is defined by reference to subsection (2) but, as far as I can see, the word &ldquo;deceased&rdquo; is not used in subsection (2) other than within brackets and is not really defined at all.  I wonder if that is a proper definition section.  Again, the words &ldquo;market value&rdquo; are defined by reference to subsection (6).  The words are used once in subsection (6) but do not seem to be explained to any great degree in subsection (6).</P>
      <P>I wonder, therefore, if this is the most desirable way of defining these terms and if a better way could not be found.  Could they not be defined in a self-contained definition section rather than by reference to another subsection in which the definition is not very clear?  Could they not be defined in the same way as the words &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; for instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The two definitions are, I think, quite satisfactory.  It is true, as the Deputy says, that the word &ldquo;deceased&rdquo; in subsection (2) appears in brackets, but it is the words outside the brackets which constitute the definition.</P>

      <P>I can foresee a certain amount of confusion, particulary in regard to the words &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  I wonder if the definition of trustee is not, perhaps, too wide:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;trustee&rdquo; includes any person who, whether the property the subject of the trust is vested in him or not, exercises or has a discretion to exercise a power or make a decision in relation to the nature or extent of, or any matter affecting, a payment under a trust of the kind referred to in subsection (2) of this section.</P>
      <P>Is it necessary to put in &ldquo;or any matter affecting&rdquo;?  Does this not make it very wide?  Some very simple matter in relation to the mechanics of a payment, by cash or by cheque, could only be determined by someone else and he could become a trustee within the meaning of the section.  Is that of any significance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (8) is designed to align discretionary trusts with non-discretionary trusts.  Section 24 of the Finance Act of 1940 was designed to prevent an avoidance of duty through the creation of foreign trusts by persons who were domiciled here.  It applies to settled movable property.  There is a doubt as to whether property in some discretionary trusts is settled within the definition of the Finance Act of 1894 and the object of subsection (8) here is to put discretionary trusts in line with non-discretionary trusts so far as these definitions are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding subsection (10), since section 32 will operate to give claims for duty if a discretionary trust is wound up within five years preceding the death of the deceased as defined in the section, it is reasonable that a trustee be given the same protection as is given to the trustee of mandatory trusts which are wound up within five years preceding the death of a life tenant. Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1955, provides that if property ceases to be comprised in a settlement the trustee may obtain from the Revenue Commissioners a certificate of the prospective amount of duty.  His liability as a trustee will not exceed the amount so certified by the Revenue Commissioners. Of course, if the amount so certified turns out to be under-estimated the excess over the amount certified may be claimed from the beneficiaries. The liability of a trustee is <Col N="844" /> limited to the amount certified by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Subsection (10) proposes to apply the same kind of procedure to a trustee of a discretionary trust as is applied at the moment under section 11 of the 1955 Finance Act in the case of a trustee of a mandatory trust.</P>

      <P>This section is designed to meet a demand that there should be a form of appeal tribunal in estate duty matters which would correspond to the appeals commissioners in income <Col N="845" /> tax.  The appeal will be to the appeals commissioners in relation to the valuation for estate duty purposes of non-quoted shares.  I received representations in this regard on a number of occasions.  While there is a right of appeal to the court, there is a feeling that this involves expense and difficulty and that there is a tendency to let the matter go at the valuation fixed by the Revenue Commissioners rather than go to court.  I do not know whether that is true, but, in case it might be, I am proposing here this form of appeal to the appeals commissioners from whom also, of course, there would be an appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>The section is designed to counteract a device adopted by trading companies to avoid the charge to corporation profits tax on their profits.  The device takes the form of introducing into the memorandum or articles of association of a company preclusion of the distribution of the profits to members.  Prior to Budget Day this preclusion entitled the company to exemption from corporation profits tax.  Subsequently, the preclusion could be removed and the profits which had escaped the tax could then be distributed.  This is closing the loophole but in the next section, section 39, we are preserving the position of the genuine companies which should be entitled to this exemption.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;( ) Section 246 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (1) after `Part XV' of `other than an initial allowance made by virtue of section 251 (4) (d) of this Act'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the giving of the concession of free depreciation in the case of a new ship on which capital expenditure has been incurred before the 1st April, 1973, which ship cannot be brought into use before that date, will not result in the consequential loss of investment allowance in respect of that ship.  There is no problem where the ship has been brought into use before the date specified. There is a corresponding benefit for other items of investment but this one relates specifically to the investment in a ship where the investment has been made or capital expenditure incurred before the 1st April, 1973, but which has not been brought into use before that date.</P>

      <P>This is simply a drafting amendment dealing with the collective citation of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act under which credit unions are registered.  In fact the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1971, provides that the various Acts relating to industrial and provident societies were to be cited together as the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1971.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did raise a point here and I suppose it applies also to section 44 in regard to the retrospective element.  This arises, I think, from a particular case that has arisen. It is rather unfortunate where a case arises which shows a defect in the law and the Dáil amends the law so as to put it right, the person concerned does not get the benefit of the anomaly being remedied unless there is retrospection. Could the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners be used in this case, or to deal with cases of this kind, especially the case which may have given rise to this amendment being brought in?  I have had representations made to me in respect of this particular case and I should like to press this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties in matters such as this is that retrospection of a benefit can lead to various complications which are difficult to unscramble having regard to the fact that many cases will have been completed and arrangements made perhaps as between the different beneficiaries under a will.  While it is theoretically possible to unscramble it, it can present a great deal of practical difficulties and, while I have a good deal of sympathy with the idea, I think in practice it would not be very feasible. It is unfortunate, I agree, but all we can say about it is that it is much better that it should be done now rather than not done at all even though it does mean that some people who might have benefited in the past do not benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was dealing with the question of differential rents.  As I said, in my area we have not had any rent strikes or anything of that nature.  The tenants are very co-operative and level-headed people.  There is grave dissatisfaction with differential rents in general.  There are certain problems arising in connection with differential rents which the Minister should look into.  It is his duty to consult with the tenants in other areas who are protesting about these rents and at least talk to them.  As I said before, you lose nothing by talking, and you give people a chance to <Col N="854" /> air their views.  This takes some of the urgency and dissatisfaction out of the situation.</P>
      <P>One of the problems which arises in connection with differential rents is that a small part of the children's wages is allowed, and the rest is put on to the income of the house, whether or not the parents get a contribution from the children.  Naturally they should but in many cases the contribution by the children is quite small, and sometimes it is nil.  People have a grievance that their children's earnings are taken into consideration for rent purposes.</P>
      <P>A major bone of contention is overtime. A constituent said to me last week that they do not have to pay increased rent when they are earning the overtime.  A person can earn large amounts of overtime in one year.  He then submits a certificate of wages and he is assessed for the coming year on his previous year's earnings.  There might be no overtime the next year and in the year when he is not earning overtime he must pay increased rent. Some people do not object too much to paying on the overtime, but others feel very strongly about it.  At least it should be charged when the person is earning it.  It is a grave injustice to charge a person an increased rent on overtime when he is not earning it. The Minister should have a look at that matter.</P>
      <P>Another bone of contention is that some tenants are working for State bodies or large concerns and their wages are returned to the last halfpenny. I am sure the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are aware that incorrect statements of wages are submitted by employers in many cases. It is very difficult to get a proper assessment of wages from self-employed people, a large number of whom live in council houses.  You could have one person in one house paying a large rent and the person in the house beside him, perhaps with the same income or a larger income, paying less rent.  These are matters that arise.  The Minister should review them because they cause unrest.  He should look into them before they get out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> I was very pleased when the recent amenity scheme was introduced by the Minister.  The amount of money allotted is rather small, £300,000, to cover the country.  At least it is a start.  The Minister has taken a step in the right direction.  He has covered a fairly wide area and the emphasis is on giving this money to people who help themselves.  This is good because the people who get out, and stop complaining, and help themselves, deserve to be helped.  I commend the Minister for this scheme and I hope that next year, if he is still in office, he will expand the scheme in his Estimate.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how this money is allocated.  In Kilkenny we were very disappointed that our share of this £300,000 was £4,500.  This is a very small slice of this money.  The councillors in Kilkenny have a genuine grievance because our share is so small.  I learned that the allocation to the Minister's constituency is £12,500. I wonder why this should be allocated to the Minister's constituency while only £4,500 was allotted to Kilkenny.  Is his constituency three times bigger than Kilkenny, or is the population three times bigger?  I would be grateful if the Minister could explain that.</P>
    <P>In Kilkenny also, there is a grievance about the size of the national primary roads grant.  This grant should be increased. It was decreased for the past two years and this year it was brought back to what it was three years ago. You could not hope to do the same amount of work now as you would do three years ago with the same amount of money.  Large sums of money are now coming from the rural areas into the Exchequer through motor taxation and so on, and they should get back their fair share of that money for roads.</P>
    <P>I found on inquiry that our share of the grant for the upkeep of the national primary roads was £440 per mile.  In south Tipperary it is £1,000 per mile and in Wexford it is something like £600 per mile.  Like the amenity scheme, there is general concern that our area should not be downgraded. <Col N="856" /> I would ask the Minister to have a look at that matter and to do something about it, and give us an increased allocation of cash for these roads.</P>
    <P>I would also ask that he give us our allotment of money a number of years in advance and tell us what we are getting.  It has happened over the past few years that we did not even have the road grants for our rates meeting. I think that under protest last year we got notification on the morning of the rates meeting of the amount of the allotment.  This is not good business and I feel that it is a smart way adopted by the Department of having the local council pass the rates for road grants and then give what they like.  This will not be tolerated any longer.  Not alone should they have notice in time but the local surveyor should be allowed to plan ahead and get worthwhile plans for roads set up.</P>
    <P>A matter which is very disturbing to most people now is the great number of fires taking place at present. We have almost become so used to and callous about multiple deaths in fires that we would almost want to see a situation in which a dozen people are burned in a fire before we would think about it a second time.  This is a very serious situation because the number of fires is growing.  The Department will have to look seriously at our fire regulations.  There is one section in respect of which there is great laxity, that is, fire protection in hospitals, and most especially in county homes.  I have visited all the county homes in my area over the past 12 months and have been amazed by the lack of proper fire protection.  We find fire escapes from third-storey floors from which people, especially bedridden people, have no hope of getting out of and it is only through the goodness of God that we have not had a tragedy.  This situation must be taken seriously and we must not wait for tragedies to occur to prod us into action.  The time to do it is before a tragedy occurs.  We have had many discussions at health board meetings about getting people from third floor accommodation in these county homes by means of chutes and I would hate <Col N="857" /> to see a fire start in these places because they are in themselves fire-traps. They are old buildings, many of them with much timber content and, as I say, it is only by the grace of God that one of these does not go up and leave us with a major tragedy.</P>
    <P>I complain also about many of the flats which are being used, buildings which are not fit for human habitation but are being used by young couples while waiting to be housed. These are rickety old buildings and the stairs are in such a condition that if you wanted to make fast exit, you would probably die in the attempt. These are continually being let in flats and there are people on the second, third and fourth storeys in somes cases in these houses, with no fire protection whatever.  I have said before that we cannot leave people on the streets.  We cannot simply ban these types of flats because these people must be housed somewhere, and but for that situation people would not be allowed into these dwellings, but if we let them in, we must put some regulation in force which will ensure safety in case of fire.  I would not like to be living in one of these places if a fire broke out, as I say.</P>
    <P>I should like also to compliment the fire services throughout the country. These men are a most dedicated and loyal band of servants and are doing a wonderful job.  These part-time men throughout the country and the fulltime men in Dublin are certainly giving the ratepayers their money's worth.  I cannot compliment them too highly.  It strikes me that we should ask our fire chiefs to help out in making premises safer&mdash;in bringing home to people the need for fire precautions and in having buildings put in such a state that if people want to make a quick exit, this will be possible.  Above all, we should have proper fire extinguishers available in places where a number of people work.  This could be done from the fire stations and it may be necessary to employ a man for this purpose, but it would be a worthwhile exercise to put a man in charge of getting a fire extinguisher into every home and also to provide a service for the refilling of <Col N="858" /> these extinguishers.  There are many places in which there are fire extinguishers which have been used but never refilled.  They might as well not have a fire extinguisher, so I think it would be a very good extension of the fire services to have these provided. I know that the local authorities will get the utmost co-operation from the fire chiefs and their staffs.</P>
    <P>We have had in operation a systen of relief of rates for certain pensioners and people in great hardship.  I do not think this relief has gone far enough. It covers non-contributory pensioners of all kinds and people in great hardship, but I think it could at least be extended to cover contributory pensioners because most of these people have no other means and do not apply for it because they think they are not entitled to it.  I know that certain contributory pensioners are engaged at work and have fair jobs, but the majority have only the pension and there is very little difference between it and the non-contributory pension so that when this scheme is being launched again, it could be expanded to include these pensioners.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the cost of this scheme should be borne by the ratepayers who are being asked to carry their less well off brethren.  This we would not object to at all if they were not people who are nearly on the breadline because they cannot pay their rates.  Unfortunate people on fixed incomes, small business people, people with small shops should not be asked to carry this burden of subsidising the less well off people in our community.  The Minister should have a look at it and decide to put the charge on central funds.  It is a very laudable scheme but the cost of it should not be put on the already overburdened ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The house purchase scheme is a failure.  There was a very small number of applications last year and I expect the number in the coming year will be smaller still.  When the scheme was first introduced the houses were virtually given away.  Then we went from one extreme to the other and now we are being asked to charge the market value.  What is the market <Col N="859" /> value?  Certain houses have been purchased at big prices.  When there is a great demand for houses the law of supply and demand operates.  If complete blocks of houses were sold, the market value would operate.  The value at the moment is affected by the law of supply and demand.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny Corporation last year were given prices by the local engineer, a very conscientious man, who placed a value on these houses to the best of his ability, being fair to all sections. In most cases the value he suggested was adopted by the corporation.  In the case of a few houses situated in areas which may have been subject to flooding, or where other factors came into operation, the price was reduced by the corporation.  The scheme produced by the engineer was submitted to the Department and they increased the prices.  This is not being realistic.  The Department are not interested in selling houses any more. Some of the tenants have been living in these houses for 50 years.  The houses have been paid for ten times over.  These tenants are not getting a change to purchase.  They missed the first scheme when the houses were being given away.  Now they have no hope of purchasing and owning their homes.  I would ask the Minister to examine this matter.</P>
    <P>A burning question is the amount of money allocated to County Kilkenny for local improvements.  We get the princely sum of £4,000.  I put down a question some time ago asking for the allocation in other counties.  I learned that the Minister's county was getting £65,000 under the scheme.  That is 16 times the allocation for Kilkenny. I cannot imagine that in the Minister's county the area is 16 times as great, the population is 16 times as great or the amount of work to be done is 16 times as great.  An allocation of £4,000 to Kilkenny for local improvements is not realistic.  Kilkenny is not getting a fair deal in this matter.</P>
    <P>There is great demand in rural areas for the improvement of laneways into houses so that the occupants can drive their cars to their houses.  Some of these laneways are in <Col N="860" /> a dreadful condition.  It is nearly impossible to walk along these lanes unless one is wearing rubber boots. School children have to wear rubber boots all the year round.  Farmers living along such laneways are deprived of services.  Bulk lorries cannot get to their houses.  In many cases the vet and the doctor will not travel along these laneways and I would not blame them.  If I thought anything of my car I would not travel along these laneways.</P>
    <P>If we want to maintain the young men in rural Ireland, every possible facility must be provided.  Progressive young men have borrowed money and have purchased modern machinery. Many of them have bulk tanks.  The bulk lorry cannot get to their premises because of the condition of the laneways. In a number of cases young men who have inherited the family farm found it impossible to remain there because of the condition of the roads and the absence of any hope of any work being done on them.  In many cases the people cannot afford to carry out the work out of their own resources.</P>
    <P>There is a waiting list in Kilkenny for rural improvements covering a period of six years.  The period would be 12 or 15 years if it were not for the fact that people do not apply when they learn of the six year waiting list.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny County Council have a scheme whereby lanes are improved free of charge for some of these people but the amount we can spend in this way is limited because we cannot overburden the rates with charges of this nature.  We were making good progress but for the last four years we were refused permission by the Department to raise the necessary loans.  This year we have raised the money directly from the rates and have not sought permission to raise loans.  In this way we can help the people concerned to some extent.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny is not getting its fair share of the allocation for local improvement schemes.  I would ask the Minister to improve the allocation as a matter of urgency and to give Kilkenny a fair share of the grants for this very necessary work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> I would ask the Minister to examine as a matter of urgency the question of the provision of houses, not alone in Kilkenny but throughout the country. This is a top priority.  Some Deputies have said that the Minister is doing a fair job, building a fair number of houses.  It is not a fair job in relation to the demand and the general shortage of houses.  The Minister will have to do a great deal more. There must be a big increase in housing output.  The least we can give people is a roof over their heads to enable them to rear their families in frugal comfort.  No citizen must be deprived of this right.  It is the top priority for any Minister for Local Government.  If the Minister does a good job in this respect it can be said that he is making a success of his Department.</P>

Tá súil agam go ndéanfar níos mó.</P>
      <P>The functions and activities of the Department of Local Government are so diverse and so wideranging that it is quite understandable that the debate here on local government should follow a very broad pattern.  It is quite obvious from listening to the speakers here and to the Minister's opening statement that the Department of Local Government is concerned with extremely important matters, some of which take precedence and priority over others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister devoted a large part of his speech to housing.  I commend him on the way in which he dealt with the subject.  I should also like to commend him on the worthwhile work he has <Col N="862" /> done since he took office.  If, in the course of my remarks, I indicate certain aspects about housing which do not satisfy me, I know that the Minister will not treat what I say as adverse criticism but will accept it as an exhortation to him to continue the good work he has been doing.</P>
    <P>It is a truism that it is the ambition of every human being not that he should live in a house but that he should own his own house.  That is a natural and an understandable ambition. It should be our aim to provide every man with his own home. This is the goal towards which we should strike.  We should not think in terms of renting houses; renting houses should be a last resort.  Our first aim should be to assist people to own their own homes.</P>
    <P>I have been heartened by a recent development in the Dublin city area. The city manager has a pool of land and he is offering sites to small builders, small builders who build medium-priced houses for those who normally would be housed by the local authority but who, through their own industry and thrift, have saved £500, £600 or £700 which they are anxious to invest in a house.  There is at the moment a waiting list for these houses. I hope the city manager will continue this policy and make more land available to these small builders who are supplying a need in our community. I hope that the fact that there is a waiting list will not result in a sellers' market, with additions made to the price of the house, additions not always in accordance with what the house has cost.  I have referred to this before.</P>
    <P>I am critical of builders who offer houses to people without really indicating the price of the house.  In any other sphere there is never any doubt about the price of a commodity but, in the matter of housing, a most important item in anyone's life, it is difficult at times for the buyer to ascertain exactly what the price is.  Very often people do not understand about grants and so forth.  They do not appreciate the difference between gross price and net price.  They may place a booking fee and be told that the price is £5,500 or £6,000 and, in the course of a month <Col N="863" /> or two, the builder may tell them that the house has gone up by £200 or £300.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever it is, it is not something of which I approve.  This is wrong because it is sharp practice in so far as that once a client is netted it is not easy for him, if he wishes, to opt out.  It should be required of anybody selling a house to indicate what will be the specific cost of that house to the purchaser.  I do not deny to any builder the right to earn a reasonable profit but there is an obligation on him to make clear that the price quoted in the price at which the house will be sold.  There are one or two other matters in connection with the purchasing of that type of house to which I have referred in the past and to which I shall refer again now.  We should endeavour in so far as possible to accommodate anyone who is in a position to indicate that he has a sum of money which he is anxious to invest in a house which money, consequently, he is investing in the building industry. Very often because of the way in which an intending purchaser is thwarted he reaches the stage where he must withdraw that money from the building industry and invest it, perhaps, in consumer goods.  He may have to go into a basement flat and wait there until such time as his situation is so bad the local authorities will offer him accommodation.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of house purchase which concerns me is that of legal fees. It is my contention that the amount of money extracted from house purchasers by their solicitors is not in accordance with the services rendered. I see no justification for any solicitor charging legal fees of as much as £100 or £120 on a house when, perhaps, that house is one of a scheme of 100 houses, all of which are similar and which require only identical leases.  A lower figure would be more appropriate and the saving to the house purchaser would be considerable especially when it is realised that, invariably, that money has to be borrowed at, perhaps, 9 or 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> Regarding the housing situation in Dublin I would not wish to use the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; because that word is too emotive but I would say that the housing situation in Dublin is not satisfactory.  In fact it is bordering on the emergency stage.  Having regard to the changing circumstances in building and to the fact that craftsmen are not required to apply the same skills today as would have been required of them say, 20 years ago, the trade unions might make their contribution to the problem by studying the situation and discovering areas where semi-skilled or unskilled men might be capable of performing the duties which up to now have been classified as the work of skilled men. Perhaps I will be slated for saying this in so far as trade unionists are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What type of work could an unskilled man do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>For instance, I am a very unskilled man but I am sure that I would make a very good job of nailing down floorboards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>In this way the trade unions could make their contribution. Invariably we are told that the main factor in the cost of a house is the price of land.  I cannot accept that because the corporation can provide small fully serviced sites at a cost of £1,000 but the cost of the house to the purchaser will be about £5,300. We must assume, therefore, that £4,500 of that amount relates to materials and labour.  This is an area where certain economies could be effected which would be to the advantage of the prospective buyer and to the general advantage of the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crotty referred to the differential rent system.  I do not intend speaking on that topic in any detail in this instance except to say that I consider the system to be an excellent one in spirit.  No more than any other system it is not perfect but a system which requires the stronger members of the community to help <Col N="865" /> support the weaker ones, is as near to perfection as one could get.  Neither would I agree with Deputy Crotty when he says that the earnings of sons and daughters should not be taken into account when rent is being assessed.  He says that these earnings may not be given to the parents.  Unfortunately that may be true in some cases but surely it would be unreasonable to ask that the sons and daughters of other people would help the parents of these boys and girls who display such a lack of gratitude towards their parents that they would not make any contribution towards the payment of the rent of the houses in which they live.  In all areas where there is a question of subsidy one must look to new areas from where such subsidies can be obtained if those who are contributing to the subsidy are to be released from that responsibility.  However I agree that so far as overtime is concerned, there is a case to be made for increasing the amount which is disregarded.  At the moment in Dublin city one-fifth of the main earner's overtime is disregarded.</P>
    <P>One must realise that a man working overtime is required to have meals out and it is therefore not economic for his wife to cook for him the meals which he would normally share at home with his family.  There are often additional transport expenses.  Normally, he might come home with three or four other men who were contributing to the expenses of a car managed by some of them and he now loses that concession and has to meet new expense to travel home.  Some consideration should be given to this.</P>
    <P>Before leaving housing, the area of maintenance costs of local authority housing requires examination.  I may be cutting across the interests of those employed to maintain these houses; if so, I am sorry but my first concern is the frustration arising in the home of a tenant in regard to these maintenance jobs.  He can wait for months before the matter in need of attention is looked after.  On the other hand, he knows, or his association will tell him that in respect of the year the average maintenance cost per house <Col N="866" /> in Dublin city is about £29.50.  He sees little of this in his own house.  If he is carrying out any improvements in the house he is told: &ldquo;You should not do this without permission from the corporation.&rdquo; Any man, whether he is the owner or the tenant of a house, is, I think, entitled to put his own identity or stamp on that house and should be entitled to paint or decorate it as he wishes and the corporation or local authority should only be concerned where the tenant neglects the house to such an extent that obsolescence will set in much earlier than is normal.</P>
    <P>Housing and local government are the two points on which I normally speak on this Estimate and invariably I think of local government ideally as I see it.  The very title presupposes for me proximity of the offices to the person who is paying for the service that is being administered.  It presupposes familiarity of officials as far as possible with the people they serve.  In this area I continue to be very critical of the situation in Dublin where, on those standards, there is practically no local government.</P>
    <P>For those living on the perimeter of Dublin city, the so-called local office is in the heart of the city and City Quay or City Hall is as far from Phibsboro', Finglas, Cabra or Coolock as Gorey is from Wexford.  There is nothing local between Finglas and City Hall and there will never be anything local between Dublin Corporation and Finglas until there is a local office in Finglas.  Until such time as people in these areas who have a problem are able to go to an office where they can present their rent problem and discuss it with a Mr. Murphy or discuss their reconstruction grant problem with a Mr. Kehoe, or their water or sewerage problems with a Mr. Jackson and not have the present situation where a citizen with a problem invariably has access only to the most junior official, there will not be real local government.  If the junior official is carrying out his or her work satisfactorily he or she will be promoted and the more promotion the farther the official is removed from the people he is supposed to serve.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> I think at local authority level we should consider presenting not the most junior but perhaps the most senior official to deal with citizens who wish to discuss their problems with representatives of the local authority.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister indicated to Dublin Corporation that they should, perhaps, open a local office in Ballymun. This office has been operating for some time now and I hope the results are sufficient to convince the Minister and his Department and Dublin Corporation officials of the need for similar offices throughout the city.  If we had these offices we would have fewer demonstrations.  Apart from lack of communication between the corporation and the citizens I think these demonstrations occur occasionally because the citizens do not bother to read the many lengthy handouts of the corporation.  Their reaction to these is to get a placard with one or two words in large print on it and carry it through the city indicating their protest and dissatisfaction with their anonymity, their sense of powerlessness against the powerful organisation which has so much power over them.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to proceed with his plans for local offices throughout Dublin city and to have a special look at the proposal to build civic offices on City Quay.  The idea of centralising all the corporation offices at City Quay is one I have criticised already and I shall continue to criticise it until I am informed that having central offices at City Quay does not mean that we shall not have local offices in other areas.  What I fear is that if the development of these palatial offices in City Quay takes place and if there is available there accommodation which cannot be filled <i>in toto</i> I will be told that this is the reason why the corporation would not be justified in opening local offices elsewhere. It is a strange type of investment by Dublin Corporation.  On the one hand we have sections, officials, officers dealing with the traffic problem in Dublin city, of which we are all painfully aware.  We have another section dealing with the problem of pollution.  The dangers from pollution <Col N="868" /> by traffic are foremost and have been accepted as being a major problem in Dublin at present.  Simultaneously, we have the corporation indicating their intention to proceed with a proposal the result of which can only mean additional traffic congestion, an addition to the traffic hazard and an addition to the pollution which already exists.  There is lack of communication, as I see it, between the officials and the department heads in Dublin Corporation.  One cannot relate the problems that exist at present with the intention to pursue a project which must have the effect of adding to the problems that already exist.</P>
    <P>I wish to re-echo as best I can, and much more succinctly, the case made by Deputy Dowling in the matter of houses owned by Associated Properties. We have some of these houses in the Wadelai estate.  We have all the problems indicated by Deputy Dowling and we have one to which he did not refer. Last week in the estate we had a tenant anxious to decorate his house in the fashion which he thought appropriate, anxious to make alterations in windows and doors, spending his money on it and having his work and investment undone by Associated Properties.  I am not opposed in any way to, indeed I am an admirer of, private enterprise but I experience the same difficulty as other Deputies in trying to make inquiries on behalf of my constituents.  Invariably it is impossible to speak with anybody who will speak on behalf of Associated Properties.  This company enjoy certain State grants.  They enjoy certain expenditure made on behalf of the citizens of Dublin by way of improving open spaces, repairing footpaths, improving roads in the area where they constructed these houses.  Yet they deny their tenants the right of association. They tell their tenants that they will not deal with any association or with any public representative speaking on behalf of an association.  They will only deal with the individual tenant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned the situation that arises where an ambulance or a fire brigade may have occasion to visit a house in this estate. He mentioned that these people will <Col N="869" /> not allow tenants to accommodate a car in the garden, which is a very simple request for any tenant to make to his landlord.  With a view to allowing for the passage of traffic on the road the landlord is asked to give permission to the tenant to accommodate his car in the front garden and the landlord will not give that permission.  The reason must be that the landlord is concerned not to hold a tenant but to get him out.  Having got him out he can let the house to some tenant from whom he can extract a higher rent.  Citizens are entitled to be protected from any company operating on that basis.</P>

      <P>I thought I had established that they were a commercial firm called Associated Properties.  They are a well-known commercial firm. This firm may look upon a tenant as a unit of property but I do not think they are entitled to do that especially when the health of the tenant and his right to have a car are in question. The stock answer to the case made that they should permit a tenant to accommodate a car in his garden is that the houses were built for people with bicycles.  That is an indication of the attitude of these people towards the tenant.  While I know the Minister for Local Government is not responsible for the misdeeds of any commercial firm, the rate-paying people who live there contribute to the pool into which the corporation and the Minister dip and I think they are entitled to the interest, the concern and the protection of the Minister.  I have faith enough in the Minister to hope that in this matter he will look after the people living under Associated Properties.</P>

      <P>Although I am a country Deputy I propose to say a few words about Dublin.  All of us are concerned with what happens in this city because we have to stay here <Col N="870" /> for several days a week.  I noticed this morning that the whole of George's Street was rooted up.  George's Street is perhaps one of the more difficult traffic lanes in the city.  If we had elected local representatives functioning in Dublin they would be able to raise matters like this.  At the moment everything done in Dublin is decided by officials in the name of Dublin Corporation which does not exist, and does not seem to be likely to exist, if Fianna Fáil have their way, until after the next local elections, whenever that may be.</P>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that one of the major traffic lanes in Dublin should be rooted up almost in its entirety, leaving virtually only one-way traffic right in the middle of the tourist season.  This may not be the best tourist season we ever had but, at this time of the year, and in July in particular, there are more cars in Dublin than at other times of the year.  This seems to me to be a senseless act committed by whoever is responsible for the administration of local government in Dublin.  I spent about ten minutes in a traffic jam fairly recently somewhere else in the city and, when I eventually got through, I discovered that half the street had been rooted up there also.</P>
      <P>These are matters which would be highlighted if we had elected representatives, but we have not got elected representatives and we are not likely to have them.  It is a disgrace that the capital city has been without elected representatives for about three years, due to the intransigence of my colleague across the floor.  NATO, not to be confused with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, a tenants' organisation, has come into existence in Dublin because there is no buffer between the general public and the officials of Dublin Corporation.  The absence of elected local representatives can be noted here too.  If there were grievances they could be put publicly.  If grievances are put publicly they get recognition.  If they are put behind closed doors they do not get recognition.  The person who makes the representations gets a polite letter saying that it is not in the public interest to do so and so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> Fianna Fáil did a grave disservice to this country when they refused to accept an amendment to the Local Elections Bill last week asking for elections in Dublin.  The sooner they do a little quiet thinking on this matter the better.  It is also worthy of note that, despite the long diatribe from the Minister when he was introducing this Estimate about the houses that were built and the improving housing situation in the country, nobody can get a house in Dublin unless he has four children.  Apart from a few lucky people who win in the draw, people have to wait an interminable time for a house.  They are probably married for six years before they can get a house.  That is a shocking state of affairs in this day and age in the capital city of Ireland.  Things are bad everywhere else, but they are particularly bad here.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Parliamentary Secretary is getting cross.  If he would listen to what I am saying some of it might sink in and somebody might get a house.  I have listened to Fianna Fáil saying that more houses are being built for years since I came to the House.  Of course more houses are being built.  The average life of a house is in the neighbourhood of 50 years.  There is a fallout of houses always.  The population of Dublin has gone up considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> There is another anomaly in this city.  Some constituents of mine own a big house in this city which they wanted to reconstruct.  They had let friends live in it <i>pro tem</i> while they were waiting to get a house.  They discovered that their friends could not get a house unless they took them to court.  Apparently if you sue your best friends they have some chance of getting a house.  That is the Gilbertian situation which exists.  There is no use in the Parliamentary Secretary saying they are building more houses.  The Fianna Fáil Party are not building enough houses.  Since they came back into office 15 or 16 years ago the number of people waiting for houses has been growing all the time. Instead of talking about building more houses and producing idiotic statistics, they should say how many people are waiting for houses and what reduction there has been in the number of people on the waiting list.  If you ask that type of Parliamentary question you cannot get a straight answer.  You get a lot of &ldquo;blah-blah&rdquo; about the number of houses that are being built.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that pollution is a world problem.  We are rather fortunate in Ireland in that pollution has not reached the stage which it has reached in other countries.  Other countries have learned to their cost, by doing nothing about it, what the final overall cost of dealing with pollution is likely to be. In Switzerland they have had to spend literally millions on reconstructing waterways and cleaning lakes.  I am not an expert and I have not seen the maps, but I understand that the major portion of the sewage in Dublin goes into the Liffey.  That has been going on for years and years.  The Liffey has now reached the stage where it cannot take any more.  It is now positively unhealthy. The fumes from the Liffey are responsible for bad health in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This applies to every waterway in Ireland.  Every waterway is the recipient of sewage.  In some areas where the population is small, this condition is not so noticeable yet.  It is time the Minister for Local Government tried to deal with this problem.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has time on his hands when he is not dealing with <Col N="873" /> planning appeals&mdash;and I will have a few words to say about that matter in a moment&mdash;it might be no harm if this problem were handed over to him and he did something to ensure that every lake and every river is not polluted within the next ten years.</P>
    <P>It is a known fact that Dublin Bay is badly polluted and that marine life and vegetation are being destroyed. The pollution position is getting worse and worse throughout the country. Some time ago I was going through Clonmel and I saw that the River Suir, which was one of the best trout rivers in Ireland at one time, was grossly polluted.  I understand that something was done about that recently.  It has been cleaned to a certain extent to enable some trout to live in it.  They were dying in considerable numbers. Practically every river and lake is the same.  If experience has shown in other countries the magnitude of the cost of bringing back polluted waterways to normal, it amazes me why we do not do something about it while it could be done at the minimum cost.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister that he is introducing a Bill to deal with pollution.  The Fine Gael Party have a Bill before the House dealing with pollution.  It is in abeyance at the moment because there has not been any Private Members' Time for about six months.  Why wait to introduce a Bill on pollution?  It seems to me that we have our priorities entirely wrong. Why not introduce such a Bill straight away under which a legal obligation is imposed on people to stop causing pollution?  The advantage and gain to the nation would be considerable.</P>
    <P>I mention a sewerage policy.  It seems to me that if a river is being polluted because of sewage from a town, what is there to stop the setting up of a treatment works, a septic tank or several of them?  This is something which stops it.  I had the experience in my own area, in Enniscorthy, of trying to get a treatment works set up there.  We had to wait two years while letters were exchanged between the Department and the local authority about getting those works going.  In the meantime these people had no sewerage facilities whatever and could <Col N="874" /> not use toilets or bathrooms.  This is a matter which should have the active consideration of the Department.  Plans should be drawn up and local authorities should be asked to draw up plans in relation to sewerage and protection from pollution as a result.  These plans should be submitted to the Department where they should be dealt with with expedition.  If a local authority send up a request for the setting up of treatment works in a certain town or area, it is to be assumed that they have the plans, the blueprint and the site.  Why has it to be sat on for months and then sent back with some fiddling query which holds it up for another six months?  That is pure and undiluted bureaucracy, bureaucracy which is growing up and is rotting everything in Irish life and getting worse as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about motor insurance which is becoming a very serious problem, a problem which any Deputy here will agree is put up to him nearly every day.  Over the years, for some reason or other, insurance companies always refused to settle accident claims.  My experience when practising as a doctor, quite a few years ago now, and giving evidence in these cases was that although people were seriously injured and the case was obviously one which the insurance company would have to settle they would never settle anything.  They went to court and had two senior counsel and a junior&mdash;why, I do not know; I believe that across the channel these cases are conducted by a junior counsel, but I suppose that lawyers have to live, which is probably the answer &mdash;and went to the greatest expense and then they finally went in at the last moment, having created all this extra expense, and paid the bill of costs.  That went on and insurance companies were glad to insure anybody, but as time went on, the roads became more crowded and accidents more frequent and the companies began to lose money.  Premiums have now reached the stage at which in many cases it is not possible for people to pay them.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago, a third party policy could be got for £8 or £9 and it is now a minimum of about £30, <Col N="875" /> that is, with a no claim bonus.  The cost of comprehensive insurance which I have had myself over the years&mdash; I have not killed anybody yet on the roads and I hope I do not, but I have a no claim bonus&mdash;has risen out of all proportion to what it was.  It so happens that I am able to pay but I constantly have people coming to me who have had an accident and once they have had an accident, even though in many cases it was not their fault but that of somebody bashing in to the back of their car, they are refused insurance, with the result that quite a lot of people are not on the roads. If they are, they are there illegally because they are not insured, not because of any fault of theirs but because they cannot get insurance.</P>
    <P>It may seem curious that I, who have always advocated the cause of private enterprise in this House, should advocate&mdash;it is a matter for consideration by the Government or the Department&mdash;that there should be some sort of insurance available for people.  How they do it is a matter for themselves. They must have the available statistics and must be in a position to know what is the best way to do it, but I believe that some form of State subsidisation will probably be necessary to ensure that motor insurance is carried on in this country.  I suppose there is no legal obligation on insurance companies to provide insurance and when they find that they are no longer making any money out of it, they will probably give it up.  It is therefore, something which the Minister and his officials should consider seriously, that is, what contribution they can make towards insurance, and by making such a contribution, how they can lessen the burden on the person concerned. I know of people who have been asked to pay something in the neighbourhood of £125 for comprehensive insurance. These are people who have been insured for years and who have never had an accident but who are a very good mark for the cheque for the insurance company and their premium is put up above those of others.</P>
    <P>For that reason I think the State should come into it, whether they subsidise, <Col N="876" /> control or take over insurance, as they did when they took over national health insurance.  Accident insurance was taken over by the Department of Social Welfare and it greatly reduced the cost of industrial insurance, for the simple reason that they never pay anything, unless they have to. It is only with the greatest difficulty that one get it and it is paid only for six months whereas the insurance companies paid for a considerable period. Some rational thinking must be done on these lines.</P>
    <P>We have been looking for a swimming pool in the town of Wexford, a town which is close to Wales and close to Rosslare Harbour and which gets a considerable influx of tourists every year.  The Minister very nicely received a deputation from us.  He did not make any promises but I understood from him at the time that a swimming pool comes under the amenity grant scheme, in respect of which the total sum for the whole of Ireland is £300,000.  I do not think we were looking for a great lot&mdash;we were very easy to please&mdash; about £5,000.  We got nothing and we have no swimming pool, although we got vague promises that we were to get something.  We had got to the stage at which we had created an amenity area there in which everything was available for the tourist except a swimming pool.</P>

We never get anything down there because our <Col N="877" /> political representation has not changed over the years and is not likely to change.  Fianna Fáil would not gain anything by giving us a swimming pool. If they do change their attitude and do consider giving us something, I would ask that a swimming pool for Wexford be considered.</P>
      <P>I want to say a word or two on group water schemes.  Is there any reason why it should take so long to put group water schemes into effect? The money is collected; everything is arranged; the grants due to the parties concerned are to be paid by the Department. Why is there such delay in the payment?  Why is that when one goes to the Department the official concerned seems to have gone to America or somewhere else?</P>

      <P>And even if they give planning permission at the end of a month the applicant cannot do anything for two months in case somebody further objects.  That is too much altogether.  It does not make any difference in County Wexford because everything that we look for is turned down.  There is a planning official, the most dedicated man in Ireland.  I gather that he will be leaving us in the <Col N="880" /> near future.  I have not known him to pass anything yet.  He turns everything down on principle.  I will give the Parliamentary Secretary a case that was turned down the other day.  I understand that there is a new regulation that houses cannot be built on main arterial roads.</P>

      <P>This was an application to build a house 400 yards up a by-road, back the requisite distance from the by-road itself.  The application was turned down on the basis that it would be a hazard to the main road.  I do not see how that creates a hazard.  You have to get on to the main road in some way.  Surely you are not asked to live on the top of a mountain and walk down to the main road and start your car from there. The type of case that I have mentioned is being turned down in County Wexford.</P>
      <P>With regard to delays, I do not want to enlarge on what I have said because I am not <i>au fait</i> with the Act.  I still maintain that nobody gets planning permission within two months.

It is a system which was imposed on us by an alien government and we have quite failed to rid ourselves of it, just as we have failed to do a great many other things that we should have done long since.  The setup in Connacht is absurd.  There are five county councils and two health boards operating over the same territory. The whole thing is a joke.  Even the IRA have a better idea about things than we have.  They have decided to set up provincial governments. What they propose could not be any worse than what we have at present under the county managers.  I am one of the oldest county councillors in this House.  I have been 25 years a member of my county council.  The whole situation is nonsensical.  It is time it was changed.  I do not know why some Minister does not use his commonsense and give us a proper system of local government.  There are a great many people, urban councillors, demi-gods, who want to hold on to their demi-popularity.  Some of them get only 40 votes, but they are elected.  I get 7,000, or something like that.  It is absurd to have a man who commands only 40 or 50 votes ruling a community. He is supposed to represent the community.  How could that be representation?  It is not representation. If these people want to test their popularity then they should do it before <Col N="882" /> the public in the whole county.  It is ridiculous to see a town of 2,500 or 3,000 people ruled by an urban council.</P>

      <P>One Deputy talked about Associated Properties here in Dublin.  If what he said is true, then it is time that people were made aware of the identity of these people, whosoever they happen to be.  It is very hard for a man to stand idly by and not challenge Deputy Tunney.  I presume that what he said is true.</P>
      <P>County councils are more or less a joke.  We have the same road running through five counties and there are five different standards of maintenance.  I take it the Department of Local Government will be taking over the maintenance of these national highways. They should take over a lot of other things as well.  However, in the west, Galway, Clare and Mayo should be grouped together under a regional council.  I do not care who loses his soft job as a result of that.  I will not lose mine anyway.  I have one of the safest seats in Ireland, but I may not go forward again.  We have not got proper administration.  Roscommon, Sligo and Donegal should also be grouped together. It is time the system was changed and bigger groups were formed. We must rid ourselves of this system imposed on us by the British Government, a system we have accepted for the sake of appointing the chairman of the county council.  What does he do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> The whole thing is a cod.  I would never dream of wanting to maintain a county council just for the sake of keeping myself at the head of the poll every five years or so.  Local administration must be spread broadly and not on the basis merely of county councils.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems in my constituency is that of roads.  Of course those people who make the laws in respect of roads are those who travel in State cars and who probably do not see the bridges let alone the roads as they travel.  It is strange that only those roads on which State cars travel are maintained properly.  Nothing is done to improve other roads but at election time some gombeen is sent in and expected to use the back roads. Instead of wasting money on the removal of bends I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that money be spent instead of improving the bad roads in this country.</P>

      <P>We are entitled to have our lesser roads improved.  After this has been done there should then be money for the further improvement of the main roads over which these geniuses travel in their State cars at 100 miles per hour.  I suppose most of the time they are asleep.  Apparently in my county there is nobody who can build a bridge.  There are three bridges on the route over which I travel regularly to attend county council meetings but to cross them one must <Col N="884" /> travel at a snail's pace and they will not accommodate vehicles of more than two tons in weight.  These are our main roads.  Those people who sit in the Custom House or in the Department's offices at O'Connell Bridge do not come to our part of the country. Should they come to visit us they would get what was coming to them. It is odd that our people who are working in Britain can build bridges for the British while it seems that those at home cannot do the same type of work.  If the Parliamentary Secretary checks with the Mayo County Manager he will find that no bridge has been built in Mayo for many years.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House also to the situation in relation to grants.  The level of grants has changed very little since I came here many years ago.  If the Parliamentary Secretary knows anything at all about the cost of materials, he must realise that the maximum grant of £900 would not be sufficient to buy roofing for a house not to mention all the other materials that are required.  It is high time that the grant was increased.  What amuses me is, that bad as is the situation in my county, it is worse in the Parliamentary Secretary's part of the country, so that if only in the interest of his own people, he should insist on a change in the grant to bring it up to a realistic figure.  A sum of £900 would not buy a decent engagement ring nowadays.  Certainly, it would not cover the cost of a wedding of the type we have in our part of the country.  There is a limit, too, in respect of a loan.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Chair is not aware of this but I can tell him that if a man applies for a housing loan he will, in order to qualify, be forced to state on the application form that he is earning at least £1,500 per year.  As soon as the application form is received in the Department, they write to the income tax people to find out what returns that man made for the year.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may write to the Mayo County Manager to ascertain if one word of what I have said is incorrect. We have the famous differential rents system, one of the daftest ever introduced in any country.  I do not know how many Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries have sons or daughters working.  Some of my children are working but if I got a penny from them I would faint.  Yet if I had a house under that scheme I would have to disclose my sons' and daughters' incomes and the rent would be based not only on what I get but also on what they earn.  Does anybody think they would give me a penny for that?  Surely, it is an absolutely unfair method of assessing rents?  On the face of it, I admit it seems fair provided we lived in a Christian community where everybody supported everybody else.  But we live in a Catholic community and there is <Col N="886" /> a tremendous difference between a Christian community and a Catholic community.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many Deputies have ever got a penny from any members of their families&mdash;there are not many Deputies here at present anyway.  I do not believe they did; I did not get it in any case.  I think the Minister is not married himself and I do not know what advice the Parliamentary Secretary would give him but if any of them got a penny from a member of their families it would be a miracle.</P>
      <P>Many county councils at present have all kinds of glorified schemes, water schemes, sewerage schemes and so on.  They seem to have money to burn but they have not the price of their breakfast.  In Mayo I think they have about £10 million worth of water schemes but they have not ten pence in the kitty.  The Minister will keep silly, stupid documents in the Custom House, perhaps for months and months instead of sending them back immediately.  He knows well these things cannot be paid for and we cannot pay for them and that they will never be carried out.  Why he should hold these stupid documents, sent up from county councils, in his office before eventually&mdash;perhaps after two years deciding&mdash;to let the matter drop, just as the boys on the Castlebar Committee decided to let the matter drop, I cannot imagine.  He must know it is daft and he should cut out the codology and waste because it is a waste of time.</P>
      <P>Some of the sewerage schemes are just as bad as the Moy Drainage Scheme.  Once it was flowing down but now it is flowing up since they drained it.  They decided to give grants for derelict sites.  I wonder if anybody was ever paid such a grant.  I once got a letter and I was advised that if the person concerned decided to accept the word of whoever wrote the letter the grant would eventually possibly be paid.  That was about two or three years ago; it has not been paid yet. Then they produced amenity grants. I do not know what an amenity is; it could mean anything.  It could mean opening a dump or closing a dump.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> It is a nice word and it reminds me of some of the letters I get.  I got one yesterday in which 12 words were misspelled. I returned it telling the writer to carry out the necessary corrections.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary replies to the debate he will explain what an amenity is.  The dumping grounds in the country are a public disgrace and it is a pity some kind of grant would not be given for them.  We also have the group water schemes, a handy way for the Department to get out of its own troubles circuitously.  To some extent, they may have achieved that but they have certainly got many people into trouble.  To get payment for those schemes is pretty difficult. I do not say it is the Minister's fault; it is often the fault of the local people. The real fault is in the fact that the people appointed to deal with these schemes are inept or not capable of dealing with such matters.  That is a pity because these schemes would be very useful and would bring tremendous benefit to many people if properly operated but in many cases this is not so.  Before schemes of that kind go into operation it is necessary to ensure that a reliable supply of water will be available.</P>
    <P>There is the perennial question of pollution.  A good deal of bull goes out of this House and it is no wonder many places are polluted but in many cases pollution is a grossly exaggerated problem.  I am not surprised that Dublin Bay is polluted when one thinks of what flows out of this House.  I shall not say what it is; I said it before and the wife nearly killed me.  There are not many here who do not know what I am talking about.  I suppose there is pollution.  We have not got it around my place.  We are a very clean-living people.  I do not think any local authority can do a tremendous lot about pollution.  If you want to pollute you can pollute.  You can pollute your own house and if you want to keep going you can pollute anything you like.  I think to a great extent this is grossly exaggerated.  I think my pal, the chief pollution agent, is here at the moment.  It is exaggerated and is used <Col N="888" /> more for propaganda than for any other purpose.</P>
    <P>The Planning Act has been misinterpreted and misused by local authorities. Some local authorities use it just to show their autocratic attitude to the public.  If the present Planning Act, as now operated by Mayo County Council, operated in 1918 there would be no houses in Erris or in Achill, or very few.  The builders would all have been shot down.  Why people can be so stupid in this day and age as to stop a man from building a good house is beyond me.  After all he can build a hayrick twice as big as the house or a stack of turf three times as big as the house and the local authority would not be asked for permission. How many Deputies realise that?  He could leave his hayrick there until the cows came home to eat it, if they ever came home, and he could leave the turf there until his wife brought it in to burn it but if he builds a good decent looking house he is shot down.  This is going on in Galway and Mayo.  I do not know about other counties.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have a look at this.  The way the Planning Act is being operated in these two counties is nothing better than a fraud.  It is being used against unfortunate people who wish to progress and who are prevented from doing so.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned Dublin Corporation. I often wonder whether half the organisations we have could not be got rid of.  I think we would be better off.  We have urban councils and all kinds of funny councils.  What they do I do not know.  If we rid ourselves of them we would be doing no injury to anybody but we would be saving the public from a good many of the expenses they have to bear.  I do not know how anyone can justify the appointment of an urban council in a town of 2,500 or 3,000.  I do not hold with it.  Any town with a population of less than 10,000 to 12,000 should in no circumstances have a crowd of these little demi-gods ruling it.  If they went up for the county council, every one of them would forfeit his deposit even if it is only £10.  If they went up for the Dáil, sin deireadh <Col N="889" /> leis an gcás.  We could get rid of a good many of these silly, stupid organisations. I understand there are Ministers in this House who have it at the back of their minds to set up more organisations.  What they are setting them up for I do not know.  It is like the health organisation.  I know this is a little off the mark but it will illustrate what I mean.  We are on the health board and then we set up a consultative organisation.  We are then back again on the consultative organisation so we have appointed ourselves to advise ourselves on what to do.  This looks funny but it is true.  I am on the health board and I am on the county council.  Then I am appointed to a new organisation to advise myself on what to do.  Is it not a very sensible type of organisation?</P>

    <P>The local authority are the motor taxation authority for some reason which is beyond me.  Hundreds of Mayo people tax their cars in Dublin. I do not know what happens to that money.  I do not know whether it goes back to Mayo.  If people tax their cars in Dublin, or in any other county, does the place where they tax their cars get the benefit of that money?  I think it does.  I would imagine that about 20 per cent of the Mayo cars are taxed in Dublin.  Who gets that money?  Do Mayo County Council get it?  On one <Col N="890" /> occasion I asked for a driving licence in Dublin and I was told to get it in my own county.  I went out the door and then came back and wrote down &ldquo;in care&rdquo; of such a place and I got the licence.  Who gets that money?  I wish the Minister would answer that question.  It is a very interesting point.  I do not agree with the local government administrative set up.  I should like the Minister to answer that question about motor taxation.</P>

I do not think the Planning Act, 1963, was introduced in time because, before that, many beauty spots particularly in the south of Ireland were being destroyed and, but for the introduction of that Act, the situation would have been very serious.  There seems to be a lot of confusion about the Act and quite a lot of opposition to it.  When it was first introduced the local authorities were not capable of administering it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When young married people apply for permission to build a house&mdash;and a considerable time elapses before a decision is reached&mdash;and when their application is refused, the local authority or the planning authority should be able to offer them an alternative site.  Around every village and town the local authorities should have land suitable for building development. When they refuse an application they should be able to say: &ldquo;We have here a fully serviced site and, even though we cannot allow you to build on the site you applied for, we can give you an alternative site.&rdquo; This is not the case and I believe this is why the <Col N="891" /> local authorities were not ready to administer the Act when it was introduced.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with something which is worrying many people and particularly public representatives and members of local authorities.  In the event of an application for planning being refused, whether it is an application <Col N="892" /> to build a house or a factory or anything else, have I the right to go into the planning offices and examine the file in detail to find out why the application was refused?</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6th July, 1972.</P>
