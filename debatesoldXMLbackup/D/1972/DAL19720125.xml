      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what action, if any, he proposes to take regarding allegations of negligence in relation to the issue of a prescription dated 24th September, 1971, to an out-patient (name supplied) at a Dublin hospital (name supplied).</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what steps he will take to ensure that the name on a prescription is the same as that on the medical card when a prescription is presented for filling at a health board dispensary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will authorise an immedate inquiry into allegations that a medical card holder (name supplied) was given a drugs prescription dated 24th September, 1971, made out for a different man when he was examined at the out patients' department of a Dublin hospital (name supplied).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the matter has been taken up on behalf of the relatives with the voluntary hospital concerned and the Eastern Health Board and that each of these bodies are making inquiries at present.  Until the matter has been investigated by these bodies I am not in a position to state what further action, if any, may be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree to send a general circular to all hospitals asking them to tighten <Col N="300" /> up many of their procedures in out-patient departments, <i>et cetera</i>?  This would be a firm initiative from the Minister and would show that he is very concerned that it should never arise again as it has arisen in days gone by.  In addition, would he effect an inquiry, irrespective of the inquiries which I know are being conducted by the hospital concerned and by the Eastern Health Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to receive the report of the health board and the voluntary hospital before I could take any further decision.  Quite naturally, if the report revealed that it is necessary to take any steps of the kind suggested by the Deputy, the steps will undoubtedly be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will consider including Parkinson's disease under the free drugs scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies of 14th December and 28th October last to somewhat similar questions in which I stated that I do not propose at this stage to extend the list of long-term diseases and disabilities in respect of the scheme introduced on 1st October last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there are quite a substantial number of people suffering from a crippling disease which is costing them an average of about £4 to £5 per week for drugs, does the Minister not consider that these people should be included in the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that there was expenditure last year totalling over £200,000 on drug assistance to the limited eligibility group, quite apart from drug assistance made available for certain specific maladies.  It is hoped that we will be able to extend that drug assistance in a general way but I cannot promise that until I see what the financial position will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that in fact those people, even if they have not got medical cards because of <Col N="301" /> the strict regulations, should be able to get those drugs, if they find it difficult to pay for them, under the existing scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing scheme drug assistance is made available. I am sure I am right in saying that the total amount spent last year was £200,000.  Chief executive officers and their delegated officers are empowered to give aid to people in the limited eligibility group who find that the cost of drugs is prohibitive.  That is going on constantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make it awkward for the Minister.  I was going to suggest that if particular cases were brought to his notice he might do something about them but that could be very involved.  Could the Minister suggest some way by which a person who has applied for a medical card and has been refused, and who has applied for a drug card for the purpose of getting drugs and does not appear to be going to get it, could be dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister introducing any uniform method of assessment in regard to eligibility for medical cards?  It applies in cases such as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health when approval will be given for work to start on the Eastern Regional Health Board's proposal for an old people's home at the Magdalen Convent, Donnybrook, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal is still under consideration in consultation with the Eastern Health Board and I hope to be in a position at an early date to give a decision with regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say how early a date it is likely to be? Is he aware that this matter is something <Col N="302" /> that the Eastern Health Board are concerned to press and will he ensure that approval is not held up in his Department especially in view of the circumstances that the site in question is being given free for this purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A further meeting to discuss the proposal has been arranged between the parties concerned for the 27th January.  As the Deputy knows, this is partly a matter for decision by the Eastern Health Board, how best to provide accommodation for the patients who are likely to come to the institution which has asked for aid. It is, in part, a decision by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Eastern Health Board are in favour of this and give it the highest priority and that the hold-up is in his Department, not having given approval for this plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of a choice between the provision of beds which, in fact, might be at a lower cost per head and, on the other hand, the very favourable offer by the Order concerned. These two different types of approach are being considered by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not right in saying that the Eastern Health Board are in favour of this proposal and it is in the Minister's Department that the hold-up has occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am asking them to look into it.  The Deputy is correct in that.  I will make a decision on the matter as soon as I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the statement is a lengthy one, I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final meetings with the Communities before the conclusion of the negotiations were concerned with the <Col N="303" /> questions of fisheries, animal health and sugar production quotas.</P>
    <P>The outcome of my negotiations at these meetings on fisheries is set out in the White Paper on the Accession of Ireland to the European Communities&mdash;paragraphs 33 and 34 of Chapter 5 and paragraphs 191-195 of the Appendix.</P>
    <P>I reached agreement with the Communities on the following arrangements relating to animal health:</P>
    <P>
      <i>General Provisions:</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  A derogation permitting us to continue to apply existing national rules in respect of imports of cattle and pigs (other animals are not covered by the Community directive) and meat.</P>
    <P>(ii)  A derogation from the obligation to vaccinate animals against foot and mouth disease before export.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Continuation of existing methods for declaring herds free from bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, export tests for these diseases to be carried out according to Community rules.  These export test requirements will apply in our case only to exports to the six member States of the existing Community.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Extension of the existing Community derogation to allow all member States of the enlarged Community to import animals which do not come from brucellosis-free herds.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Ireland-U K Trade:</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  Exemption of Irish bullocks from testing for brucellosis; our heifers to be tested according to Community tests.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Export of our cattle to continue on the basis of existing bovine tuberculosis arrangements.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Exemption from the obligation to separate slaughter cattle from store and breeding cattle.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Maintenance of existing trade arrangements between the Twenty-six and Six Counties.</P>
    <P>These arrangements will be reviewed before the end of a period of five <Col N="304" /> years when the animal health situation in the enlarged Community as a whole and in its different parts will be examined in the light of developments in the veterinary field.  The decision in regard to the arrangements to apply after the initial five-year period will be taken by the Council of the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Poultry Meat:</i>
    </P>
    <P>A delay of six months for the implementation of the EEC directive on poultry meat was agreed.  The Community pointed out that, under this directive, we shall be able, on our accession to the EEC, to prohibit imports of poultry meat from areas where the disease has been occurring and the matter would then fall to be examined by the Community's standing veterinary committee.</P>
    <P>At the ministerial meeting on 10th and 11th January the question of the sugar production quota for Ireland was discussed at length.  The Community made a final offer of 150,000 tons as the basic sugar production quota for Ireland and this was subsequently accepted by the Government. This quota represents the quantity of sugar for which the Community will guarantee the full EEC price and does not limit the amount of sugar which we may produce.  We are free if we choose to avail of a supplementary quota of 50,000 tons for which the Community will guarantee a lower level of price support. Production in excess of 200,000 tons will not attract Community support. The Government have decided that the supplementary quota will be availed of to the extent necessary to ensure that there will be no drop in sugar beet production and that current output and employment is maintained in the sugar factories.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that <Col N="305" /> the question of our being involved militarily is uncertain and would he make a statement to the effect that we will not be committed militarily without a decision of Dáil Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can hardly make a more specific commitment than I have issued now in my direct reply: there will be no military or defence commitments involved in Ireland's entry to the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising further from the Minister's reply which is extremely incomplete, will he depart from the recorded statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this country will be willing to enter into military commitments as a member of the EEC?  Does that still represent Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that when the legislation before the House is passed, amended in accordance with Fine Gael amendments, it would not be possible for any commitment to be entered into involving either the raising of military forces or the declaration of war other than by Dáil Éireann without a further change in the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the change in the Constitution, it certainly is a matter for sovereign decision by the Irish Parliament and the Irish Government in the event of any future hypothetical developments such as referred to by Deputy O'Brien.  At the moment no such commitment is involved or foreseen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will state the factors which influenced his decision to accept the sugar quota agreed with the EEC; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's statement of 13th January sets out the considerations on which the decision was based to accept the Community's final offer of a basic sugar production quota of 150,000 tons.  I have circulated copies of this statement to Deputies.</P>
      <P>The question of the basic production quota was first raised by Irish officials on 23rd April, 1971.  They were informed that the matter was one to be dealt with during 1972 when the details of the transitional arrangements for agriculture were being worked out.  However, the Community decided towards the close of the negotiations that the matter should be settled in the negotiations and made a formal offer of a basic quota of 135,000 tons for this country on 21st December 1971.  I then sought a special negotiating meeting and put forward the precise quota sought by us.  This meeting was held on 10th and 11th January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state what is the tonnage which under this arrangement, taking into account the double price system, we can produce yielding the same return as at present?  Is it 180,000 tons or 185,000 tons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 200,000 tons. Allowing for the reduction in the EEC guarantee after 150,000 tons, we can get slightly better than existing prices for a 200,000 tons production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="307" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Which is 20 per cent more than the maximum we have produced so far?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister guarantee that there will be no redundancy in the sugar factories or the beet industry generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have already given that guarantee and I want to emphasise that the existing sugar refining facilities in factories are employing a number of people and that they are geared to the maximum employment of those people in the production of sugar from in the region of 180,000 tons.  We can under this arrangement get 200,000 tons which is in excess of the existing capacity of the sugar factories to deal with.  This means that far from employment being reduced, if we fill our quota there will be additional employment because extensions will have to be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why he never explained that to the people before?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is not true. Do I understand the Minister to suggest that we could produce up to 204,000 tons at the same financial return per ton as we are now getting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. What I am saying is that if we avail fully of (a), the Common Market guaranteed price up to 150,000 tons and (b), the 35 per cent contribution that will be made to us for the balance, together with whatever Exchequer assistance will be given by us in that event, we can ensure&mdash;the decision lies with ourselves&mdash;that up to 202,000 tons is produced at the maximum price available.  We can ensure that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not correct that the price for tonnage between 150,000 and 200,000 will be of the order of £60 per ton and is it not further correct that Irish farmers are now receiving about £94 a ton and that they are finding it difficult enough to make a profit? Surely the price will not be any incentive <Col N="308" /> to produce more than 150,000 tons when the price will be only two-thirds&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a total misapprehension.  Unfortunately, this is the sort of misleading talk that has been going around.  We have it in our control to ensure whatever price level operates up to 202,000 tons and we can marry the EEC price with Exchequer assistance to ensure that the maximum price is available.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that it became necessary in recent months to advise applicants for the electricity supply in some of the rural areas in the Dublin north west district that their applications could not be dealt with for a year.  This delay in giving supply under the rural electrification scheme is due to the high rate of house building in the rural areas around Dublin.</P>
      <P>Advertisements were recently placed in the press notifying prospective applicants of the need to apply before 28th February, 1972, if they wished to avail of the present subsidised rural electrification terms.  When all applications have been received the work programme will be reviewed and completed as quickly as the availability of capital and the necessary skilled construction staff will allow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Official estimates of tourist traffic in 1971 will not be available until later <Col N="313" /> this year.  Preliminary estimates prepared by Bord Fáilte show that, while the number of visitors last year was about the same as for 1970, tourist revenue increased from £99.1 million to £104 million at current prices.  In the case of Britain, the board's estimates show that traffic in 1971 increased by 0.9 per cent on 1970 and revenue by £1 million to £32.8 million.</P>
    <P>The effects of the political unrest in Northern Ireland are expected to continue to influence tourist traffic levels during 1972.  In their efforts to counteract the effects of these influences Bord Fáilte have revised their budget to provide additional funds for marketing and promotional work.  The board are carrying out an intensive sales campaign directed towards the travel agents in each of the main market areas.  Greater emphasis is being placed on the development of ethnic traffic and on the encouragement of home holidays.  There are prospects of increased revenue from the North American and continental markets.</P>
    <P>In the case of Britain, Bord Fáilte are mounting their biggest publicity campaign to date.  The board are spending about £100,000 on advertising there and this is being supplemented by £50,000 from carriers participating in joint advertising.  In addition, carriers and other tourist organisations are carrying out their own advertising and promotional campaigns.  The advertising is being backed up by a heavy programme of promotions and sales drives involving co-operation between Bord Fáilte and the industry with the participation of 100 trade representatives. Travel agents and journalists will be brought on sponsored visits to Ireland as a back-up to the general promotional activities.</P>
    <P>While I hope that the promotional and marketing campaigns of Bord Fáilte and the other tourist interests will bring about an increase in traffic and revenue in 1972 it would not be possible at this stage to make a meaningful forecast of the prospects of tourism for the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that already £60,000 of the £100,000 allocated to advertising has <Col N="314" /> been spent to date?  Is the Minister aware that the number of inquiries to date in comparison with those in the corresponding period of last year show a reduction of almost 50,000?  Does the Minister realise that the number of inquiries received in Britain show a reduction of 50,000?  There have been 50,000 fewer people making inquiries than did so last year.  Does the Minister realise that the manner in which Bord Fáilte have allocated this £60,000 has been stupid?  The largest proportion has gone to advertisement in British newspapers which have been notorious for their anti-Irish attitude. Is the Minister also aware that the amount allocated towards promotion in the only market in Britain where we had any hope&mdash;the ethnic market&mdash; is ridiculously low?  There is £40,000 to be spent still.  Will the Minister ensure that it is spent properly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Deputy up on the last point.  The emphasis must be placed on the Irish ethnic market in Britain.  So far as Bord Fáilte are concerned they have <i>carte blanche</i> from me to spend any money they deem advisable in that direction.  That is the area where we can pick up the slack from other areas. Bord Fáilte are aware of my attitude. The Deputies can be assured that there will be no shortage of money in so far as the Irish ethnic market is concerned. The idea is to get down to the roots of the Irish clubs.</P>

      <P>Prices for accommodation and table d'hote meals in hotels are determined by the individual hoteliers who furnish particulars of their maximum prices to Bord Fáilte for inclusion in the official hotel guide, which is published annually.  The prices are not subject to the prior approval of Bord Fáilte but once they have been published in the official guide they may not be exceeded during the year to which the guide relates without the board's consent.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that a comparison of the hotel prices in the 1972 guide with those for 1971 showed that 42.4 per cent of hotels have not increased their prices and 3.6 per cent have reduced their prices.  The remaining 54 per cent increased their prices, the overall average increase being 12 per cent.  In almost half of these hotels, the increase was less than 10 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are gravely concerned at the action taken by the Government of the United States in giving notice that the Aerlínte serrights at New York will terminate on 18th August next.  If the Aerlínte services between New York and Shannon were discontinued next August, the <Col N="319" /> effect would be disastrous not only for the airline but also for the Shannon region and for general tourism. Aerlínte accounts for the bulk of US/Ireland terminal traffic amounting to 60 per cent in 1970 or 72 per cent if traffic terminating at Dublin is included. The welfare of the national airline is vital to the welfare of Shannon and to tourism and there is no real conflict of interest between them.  In accordance with Government policy the airline stops at Shannon and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the US authorities as set out in President Nixon's letter to the Taoiseach which was the subject of a Dáil Question on the 9th December, remains unchanged.  In response to newspaper reports suggesting that the Government contemplated renunciation of US rights at Shannon the US authorities indicated through diplomatic channels that in such event they would have no option but to renounce Irish rights at Boston and Chicago in order to restore balance under the agreement and that in any subsequent negotiations they would find it difficult to consider granting more than one entry point in the US in return for Dublin and Shannon because many other countries of greater importance in aviation than Ireland had only one entry point in the US under the relevant bilateral agreements.</P>
    <P>Aerlínte estimates of the cost of turning around at Shannon and the assumptions on which they are based have been closely scrutinised by my Department with the assistance of Dr. Martin O'Donoghue, economic adviser in the Department of the Taoiseach. Both the estimates and assumptions were found to be accurate.  On the basis of these estimates Aer Lingus would have to incur additional capital expenditure of the order of £5 million to £6 million and additional continuing annual costs rising from £2.7 million. This would place Aerlínte in a serious loss position and, indeed, jeopardise the continuation of their transatlantic service unless massive subsidies could be assured.</P>
    <P>In the light of discussions with the <Col N="320" /> US to date, there is no indication that they would accept a turn-around at Shannon by Aerlínte as meeting their claims of imbalance in the operation of the bilateral agreement or would be prepared to exchange rights at New York, Boston and Chicago for rights at Shannon alone.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to resume negotiations at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the uncertainty about the future of Aer Lingus landing rights in America, does the Minister not think this is going to have a very adverse effect on the tourist industry this year; and that as we are now at the end of January there is need for urgent talks to clarify the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the ideal solution to this whole <i>impasse</i>, even at this late stage, is for the Minister and the Government to try to persuade the American Government to maintain the existing bilateral air agreement?  In the light of that, could the Minister tell me whether or not since the last negotiations broke down the Minister or the Government made any representations to the American Government along those lines and, particularly, has the Taoiseach replied to or followed up in any way the letter he received from President Nixon in early December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if Deputies appreciate how governments work, but I certainly can assure the House that at all stages in this matter our point of view in regard to landing <Col N="321" /> rights for the American airlines has been made known at every level of the American administration&mdash;and that means right up to the President himself&mdash;and that there has been no lack of communication in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that all the indications from the United States point to the fact that the Government here have not pursued this matter in a determined fashion, that the Government have not used every means at their disposal to persuade the American Government to withdraw the ultimatum?  Is the Minister further aware that there is an excellent chance that if the Government really got down to it they could still persuade the American Government to leave us alone?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is living in cloud cuckoo-land.  I have explained this fully to the members of the Shannon Action Committee, to the trade unions and all the other interests involved, that it is a fact of life that the American Government have decided to deny us entry into New York from August next.  This is vital to our tourism.  We want to recapture our position there and we have to bargain hard.  Bargaining means negotiating and that means that we have to try to get the best we can out of the situation. That is precisely what we are doing.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that initially this was a matter that was pushed on by the American airlines but that now it has got to a stage where in fact it is a matter between Governments at highest level? In view of that and in view of the special position of this State in regard to the United States and in view of the contributions that Irish people have made to the upbuilding of the United States would the Minister not agree that the matter of negotiations should be put on the highest possible Government level, not on an economic but a political level?  Would he not agree that the best outcome could be sought &mdash;I know there is risk in it but there is also possible gain&mdash;by the Minister indicating in the clearest way to the Americans the significance we place on this by undertaking the leading of the negotiations himself?  This seems to me a political way in which you can indicate that we are putting it on this plane and that we expect concessions.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say whether any steps have been taken to communicate our position to the American people?

    <P>Most of the reports mentioned in the Table were commissioned for the purpose of eliciting data and information on various problems under consideration in the Department.  In many cases the reports were not intended to provide specific recommendations and accordingly the question of formal implementation did not arise.</P>
    <P>As regards the two major reports completed in recent years the position is that the recommendations in the report on the cross-Channel freight services are in the process of implementation and the recommendations in the report on the financial position of CIE are at present the subject of consultation with the interests concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 27, 28 and 29 together.  Acting on the advice of the Irish Dental Association, and in pursuance of a demand for higher fees, a majority of dentists terminated their agreements to provide treatment for eligible insured workers under my Department's dental benefit scheme. However, a substantial number of dentists remain on the dental panel and treatment under the scheme is still available from those dentists.  Furthermore, some 6,000 insured workers over the normal number for that time of the year who applied for treatment from their dentists immediately before their resignation took effect on 1st December, 1971, are at present being treated under the scheme.  Since then some 4,000 additional late claims received <Col N="336" /> from dentists who have resigned have been admitted and treatment approved. Some 3,000 claims have also been received in the same period from dentists still on the dental panel.  I am not aware, therefore, that, so far, any considerable hardship has been caused to insured workers.</P>
      <P>As an interim arrangement, pending a closer study of the matter, including a general survey of the times taken for the various dental operations, which would provide a firmer and more satisfactory basis for determining a new scale of fees, an offer of a substantial overall percentage increase in fees has been made to the Irish Dental Association.  A reply to this offer has not yet been received from the association.</P>
      <P>I would add that I cannot accept that the matter at issue is one which could or should be referred to an arbitrator. We are in effect asking dentists to provide a service for fees which we consider provide them with a reasonable profit.  If they are unwilling to provide that service at a reasonable cost then the dental benefit scheme cannot be provided by my Department and I may be compelled to suspend or terminate it.  However, so long as a substantial number of dentists remain on the dental panel the scheme will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is entitled to outline the scheme which will compensate these insured workers, who are paying but not getting any service, and it is ridiculous for the Minister to suggest the scheme is in operation and organised properly at the present time; he is depriving people of a service for which they are paying and to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>That is the question. Each dentist was not allocated an equal number of patients and some dentists did little or no work under the scheme.

D'aontaigh an Ardchúirt go raibh altanna áirithe den dlí toghchánach neamhbhunreachtúil agus tar éis achomharc an Árd-Aighne a mheas chinntigh an Chúirt Uachtarach an bhreith seo.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to deal with the situation arising from the Supreme Court decision on the secrecy of the ballot.  The effect of a declaration of unconstitutionality is to remove from the law the provisions declared to be unconstitutional, and the law, excluding such provisions, continues to have effect.  The Dáil electoral law must therefore now be read as excluding the particular provisions found to be unconstitutional and at future Dáil elections the elector's number may not be written on the counterfoil of the ballot paper, but procedure otherwise &mdash;including the provision for serial numbers on the ballot papers and counterfoils&mdash;will remain unaltered. Amendment of the Dáil electoral law is not, therefore, essential and an election could be held without amending the law but it is desirable that it should be tidied up.</P>
    <P>The law relating to Presidential and Seanad elections was not at issue on the court case but a procedure identical with the Dáil election procedure for entering the elector's number on the counterfoil of his ballot paper is contained in each of these codes.  The Constitution provides that voting at Presidential and Seanad elections shall be by secret ballot and difficulty would, therefore, arise in relation to the conduct of these elections.  It would clearly be improper to comply with procedure which has been found to be unconstitutional in the context of Dáil elections, but clear authority to depart from this procedure would be lacking. It is necessary, therefore, to amend the law before a Presidential or Seanad election can be held.</P>
    <P>The Referendum Acts also contain provision for inserting the elector's number on the counterfoil of his ballot <Col N="346" /> paper.  While there is no specific provision in the Constitution requiring that referenda be conducted by secret ballot, it is clearly desirable that a vote at a referendum should enjoy the same protection of secrecy as a vote at a Dáil.  Presidential or Seanad election and the Bill also proposes to amend the procedure at a referendum. Detailed procedure at local elections is contained in regulations and it is proposed to amend these regulations before the next local elections.</P>
    <P>The courts did not advert to another procedure in the electoral law by which a ballot paper could conceivably be traced back to an individual elector after the election.  This procedure is contained in the postal voting rules which are common to Dáil and Presidential elections and referenda.  In accordance with this procedure the form of receipt signed by the postal voter indicates the serial number of the ballot paper received by him.  As in the case of other election documents the receipts are retained for a year and it would be possible by reference to the receipts and the ballot papers to find out how an individual elector voted.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be necessary to have an order from the Dáil or the High Court to obtain access to these documents.  However, the provisions found unconstitutional by the courts were struck down not on the basis that there was likelihood that the manner in which an elector voted could be ascertained but on the ground that there was a theoretical possibility, however remote, that this could be done.  Accordingly, under the arrangement proposed in the Bill a postal voter will in future simply acknowledge receipt of a ballot paper without specifying the number of such ballot paper.  The Bill also makes the necessary minor consequential changes in the postal voting rules.  Corresponding changes are proposed in the procedure at Seanad elections where voting is entirely by post.</P>
    <P>Deputies are no doubt familiar with the system of voting for the election of Panel members to the Seanad.  The elector is required to produce his voting papers to a prescribed person, <Col N="347" /> that is to say the Clerk or Clerk Assistant of the Dáil or Seanad. County Registrar, City or County Manager, County Secretary or Garda Superintendent, who witnesses the elector's signature on the declaration of identity and signs a certificate which is then attached to the envelope sent to the Seanad Returning Officer.  The purpose of this arrangement is to make it impossible for anybody other than the elector to whom the particular ballot papers were sent to vote by means of these ballot papers.</P>
    <P>This safeguard will be somewhat weakened by the fact that the declaration of identity and the ballot paper envelope will no longer show the serial number of the ballot papers.  Subsection 5 (e) of the Bill seeks to remedy this by requiring the prescribed person to destroy each outer envelope, that is to say, the envelope addressed to the elector, produced to him and thus ensure that an elector, having already voted by means of his own papers, cannot subsequently produce his own outer envelope and another elector's ballot papers to a second prescribed person.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the Bill prescribes new forms of ballot papers for use at Dáil and presidential elections and referenda.  These new forms are identical with the forms at present prescribed except that the space for the insertion of the voter's number on the counterfoil has been removed.</P>
    <P>Some wrong impressions seem to have gone abroad about the effect of the court ruling and I would like to correct these.  The only procedure found to be unconstitutional was the practice of writing the elector's number on the counterfoil of his ballot paper.  The courts were also invited to declare it unconstitutional to have serial numbers on ballot papers and counterfoils but did not do so.  The serial number will, therefore, be staying. It has been said also that it will now be impossible to prevent or detect personation. This is quite incorrect.  In the future as in the past, the prevention of personation will depend on the vigilance of presiding officers, personation agents and gardaí present at polling stations.  In the future as in the past, <Col N="348" /> conviction for personation will depend on the evidence of these officers and agents.  The only difference now is that it will no longer be possible for an election court trying an election petition to identify and exclude corrupt votes and order a new count to be carried out excluding such votes.  To put this in perspective, it should be remembered that we have not had a Parliamentary election petition since the State was founded.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the House appreciates the importance of having these necessary amendments to the various electoral codes effected as quickly as possible and I am confident that the House will see fit to give the measure a quick passage.  The Bill is purely a technical measure, its sole purpose being to deal with the situation arising from the Supreme Court ruling, and on this basis I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill which, as the Minister has pointed out, is simply a technical measure.  In certain areas there has been some element of doubt expressed from time to time regarding the secrecy of the ballot. Because voting papers may be retained for a certain period this did not help to eliminate the doubt that existed, particularly in small rural areas.  The removal of the voter's number from the counterfoil of the ballot paper will remove all doubts regarding the secrecy of the ballot.</P>
      <P>Heretofore the system was that the counterfoil had a number and there was a corresponding number on the back of the voting paper.  The presiding officer put down the number given on the voters' list on a special part of the counterfoil so that theoretically one could trace how a person had voted.  This left a certain amount of doubt in the minds of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never understood why it was necessary to put this number on the back of the ballot paper.  Apparently this practice had been adopted since the foundation of the State.  The Minister has not made any observation as to why it was thought necessary to do this during the years but now it is <Col N="349" /> deemed unconstitutional.  This measure will cover Dáil and Seanad elections, presidential elections and referenda but there is no mention of voting in county council elections.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister state if it will be possible in future to put down the voter's number on the brown cards which are sent to the electorate before the elections telling them where they are to vote?  I expect it will be possible to do that and I consider it desirable that it should be done.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us if this will be done; if not, perhaps something could be done to keep that form of notification because it is helpful.</P>
      <P>I note from the Minister's statement that the only part of the procedure deemed to be unconstitutional was the practice of writing the elector's number on the counterfoil of his ballot paper. However, there will still be a number on the back of the voting paper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us why it is deemed necessary to have numbers in sequence on the counterfoils and on the back of voting papers.  If the Minister intends to put the number on the voting paper, why not put it on the front of the paper.  It appears to me that there is still an element of secrecy or deception about it.  If there is a good and valid reason for retaining the number, perhaps the Minister would tell us.</P>
      <P>I did not know that the placing of numbers was not unconstitutional.  The unconstitutional factor was writing the elector's number on the counterfoil.  I take it that the Minister could have dropped the matter of having numbers on the back of the voting papers if he wished.  I am sure he has given this matter consideration and I should like to hear him explain the reason for the continuance of this practice.</P>

We have had a speech from Deputy Hogan which indicates clearly that Fine Gael really believes men are honest but to my mind this Bill clearly indicates that Fianna Fáil are not honest.  We have had this time and again.  We had the Electoral Act of 1959, the Bill dealing with the constituencies, the various referenda, all showing that the only desire of the Fianna Fáil Party is to be dishonest.  Their only fundamental desire is to be dishonest if they can.</P>

I do not mind admitting that I understood this was due to the fact that there was a number printed both on the counterfoil and on the ballot paper.  In spite of all the codology going on here this afternoon, it must be admitted that it is as easy to track a ballot from the number printed on the counterfoil as it is to track it from the number printed on the ballot paper.</P>

It suits Fianna Fáil to be able to say: &ldquo;We will know <Col N="355" /> how you vote and if you vote against us you will not be given a job on the roads next time you are unemployed&rdquo; or to say: &ldquo;You are due for a gangership but you will not be promoted if you vote against us&rdquo;.

      <P>What I meant was that a decent man like Deputy Connolly would not put himself out on a limb.  This Bill is all very well but it does not deal in any way with the fundamental problem.  According to the Minister's brief, this Bill is for the purpose of complying with the decision of the Supreme Court.  In the section of the Department of Local Government which deals with elections, did it not occur to anybody to reconsider the whole matter?  I am sure it must have occurred to somebody.  I hope civil servants adopt the same attitude towards problems now as they did when I was there: that was that they gave them much thought.  Therefore, I have no doubt that other points were put to the Minister but he did not seem to bother about them because it suits Fianna Fáil to operate in that way.</P>
      <P>It cannot be said that I have ever made allegations against Fianna Fáil but I stand over the allegation that it was they who were responsible for telling the people in the West of Ireland that it would be easy to ascertain how they voted.</P>

      <P>Of course, they can be postponed.  However, Deputy L'Estrange is making an allegation now and that is something that is not allowed in this House.  We here are all honourable and decent men and we must not make allegations or anything of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Seanad elections which, from a political point of view, do not count a great deal, I notice that great care is to be taken to ensure that voting cannot be traced.  Therefore, if a man promises to vote for &ldquo;Mr. A&rdquo; but if &ldquo;Mr. A&rdquo; suspects him subsequently, he will have no means of ascertaining whether his suspicions were justified.  We are told that subsection (5) (e) of the Bill seeks to remedy this by requiring the prescribed person to destroy each outer envelope, that is, the envelope addressed to the elector, and thus ensure that an elector, having voted already by means of his own paper, cannot produce subsequently his own outer envelope with another elector's ballot paper to a second prescribed person.  This shows that thought was given to the system in the Department of Local Government and I do not believe that thought was not given to the point I made earlier in this discussion.  Therefore, recommendations must have been made to the Minister but, no doubt, the Minister saw fit not to accept them.  We are told that the only procedure found to be unconstitutional was the practice of writing the elector's number on the counterfoil of his ballot paper.  This was the case that was made to the court.  We are told that the court were <Col N="357" /> invited also to take into consideration the question of numbers on ballot papers but that they did not do so.  In other words, all the Government are prepared to do is to accept the decision of the court in relation to the net matter on which the court decided and they do not have any thought themselves in relation to a much more serious matter.  I do not believe the practice of writing the person's voting number on the counterfoil is a serious matter at all because the only case in which it could come up would be where there was a petition about an election and, as the Minister said correctly, there has been no petition in this country since 1923.  No election has been petitioned, though indeed we have had a few long counts. The Minister says:</P>
    <P>The serial numbers will, therefore, be staying.</P>
    <P>This does not surprise me.  This Government are so conservative that they never move at all.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>It has been said also that it will now be impossible to detect personation. This is quite incorrect.</P>
    <P>I do not know who said this but I do not think the ballot papers were ever used to detect personation.  I do not see what it has to do with the ballot papers.</P>
    <P>This Bill implements the decision of the court&mdash;I admit that&mdash;but apart from that it is a pretence and an absolute cod.  The Bill is just a joke and is typical of people who carry out something in which they are not particularly interested because it might cut the ground from under them.  The pretence that is brought to bear on the voters in the more remote parts of rural Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think very often they do not reach the quota down in that part of the country.  This is not an honest Bill.  It is a typical example of the way the Fianna Fáil Party behave when they are put in a spot.  They always try to get out of it one way or <Col N="358" /> another.  The same applies to the other Bill coming up this evening.  They realise that the correct thing to do would be to have a referendam on going into the Common Market as a straight issue and then referenda about the Constitution. No.  The ikey stunt was thought up to have only one referendum and abolish the Constitution.  If the Constitution is abolished this whole thing will go.</P>

I think they admired the kind of effort that they approve of in an individual.  Let us be fair to them about that.

I would not have said one word about the Bill if it had been approached in an honest, upright way.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  It is a short Bill and it has been brought in to deal with the situation arising from the Supreme Court decision on the secrecy of the ballot.  Everyone who is over 21 and entitled to vote believes that there should be complete secrecy of the ballot.  When people vote, whether at local elections, referenda or Dáil elections, their votes should be cast in complete secrecy.  I understand that the present system of election in regard to secrecy has been in operation here since 1923.  It has continued under our 1937 Constitution.  We have had changes of Government during that period and no Government made the changes which are proposed now. These proposals came about as a result of a petition to the Supreme Court and they are in line with the Supreme Court decision.</P>
      <P>I find it hard to understand why Deputy O'Donovan says that the Bill is just a joke and that it is dishonest. When the Government bring in a Bill they know well that it is the right of any individual to appeal to the courts and to appeal to the Supreme Court. That court has shown that it is completely impartial.  It has made many decisions against Acts which have been passed here, and that is as it should be.  The Minister introduced this short Bill to bring the law into line with one of their latest decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the courts were also invited to declare it unconstitutional to have serial numbers on ballot papers and counterfoils but did not do so.  Up to now a person's <Col N="360" /> number was recorded on the ballot paper and also on the counterfoil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the counterfoil. There is a little weakness here and it is the question of how one is to identify corrupt practices.  It depends on the evidence of personating agents, Garda officers or presiding officers.  Under the old system it was probably easier, having the number on the counterfoil. From now on it will be difficult, but the Supreme Court gave a decision.  It was also invited to give further decisions which it did not give.  This Bill just goes as far as to comply with the Supreme Court decision.  Surely nobody can say that it is dishonest to bring in a Bill to comply with a Supreme Court decision.</P>

I agree we have publicminded people in this country who are interested in fair play and justice and, despite what I might say about some justices and judges, we still have an independent Judiciary, particularly in the Supreme Court.  The Minister said that the courts were invited to declare unconstitutional the practice of having serial numbers on ballot papers but that they did not do so.  I do not know why it is necessary to have these numbers. The Department must have had some doubts because it is provided here:</P>
      <P>The back of each ballot paper shall be numbered consecutively and the back of the counterfoil attached to it is to bear the same number. The number on the back of the ballot paper shall be printed in the smallest characters compatible with legibility.</P>
      <P>Who is to decide that?  Will there be specific instructions to every returning officer?  Will the Minister give definite instructions on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, it seems the Department had doubts when they decided to have the numbers printed on the back of the ballot papers.  On the ordinary ballot papers there will be the numbers and the words &ldquo;an election for the constituency of&rdquo;.  Why is that necessary? I am not at all satisfied that votes cannot be traced.  Under this system a personating agent in a particular booth will know the number of every person who votes.  I know that from past experience.  I have been director of elections in eight or ten constituencies. <Col N="363" /> In a particular booth a series starts at I and ends at 100.  The personating officer can put down in rotation how the people vote.  He can see that No. 6 on the register voted first.  No. 15 voted second and No. 13 third.  He could tell you the number.</P>

      <P>It is a pity the Minister has not gone further and provided for the introduction of a stamp that would perforate the paper. Deputy O'Donovan said there are astute operators in Fianna Fáil and I agree entirely with him.  He said Fine Gael had indicated that the people are honest.  We made that mistake, because anybody as long in politics as I am knows how astute Fianna Fáil are at election time.  I was interested to hear Deputy Meaney say that votes cannot be identified but I know people in <Col N="364" /> rural areas of Ireland who think the opposite.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan hinted at this being all codology.  The Minister for Local Government said it was disgraceful to make such allegations.  A Minister for Local Government before the present Minister had a county council lorry going around the county with 37 to 40 road workers personating at one pooling booth after another.  That is true.  Some of them swore affidavits afterwards about that incident.  It did not happen too far from the present chairman's constituency.</P>

      <P>They have won elections by their carry-on.  The vote should be secret.  I want the House to put an end to the despicable aspects of such conduct by unscrupulous Fianna Fáil people.  Such people, Mafia from the Parliamentary Secretary's county, went around in the dead of night&mdash; Deputy O'Donovan mentioned this earlier&mdash;in Sligo Leitrim, Roscommon, Donegal, west Limerick, Kerry and <Col N="365" /> Wicklow.  The Mafia may be broken up now because Deputy Andrews does not agree with Deputy Blaney who was one of the principal organisers&mdash;and a useful one&mdash;in the party in bygone days.  They went to the homes of widows at night and told them to vote for &ldquo;so-and-so&rdquo; or their pensions would be stopped.  They told them that they would find out who they voted for and that if they had not voted for Fianna Fáil they would lose their pensions. They also went to the road workers at the dead of night and said that they would find out who they voted for and that if they had not voted for Fianna Fáil they would lose their work on the roads.  They went to forestry workers and to Land Commission workers throughout the country.  This is very well known and if this Bill does nothing more than put an end to that despicable practice, which has gone on for far too long, it will be doing something worthwhile.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied.  I want the Minister to arrange to take the numbers off the ballot papers altogether and to arrange for a proper stamper so that we will not have the trouble which we have had at previous elections.  I have seen arguments going on for hours over stampers.  A stamp should be made which would perforate the voting papers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy L'Estrange.  I am glad there are some people who have sufficient interest in the practice of politics, which are at their lowest ebb, so that they are prepared to come into this Chamber and discuss this Bill.  I was afraid when I saw this Bill that it would pass through the House in five minutes because it is a small technical Bill.  I am glad that that has not happened.  An opportunity has been given to talk here about the Bill and, with the leave of the Chair, about some ancillary matters connected with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out that this Bill was not brought before us by a reforming Fianna Fáil Government which recognised the defects in the electoral system.  It has been brought before us reluctantly by the present <Col N="366" /> Minister for Local Government who has been forced to do so by the Supreme Court.  I do not think this Bill goes far enough but I would like to commend the public spiritedness of the private citizens who took the action which, in the first instance, compelled the Minister for Local Government to come into this Chamber and bring this Bill before us.  I agree completely with Deputy O'Donovan and with Deputy L'Estrange in that I do not think this Bill goes far enough.</P>
    <P>No election is ever completely crystalline, spotless and pure.  We, as a small party, face the enormous financial advantage which the Fianna Fáil Party with their secret reservoirs of big industrial funds have at election times.  The extent of their resources in the form of cars, loudspeakers, posters, ministerial spokesmen, and State-paid Mercedes cars would make one wonder how the process of elections could be conducted in a democratic fashion at all.  There was a certain candidate in this city who used to provide free drinks.  That did not do him too much good.  Even if we had a clean system of elections we are up against such things.  One of the most despicable things which Fianna Fáil ever did was to abolish the law which compelled the election agent to make a return accounting for the expense of a candidate's campaign and insisting that that expense must not exceed some fraction of an old penny in respect of each voter in that constituency.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that that Act was enforced.  It was evaded blatantly.  I have been engaged in election work for 20 years.  I have been at many elections in my time.  I have observed what happened at close quarters, particularly in 1954 and 1957 when, in the first instance, I was in the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;God forgive me, everybody is entitled to one mistake&mdash;and I could see the machine working from the inside. I was outside the party in 1957. I could see what happened from the outside on that occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I followed Deputy Noel Browne into Fianna Fáil and I followed him out of it like a little child. <Col N="367" /> I regard myself as not being fully responsible for my actions at that period.  I had not attained adult status at that stage.  I remember meeting a good friend of mine in the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;he remained a friend even after I left the party&mdash;and we discussed the election in which Fianna Fáil succeeded in taking the seat from Deputy Noël Browne.  This man boasted that he had spent £15,000 on the election campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>What can one do against people like that, even if the system was straight, which it is not? Deputy Browne was in no position to spend £15,000.  I recall being an area director for Fianna Fáil at an election in 1954.  By the time the final count was reached all political divisions among the parties had disappeared and the only point to be decided was whether ex-Deputy MacEntee or Deputy Noel Browne would retain the seat.  I remember seeing amongst those counting the votes two of the people who had been canvassing for Fianna Fáil in the election campaign which had taken place in the three preceding weeks.  I had to tap one man on the shoulder because he put into a MacEntee box a transfer with a Browne preference on it.  There were something like 200 votes separating the candidates so this did not matter too much, but in an election like we had in 1965 in Longford/Westmeath and in Dublin North-East four votes settled the issue.  The importance of the secrecy of the ballot and of the utilisation of this sort of influence is vital to the maintenance of any sort of democracy in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the necessity for making a change before the local government elections.  It is not too much to ask the Minister to give us some small hint here&mdash;Deputy O'Donovan has probed him with his characteristic sense of humour on this issue&mdash; as to when the local government elections will be held.  At the moment in Dublin there is no local government at all.  We have one man holding meetings <Col N="368" /> with himself and, presumably, the shaving mirror, and signing orders in the name of Dublin Corporation.  The Minister has said that the White Paper on local government organisation would have to be implemented before the local government elections could be held.  It is not good enough for the Minister to talk blandly here about the next local elections, which are due in a few months time, and give us no hint as to when these elections will be held. I put this challenge directly to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy L'Estrange and Deputy O'Donovan, I see no need at all for the retention of the serial numbers.  The point has been made that personations might be made easier if they disappeared. I do not think this point is valid.  First of all, if the supreme exponents of personation, to wit, the Fianna Fáil Party, are content that the serial numbers should remain on the paper, then obviously they do not regard these as a material obstacle to their conducting the practice of personation at which they are so expert. I do not see why these serial numbers should be retained.</P>
    <P>The point about the stamp is very important.  I have acted as a personating officer on several occasions and acted as director of elections on eight occasions, and if I may say so I have been successful in every one of those except two which I regard as being consequent upon factors outside my control. I, too, have witnessed the manner in which the returning officers have scrutinised the stamp to see if it is there, if it is faint or if it is not.  A stamp should be introduced of a kind about which there could be absolutely no doubt as to whether it appeared on the paper.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that the secrecy of the ballot is unbreakable, that it is impossible to detect how a person votes.  We had this idyllic picture of voting in Ireland painted by the Minister for Local Government and by Deputy Meaney, a perfect system, worthy of classical Greece in which everybody rationalises his mind and then goes out and votes for Fianna Fáil.  Who is fooling who in all this? In Dublin certainly it may be difficult <Col N="369" /> to get away with intimidation or influencing voters, for instance, in the polling stations in the constituency which I have the honour to represent where the votes run into thousands. However, there are polling stations&mdash; and I noticed this when I was directing the Labour campaign in Longford-Westmeath some time ago&mdash;which run well below the 100 mark and which are in private houses.  There are polling stations which run down as low as 30 in some parts of this constituency. Given a low vote in an area like that there may be 15 to 20 people who are voting in that particular box, and for anyone to suggest that it is not possible to work out exactly who is or who is not voting for Fianna Fáil is for that person to seek to pull the wool over the eyes of the electorate.  These are the polling stations where you find the biggest concentration of Fianna Fáil cars, Fianna Fáil posters, where you find personating agents at desks for Fianna Fáil, who can see the number as the slip is torn off, who can look beady-eyed at the person who is doing the voting.  You will not get a Fine Gael man there probably and you certainly will not get a Labour man there doing this, because neither of us have the resources, but you will certainly get a Fianna Fáil man there doing this.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government and Deputy Meaney can say that the idea that the ballot is not secret is ridiculous.  The fact remains&mdash;and Deputy L'Estrange and Deputy Dr. O'Donovan are completely right here &mdash;that this fear is inclucated in the minds of people&mdash;and, particularly, old people, people dependent on pensions and people with memories going back to the personating days of the 20s and the 30s, when the practice of personating was widely used, as any historian knows&mdash;that it will be known what way they vote.  That fear is inculcated assiduously by the Fianna Fáil organisation in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Donovan has made another excellent point which characterises one of the most disgusting things about Fianna Fáil.  It is not the Minister for Local Government who goes down and does this exercise; it is not any of the people in the front bench. <Col N="370" /> It is like Henry II getting rid of Becket.  He does not say: &ldquo;Kill Becket&rdquo;.  He says: &ldquo;I wish somebody would get rid of Becket,&rdquo; and a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse. The Ministers in their beautiful mohair suits travel around in their State cars, believing they preside, moryah, over a world of truth and beauty, but the local representatives, the back benchers, know their duty to the Department and in addition to going round the country saying we are all communists here, we are all divorcees and everything else, another little trick they do is to drop the hint in the ear of the old person in one of these small polling stations that his pension or his livelihood is in jeopardy if he does not vote according to the party line.  Anybody, like Deputy L'Estrange, who keeps sophisticated tally card records in a rural constituency knows perfectly well that, in a small polling station of, say, 50 voters, at the end of an election you can put a name on everybody who voted.  I should like to go further and say these polling stations are too small. I do not know if this is directly relevant to the Bill, but I just want to make the point.  I know it would create a difficulty.  The polling stations were originally designed in the days when everybody either walked or used a bicycle; today transport and communications are much more rapid.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that from Deputy L'Estrange.  Let us hope in that case that it will be more difficult, but I still say that given any structure of politics&mdash;and heaven knows no structure of politics is perfect, and I as a professor of political science am the first to concede that professors cannot construct perfect political systems&mdash;in a small country like ours with relatively small polling stations, with the presence of Fianna Fáil personating agents, with the number on the counterfoil the same as the number on the ballot paper, there will be this hidden fear among certain people that their vote will be known, and I honestly believe that the Fianna Fáil organisation in rural Ireland relies heavily on this fact.  When we consider that there <Col N="371" /> are only 144 seats in this House and that the majorities are rarely in excess of two or three seats, we realise how important the exercise of this power is and how fundamentally important the use of the vast resources of the Fianna Fáil Party is in intimidating people into voting for the party.  If this fear were erroneous I would accept with pleasure Deputy Meaney's assurance that it was erroneous, but it exists, and if it exists it is because that party has inculcated it into the electorate over the past 40 years.</P>

      <P>We see now that Deputy Thornley on television is a different man from Deputy Thornley in the House.  If he was not pushed so much by other forces in Dublin North West he would not possibly be using some of the language he has been using in this House and outside it over the past few months.  During the past few months the Deputy has been using rather peculiar language in relation to certain organisations.  That is because pressure has been put on him and he is yielding to pressure inside the House in order to save his own skin for fear that other people at some stage might be resurrected to contest elections in the future.  On the next occasion Deputy Thornley might be glad of a few marks on the ballot papers as, indeed, might other members of the Labour Party.  The foul type of character assassination that we have heard tonight from Deputy Thornley and others, the references to honourable members of the Fianna Fáil organisation will not be accepted by the people. Members of our organisation would not stoop to those tactics.  The people in the last analysis decide.  They have decided over the years.  They have put their marks in the right place and I am quite certain they will continue to do so in the future.  The official workers of the Fianna Fáil organisation, because of the tremendous vote over the years, because of the confidence of the people <Col N="373" /> over the years, have done a wonderful job.  Deputy Thornley and others now seek to cast a slur on the effectiveness of the Fianna Fáil organisation and on the characters of the Fianna Fáil workers.  These workers are honourable men and women who have devoted their time and energy to ensure that the people understood the policies of this party.  It was on the policies as presented by the party that candidates were elected not because numbers were scribbled on the ballot papers.</P>
      <P>I am glad that at last we are educating Deputy Thornley and all the other doctors of the Labour Party, together with the other doctor they intend to bring in, Dr. Paisley.  I am quite sure he will fit in well with the other doctors in the Labour Party.  They seem to have a monopoly at the moment.  It appears that the ordinary rank and file are no longer wanted. They will no longer be looking for a mark on the ballot papers from the ordinary rank and file workers because they have been ditched by the Labour Party and they are endeavouring to import people like Dr. Paisley to replace the honest to God hard-working Labour members who in the past sought the confidence of the people to elect them because they understood their problems.</P>

I am quite sure there will be a lot of people written off as a result of the ballots that will take place there and possibly Deputy Thornley will be one of them.  The question of large scale personation has been outlined by Deputy Thornley.  Of course, this is another fairy tale that the Labour Party have trotted out from time to time when they have done badly.  In the last Dáil they were much stronger than they are in this Dáil and with the decline in the party they will be much smaller in the next Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> During the last election campaign we heard about the wonderful policies of the party.  The only thing the public want are policies that will be pursued by a party.  We know what happened the Labour Party on the last occasion, despite the fact that they had large scale personating teams out in Dublin city.  I know in my own area that thousands of pounds were poured into the campaign by individuals who did a very extensive tour and obtained this money.  Many of the votes obtained by the Labour Party in the Ballyfermot area on the last occasion were as a result of this type of personation that Deputy Thornley indicated was in existence in Dublin South West.  Whose money was it?  It was the hard-earned money of the Dublin workers which was paid out by contributions at political level.  The Labour Party got substantial contributions from the ordinary workers of Dublin.  Deputy Thornley spoke about the amount of money contributed to the campaign but he did not mention about the crucifying of the Irish workers to extract the last halfpenny from them so that certain Labour Party members might be elected.</P>

He will be dealing with a different type of person from those with whom he deals in Montrose.  He will be dealing with people really concerned about problems, with the Fianna Fáil members, with people who showed their concern when others tried to wreck the democratic system by the action they took, not once but on a number of occasions, in the council chamber; and, no sooner were they dissolved, than they went around crying and asking could the order dissolving them be rescinded because they wanted to go back into the Dublin Corporation.  I am sure the Minister for Local Government will give the people an opportunity of electing responsible members to Dublin Corporation at some time in the future.

There are members of the Labour Party who do not approve of this system, who do not approve of people having the opportunity to indicate whom they want to support.  Now, after 30 years in the wilderness, they are whinging about it being possible to check back on how some guy voted out in Cabra or in some other area.  This is just a coverup for the inefficiency of the Labour Party.  I do not know whether or not Fine Gael indulge in personation but, if there was personation, they should have been efficient enough to spot it. I must admit that on the last occasion a number of people got through the net in our area&mdash;that was the last election in which they will get through <Col N="378" /> the net&mdash;from the Labour Party.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the Bill goes we welcome it.  It is somewhat extraordinary that on such a major constitutional matter no initiative was taken by successive Ministers for Local Government until the matter was finally brought to the courts.  Electoral law should be under continuous review and we should not have to wait until the courts decide an issue to discover whether or not certain articles are or are not constitutional.  We were aware of a constitutional query, as it were, in relation to the particular practice under discussion.  It is astonishing that Mr. Boland did not take action as Minister for Local Government; he has been very eloquent about the sacrosanct provisions of the Constitution.  Deputy Neil Blaney as Minister for Local Government took no initiative in this.  He, too, had an opportunity of ensuring that the unconstitutional section of the Electoral Act would have been deleted but did not do so.  Yet, he now careers around the country assuring everybody of his undying devotion to the Constitution. He was rather loath in his pretty busy period as Minister for Local Government to apply the Constitution to the electoral law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having welcomed the Bill in that context I think the Minister does not deal with the serious matter of abuse which still exists in electoral practices. There is nothing to prevent a personating agent taking a number off the ballot paper, putting it on the register opposite the name and number of the elector and then subsequently&mdash;say in a very small electoral area where a count of the 250 or 350 electors is done separately by the returning officer&mdash;there is <Col N="380" /> nothing to prevent the possibility of the elector's identity, and how he voted, being known to those in possession of the register.  In that context there is a real possibility of abuse in many rural areas.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the Minister the study done by Trinity College political science students under Professor Basil Chubb in relation to Donegal.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael personating officers were in a position to indicate pretty accurately how families in certain townlands, Catholic and Protestant, voted.  Using the electoral law as it stands and as amended I am sure they will still be in a position to track down with reasonable certainty how a particular person voted.  I am thinking of a small electoral register of about 300 people.  I gather the new regulation is that no polling station shall have less than 300.  This tends to prevent abuse but I gather the possibility is still open.</P>
    <P>I have raised the matter now because I have raised it here before and I am not raising it merely in relation to the Second Reading of this Bill.  The Minister should give some general indication of his views.  However, I strongly welcome the fact that the courts and the judiciary have now found that the practice of writing the elector's number on the counterfoil of his ballot paper is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I am still rather concerned about the postal voting system.  I have raised this matter also on a number of occasions and I propose now to make only a few brief points in relation to it.  I have previously suggested there is the possibility of serious abuse in relation to the postal voting system.  I am not satisfied that we have given the security forces, the Army and the Garda, who must avail of the postal voting system, the assurance they should have.  These are critical times in which one should give more than an offhand assurance. We should be able to say authoritatively and unequivocally to a garda or member of the Army that his vote cannot be traced.  This is a serious matter.  I have pointed out to the Minister that in a recent by-election in South County Dublin in which I was director of elections for the Labour Party we had available to us the actual <Col N="381" /> return of the postal vote, because in our opinion the counting of the votes was not done properly and we were able to say that so many guards and so many Army personnel on that register voted for Labour or for Fianna Fáil, or Fine Gael or for Independent candidates. When you consider that in a constituency like South County Dublin, where the total number of postal votes is about 430, you can say that 23 members of the Garda or Army voted Labour, 70 or 80 voted Fianna Fáil, 60 or 70 voted Fine Gael and 30 or 40 voted for the Independent candidate, you see the position.  You have the postal vote register and you can start the kind of thing which used go on in the old days when a Fianna Fáil Deputy went to a house and said: &ldquo;I know you did not vote for me; I checked it at the count and I shall remember that.&rdquo;  The unfortunate family were intimidated into voting the &ldquo;right way&rdquo; the next time.</P>
    <P>This does happen in certain rural areas and indeed in certain urban areas.  People think in the same way. The Irish electorate, I regret to say, in terms of their entitlement under electoral law are illiterate, unaware and uninformed of their legal rights. They do not know and are not told of their electoral and constitutional entitlements.  That is why we find ourselves discussing this matter now in this way.  Fortunately, Deputy Dowling has now gone.  If this is the level of contribution one can expect from Fianna Fáil in regard to electoral law I tremble to think what the prospects would be if the like of Deputy Dowling ever reaches ministerial office. We shall show our contempt with general silence.  However, I would ask the Minister to have another look at the postal voting rules.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is provided for in this Bill.  I do not know if the Deputy has studied the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond </NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  I have marked the section here.  I want to get on to one particular rule the Minister might make.  He recently conveyed to returning officers in various places that particularly where postal votes are being counted they should be turned <Col N="382" /> face downwards.  Normally, returning officers turn the other votes face upwards. A further suggestion in relation to postal votes is this: I think it is highly invidious, undesirable and most questionable that the votes of a particular occupational group, especially the security forces, should be counted separately either the night before the count or during the count itself.  The Minister may have observations to make: I am talking about what I have seen happen and which may not have been according to electoral rules.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that some returning officers take a rather liberal view of what people want at a certain polling station and, in fact, they may not be acting in accordance with the statutory rules.  I suggest that these postal votes should be counted with the other votes.  Measures should be taken to ensure that it would be physically impossible, either from the point of view of observation or otherwise, to define how even a proportion of the security forces in a constituency cast their votes.</P>
      <P>Following the passage of this Bill, the Minister will send copies of the revised regulations to the returning officers.  We are slipshod and lacking in normal democratic dignity in relation to the manner in which we conduct our elections.  Far too many people are asked to vote in scruffy, insanitary &ldquo;kips&rdquo; of polling stations; old disused tennis clubs, dilapidated halls, and run-down premises without any sanitary facilities or electricity are used for this purpose.  Frequently people have to vote by candlelight at by-elections in rural areas.  Under our Constitution people have the right to vote, and on average people vote every three and a half years, but it is degrading and not in keeping with the democratic traditions we are trying to build up and it is destructive of our democratic procedures that people should be asked to vote in such conditions.  I would ask the Minister to direct returning officers to have some minimum general standards applied with regard to polling stations.  We have long enough between elections to investigate the condition of the stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The job of the presiding officer is <Col N="383" /> not an easy one.  Adequate finance should be made available to him to conduct his job in an efficient manner. It is not unknown that returning officers frequently ask the candidates and the directors of elections for the various parties to continue throughout the night with the proceedings because otherwise he would have to pay another £200 or £300 to the polling clerks for another day's work.  This kind of skimping and the failure to make adequate provision to ensure that the count is conducted properly is to be deplored.</P>
    <P>There should be some rule or regulation introduced whereby counting of votes would be conducted with a reasonable degree of expedition.  It is an absolute farce that in some cases it takes from 48 to 60 hours to count votes.  In these days when electronic calculators are available, when one can have much improvement in counting procedures, it is ludicrous that such long delays should occur. There is nothing more ridiculous than to have the electorate waiting for hours on end for the results of counts. Generally, the returning officers do not employ enough counting clerks.  The Minister should make available through his Department new and modern equipment which would enable polling clerks and returning officers to carry out their work quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make known to the superintendents and the Garda Síochána in each area the procedures relating to the presence of candidates and their supporters outside polling stations.  It must be stated that the Government have been more prone to use this kind of subtle face-to-face intimidation of electors.  I do not think electors are unduly influenced by people screaming and yelling at them outside the polling stations and by stuffing Fianna Fáil canvassing into their pockets in the hope that this will cause them to vote for Fianna Fáil candidates.  It is undesirable that there should be such a plethora of microphones, cars and so on, in front of the polling stations so that the electors have difficulty in entering these stations.  This may add a certain <Col N="384" /> gaiety, tension and excitement to the atmosphere but many electors have told me they are sick and tired of this nonsense.  There should be clear directions given to the Garda Síochána to ensure that the electors are not intimidated by such performances.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider using the facilities available to him on Telefis Éireann and the publicity arrangements in the Department of Local Government to make available to school-children and to the young people who will be coming on to the electoral register information regarding the electoral system.  Only a fraction of the electorate have the slightest idea of what PR is about or how a ballot paper should be marked right through the paper.  Our electorate are ill-informed regarding these matters and the Minister should give serious consideration to making available to young people a comprehensive guide on the subject.  This will enable young people to understand what they are doing when they cast their vote.</P>
    <P>I hope that the next Electoral Bill to be brought before the Dáil will include votes at 18 years.  Politicians have a nerve and a cheek to talk about democracy and the exercise of the franchise when on average most people are unable to vote until they are 22½ years of age.

      <P>I appreciate the reception the Bill has received from both Opposition Parties.  Although many other matters have been raised in the course of the debate and many suggestions have been made to me that there are other aspects of the electoral law which may be in need of revision or improvement again I should like to reiterate that I am merely dealing here with the position that has arisen because of the decision in the Supreme Court.  I realise fully that other aspects of the electoral law are in need of improvement, <Col N="385" /> aspects of a technical and a procedural nature.  A fairly comprehensive Bill is being prepared at the moment to deal with these matters and I hope to be able to introduce it in the House in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan raised an interesting point.  I should like to elaborate a little on the history of the question of including the voter's number on the counterfoil of the ballot paper.  It goes back to the 1923 Electoral Act.  The voting procedure in parliamentary elections is based on that Act which closely follows the provisions contained in Part I of the Ballot Act, 1872.  The Ballot Act, 1872, required each ballot paper and the attached counterfoil to be numbered, the number being printed on the back of the ballot paper and on the face of the counterfoil.  It also required that the voter's number on the register of voters should be marked on the counterfoil.</P>
      <P>The voting system under the 1872 Act was specifically designed to permit scrutiny of votes after an election, should the necessity for this arise.  The introduction of the 1872 Act was preceded by a report of a special parliamentary committee on the electoral system.  Specific consideration was given by that committee to two different systems of voting which were then current in Australia.  One was the South Australia system and the other was the Victoria system.  In the South Australia system there was absolute secrecy.  On establishing his right to vote, the voter received a ballot paper bearing neither number nor mark.  In the Victoria system, before being handed to the voter the ballot paper was marked by the returning officer with a number corresponding to the voter's number on the electoral roll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framers of the 1872 Act rejected the South Australia system and accepted the Victoria system with the modification that the ballot paper and the counterfoil should be numbered serially, the number on the ballot paper being printed on the back.  Before the ballot paper was handed to the voter his number on the voters' register was marked on the counterfoil.  So it was <Col N="386" /> the Victoria system which the Oireachtas borrowed in 1923, via the Ballot Act, 1872.  I suppose it is no harm to remind the House, in view of the criticisms of this requirement which have come from the Opposition Deputies, that the 1923 Act was passed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government at that time.  Since then a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas sat and considered our electoral law.  They did not recommend that there should be any change in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is a bit unfair for Opposition Deputies to insinuate that there was a lack of initiative on my part and that I was forced to bring this forward because of the Supreme Court decision rather than taking this step myself.  As I said, I am preparing a comprehensive Bill to deal with improvements in procedural and technical matters relating to electoral law.  Because of the imminence of the referendum at the moment, and the possibility of a general or Presidential election, or a Seanad election at any time, it is incumbent on any Minister to take action as soon as possible after such a decision has been issued from the Supreme Court.  This is why I came forward with this interim step to tidy up this section of our electoral law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan referred to the issue of voters' polling cards and suggested that this should be continued.  He asked whether this Bill will interfere in any way with the issue of voters' polling cards which enable electors registered on the voters' list to know in advance their exact number on the voters' list.  This is done for the convenience of voters and this Bill will in no way interfere with or change that procedure.</P>
    <P>Great play was made with the use of serial numbers on ballot papers. Deputy Hogan raised this matter and a number of other Deputies had various things to say about it, including Deputy L'Estrange.  Some allegations were made which I wish to refute.  It was alleged that it was possible to trace the manner in which any voter had, in fact, voted through the agent in the polling booth being in a position subsequently to compare the number on a ballot paper with the actual marking <Col N="387" /> on the ballot paper as discovered at the count.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned the law remains as it stands and the local elections are due to be held this year.  No decision not to hold them has been taken by me or by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether some Deputies studied this Bill carefully. There is not very much that is new in it other than the removal of the provisions which make it obligatory to record the voter's number on the counterfoil, but in dealing with the Bill they seemed to insinuate that there was quite an amount of personation at elections. They reached the extraordinary conclusion that this was so and that it was carried on only by Fianna Fáil. Facts do not prove that there has been wholesale personation at any elections that have been held here since the foundation of the State and there has not been any occasion on which a petition has been presented either to the Dáil or to the courts for the purpose of dealing with such matters.  Therefore, it is somewhat glib and a little too easy for Deputies to come here and simply make these types of political charges. The fact that an all-party committee sat in 1960-61 to consider this issue and that they decided at the time not to recommend any changes on this particular aspect of electoral law, is of <Col N="389" /> some significance.  It was alleged by Deputies O'Donovan and L'Estrange, among others, that under this particular system the Government were able to intimidate persons by implying that it was possible to discover after an election which way any person voted.  This allegation is dishonest and if Opposition Deputies were of the opinion that there was any truth in it I would suggest to them that Depuies of their own parties who were members of that joint committee on the electoral law could have pressed for this change during their time as members of that committee. Instead, the committee were unanimous in their decision not to recommend any change and the only reason I am making a change is because I am obliged to do so as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court.  It would be no harm to remind the House of who represented Fine Gael and Labour on that committee.  Among the members were Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Jack McQuillan, then a Deputy, George Russell, then a Deputy, and the late Deputy Sweetman.  However, much more interesting would be to tell the House that a certain Senator L'Estrange, as he was then, also was a member of the committee which did not recommend any change in this law. So much for the allegations that have been made to the effect that there was a reluctance on my part, or on the part of any predecessor of mine, in bringing forward legislation of this kind.</P>

      <P>However, Deputy L'Estrange raised an interesting point in relation to the stamp and I would agree with him on this.  There is no necessity to change the law on this matter.  In fact, the law envisages that the mark will be embossed or perforated so that the choice is there already. I share the view expressed by the Deputy about having the mark stamped clearly on the ballot paper and I will look into this matter which I consider <Col N="390" /> to be of some importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have told the Deputy, I am prepared to look into the matter and to take some action in regard to it.  Deputy Thornley referred to the limit of expenses of political parties or of any candidate at election times.  As he is aware, perhaps, this arrangement existed up to 1963 when it was dropped.  It was dropped on the recommendation of the all-party joint committee on the electoral law so that again this was a question on which all sides of the House decided to take certain action, but we now have members of parties who were represented at that committee coming here and criticising decisions of their colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but the Deputy should appreciate also that in making the allegation it would apply to all parties in this House.  It was not a particular wish of the governing party at the time, Fianna Fáil, that such should be the case.  Therefore, the point I made was a fair one in consideration of what the Deputy said.</P>
      <P>There was another rather amusing allegation from the Labour Party to the effect that Fine Gael and Labour did not have enough money to provide personating agents at all the booths in rural areas.  This may be an indication of the philosophy of the Labour Party and it may well be the reason for much of their failure in the political field since their establishment.  Since their foundation they have never managed to increase substantially their representation in the House. Certainly, they have never presented any great danger to a governing party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Thornley believes that it is the availability of finance that enables any political party to man the polling booths and to have an efficient political organisation on the day of voting. In that he is mistaken greatly and I would like to assure him that persons who carry out these functions for <Col N="391" /> Fianna Fáil&mdash;the party of which I am proud to be a member&mdash;do not do so for any remuneration.</P>

      <P>The question of the condition of polling stations was raised but, although it may not be relevant to the Bill, I take the point.  Deputy Desmond said that some of these stations are unsuitable for the purpose and that there was a certain amount of inconvenience to those who worked in them on election days.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that the selection of polling stations is made by local authorities in the different areas and often returning officers have great difficulty in finding suitable locations for polling.  In order not to involve people in long journeys they make great efforts to locate the polling stations as near as possible to the area in which the people are living.  These are difficulties that any returning officer must face but, all in all, they have been doing a fairly good job down through the years.  However, I will remind the county councils to consider this point when selecting polling stations in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of postal voting rules was raised by Deputy Desmond.  I think he is under some misunderstanding here.  There is no question of counting the postal voters' ballot papers separately from other papers and there never was.  The returning officer, of course, opens the postal voters' papers before the commencement of the count.  This is usually done the night before as he has to indicate the time and place at which he is going to do this and inform the candidates and their agents in advance.  Up to now the returning officer was obliged to compare the number on the receipt with the number on the ballot paper envelope and, subsequently, he had to compare the number on the ballot paper envelope with the number on the ballot paper itself.  Under the Bill which I am proposing to the House this procedure will no longer be necessary.  While it existed, and it still exists until the Bill is passed, of course, it did give an opportunity to candidates' agents if they wanted to, to get some indication of the trend of the postal vote in advance of the actual count because the ballot paper had to be unfolded.  Under the Bill, this comparison of the numbers will not arise and the returning officer will be able to take the ballot <Col N="393" /> paper out of its envelope and drop it, without unfolding it, into the sealed ballot box which then goes to the place of count the following day and is counted with the other ballot papers in the ordinary way.  I trust that that will eliminate any possibility of discovering in advance how the postal votes went.  That is contained in section I of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered most of the points made.  As we will be dealing with each section separately later, any other points will, I am sure, be answered to the satisfaction of the Deputies.</P>

      <P Just="Center">and</P>
      <P>In Part II, page 6, line 9, to delete &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides for the deletion of certain words in line 9 of Part II of the Schedule.  This was referred to at considerable length by a number of Deputies as well as myself on Second Stage.  At that time we also adverted to the possible need to make other amendments and a good deal of time was spent referring to certain other Articles and sub-Articles of the Constitution. In fact, in the course of the <Col N="395" /> Second Stage I think we indicated that it was possible that amendments would be moved on Committee Stage for the specific purpose of including certain sections by naming them for specific mention in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, on reconsideration and after further examination of the Bill, it has been decided that it is not necessary to propose other amendments because the specific terms of the Rome Treaty as well as the other two treaties referred to here in no way affect the Articles of the Constitution to which we adverted.  I refer to Articles like involvement in a conflict and the specific involvement of the State in war or the Article dealing with fundamental human rights.  These were the particular ones as well as the Articles dealing with the raising of an armed force.  While there was some concern about the possible infringement, I think it is right to say that there are no provisions in the EEC established by the Treaty of Rome which involves in any sense any diminution of these rights. Certainly the State cannot participate in or be involved in war except with the clear assent of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>That is clear, and consequently we have decided that the only amendment we shall move is the one described as amendment No. 2a on the white sheet. The wording of the amendment proposes to delete &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of&rdquo; membership.  The reason for the amendment&mdash;this was the subject of considerable discussion on the Second Stage&mdash;is that the words &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; are too wide.  The proposed amendment will limit the changes which may become necessary as a result of the accession of this country to the EEC in the event of this referendum being accepted by the people&mdash;that the changes, which will have the force of law, will only be those that are necessitated by the obligations of membership, those which are strictly necessary rather than any changes involving actions done or measures adopted consequent on membership.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this amendment therefore is limited to that specific <Col N="396" /> point.  It is designed to ensure that the proposed amendment in no sense exceeds the necessary changes which must be made in order to conform with the Treaty of Rome.  The discussion which we had on the Second Stage adverted to a number of factors including the question of war, and I think it is quite clear that the terms of the Treaty of Rome in no sense conflict with Article 28 (3) (1) of the Constitution. That and the sections dealing with fundamental human rights are the specific Articles which caused some concern and were the subject of comment in the course of the Second Stage discussion.  This particular wording has been so drafted that it will rephrase the Schedule which will read, in the relevant passage:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>The sole purpose of this change is to ensure that the phraseology of the Schedule expressly will be limited to actions and measures necessitated by the obligations of membership.  To that extent I believe it meets the general desire that any change should be only that absolutely necessary rather than involving wider alterations of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We expressed some concern about other sections but on reflection we decided the best way is to put this as clearly as possible&mdash;to put the issue, when the Act is put before the people, not in a complicated way by discussing matters not in it.  This particular wording has been so drafted as to ensure that it will be possible to make whatever changes are necessary and that no changes which are not necessary will be involved.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach stated on the Second Stage of this Bill, its object is to enable the people to decide by way of referendum whether they wish to agree to amendments in our Constitution which <Col N="397" /> would be, to use the words in the Bill, consequent on membership of the European Communities.  He also made it clear that he thought there was a great deal to be said for the view that the issue should be posed as simply as possible and in such a way that the people will be able to give a clear &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it is self-evident that if the people decide in a referendum to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, what they will be saying is that they want to take up membership of the Communities and that they want such changes as are necessary in our Constitution to be brought about.  The wording of the Bill as it stands in this connection is &ldquo;consequent on membership of the Communities&rdquo;.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Cosgrave would, I think, to the average voter make no difference.  It may be that as far as lawyers are concerned it will mean the somewhat wider interpretation that certain &ldquo;actions done, laws enacted&rdquo;, <i>et cetera</i>, necessarily arise out of our membership of the Communities, but I think this is largely a matter of a very fine legal interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the average voter is concerned, I do not think there will be any real difference.  However, as far as the Government are concerned, what we want to do is to ask the people to make up their minds whether they wish us to enter the EEC and, if so, to make the necessary changes in the Constitution.  The Taoiseach was at pains to point out that we tried to have the Bill drafted in such a way as to make it clear that only such changes as were directly necessitated by membership were contemplated and that what is proposed here are changes consequent on membership of the existing Communities, not of any new community which might sometime evolve.  Therefore, so far as the Government are concerned the amendment proposed by Deputy Cosgrave will, as I have said, make no difference to the average voter.  It may make some difference to some lawyers arguing the matter very finely but since our objective is to ask the people to make a clear decision we have no objection to this amendment.  So far <Col N="398" /> as I am concerned, it is one that has the same meaning as the Bill as drafted, although it may be that some lawyers arguing fine legal points will detect a difference between the two versions.  So far as we are concerned, the purpose behind the Bill is being met and is not being interfered with by the amendment.  Consequently, the Government are prepared to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to express satisfaction that Deputy Cosgrave's amendment is being accepted by the Government, although I detect a singular lack of enthusiasm by the Minister.  The plain fact is that in the view of a significant number of people this amendment is absolutely essential to make the issue one which can be voted on with credibility by the people.  It is important that this should be understood: that under the original wording the fear was legitimately entertained by many people that we were going to permit a situation in which merely following on our entry into Europe a whole lot of our laws could be questioned as a consequence of membership.  That was never the intention of anyone who proposed our membership of the Communities.  In order to make that absolutely clear, Deputy Cosgrave's amendment was tabled.  I would have felt that the acceptance of Deputy Cosgrave's amendment by the Government might, indeed, have been done more generously than it has been done.  It is good, however, that the amendment is being accepted.</P>

      <P>I notice that the Minister for Finance, in accepting the amendment, said that in his view the amendment had the same meaning as the phrase in the original Bill.  The Minister for Finance said that it might be argued from a lawyer's point of view that it was a bit tighter.  That may be so; I have not an opinion on that.  I find myself in agreement with the Minister for Finance in saying that it is clear that the amendment in the name of Deputy Cosgrave has substantially the same meaning as the original Part II of the Bill.  We have the deletion of two words and the addition of five words in a section of 11 lines.  This Part <Col N="399" /> is quite an extraordinarily comprehensive one.  It is so comprehensive that when we make the slight change to &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Community&rdquo; then we are changing this sentence only in regard to action by the State.  The second half of the same sentence refers to &ldquo;laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or the institutions thereof&rdquo;.  The acceptance of this amendment by the Government makes an absolutely insignificant difference to the full meaning of the sentence and also to the full meaning of the Bill.  It may be that at the lawyers' level it makes a little difference.  It does not make any difference to the Labour Party's essential objection to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that and I do not intend to speak for long.  I want to make clear that our opposition to this amendment arises simply as a reiteration of our basic objection to this section of this Bill.  If we thought that it made a significant difference to the section as a whole we might have thought it would be better to get some little bit of benefit.  The essential objective of this section is to give power, not just to hold a referendum.  It goes deeper.  It will wipe away large parts of the constitutional protection which we have had.  We discussed at length in the debate on the Second Stage those sections of the Constitution which could lose their validity under this section of the Bill.  We have indicated that we think the 1937 Constitution was a much less satisfactory one than the original Constitution of the State.  It was a sectarian Constitution and one in which the approach to reunifying the country was made much more difficult. It still contains some useful protections for which we may have the greatest need in the near future.  It is not the aspect which enables the people to be consulted which we object to.  We are as anxious as anyone for that consultation <Col N="400" /> of the people.  We await their verdict.  What we object to are the aspects of the Bill which enable not just sections of the Constitution to be rendered invalid but which effectively negate the Constitution.  So much of it is swept away that what is left is hard to describe as being the original document.</P>
      <P>This amendment is so tiny and, as the Minister has correctly said, is substantially the same in meaning that I do not think we could logically oppose this part of the Bill on Second Stage and now accept an amendment which might make a bit more grist for the lawyer's mills but which in the ordinary understanding of the section itself or of the section with the amendment now accepted makes no substantial difference to the scope, the extent, the vagueness and the sweeping powers of this section.  Consequently, though the Minister in speaking for the Government has accepted this amendment, we are opposing it.</P>

      <P>This barrage is unexpected. I must have offended the Labour Party deeply by what I have said, but I still think despite their barrage their position is irrational.  There are two elements in this part we are seeking to amend.  There is the basic question of the extent to which it is necessary to provide for a modification of our Constitution in order to secure membership of the EEC.  That is something which you are either for or against because you are for or against membership.  Clearly if you are against membership you are against the Bill. That is logical enough, but if, in fact, the Irish people are to adopt this&mdash;<Col N="401" /> and the Labour Party clearly concede their right to do so and will accept their verdict, of course, as a democratic party and have always said they will&mdash;it is important that they do not accept a change in the Constitution which gives to any Irish Government any power to override the Constitution on its own account for its own purposes. It is important that nothing should be put to the people or adopted by them which does any more than the minimum necessary to our Constitution to enable us to enter the EEC.  The reason why this amendment is so essential and why it has determined our attitude to this whole issue is that, as drafted, the Bill left open in a very serious way the possibility of the Government bringing in legislation which was not necessitated by the obligations of membership but which could be held to be consequent on membership.</P>
      <P>Such legislation could be in any field.  Let us take an absurd and extreme example to make the point. The Government could hold that, in order to secure the orderly application of the Treaty of Rome in the difficult circumstances of this country, various human rights should be suspended.  If the Government brought in a Bill called the &ldquo;Suspension of Human Rights (Consequent on EEC Membership) Bill&rdquo; that Bill would not be unconstitutional. It would depend on what the courts would decide, but the likelihood of the courts deciding it was unconstitutional with that wording in the Bill is certainly dubious.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts are very slow to interfere with the Legislature and to say the Legislature is wrong in its judgement of facts.  If the Legislature passed a Bill of any kind expressed to be consequent on membership of the Community and if that Bill were, in the judgement of the Legislature, necessary, I am not at all sure that the High Court, or the Supreme Court, would look behind that to establish the facts, which is a matter for the Legislature given that the Bill is expressed to be consequent on membership. I am not suggesting that <Col N="402" /> would happen or that the High Court or the Supreme Court would decide it was constitutional, but clearly legislation expressed to be consequent on membership and which did appear to arise from membership but would not be necessitated by it could conceivably and, I would think, even probably get through in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>The opposition of the Labour Party to this amendment is curious.  It is an opposition which, given that the Government have accepted the amendment, will not affect events, but why they should pursue a line which involves expressing a wish to leave a provision which the Government have accepted could give them powers beyond what is necessary is something I do not fully understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, with this amendment, does no more than the minimum necessary to secure membership. It ensures that any law passed here which can be shown legally to be necessitated by the obligations of membership, to be an unavoidable consequence of membership, to be required by membership, will, to that extent, take precedence over the Constitution, but unless that can be shown and if the law is simply consequential on membership but not necessitated by it, it does not override the Constitution. Similarly in relation to the provision in the second part to which Deputy Keating referred, that the regulations of the Community which must be regulations properly adopted in due form under the Treaty of Rome &ldquo;shall have the effect of law despite the existing provisions in the Constitution limiting legislative power to Oireachtas Éireann&rdquo;.  That is also a necessary consequence of membership.  If one accepts membership one accepts that. If one rejects that one rejects membership. It is logical therefore that provision should be there.  These provisions will enable us to be part of the Community within whose decision-making system we shall play our role; and it must be remarked that within that system as it has operated to date, no country has ever been voted down in any matters that concerned its vital interests.  It is quite clear from the attitudes <Col N="403" /> of some Governments, such as the French Government, that they are determined that will not happen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating has argued that the whole tone of this amendment is wrong, that it should have been in the form of a listing of the Articles of the Constitution which are specifically affected but, as I suggested on the Second Stage, he undermined his own argument by listing a series of Articles that he thought might be affected, showing the danger of legislating by trying to pick out the Articles that might be affected when we cannot be sure which they are.  Such a procedure could leave us in the position where an astute lawyer would find a loophole of some kind in years to come as a result of which our membership of the Community and all the benefits accruing from that would be invalidated, requiring a further referendum. That would be quite wrong.</P>
    <P>This amendment does no more than the necessary minimum to enable us to be members of the Community.  As such it is necessary if we are to put to the Irish people a realistic alternative of entering or not entering.  If the Bill did less than this we would not, in fact, be posing the alternative of entering or not entering, because a Bill drafted with fewer provisions than this would not entitle us to enter.  It is the minimum necessary to put a realistic alternative to the Irish people when the referendum takes place.</P>

      <P>I speak under some difficulty on this amendment.  First of all, to me the whole Fine Gael attitude to the Common Market and to this Bill is a tragic example of the sheepish me-tooism which too often is practised by the leadership of that party. Secondly, I speak under an intellectual difficulty.  I have often been called an academic intellectual and perhaps that piece of opprobrium is accurate; it has often been said that there are too many doctors in this party, but I thank God I am not a lawyer and I think we can say with our hands on our hearts that we have no lawyers in the Labour Party.  We have had three lawyers speaking from Fine Gael and defending this amendment.  As far as I am <Col N="404" /> concerned, apart from the points made by Deputy Keating the only intelligent thing said here so far was said by the Minister, and I congratulate him on characteristic intelligence in saying that this would make no difference to the ordinary voter.  It certainly will not.  It does not make any difference to anybody.</P>
      <P>I do not so much oppose this amendment as dissociate myself from it with a certain degree of derision.  I shall certainly not go to the ramparts or the barricades to insist that &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; should be replaced by &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of&rdquo;.  This is great fun for the lawyers, and I think the amendment is a nonsense.  I am sorry to have to say that to people I respect as much as my friend, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, and his eminent colleagues there.  The acceptance of the amendment by the Minister is equally a nonsense, because the acceptance of an amendment by a Minister is supposed to indicate a relatively significant change on the part of the Minister brought about by his flexible acceptance of the reasoned arguments presented to him by Members of the Opposition.  The Minister has just said he accepts this amendment because it does not make a blind bit of difference, if I may use that rather crude language.</P>

His acceptance of this amendment, so far from offering any readiness on the part of the Government to alter the disgraceful clause in question in Part II of this Bill, which provides a portmanteau which allows any section of our Constitution to be swept aside by some lawyer's judgment of the meaning of either of these two phrases I have mentioned, so far from representing any significant gain for those who oppose this Bill totally in <Col N="405" /> its present form or even oppose it marginally, it is the first kiss in the Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael honeymoon in Brussels.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned about pursuing the thought as developed by Deputy Sherwin although it is a valid one.  I believe we will talk about this again and again.  I am interested in the logic or non-logic of our opposition in relation to this section. Deputy FitzGerald is able to add and he, therefore, knows that when an amendment is proposed by the second largest party in the House and accepted by the largest party in the House, whether we oppose or do not oppose, makes no difference to the material outcome.  Therefore, the role we can play in this is not to determine the final result of this amendment but to express our thoughts on it.  Therefore, no action of ours either strengthens or weakens the outcome.  Since the Government have accepted the amendment, no action of ours strengthens the inadequacy in the Bill at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of our opposition is precisely in the circumstances of a referendum. If we were to say we favoured this amendment we would be participating in playing the game of trying to make section 3, Part II of the Bill a little better, a little more acceptable. We made it perfectly clear that the section is totally unacceptable, that it drives a coach and four through our Constitution, that it destroys it section by section, that it enables this to be <Col N="407" /> done without any full discussion of it. The amendment does not materially alter the real threat of this section, that in regard to the validity of things done by the Communities it has no effect whatsoever.  We would be participating in a charade, which could very properly be a source of reproach to us, if we did anything other than to dismiss the whole thing as a game of ping-pong between two parties who are in basic agreement on this issue.  We may be reproached for lack of logic but any other action in regard to any playing with little bits of polite alteration of what is to us a monstrous section of the Bill would very properly be a source of reproach.  It would be irresponsible on our part if we did anything other than make clear our total opposition.</P>

      <P>As one who supported the Bill on Second Stage, at the same time, having read some of the speeches and listened to more of them I was satisfied that there was a feeling within the House that certain amendments would be necessary.  In Press reports since it was quite clear that amendments would be submitted, particularly by the Fine Gael Party, and that they were likely to be accepted by the Government, as this one has now been accepted.  The Bill, as I see it gives the Government and the Communities a blank cheque, so to speak, to deal in what way they wish with our Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party amendment, which has been accepted by the Government, seems to put some control on what we do in relation to our Constitution, that we will only amend or pass legislation that is strictly necessary for our entry into the Common Market.  I do not know whether the amendment controls what the Communities do subsequently.  As I see it it states:</P>
      <P>Prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like some clarification on this. Can we find a situation here where we are controlling ourselves in relation to changes in the Constitution or enactments <Col N="408" /> in this House and at the same time allowing any other member of the Communities to pass laws that will be in force here that might be repugnant to our Constitution?  In relation to legislation passed here by successive governments with all the expertise available to them we have found subsequently that some part or subsection of it has been declared unconstitutional.  I have no doubt that the draftsmen framing this legislation originally tried to bring it within the framework of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>What will happen when we will have people in other parts of Europe who will enact laws which might very well be found to be unconstitutional as far as we are concerned?  I am not sure whether the Fine Gael amendment covers that particular aspect or whether they are worried about it.  I am particularly worried about it.  I am glad that the Minister has gone so far as to accept this amendment in relation to our own laws here.  I should like to be satisfied that we are not leaving any loopholes here for other member States to decide what kind of laws we should or should not have.</P>

      <P>That legislation must be passed with the same effect as individual States passing laws.  I just want to clarify that point in case his inadvertent phraseology could have misled anybody inside or outside the House.  These are the laws passed under the terms of the Rome Treaties. It is important, I think, to get this clear because, with the new phraseology now incorporated in the Bill, the Bill applies only to laws which are passed under the existing Rome Treaties.  These are confined, of course, to economic matters. Within that sphere they are extensive and very important economic decisions will in future be taken jointly by ourselves and other countries; but they are confined to that and it is worth emphasising that point.</P>

As the Treaties are purely economic no attempt by the group of countries which are members of the Communities to legislate in a manner which is not required by or under the terms of the Rome Treaty would come within the framework of this and, should they decide to legislate on matters not covered by the Treaty, such as, for example, military and defence matters, any such legislation would be null and void and would not affect our Constitution. It is only anything which is necessitated by the obligations of membership or regulations passed pursuant to the Treaties binding on these particular Communities which is affected and, as these Communities are confined to economic matters, it is only in these matters this can take any effect. It is important that that point should be clarified.  Of course, as these Communities operate on the basis of having a legislative power binding on member <Col N="410" /> States, a power which has hitherto been operated by unanimity, for which there is provision, to operate by a qualified majority in future, as we are joining such a Community, if we decide in favour, then that implies accepting the sharing of legislative power in respect of the matters covered by the Treaties.  If we are not prepared to accept that, then we cannot join and we should not pretend we want to join.  If in fact, we do decide we want to join, then the minimum provision we have to make is what is here and it is important that the Irish people should be faced with something which is the minimum necessary and which does not go beyond that.  I do not understand the logic of the point of view of the Labour Party that voting for or against something in the Dáil is something you decide on not solely because you think you can win the vote.  On most occasions we, in the Opposition, in all parties, air our views indeed, but one votes for what one thinks is right; one knows one is going to be defeated most of the time, but one votes for what one thinks is right.  We think it right that no Government in this country should have any power to override the Constitution by claiming that legislation is required and arises consequent on the Treaty.</P>

      <P>It was not a question of right or wrong.  I understood Deputy FitzGerald to suggest that we were somehow strengthening the original version of the Bill by opposing the Fine Gael amendment.  The point I was making is that no action of ours, one way or the other, would affect what the Dáil passes and we are therefore entirely free to vote as we think right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a view I do not personally share.  The fact that on any given issue we want to defeat the Government is not a reason for voting against something which is good or for something which is bad.</P>

      <P>I understood the Deputy's argument to be that, because the Labour Party's vote could not affect the issue, there was no point in voting for something, even if that something had the effect, as we believe and are advised it will have, of preventing a Government here legislating in a matter not required by the Rome Treaty and overriding the Constitution. That danger exists.  It is easy to dismiss lawyers and say lawyers do not matter. In fact, it is lawyers, lawyers in the form of judges, who decide after hearing advocacy whether or not something is constitutional.  This is a constitutional Bill.  It is a legal Bill.  The wording of it is vital.  If any mistake or looseness in the wording were allowed to persist then the Government could acquire the power to override the Constitution for their own purposes in matters that are not necessitated by the obligations of the Treaty.  It is the duty of the Opposition in this House to prevent that and I am sorry the Labour Party have not seen it as part of their duty to support us in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression, wrongly I think now, that Deputy Cosgrave, who introduced the amendment, explained it and that his explanation was the explanation to the amendment.  Since then Deputy FitzGerald has, of course, put a different complexion on the amendment and, in my opinion, if the question of support or anything else came up, this would completely alter my opinion and, I am sure, the opinions of some of my colleagues on the question as to whether or not we should support the amendment.  The Minister has accepted the amendment for the very simple reason that the Fianna Fáil Government are anxious to have Fine Gael on the same side as themselves during the referendum.  It is as simple as that.  It is not because it is an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether or not it is an improvement is beside the point.  The only reason they have accepted it is because they want the support of Fine Gael.  Deputy Cosgrave threatened them some weeks ago that he would, in fact, have to <Col N="412" /> think very strongly if certain things were not done; they could not hope to win the referendum on their own and, Fianna Fáil, having seen the amendment and realising, as the Minister has said, that it did not matter a damn whether they accepted it or not, said: &ldquo;Oh, we will accept it.  If that pleases the boys and gets them in on the same side as us, then it is all right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I honestly believe this is a type of Bill entirely misinterpreted by Deputy FitzGerald, for some peculiar reason. I think Deputy Brennan put his finger right on the kernel; the only thing I am sorry for is that he did not put his finger on it on Second Reading because I believe that he and the people who are on this side should have spotted this particular thing much earlier and voted against the Government at that particular time.  Whether or not they were defeated is beside the point.  Fine Gael, voting with them, would ensure they would not be defeated.  But Deputy Brennan did, in fact, put his finger on the kernel of the whole thing and it is senseless for Deputy FitzGerald to be talking now about what the Community as a whole decide.  In fact, the Community may decide to do certain things and, if they do, then they are acceptable, or will be acceptable if this amendment of the Constitution is passed.  Do not forget that the whole Kernel of this is Part II and it is Part II, the Schedule, we are discussing here this evening.  In addition, reference has been made by more than one speaker to the fact that this must be constitutional and people have been talking about the necessity to have rights so that we can appeal to the Constitution.  If this Bill is passed, then we no longer have any right to go to the High Court or the Supreme Court to find out whether or not something is constitutional because one of the things excluded in the Constitution by reference to the courts is an amendment to the Constitution and the Minister is, I am sure, aware of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is not, unless I misunderstood him, saying that, because of that provision, which refers to an amendment of the Constitution, in any matter in which normally people would have gone to the courts to <Col N="413" /> argue that it is unconstitutional they will no longer be able to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the story.  If they find out that there were a number of Bills previously that were wrong and that a mistake was made they cannot go any further.  If we accept that, and if we enter the EEC and if we make this amendment, does anybody seriously suggest that at that stage some citizen can go to the courts and ask to have certain things that are being proposed declared unconstitutional?  Is it not a fact that this is conditional on being an amendment of the Constitution and we have no right to change it in any way? Deputy Cosgrave made reference earlier&mdash;I did not quite follow his argument&mdash;to war being declared and Deputy FitzGerald said that defence commitments did not, of course, enter into it at all, good, bad or indifferent. Maybe Deputy FitzGerald was being a little bit cute about this.  Is not the political objective of the Community the setting-up of one Community?  And if you have such a Community defence is bound to enter into it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking him to have a look at the Schedule in relation to which the amendment is before us and he can see that it refers specifically to three treaties, gives the dates of them and therefore this amendment can only operate in relation to those specific treaties and their specific provisions. None of those provisions refers to defence or military commitments.  On that basis I ask the Deputy how does he justify his argument?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister asked that question because I said it a few minutes ago and the Minister was inclined to agree though he thought they were not the exact words. Because already the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister have stated that Ireland was prepared to accept any defence commitments required and they also stated that a Europe worth joining was a Europe worth defending.  It is only a very small step from that to accepting that whatever arguments or treaties are made in future they will follow the line set here.  Perhaps the Minister is suggesting that if something like this happens a further referendum will be held?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I suggest that whether it is a large or a small step to the next stage he talks about, and whatever view one takes of that, it is not covered by this Bill.  That is the point I am making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will remember his own words about Deputy Cosgrave's amendment.  When the amendment went down the Minister said that as far as he was concerned it did not make much difference but that certain lawyers might be able to make an argument on it.  I have great respect for lawyers, unlike some of my colleagues here, and I know they can make arguments which do not seem to the ordinary layman to exist but in fact are there.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can tut, tut as much as he likes.  Deputy <Col N="418" /> Brennan made quite a clear case.  It is that there are really three parts in Part II of this Bill.  If the Bill were the first sentence in Part II we might oppose it but we think it would be a fair issue to put to the people.  The second sentence has two different provisions in it.  They are not satisfied to make three sentences of this business. They abolish the Constitution past, present and to come by a single sentence. I was inclined to think that this was an example of the lemmings.  I think the lemmings behave as they do because they have over-population&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is much more like the rush of the Gadarene swine. According to the biblical story, the devil got into them.  The first part of the second sentence reads:</P>
      <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities...</P>
      <P>The second part states:</P>
      <P>...or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
      <P>That means that all laws adopted by the Communities will over-ride the Constitution.  Deputy FitzGerald may say this relates only to economic matters.  For the moment, of course, he is talking as the lawyer with an interest in legal institutions and cultural affairs. Normally he professes to talk in this House as an economist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to give the House an assurance on the following matter.  While we can be happy that the amendment will cover matters as they stand now, can we assure the people during the referendum campaign that the Council of Ministers will not doublecross us in any way?  Assuming that the Amendment to the Constitution is accepted, will we have some say in any changes the Council of Ministers might make or in laws they might pass?  It could happen that in the six-months period the Council of Ministers might bring in some legislation which might affect us in an adverse manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As of now there is in operation a procedure under which the four applicant countries will be consulted by the Communities on any developments which will take place <Col N="420" /> between now and the date of accession. A formal procedure has been set up in this regard.  It will continue to operate after the referendum and prior to entry, assuming that the referendum is carried.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I should draw the Deputies attention to some facts they appear to have overlooked.  First, the wording of this Bill as originally drafted, or now as proposed to be amended by Deputy Cosgrave and agreed to on this side of the House, is very restrictive.  It refers specifically to three Treaties.  These are written down and are available and their terms are known.  There is no provision in this Bill under which some development which might take place within the EEC which is not provided for in those Treaties could, in fact, take place and be imported into our law.  Deputy MacSharry referred to what might happen if an attempt were made to bring in some legislation in the Communities which would bind us when we become members in the interval after the referendum and before accession.  First, should this happen the piece of legislation would have to conform with the Treaties and, secondly, it would have to be in breach of our Constitution before this Bill comes into play.</P>
      <P>As to whether such a matter is within the terms of the Treaties, and also as to whether such a matter would, but for the passage of this Bill and the subsequent referendum, be in breach of our Constitution, is a matter which would be decided by our High Court and possibly our Supreme Court.  It is specific as to what is involved.  Clearly, the major part of the legislation and directives which would arise would never come within the category of measures infringing our Constitution. As Deputy FitzGerald pointed out, they deal mainly with economic matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there is a limited area where this could arise.  If anyone wants to contest it, he can contest it before our courts unless it is an act which arises directly from the terms of the Treaties referred to in Part II of the Schedule.  This would be a matter for interpretation by our courts.  I believe there may be people who have been <Col N="421" /> under a misapprehension in regard to this matter but there are others who are under no misapprehension whatever. They know very well what is involved but they do not want the people to know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>A very interesting and worrying trend of argument has emerged in a contribution and in some interjections by Deputy FitzGerald and in the contributions from the Minister for Finance.  The emphasis in both cases is what I characterised in an interjection while Deputy FitzGerald was speaking as &ldquo;legalistic&rdquo;.  We are being urged to consider this amendment entirely, to quote the Minister for Finance, as &ldquo;referring specifically to three Treaties&rdquo;, for which the dates are given.  This is legalistic and misleading and it is a serious point.  We all know that the Communities are on-going things.  Indeed, they have declared their future plans at some length.  We know that Hallstein formulation of many years ago: &ldquo;We are not in business; we are in politics&rdquo;. There are many other statements. We get economic union, we get a customs union, then we get an economic union and a monetary union and then a political union.  This is not a secret. It is not a surprise to any of us.  In fact, it is loudly proclaimed by the Commission and by everyone who looks at the Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that it is not proclaimed that that can happen just on foot of the existing Treaties and without another treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point of what the Minister has just said.  I will come to that in a moment.  Were it not the case that it was so loudly proclaimed, we would know anyway that it was inevitable because of its very nature, the building of three sub-Communities, the Coal and Steel Community, Euratom and the Economic Community is not a process that can stand still.  We know with absolute certainty that they will stagnate or disintegrate or else they will progress towards closer unity.  There is no point in our arguing at this stage precisely what form that closer unity will take <Col N="422" /> because we could have different opinions about it and, to some extent, it is in the womb of time.  No politicians' predictions will alter that evolution very much.</P>
      <P>We also know with absolute certainty, if we are telling the truth about it, that adhering to the Community&mdash; and I am using it now in the singular and adhering to the three separate Treaties is not a readily reversible process. You might reverse it after about six months, or a year, or 18 months, but you will not reverse it after five years without causing the most profound convulsions and upheavals. There is the analogy of the eggs and the omelette.  You cannot unmake an omelette.  You cannot unscramble an egg.  To go back to Germany and say: &ldquo;The Zollverein started something which ended in two German States currently, but we will go back to the status quo before the Zollverein came into existence&rdquo;, is simply impossible. It may not be impossible in legalistic terms but it is impossible in terms of reality.</P>

      <P>Possibly.  I am not arguing about whether or not people want to, but we know as a fact that, after a significant period of participation, it will be next to impossible to back out of membership of the Communities. We know that it is an open-ended commitment.  We also know&mdash; just to take the Treaty of Rome which is much the more important of the three&mdash;that, if my memory is correct, it was signed in April, 1957.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  Therefore it was being thought up, and drafted, and argued about, and significantly formed, during the second half of 1956, 16 years ago.  I have met many people in Ireland who think it is wonderful, but I met nobody in Brussels who thought it was wonderful. I met universal agreement that <Col N="423" /> it was antiquated, out of date, in need of revision, archaic, <i>et cetera</i>, which is pretty obvious anyway.</P>
      <P>You can make what Deputy FitzGerald and the Minister have made, what I call the legalistic argument that we are just talking about the Bill, the Minister says, and that it refers specifically to the three Treaties which is true or, as Deputy FitzGerald says, that we are talking simply about the Treaty of Rome and that there is nothing either in the Treaty of Rome or in this Bill or this amendment which has any relevance to a future &ldquo;defence commitment&rdquo; or future participation in a European army, involving the abandonment of our neutrality.  Formalistically and legalistically that is true but it is not true in reality because we know that we are arguing about more than the terms of the Treaty of Rome.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not.  I am not now developing any argument as to whether or not we should sign this Treaty.  I am saying that when we are considering the validity of this amendment we are not entitled to say, in what I call a legalistic or formalistic way, that we are looking at the text of the Treaties only.  If we are serious we are, in fact, looking at the reality to which we are committing ourselves, which is very much more than the text of the Treaties.  I know that the text of the Treaties commits us to no military involvement, but we are taking decisions which offer a choice to the Irish people.  We would be deceiving them if we said that in reality there is no military commitment involved.  Of course there is no military commitment involved in the small print.  For example, if I write a cheque for money I have not got, at that moment I do not involve myself in bankruptcy, but I involve myself in bankruptcy as an inevitable sequel, as the end point in a chain of events I am setting in motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> For any serious observer of the European scene to suggest that the end result of the chain of events we are setting in motion will be other than participation in a military commitment is not frank.  I want to come back to the word &ldquo;legalistic&rdquo; and the legalistic distinction of saying the Bill refers specifically to the three Treaties, as the Minister said, or that we are only discussing the Treaty of Rome and there is nothing about defence in the Treaty of Rome, as Deputy FitzGerald said.  These things are formally true but they are not true in relation to the honest presentation of the issues to the Irish people, which is what this Bill is about.  When Deputy Tully pressed the Minister on whether or not there was a commitment to defend Europe the Minister hedged a little about the precise wording.</P>

      <P>I wish to remain in order and to respect the rulings of the Chair.  Perhaps I am taking a little time but I am not wandering widely.  I am staying on the single theme introduced by Deputy FitzGerald and the Minister on this amendment, whether our attitudes and our conclusions could be based on the three Treaties and what is specifically in those Treaties or even more narrowly, as Deputy FitzGerald says, on what is in the Treaty of Rome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keating's contention, as I understand it, is that it does not matter what is in the Bill.  He believes certain things are going to happen and that these are what we should be discussing.  If, in effect, that is what he is saying, we are wasting our time because, as I understand Standing Orders, we can discuss only what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I was not for one moment favouring the House with any predictions on my part as to what is likely to happen or as to how I thought the Communities would evolve.  I shall do that at another time but what I was doing was arguing that considerations of that nature would have to be taken inevitably into our judgment.  I was not saying what were those considerations.  It would take me a long time to do so and I have no intention of burdening the House as to what are my predictions or expectations. Such would be out of order, in any case.  The point I am making is that any valid considerations will have to be made not only on the wording of the Bill but also in the light of our assessments of the likely evolution, and that we cannot have a real debate on any of this if we confine ourselves legalistically in this simple way because we know that we are entering on an open-ended process and we must have some impression of this process. The single point that I rose to make was that if we try to argue out of the small print, out of the Treaty of Rome, out of the past 15 or 16 years, we are not presenting the issues in the way in which they should be presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> The one point I should like to make is in regard to the observations made already concerning laws enacted by the Communities and to which both the Minister and Deputy FitzGerald referred. I refer specifically to Part II, section 3, lines 9 and 10, where the phrase &ldquo;laws enacted&rdquo; occurs but where occur also two other and much wider phrases.  These are: &ldquo;acts done or measures adopted&rdquo; and I might emphasise that in this case neither of the terms &ldquo;acts&rdquo; nor &ldquo;measures&rdquo; is given a capital letter.  It is quite clear as to what is a law.  So, also, it is clear as to what is meant by a law enacted because there is an historically evolved mechanism in any nation whereby laws are enacted.  Consequently, a law is something that is definable.  It is much more difficult, however, to define an act done or a measure adopted.  I know that in this context it has not the meaning that it would have in ordinary life where an act done is any visible movement.</P>
    <P>Of course, in this case &ldquo;acts done&rdquo; can only be acts done by legally constituted and correctly operating organs of the Community.  Yet, it is very much wider than simply the laws enacted by the Council.  This, again, leads us to the objection to the section in that, even as amended, it falls on the grounds of vagueness because the meaning of &ldquo;laws enacted&rdquo;, &ldquo;acts done&rdquo; or &ldquo;measures adopted&rdquo; is so wide and imprecise as to be incapable of valid legal definition.  Therefore, these words have very little meaning at all and the reason for rejecting the amendment is that, even dropping the words &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; in line 10 and substituting the words &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of&rdquo;, the imprecision of the phrase &ldquo;acts done or measures adopted&rdquo; is not removed. We have been directing our attention to the amended sentence in so far as it refers in both sentences to &ldquo;laws enacted&rdquo; but of course this is the narrowest and, in legal terms, the most easily dealt with section and, therefore, the most meaningful section. The section which refers to &ldquo;acts done&rdquo; or &ldquo;measures adopted&rdquo; is so wide as to be imprecise and to have no meaning.  Even amended, it is so wide as to have no meaning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The stand taken by the Labour Party is particularly important and we must go back to the first case made by Deputy Keating&mdash;the rose-by-any-other-name difference between &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; and &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo;&mdash;and to the easy way in which the Minister dismissed effectively the amendment as being of so little consequence that he could accept it in so far as it did not change basically the meaning of the section and left him with his original proposals and intentions. It is only right that if the Fine Gael Party are now becoming worried by their rather deeper examination of the implications and, God knows, it is about time they decided to examine the implications in depth, they should not be under the impression that they have strengthened in any way the barriers against actions which they would now resist or would prefer did not result from accession to the Common Market.  As Deputy Keating points out, this section carries not only the laws enacted but the acts done and the measures adopted.  It seems to me to represent a very superficial assessment of the consequences of the introduction of Deputy Cosgrave's amendment to think that it would make any serious difference in the results that would follow should we join the Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been involved in this debate for many years.  Anybody who even reads the section can appreciate that the situation is very much an on-going one, right from the European Steel and Coal Community established in 1951 to the Treaty of Rome and up to the present position in which we have now signed conditionally the Treaty.  Anybody who listened to or saw the discussions following the signature the other day would have little doubt. Listening to Douglas-Home or Heath or the various other speakers it was quite obvious that one simply cannot restrict oneself to the economic commitments of the Treaty of Rome, that this is simply a step towards the creation of a political unity.  They were all quite certain about this. People like Heath talked about the consequence to Britain of their special relationship with America and the particular <Col N="428" /> problem facing the French because of their non-membership of NATO.  The total impression created was that having got this out of the way we are now moving on to the next step of a continuing, on-going evolution in Europe.  I shall not discuss the objections many of us have already made about the Common Market but this is simply another step towards political unity, leading to the political unit finding itself faced with defence commitments of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Most of us were very shocked by the Minister for Foreign Affairs volunteering that we would accept all the commitments of the Treaty of Rome or of accession to the Common Market. Implicit in his promise of our honouring our responsibility&mdash;what is worth joining is worth defending and that sort of general theme&mdash;was the idea of eventual defence commitments and that is implicit in our general attitude over the whole period of the negotiations about the Rome Treaty and now the EEC.</P>
    <P>If the Fine Gael Party are having second thoughts about the full implications, now that they are beginning to understand and see the full implications from what they have either read or heard, it would be foolish of them to think that they are now erecting any kind of significant impediment, barrier or safeguard which was not there already.  As the Minister has told them it is already there as far as he is concerned to the extent that he wanted and this simply makes little or no difference.</P>
    <P>I recall a speech by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Micheál Ó Móráin, in which he claimed that the whole intention was to join NATO. That was in the time of the late Seán Lemass as Taoiseach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> This simple substitution by Fine Gael of &ldquo;necessitated&rdquo; for &ldquo;consequential on&rdquo; is really whistling past the graveyard.  It saves us from nothing at all.  For that reason I think the Labour Party are correct in drawing everybody's attention, including the attention of the Fine Gael Party, to the futility of their amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I should like to pursue this a little further.  The point at issue here, which is being fairly skilfully avoided but I think deliberately avoided by the Labour Party is that the words &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; are loose and could have two effects, one of which we have adverted to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a legislator, as we all are, and concerned as we all must be with precisely what words mean.  A lot of trouble can occur if legislators do not legislate by saying what they mean or if the wording is loose and as a result of loose wording things can happen that we never intended to happen.  It is our job to legislate properly.  All of us are lawyers. We make the laws and we are lawyers in that sense.  The pooh-poohing of the importance of legislating accurately, correctly and unambiguously is something that should not come from any part of this House.  Having made that clear let me get back to the issue.</P>
      <P>The effect of changing these words is twofold.  I think we have really adverted too much to one aspect and not enough to another.  One is that it removes from our Government the power to introduce legislation which is not necessitated by the obligations of membership but which could be alleged or said to arise consequent on membership. We think that important because we do not think any power should be given to this or to any other Government that might have the effect of enabling them to override the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> There is another aspect which I think is worth emphasising because the question of defence has come up so much from the Labour Party.  It could be argued that, if the words &ldquo;consequent on membership&rdquo; were left, a subsequent treaty negotiated for defence purposes between member states would be consequent on the three Treaties.  I think this is arguable because the Rome Treaties and the Treaty of Paris were originally signed by countries with the intention of moving towards a further political union.  They are quite right to emphasise that point.  They would also be helpful if they mentioned the fact that the countries concerned after 15 years have made damn all progress in that direction and the most they have been able to achieve so far is to agree to meet every six months to see if they can agree on anything.  That is another day's work.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that, if the wording had been left and if the members of the Communities had decided, arising out of their original aspiration, to sign a treaty with defence commitments, it could have been alleged, and could have been upheld in our courts, that such a treaty was consequent on the other three treaties.  It cannot, however, be alleged that any further treaty is necessitated by the obligations of these three treaties.  The obligations of these three treaties concern economic matters only and there is no obligation in them in any matter of defence or foreign policy.  There may be aspirations which the founders had but they are not contained in the articles of these treaties.  By the change in wording we have made absolutely certain what would not have been certain otherwise: that if any future treaty is signed with defence commitments, if any Irish Government enter into that and if that treaty involves any infringement of our Constitution in such matters as the declaration of war, the raising of an army, then as a result of this amendment there could be no doubt whatever but that that further treaty must be put to the people in a constitutional referendum.  If we had not put down this amendment it would have been possible for some Government here to enter into a further treaty, <Col N="431" /> to claim that that treaty was consequent on the other three, which could be sustained in the courts, and to avoid the necessity for any further referendum in matters of foreign policy.</P>

      <P>If they rejected it they would certainly not take part in that defence treaty.  That does not affect our situation within these three treaties and there could be no better defence for us than to be in a position to say that as a result of the way this amendment has gone through this House any proposal for defence commitments is something that must be the affair of the Irish people.  That is the effect of this and it is of vital importance to us.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from ensuring that no Government can use the excuse of the EEC to legislate over the heads of the people and to override the Constitution, by virtue of this amendment also &mdash;and this I think the Labour Party must accept&mdash;it would be necessary to come back to the country again.  The speeches made on the Labour side of the House are legitimate though not entirely in order.  They are legitimate speeches arguing the case against the Irish people joining the EEC.  What they are saying is that if we join this Community it will tend to evolve in this general direction, that we do not have to look at the direction.  This is a legitimate argument but not to me a compelling one.  But it is not as legitimate an argument as our argument for this amendment.  It is a political argument against joining the EEC.  It is a legitimate one but not directed to the issue involved here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, there is a doubt&mdash;even the Minister admits there is a doubt and he has every interest in playing it down, playing down the bad and weak drafting on the Government's side&mdash;which could have enabled the Government to override the Constitution, which could have enabled a future defence treaty to be put through without referring it to the Irish people.  By virtue of this amendment these things cannot now happen.  That is important and our job is to legislate in such a way as to prevent any looseness creeping in, to prevent excessive powers being given to this Government or to anybody else in respect of our affairs and to ensure <Col N="433" /> that to the people and the people alone will be referred all matters affecting the vital interests of this State.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of this amendment and I think the Labour Party, by putting up an ingenious though not entirely relevant argument in the matter, are not acting in the best interests of this community as a whole because it is vital that we ensure that if there are any future defence commitments they will be referred to the Irish people.  That is where we stand and it is for that very strong reason that we press this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if the Minister could by any scrutiny of the record find any evidence to indicate this attitude on my part.  If there is such it was an error on my part because I have no such feeling towards the average voter.  Possibly I misunderstood him. I thought he meant that there was not a substantial significant difference between the Bill and the amendment, that lawyers might be able to work out differences even if the laymen could not but that since it did not matter very much either way, the Government were prepared as a gesture of goodwill to accept the amendment.  I thought the Minister was taking a different position from that of Deputy FitzGerald who said that in this amendment there is a profoundly important safeguard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>His argument against the amendment is that it makes very little difference.  It is an argument that the Minister has used but it is by no means the core of the argument against it.  If one is in our position of finding this a thing not just to be rejected but something which is monstrous&mdash; the whole Part is monstrous&mdash;then minor alterations to it, if we participate <Col N="435" /> in them, can be interpreted as some sort of truck with the whole thing which we find outrageous.  But that is not the core.  That is an ancillary argument as far as I am concerned. It is an argument that is not very important either way.  There is no point in going into that and saying: &ldquo;Good on you.  It is a great improvement. We support that.&rdquo;  It is not important enough to merit that point of view.  We would be getting ourselves involved in something trivial if we said that.</P>
      <P>The core of the objection is different. We have a second sentence from lines 7 to 11 in part II of the Schedule and it contains two halves.  The first half says that no provision of the Constitution invalidates laws enacted or measures adopted by the State.  That is something this State and this Parliament does and that is being amended in what may be a major or a minor way, depending on whether it is Deputy FitzGerald's or the Minister's view. That half will be amended by the Fine Gael proposed amendment&mdash;the Government have accepted the amendment. The second half says that no provision of the Constitution prevents laws enacted by the Communities or the institutions thereof from having the force of law in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the second half of the sentence. That is not what this State does. It is what the Communities or their institutions do in regard to us.  The reason the amendment is so weak is precisely because it does not amend this second half of this sentence. Deputy FitzGerald waxes passionate when explaining that he thought that by this amendment we could avoid a subsequent defence commitment if at a referendum the Irish people rejected the treaty embodying that defence commitment, that in some way the defence commitment would be binding on us if we did not have the amendment but that it would only be binding after a referendum in which the people would have voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, and that, therefore, there was an important safeguard there. This again comes back to the point&mdash; and strengthens my conviction that I was right to introduce the matter of the critique of the legalistic approach at an <Col N="436" /> earlier stage both in regard to the remarks of the Minister and those of Deputy FitzGerald&mdash;that if we were inevitably part of an on-going situation, and I think Deputy FitzGerald at least agrees that the Communities as envisaged are going to constitute an on-going situation of which we may not be a part, but that if we are such a part and if, as the years progress we become an inextricable part, then the matter of whether we participate in a defence commitment, to use an euphemism, will not be decided in terms of referenda or in legalistic terms but in the terms of the reality of the power situation at that time.  Decisions about legalistic protections against being involved in a war or an arms buildup or in the giving of military bases will, in fact, be the result of the outcomes of pressures which we will not be able to resist in reality, whatever we may be able to do in law.</P>
    <P>The whole point of my making a distinction between the reality of the on-going situation and the legalistic aspect was that even if we had legalistic protection we would not have realistic protection.  We would not have protection in reality.  We could not participate on the one hand and not participate on the other hand.  An essential thing about the Community is that if you are in for a penny you are in for a pound.  One cannot say &ldquo;I like that aspect but I do not like the other one and I will ignore that&rdquo;. That may be the legal situation but it is not the real situation.  It is wrong to pretend to people that they have legal protection which they do not have.  I will make the analogy of the situation in Northern Ireland and the situation of the blacks in America where the blacks had for 100 years constitutional rights and until they engaged in the most militant forms of struggle, those written-down, legal rights were not worth a damn to them because they could not be realised in the existing situation.  All of the citizens in Northern Ireland at this moment have, in theory, equality before the law.  Yet, in the whole life of that State it has never existed as a reality.  To say that the legal protection being offered by this amendment exists is one thing; it may be there as fully <Col N="437" /> as Deputy FitzGerald says it is, although I am inclined to think it is not and to agree with the Minister in that.  But that sort of legal protection which we as people with responsibility for political decisions know is not the situation will be worth very little. Even if we accept the amendment and the assessment given by Deputy FitzGerald we, in thinking by our voting for it that we are thereby getting something significant for the future protection of the Irish people, would be misleading them for political, power, economic and general State reasons.</P>

      <P>I thought that the rejection by the Labour Party of this amendment had been made clear at the beginning.  I was recommending the House to reject the amendment.  I was taking up the statements of Deputy FitzGerald that, in fact, we had somehow not taken the real content of this amendment, but that we were being evasive and seeking some subsidiary arguments to reject it.  When something is as trivial as this is in regard to the real problem, the truth is that one is condoning something impermissible in having anything to do with it at all.  To seek to amend this section is like putting a plaster on a cancer.  When you put a plaster on a cancer you actually do something harmful because you are pretending that what you are doing is some good to somebody.  In fact, what one needs in such circumstances is truth and reality, and not a whitewashing job which is what this amendment is.  The core of the amendment, as Deputy Tully said, is that it is a whitewashing job and a bit of plastic surgery to make a loosely and carelessly drafted Bill acceptable to a population who, in the Government's fears, are in danger of defeating the referendum.  We as a party oppose this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that although Deputy Keating's defence of his position is improving as he goes along nevertheless he is not really dealing with the critical point.  The question at issue is whether this amendment does, in some way, make it more likely that the Irish people, through a referendum, will have a say in any future defence commitments or whether in any way it would make it less likely that Fianna Fáil or any other Government could override the Constitution in matters where this is not required by the terms of the treaties.  Nothing that has been said from the Fianna Fáil benches has weakened or diminished the argument to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating has talked around the point but has not referred specifically to this point.  It is all very well to say that we are going to be pushed <Col N="439" /> in a particular direction.  It is the Irish people who will decide whether we will be pushed into this or not.  The Irish people will have to make the decision in this.  If there is any defence commitment which involves the raising of forces by any authority other than that of our Government, or which involves any power to declare war on our behalf then, as this Bill is now amended, one can say certainly that such further treaties must be referred to the Irish people for a constitutional decision.  As it stands before the amendment, that is not so.  This is the vital step forward.  Whether or not Deputy Keating is right in thinking that it is in this direction that the Community will evolve is not important. If the Deputy is right in thinking that and if he is concerned in preventing it and having the opportunity of persuading the Irish people to oppose any such commitment, then he should be violently in favour of this amendment.  It seems to me that when, in fact, this goes through and when the referendum is won it could well be that in spite of what Deputy Keating says he will find himself relying on this amendment in order to prevent the commitment which the Labour Party feel so strongly about.  I would like to see how the future will evolve.  If a time came when, in fact, the countries joining with us in this enterprise shared our viewpoints on foreign policy, which they notably do not at the moment&mdash;I find deep divisions between us and them on many issues&mdash; and if the peoples of these countries, including our own people consulted in a referendum, as they will have to be consulted, decide to go further together in some form of closer unity, then I might well find myself favouring that. At the moment what I am concerned with is that any future commitment of that kind must be one decided by the Irish people and that no Irish Government be given the power to do these things over the heads of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>That is what this amendment is all about.  While the Labour Party may say they are not interested and that to support it would in some way tarnish their pure, anti-EEC attitudes, I still <Col N="440" /> think it is a pity they would not support us in the enterprise of securing that this whole question of development involving any impingement on our Constitution under any fresh treaty must be referred to the Irish people. It is a pity they would not support us in that, but they have their tactical position and they want to maintain it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that in awarding marks we have to suggest that Deputy FitzGerald is what in psychological terms is called a slow learner.  What we are trying to put across to him is the fact that he has been told by the Minister that because there is virtually no difference between his wording and Deputy FitzGerald's wording it is acceptable.  Therefore, the Fine Gael Party, having promised that there would be a number of amendments, end up by producing this now relatively unimportant amendment, as far as we are concerned and as far as the Minister is concerned, in that it will not change anything in a basic way.  One wonders why, having been told it makes no significant difference, the Fine Gael Party persists with the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it simply an act of token revolt against the prospect of a joint campaign to get this idea of going into the Common Market accepted by the public, or is there a genuine fear in this connection?  This is a factor which is causing me some anxiety, because I know Deputy FitzGerald knows much more about the Common Market than I know because he has given much more time and study to it. Is it, on the one hand, simply a deceit or an act of windowdressing or is it on the other hand, a serious fear on the part of the Fine Gael Party that they have entered on a course which will bring them to a situation in which they do not particularly want to find themselves?  Did they <i>bona fide</i> put down this amendment believing that it would protect them in some way or another from the consequences of their mistaken judgment, in the first instance, in supporting the Government on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> This is what I say is the slow learner part of Deputy FitzGerald's continued obstinate defence of what seems to me an untenable position.  He told us that he was very worried about something and that by changing &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; to &ldquo;necessitated&rdquo; he believed we had gained something very significant, something that was going to provide a profound safeguard&mdash;some phrase like that he used.  Now we find that this is not so at all.  Why does Deputy FitzGerald want to change this in a fundamental way, and having been told that he can change it in a fundamental way, would he now tell us what he thinks will be the consequences?  Why did he worry about the word &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; at all if the word &ldquo;consequent&rdquo; is exactly the same in its meaning as the word &ldquo;necessitated&rdquo;?</P>

We share these fears about the prospects to come and have shared them for many years since this proposal was first mooted.  All my political life I have opposed this whole thing.  Is it true that Deputy FitzGerald has genuine fears about the prospect before us and that he is as worried as we are, not just by the Community laws or the acts done or measures adopted by the Community but also by the implications of the Community's institutions: the bureaucracy, the secretariat, the various defence forces, the various advisory bodies and groups that they have set up?</P>

      <P>But you are now joining Health.  I am sure Deputy FitzGerald knows that when this proposal <Col N="442" /> was introduced many years ago the first thing I said was that the decision as to whether we went in or not would be taken for Stormont and Dublin in London.  We are going in because London is going in and for no other reason.  We all know that; it is not a subject for debate at the present time. It was interesting to hear what we felt were absolutely sacrosanct principles of the whole process of democratic Government dismissed as completely unimportant and that certain matters such as a referendum to decide on an amendment to the Constitution, were ones on which the major powers did not agree.</P>
      <P>This Fine Gael amendment has produced a very confusing situation.  One can be cynical about it, and as I said at the beginning, they simply do not want evidence that the civil war is at last over and that we are going to get them standing on the same platform advocating this particular measure which they should have done 30 or 40 years ago.  They are about to put up some sort of token resistance to this picture which will be drawn of them over the next few months.  Is it that or is Deputy FitzGerald very frightened now of the probable consequences of going into the Common Market and is his silly amendment an attempt to lock the stable door?  Because we are now told it is not an amendment that makes any real difference.</P>

That has been my main objection to this.  This is something which does not frighten Deputy FitzGerald or, perhaps, it does. I remember 12 or 13 years ago debating with the then Shadow Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Declan Costello. He was at that time arguing with little heart in favour of going into NATO while I was against going into it.</P>

We were concerned to see that the Constitution would be sufficiently amended to permit us to join Europe but we were equally anxious to ensure that no unnecessary amendment was made to the Constitution.  We were also anxious to ensure that the Constitution was not totally suspended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We applied ourselves to the best of our ability to study the amendment put forward by the Government.  We sought advice and listened to the views of <Col N="444" /> other people on the wording of this amendment.  We came to the conclusion that, without doubt, this amendment was unnecessarily wide. When I speak of the amendment to the Constitution I speak of the Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill, 1971.  We came to the conclusion that this was a classical example of the Fianna Fáil attitude of taking more power than is really necessary, a trend which has been evident in recent years of using a sledgehammer to kill a fly.</P>
    <P>We put down this amendment which seeks to delete the words &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo;. We believe that that is a very worthwhile amendment, that it will preserve each Article of the Constitution and each part of an Article which it is not necessary to amend because we are entering Europe.  The Government have accepted that amendment but they have, I regret to say, accepted it, through the Minister for Finance, in a most ungracious manner by saying that it really does not matter but they are going to accept it to please us. That is typical of the policy of the infallibility of the Taoiseach and some of his colleagues.  It is typical of the arrogance which has been displayed by the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government over the past few years but it is not doing them any good.</P>
    <P>The Minister would have done himself and his party much better service if he had come in here and said: &ldquo;We are anxious to amend the Constitution but only to amend it to the extent that is necessary and we believe that the Fine Gael amendment is an improvement on the Bill as drafted.&rdquo; I regret to say that would be expecting too much from the Government.  In the words of the Leader of this party this referendum, which will be necessary to enact this Bill, cannot be passed without the full support of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

But now, as in the past, we are determined to protect the country from the folly and, indeed, on some occasions, the stupidity of Fianna Fáil.  We are determined to protect Fianna Fáil from themselves.  That is what this amendment is about and it would be much more appropriate if the Minister for Finance had come in here and said in a gracious manner that, having considered the Bill and having considered the Fine Gael amendment, he was satisfied that our amendment improved the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill and, in that light, he was accepting it. He did not do that.  I find it difficult to understand the attitude of the Minister. I pose him a question here and now: If this amendment makes no difference why did he accept it?  Why did he not come in and argue the case that the amendment was not necessary?</P>

We are prepared to accept any amendment to the Constitution which is strictly necessary to our entry into Europe, but we are not prepared, as the Government want, to confer vague powers on the Government or on anybody else.  The Taoiseach and his Government love dealing in vague generalities and the civil servants who advise the Government love to get more power than is necessary at a particular time.  They like to look years ahead and take powers which are not now necessary but which they think might be necessary in 20 or 30 years time.  We do not believe in that.  We believe in consulting the Oireachtas when the occasion arises in the confident knowledge that the Oireachtas will do the right thing at the time at which it is consulted.</P>

    <P>I was prompted to rise and speak as I have spoken only because of the ungracious attitude of the Minister towards this amendment.  Fine Gael will campaign for and support the passing of the referendum necessary to enact <Col N="447" /> this Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1971, but we will do that after studying the Bill and putting down this amendment which we are satisfied is a vast improvement on the sloppy, unwieldy terms of the amendment put forward by the Government. It will not be the first time Fine Gael has had to stand between the Government over there and the rights of the people.  I rise to make that clear and to reaffirm that we in this party, satisfied that it is in the interests of the country to enter Europe and that it would be a national, political and economic disaster if we did not enter Europe and, notwithstanding the muddling and messing of the Fianna Fáil Party in providing the mechanics for entering into Europe, and having helped them to overcome their mistakes, will support entrance into Europe.</P>

      <P>I am not competent to follow my colleague into the complexities of the spoken vernacular of the people.  I want to refer to two points made recently, one by the Minister and one by Deputy FitzGerald. I also want to comment upon what I think is a very important point and that is the way in which this discussion is developing.  It reveals significant things.  First, the Minister has made an accusation of arrogance against us with reference to his argument that the amendment would not be particularly relevant to the average voter.  I mentioned the three Fine Gael lawyers.  I forgot the Minister is also a lawyer.  Now we have four lawyers.  I have nothing against lawyers.  I think they are very handy people on occasion, but I also think litigation is to be avoided at all costs if humanly possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion has been a lawyer's delight.  The Minister has said this amendment will be acceptable precisely because it will be unintelligible to the average voter.  The arrogance, if there is any, is coming from the Minister because he has implied that there are two sets of people, the lawyers, the men with the long grey faces, as Pearse called them&mdash;it is not fashionable to quote Pearse now in some places in this House&mdash;and the laymen.  The lawyers will have great fun.  The lawyers will sit and if something is done in Europe they will debate whether or not what is done in Europe produces consequences in our case which are necessitated by the obligations of, as opposed to what would have happened if they had been consequences following upon something which was not consequent on&mdash;I wish them luck and I hope they get good fat fees from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respectfully suggest that the Minister is right here in his casual dismissal of this amendment.  He is accepting it because, in effect, he says it is ridiculous; it does not mean anything to the ordinary people.  Therefore, it <Col N="449" /> can be permitted to go through.  Deputy FitzGerald has very rightly taken up this point for reasons I shall explain shortly, reasons which I think will be rather painful when I come to them. Deputy Keating pointed out that legal restrictions of the kind contained in this amendment are not worth the paper they are written on.  Not only have the speeches from these benches been relevant but in my opinion they have been the only ones that have been relevant to the discussion.  Joining the EEC is jumping on to a moving escalator from which one will never be allowed to get off.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald said that if the Fine Gael amendment is accepted the Irish people will decide in future. Great heavens! The Irish people will decide!  He say he has an open mind about the future.  I have the utmost respect for and confidence in Deputy FitzGerald.  I am sure he has an open mind about the future.  I wonder has Dr. Mansholt an open mind about the future.  I wonder if the people who run the EEC in which we shall be as tiny and insignificant as the fleas upon other fleas in Dr. Johnson, have open minds.  It is all right for us to have open minds.  In ten years time we shall be so totally economically committed to the infrastructure of the EEC and our trade will be so firmly based&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am coming to the amendment.  We shall be so totally locked in the embrace of the EEC that if in ten years time a decision is taken of a political or military kind, does Deputy FitzGerald seriously suggest anything in particular is gained by the fact that this will force a referendum?</P>

      <P>Our economy would be so totally committed to the EEC that we would be going to the people and, in effect, offering them two alternatives, the kind of horrible alternatives that both major parties have structured for them in the present referendum. <Col N="450" /> You can go to them and say: &ldquo;If you do not like joining a European army, we shall say, accepting normative powers in the European Parliament, you can reject the referendum.  In that case you can get out.&rdquo;  Presumably you then unmoor the country from its situation 50 miles from England and sail it across the Atlantic.  I do not see anything is gained by this amendment.  As Deputy Keating correctly pointed out, this is an open-ended, steadily developing process and the Fine Gael amendment is a joke which the Minister has accepted as a joke.  Here the Minister is right.</P>
      <P>The last thing I want to say is about the intervention of Deputy Fitzpatrick on this Bill and the way in which suddenly Fine Gael are contributing so much so vehemently to this discussion.</P>

      <P>If Deputy FitzGerald thinks that this amendment is going to make a significant change in the Bill he is pulling the wool over his own eyes.  I have enough respect for the Deputy to think that he is doing this unconsciously.  He has many excellent qualities.  He has two defects which he has manifested in this debate.  One is a tendency to garrulousness and the other is that he has a blind spot where the Common Market is concerned and believes that it is a pot of honey at the end of the rainbow.  These are amiable defects in an old friend of mine and I am prepared to accept Deputy FitzGerald, warts and all.  What I am not prepared to accept is a process by which the wool is pulled over the eyes of the Irish people.  Let me say in blunt terms, and I have a tendency to speak in blunter terms than my colleague, Deputy Keating&mdash;I do not have the economic knowledge of himself or of Dr. O'Donovan&mdash;in my opinion&mdash;I do not suggest Deputy FitzGerald is a part of this&mdash;this amendment is more than a joke; it is a trick.  The Fine Gael Party are already embarrassed by the fact that they have publicly come out in a situation where they are virtually at one on the same platform with Fianna Fáil on this issue.</P>

      <P>In my opinion Fine Gael believed that by bringing in this amendment, if the Minister had accepted it with dignity instead of the flippancy with which he did accept it, they could then have gone to the country and said: &ldquo;This Bill is significantly better because of the contribution which we made.  We are not, therefore, asking you to vote Fianna Fáil but we are asking you to vote for a Bill which is radically altered by the application of our integrity, our sincerity and our superior intellects.&rdquo; The Minister being wise in his own generation destroyed this tactic in a second by saying: &ldquo;I am accepting your amendment because your amendment is a joke.&rdquo;  This is why Fine Gael speakers are now coming in to speak vehemently in defence of this amendment and to condemn the Minister vehemently because there is a game of battledore and shuttlecock being played across the House.  The bluff of this amendment has now been called. The Minister has destroyed the tactic precisely by accepting it in the contemptuous terms in which he accepted it.  In so doing he will make it all the more difficult for Fine Gael to support the Bill without merely indulging in what I earlier described as &ldquo;me-tooism&rdquo;. The attempt to make a constructive contribution towards this Bill has been exposed by the Minister as being irresponsible and superficial as, in fact, it is.  In so doing and as this debate has developed it reminds me, if it was necessary to remind me, that the only meaningful and substantial opposition <Col N="452" /> to this entire measure comes from these benches.</P>
      <P>Listening to the debate on the amendment at the outset and bemused by the lawyers' arguments back and forth I was tempted to say: &ldquo;Perhaps it does not matter one way or the other&rdquo; but now I think it does.  I thank the Minister for this.  I am sure Fine Gael are very angry with the Minister for spoiling their little tactic. I thank the Minister for making it clear that he accepts the amendment with flippant cynicism and destroys all its credibility in the process.</P>

I should like to come for a moment to what Deputy Dr. Browne said because he raised the question of whether I and Fine Gael in general are becoming frightened of the prospects of the EEC and that that was what lay behind the amendment.  It is important that particular hare should be dealt with immediately.  This party have always favoured membership of the EEC and have seen great advantages for us in membership of the EEC.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. I am trying to deal with why the amendment was necessary.  Deputy Dr. Browne suggested that in introducing this amendment we are in some way frightened of the consequences of EEC membership but the purpose of the amendment is not in any way to head off the consequences of EEC membership but to ensure that by this amendment of the Constitution which we are here enacting we shall do no more at this point in time and require the Irish people to do no more than accept membership of the Economic Communities established by these three treaties.  We seek to ensure by the amendment that any further commitments which may be good or bad &mdash;I have said I have an open mind on them because it depends entirely on the circumstances in which they arise&mdash; and the purpose of any further developments that may turn up in the future we have an open mind in regard to these but we insist that the people shall be given the chance to determine whether there shall be a further evolution beyond the point of the present EEC with their three Communities and three treaties.  I have said&mdash;and I think this is the view of my party generally&mdash; that it is possible that an evolution might take place in the Community, in which the other countries might come to share our views on foreign policy and, as a result, we might come together for other purposes.  I have no confidence in this happening in the foreseeable future but it could happen. If it happens, there could come a time when we might consider it necessary to seek endorsement from the people with regard to a further treaty involving other commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we are saving is that this should be left to the people.  We are not content with, or prepared to have a situation where another government&mdash; perhaps a Fianna Fáil Government&mdash; might walk us into some commitments involving foreign policy and defence where this country did not accept the basic foreign policy involved in such <Col N="454" /> a commitment.  We are not content to have a situation where this could be imposed on us by the Government by way of legislation, without it having to be put to the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  At this moment I do not believe the Irish people would wish to enter into further commitments of a political defence foreign policy character with the Community, bearing in mind that the general foreign policy of the Community does not conform to our views.  However, we do not exclude the possibility that it may change and if it changes the Irish people must be given a say in the matter.  We are not prepared to trust any government with a decision of this kind over the heads of the people.</P>
      <P>This amendment is necessary to ensure that no government will enact any law on any other subject claiming it is consequent on membership and that they will not attempt to enter into any commitments of a further character beyond what is in the three treaties without going back to the Irish people if there are any constitutional implications involved.  This is the position and it should not be confused with anything members of the Labour Party may have said.  They have their reasons for the line they have taken and I respect them, but nothing they have said should confuse the public regarding our position and where we stand.</P>

Deputy Keating pointed out that the objection to the amendment is that it attempts to alter the Schedule to a Bill which we believe should not be before this House and which should not be passed.  Our reasons are as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason we want to have this on the record of the House so that everyone will know what is happening is that we believe that not only with regard to this section and this <Col N="455" /> amendment, but wittingly or unwittingly, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are putting across propaganda to the people of the country which we believe will lead them into a morass.</P>
    <P>We believe that Fianna Fáil are using unfairly the mass media to put across a very slanted view in favour of EEC entry.  It is our job in this House to try to get at the truth.  Like Deputy FitzGerald, I believe the people are entitled to make up their minds. Whether they are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or Independent supporters they will get an opportunity of voting in the referendum.  They should know what they are voting for or against.  Any suggestion that things are as clear as the Minister attempted to suggest when he spoke in this debate is wrong.</P>
    <P>Part II states:</P>
    <P>The State may become a member of the European Coal and Steel Community (established by Treaty signed at Paris on the 18th day of April, 1951), the European Economic Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957) and the European Atomic Energy Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957).</P>
    <P>The important part is the following where it states:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have tabled an amendment which states:</P>
    <P>In Part II, page 6, line 9, to delete &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They maintain that this amendment makes it foolproof.  May I point out that this would simply mean that the second portion of the Schedule would read:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution <Col N="456" /> invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>To suggest that this is giving us the safeguard we want is too ridiculous for words.  Deputy Keating has pointed this out, and this fact cannot be stressed too often, no matter how you twist words about or how you write in the amendments suggested by Fine Gael.  So far as I can see, the Communities can make a decision which will bind us.  If we decide, as Deputy FitzGerald said, that we cannot go in without having a further referendum, what will we do if we are forced in five or ten years time to have a referendum to decide whether the wording of Fine Gael or the wording of Fianna Fáil can protect us?  Is it not a fact that in ten years time we will be so enmeshed if we go in we will not be able to get out?  Not only is it unfair but it is dishonest on the part of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to attempt to tell the people that we can slip in and out of the Communities as easily as a person can join and leave Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or any other party here.</P>

If the Communities bring in laws or regulations we do not like, we cannot opt out of them.  The people are entitled to be told the truth and that is all the Labour Party are asking.  I would castigate the Government for giving the impression to the people that there is a bed of roses waiting for them in Europe.  I fear that if they go in they will find a bed of roses all right, but it will be wintertime, the roses will be gone, and all that will be left will be the thorns.</P>

      <P>I fear that Deputy Tully may be confusing this further. There are times when I feel that the absence of lawyers in the Labour Party may be a mistake.  It seems to me that what he visualises here is that the Communities as defined here might in the future enact laws, or do acts, or adopt measures, which could in some way involve us in commitments of the kind we have been talking about, defence and foreign policy.  Of course they cannot.  What Deputy Tully should understand, and what is important that our people should understand, is that the power of these Communities, defined as being the three set up by these Treaties, to act in any respect depends upon these Treaties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am dealing now with the second half of the sentence which reads: &ldquo;...laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the ... Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the crucial part.  The Communities there described are the three Communities established by the three Treaties named above. The three Communities have powers to act only within the framework of those three Treaties.  Any action they purported to take which did not derive from those three Treaties, and which moved into another sphere not covered by the three Treaties, would be <i>ultra vires</i> and would not, in fact, have the effect of law within the Communities here or any other part thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>These three Communities are established under three Treaties for economic purposes.  There are specific obligations contained in the Treaties and they require us to accept laws enacted under the Treaties, to carry out the purposes of the Treaties and authorised by them.  So much is this the case that, in cases where there has been any doubt as to whether a measure, even an economic measure, could come within the terms of the Treaty, the six countries have separately as six independent countries agreed together on the matter lest what they might do purporting to act as a Community would be found to be <i>ultra vires</i> through not being authorised by the laws involved.  That has happened even in cases of economic provisions.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there is no question of the Communities having the power under these three Treaties to enact laws, do acts, or adopt measures going outside the framework of the Treaties.  If they did so they would be <i>ultra vires</i> and would not come within the framework of the phraseology here and would inevitably be so found by our High Court, and Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to clarify that point.  I am glad Deputy Tully raised it so that it can be clarified and any doubts that might arise subsequently on that score can be allayed.  There should be no doubts <Col N="459" /> on this point.  We cannot be bound in respect of matters going beyond these three Treaties except by a fresh treaty.  The Labour Party are entitled to argue in the referendum campaign, although not so much on this amendment, that if we go in we will get into an on-going situation where there will be pressure on us of some kind to move further.  That may well be the case. It is important that we build up the necessary barriers against any such pressure being put on any Irish Government which might succumb easily to it.  We must stiffen the back of any Irish Government so that there will be no question of any further commitments being entered into save with the consent of the Irish people.  That is what this amendment does.</P>
      <P>It is a little perverse of the Labour Party not to see the point of this and not to come with us on this important provision to ensure that the Irish people will have the final say in anything which goes beyond what is in these three Treaties.  By our amendment we have tied down any constitutional changes to what is required and authorised and done under these three Treaties.  That limits it in a way that we can measure and see.  We have ensured that nothing beyond that can be done that has any constitutional implications, unless the matter is once again brought to the Irish people to decide.  They will then decide, having listened to the views of the political parties at that time, on any issue that is put before them.  What they decide will bind us and nothing else can bind us.</P>

      <P>Tonight we have heard many references to the Treaties that combine to present to us the picture of the EEC.  We have read that the European Coal and Steel Community was established on 18th April, 1951, that the European Economic Community was established and the Treaty signed in Rome on 25th March, 1957, and that EURATOM was established by a Treaty signed at Rome on 25th March, 1957.  That is a fair time ago. Do the experts insinuate that no amendment has been sought in the meantime by the six countries who <Col N="460" /> accepted the initial Treaty?  Is it suggested that these amendments have not altered the Treaties to some degree? Subsequent to our entry, would an amendment to any of these Treaties effectively bring up the question of defence?  Could we not be faced with an entirely new treaty or a necessary amendment to the existing Treaties? If so, all the arguments here tonight are weakened.  I should like to hear from the experts if that is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We would happily and instantly have complied with any ruling by the Chair.  I rose to make a point which the Minister will see is quite different from the sense of his interjection.  Although this is a tiny amendment to one section of a very brief Bill, this is an extraordinarily important Bill.  It is impossible to over-estimate its importance.  It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of the sentence which constitutes the second half of Part II of the Bill. That one sentence referring to the actions of this State on the one hand, and the actions of the Communities and their institutions on the other hand, will be the subject of a very great deal of legislation in the UK. It is very condensed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Dáil is doing something very important in spending so much time on this Bill because of the central nature of this Part.  The Minister may be outraged by this but I think we have had a serious debate about serious issues.  We have even listened to each other.  We have talked to each other.  We have not been unduly abusive.  We have not been simply making debating points or thumping each other for fun or to release our irritations.  We have uncovered things <Col N="461" /> which are absolutely fundamental.  I feel that Parliament is working rather well here tonight.  Perhaps I feel that because I am participating.  That is a possible explanation.  We are having a serious discussion on serious matters. I thought I would say that because it could be argued that we were devoting a great deal of time to something which on the face of it was rather small.  I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>Having said that I want to refer to the thoughts uttered recently by Deputy FitzGerald on what precisely this section, as amended, commits us to.  We have agreement thus far that, whether we call it the Community or the Communities, this is an on-going process which will inevitably add other dimensions of co-operation to the presently existing dimensions of the free movement of goods, capital and labour to a common market.  I think we are agreed also that we cannot predict exactly how this evolution will go.  I have to say from these benches, as someone opposed to full membership, that I may be able to look at the Community in ten years and say: &ldquo;It has evolved in a way that I did not foresee.  It has evolved in a way that I did not see at first, in a way that has minimised the drawbacks, that has strengthened the good things which, I admit, are there now.  I was wrong in my fears and reservations and I should not have opposed entry at the time Ireland was considering entry.&rdquo;  I admit the possibility that the Community may evolve in that way. Deputy FitzGerald said that future commitments may be good or may be bad but that he had an open mind. This, too, is my position.  More than Deputy FitzGerald I am inclined to fear the badness.  I am inclined to be more cautious but I do not deny the possibility that I may be in error.  So far there is no enormous difference between the three parties in the House, and if we go on to say that the process of participation may be reversible after 12 months or two years, it will not be reversible after five years.  We might agree on that also.  We might agree that five years is too short a time for our full involvement in the machinery for the process to be reversible.  Very shortly after that period, it will be <Col N="462" /> irreversible.  We are assuming a commitment that is open-ended and in my view, once we have a profound degree of economic integration, this will be irreversible in the same way as happened the States of Italy and Germany during the last century.</P>
    <P>Later when I asked Deputy FitzGerald if it was his objective to keep the options open, his reply was an unequivocal &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, that the Irish people would not wish to enter into future commitments without having an opportunity to debate them and to vote on them in a referendum.  I am trying to represent fairly the Deputy's position and that is my position too.  I want to keep open the options.  Having got agreement, I hope, even between the three parties on propositions thus far, let us look now at this section of the Bill and at this particular amendment to it because we come back to the argument between legal interpretation and what I term real interpretation. Laws are a reflection of what exists in an evolving society.  They are a codification of it but only to a very limited extent are they a cause of it. One does not write the law first and have the social evolution afterwards.  It is the other way round.  That being the case, I am sceptical of the powers of law of legal enactments to alter the direction of social evolution.  As is our right, I think Deputy FitzGerald and I would disagree on this, but I do not believe that any legal protection will save us from the consequences of the on-going process once we are enmeshed in it.  Neither do I believe we can get out of it by any legal process but, to the same extent as Deputy FitzGerald, I wish to keep the options open.  That being Deputy FitzGerald's position I am puzzled as to why he opts for full membership of the Community as it seems to me that the way in which to keep the options open&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I had endeavoured to try to ascertain the extent to which we had some agreement so that we could clarify the jumping off ground as to where we disagreed.  I thought we were in agreement as to the commitment being open-ended, that to a great deal the commitment concerned much more than treaties, that it concerned the reality of evolving political, economic and social life if we joined the Community. I thought we were in agreement as to not being able to have an I-want-to-get-off attitude after a certain period, that we were agreed we were not certain as to the type of future commitments we would have and that none of us could predict with certainty the way in which the Community would evolve.  Therefore, I concluded that, <Col N="465" /> nationally, what was prudent to do was to keep open the options.  But we seem to be in disagreement as to the best mechanism of keeping open the options.  I would have thought that it would have been prudent to have an associate or trade agreement by which we could watch the evolution without having to accept &ldquo;the laws enacted, the acts done or the measures adopted by the Communities or their institutions&rdquo;. I would have thought that it would be prudent to avoid commitment to those things, to avoid what was necessitated by the obligations of membership but to retain the position whereby we could watch and choose, whereby we could retain the possibility of genuinely, as distinct from legalistically, consulting the Irish people at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely seriously my contention that you can have legal consultation at a certain stage of the process until you are black in the face but it will be a barren exercise, an exercise in falsehood and emptiness, if you know that you have no real choice, no option but to concur in the general evolution of a community much larger than yourself, where you represent 1 per cent of the population and a ½ per cent of GNP, a community on which you can have no real influence in regard to its evolution and in which you have no choice but to accept the results of that evolution.  To pretend to the Irish people that any little form of amendment will confer on them that choice at a future time is to bury oneself in legalism, to shut one's eyes to the real evolution of society, to behave in a naïve way.  I do not mean this to be abusive.  I find Deputy FitzGerald's naïveté in ways attractive. It is a charming thing at this stage of his life, with the experience he has, that he should be naïve in the way he is.  I feel that he is naïve in this way, that he is making the distinction between the law and the reality perfectly sincerely and genuinely, but that we should not accept that distinction because it is a false distinction.  We can write in little legalistic safeguards until we are black in the face and it will not alter a tiny bit the reality of our choice or lack of choice because of the tiny, frail economy we have&mdash;the poorest, the weakest, the most peripheral, the most <Col N="466" /> underdeveloped.  If we climb on what Deputy Thornley called this escalator we cannot get off.  It is fair to say that and not to present the possibility of bogus choice to the people as if it was real choice.  This is where the confusion of law and reality is leading us.</P>
    <P>This is really the centre of our objection to this amendment&mdash;that it holds out possibilities of choice which in reality do not exist.  It holds out the pretence that we are retaining a sovereignty and being able to decide, inside this Parliament even, which of a number of roads we go, when that choice has disappeared from us.  It seems to me that the logical pursuit of the doubts, the uncertainty, the open-mindedness that has been expressed here is to take a position which permits us to avoid major disruption of trade but which permits us to make a choice at a quite different future time, in the light of the way the market evolves, whether we want full membership or not, to postpone the irreversible choice, to take up a position of protection, but also one which keeps the options open.</P>
    <P>I draw totally different conclusions from the things Deputy FitzGerald has said in full sincerity.  I share his open-mindedness about the way it might go but, since I am open-minded also, I feel that we have to take up a stance of protection and not of shutting our eyes and jumping blindly into the future trusting that the negative aspects will somehow disappear and the positive aspects will flower and that the Community will be OK for us.  Perhaps it will.  I admit that possibility but it is a terribly dangerous thing to do.  It is an almost lighthearted thing to do with the future of a nation.  I would want much greater guarantees than at present.</P>
    <P>That is a criticism of this amendment. I am not being frivolous or irrelevant, I submit, and you must be of the same opinion, Sir, because you have not suggested that I was out of order.  What I had to say and what has been said from these benches was in order, relevant, pertinent and germane directly to a discussion of this amendment.  It is an effort to tease out in public whether there is any real, <Col N="467" /> valid protection written into this amendment.  In our view there is not and, therefore, our support of it would be validating a triviality&mdash;something which is not intended, I accept, as a misrepresentation but which would end up in five or ten years as deceiving the Irish people into believing that they have protection of a legalistic kind, believing that they have choices and options which they do not possess.  I think it is a genuinely proposed inadequate thing.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that I agree with Deputy Thornley.  The Minister is possibly regretting his incautious dismissal of the amendment.  Think what a lot of time he would have saved himself if he had just pretended that this was a serious amendment and that he was accepting it with good grace as an important contribution to the betterment of the legislation and that then Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael could campaign together happily in view of the real contribution that Fine Gael had made to making the legislation better. Instead he dismissed it.  I do not think it was a piece of wickedness.  Maybe it was a piece of silliness on his part, but I think it has had a good result because it has committed the two parties.  I am sorry also, on an issue as important as this, that we have not had more contributions from the Government benches.</P>

      <P>There must be aspects of this they could have discussed even if it were to validate and support.  I find depressing the unwillingness to discuss it at all, the closed mind, the suggestion that we have no choice and that the people who object to our passing this Bill are somehow irresponsible and, as was suggested by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, somehow unpatriotic.  This is argument by abuse.  This is a serious issue.  I would have wished to hear it discussed more from the Government benches.  I shall wait for a serious argument that the protections we are given by this amendment go beyond legal ones and I shall wait with interest for an effort to argue that, even if those legal protections <Col N="468" /> exist, they will be protections in reality and that choice after five or seven years will exist in reality.  If it does not exist in reality then why deceive the people?  I accept that the intention is not to deceive but I submit that the effect may in reality be to deceive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago Deputy Sherwin asked a question and I did not get a chance to answer it until now.  The question he asked was whether it was possible, by way of amendment of the existing Treaties, that, say, a political development could take place, political community could take place, a major development by way of amendment of the existing Treaties which would mean that the people of this country would not get an opportunity of deciding whether they wanted to go in or not.  I think I am fairly summarising his question.  The answer to that is one that I gave earlier in the debate to Deputy MacSharry and it was subsequently elaborated on by Deputy FitzGerald in response to another point that was raised.  That is that any development of the Communities, and we do expect developments, in so far as they go outside the terms of the Treaties which are specified in this Bill would be <i>ultra vires</i> and certainly would not be binding on the people of this country under this Bill or any other Bill.  I have no doubt that if the kind of development which might take place and which Deputy Sherwin and others had in mind did take place, it would necessitate as far as we are concerned a further referendum for the people to decide whether they wished to take part and thereby amend the Constitution.  It is my belief that was the position under the Bill as drafted and that it is still the position under <Col N="469" /> the Bill as proposed to be amended, and I have indicated the Government's acceptance of the amendment.</P>
    <P>To return to Deputy Keating, I have been listening to him for some time on this.  I have listened to his ingenious arguments and those of some of his colleagues and I do not think he can deny that when their arguments are brought to their logical conclusion what they amount to is that he and some of his colleagues believe it is not in the interests of the Irish people that we should become full members of these Communities.  On that basis he has argued about things that might happen in the future, and if they do he argues we have to accept them.</P>
    <P>Underlying all this are a number of assumptions he has not attempted to justify, but there is one argument that disturbs me.  It is that one has to approach all legislation, and particularly this piece of legislation, on the basis of supposition.  He did not refer to what is in the Bill.  He admitted very early that his argument could not stand up if he were to base it on what is in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The terms of the Bill are before the House and, finding himself unable to oppose them with logic, Deputy Keating and his colleagues introduce a whole lot of suppositions which have nothing to do with what is in the Bill and they tried to make them relevant.  The question in my mind and which I am now forced to put arises from Deputy Keating's last contribution, in the course of which he was congratulating himself and other Members of the House on the excellence of the Committee Stage debate, a view with which I do not agree.</P>

      <P>I have taken all of the points.  I have long ago in this debate dealt with the amendment.  I have tried to deal with the questions raised which appeared to have even some relevance to the amendment, but when we reached the stage when we had Deputy Keating making the propositions he made I thought it was going too far. It is time Deputy Keating explained to us and to the public about the wonderful Committee Stage.  Why are there no amendments by the Labour Party? Why are they using the Fine Gael amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that at the end of his remarks he was coming to the issue of whether the Irish people should accept this amendment of the Constitution.  What we are concerned with is that the amendment put to the people should be one that involves the minimum interference with the Constitution, the minimum risks of any kind.  That is the ground on which we have based our amendment.  I do <Col N="472" /> not think Deputy Keating ever applied himself to that issue.  He said that the talk about legal obstacles is nonsense. That is by no means entirely true because if you think in terms of ten years, five years hence, and some proposition comes forward for a further treaty dealing with the matters Deputy Keating is sensitive about, defence matters, and if at that stage there is a weak Irish Government, possibly a Fianna Fáil one, who would succumb to pressures, there would be no better back-stiffener for them than to be in a position where they could say: &ldquo;I am sorry.  The fact is this would require a referendum and I do not think we could carry it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In practical realistic terms that is what matters.  All we want to do by this amendment is to put the Government in a position where they have to fight their corner, where they cannot be weak, where they have to be strong and where, if they decide to go along with some future agreement the Irish people would find unsatisfactory, when the Government came back they would be kicked in the teeth and told to get out.  They are the terms of real power politics of the future and I thought Deputy Keating, with his thoughtful approach to these matters. would see the point.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to have the debate proceed on normal lines.  I consider this a very important debate and the matter under discussion tonight is also important.  Fine Gael considered that the section under debate was important and that the amendment was important. The Minister said that he was accepting the amendment and that it did not matter anyway because the amendment was of no importance and was just juggling with words.  The Minister commented, when Deputy FitzGerald said that he was surprised that Deputy Keating had not recognised the merit of the amendment: &ldquo;Of course, he recognised it.&rdquo;  The Minister changed around.</P>
      <P>The debate has been orderly and useful.  It has allowed the point of view of the three parties represented in this House to be put down on record.  The views will remain on record for as long as the records last.  Anybody who wants the point of view of the particular parties on this amendment can read it on the record.  It is only right that should be so.  My only regret is that the Minister was left so alone. It is true that Deputy MacSharry was in and out of the House.  Deputy Tunney held the position of Chair for a period.  Apart from that the Minister was on his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfair that any suggestion should be made that the matter we are discussing should be rushed through the House as if we were rushing to catch a train.  Many of us have a long way to go and perhaps it would suit us a lot better if the debate were to collapse.  But we were not elected for that; we were elected to put the point of view of the people we represent before this House.  We have been attempting to do that all night and we are prepared to accept in good faith the points made both by Fine Gael and the Minister.  We think they are wrong but we accept their views as being held sincerely.  What we want to avoid is the ordinary people, the voters, being forced into the position that when <Col N="477" /> eventually a referendum takes place they would go to vote on an issue about which they do not know the full facts, the reason for that being that the Government are prepared to put only one side of the story.  If the Government are not prepared to put both sides of the story, it is our job to see that it goes on the record.</P>
    <P>We believe it is wrong to suggest that we can accept the amended provisions here tonight, then go to the country and if the amendment to the Constitution is carried, go into Europe and point to this amendment at a later stage and say: &ldquo;It is all right no matter what happens in Europe&rdquo;.  Even if it is decided that war is to be declared by a then built-up political group, let it be against Eastern Europe, against China or the USA&mdash;I do not care which it is &mdash;I do not want to see this country involved in a war in favour of or against anybody.  We have been traditionally neutral and that is the way we want it to remain.  We believe there is no safeguard and that it is not right that either the Government or Fine Gael should try to put it across that there is a safeguard in this amended Schedule which will allow us to opt out if we do not like the way the game is going.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is talking about NATO.  That is an entirely different matter.  Deputy Garret FitzGerald has shown us that he agrees it is possible that there would be a military bloc established at a later date.  If he is prepared to agree to that, does he suggest for a moment that it will be possible for ten nations of Europe to be fully integrated for a number of years and then, because the second smallest of them does not like what is going on, they can suddenly say: &ldquo;We are not going to take part in this.  You fight the battle for us.  We are dropping out&rdquo;?  If that is the <Col N="478" /> case then why did the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;and the Minister for Finance said he did not say it in so many words&mdash;say two things, first: &ldquo;A Europe worth joining is worth defending&rdquo;; and, secondly: &ldquo;We are prepared to accept any commitments&rdquo; and when they were asked: &ldquo;Does that include defence?&rdquo;, they said: &ldquo;Any commitments&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The kernel of this discussion here tonight is whether the proposed amendment of the Constitution in the Schedule, as amended by Fine Gael, gives protection to this country for the future.  The Minister said it was entirely wrong that we should even talk about these things.  He did not say we were gazing into a crystal ball but that we were talking about things that might happen.  If we do not talk about things that might happen as a result of this, what can we talk about? Is he able to tell us exactly what will happen?  This referendum will be decided not on what is being offered but the whole thing, what is happening <Col N="479" /> now and what is likely to happen in years to come, and it all depends on who will make the best case to the public.</P>
      <P>Let me repeat what I said the other day: the Irish people have become very well-informed.  It does not matter whether five out of the ten minutes of news at 8 o'clock or at 9 o'clock is Fianna Fáil Party propaganda or not, pro-EEC or not, when they come to vote they will count everything that is going.  When that time comes Fianna Fáil and maybe Fine Gael, too, if they are in the same cart, will wonder what happened the horse because there will be no locomotion; they will be left sitting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me we have reached the point where the central validation that Fine Gael are offering for their amendment is that any future developments inside the Community which would require a new treaty would be <i>ultra vires</i>, to use the words of the Minister for Finance when he was agreeing with the point, and it would not be binding on us. Therefore, putting in the sort of protection that this amendment envisages would, in fact, as Deputy FitzGerald said earlier, keep our options open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a point of view that is tenable on certain assumptions.  On the other hand, there is doubt as to whether it is true or not.  However, we are faced with deciding whether the legal protection that would be given would protect our freedom of choice.  When the Minister for Finance was agreeing with Deputy FitzGerald's point on this, he used a phrase which I wrote down at the time; again I do not pretend it is an accurate transcript but I think it represents fairly the sense of what he said, that such developments would be <i>ultra vires</i>.  &ldquo;Such developments&rdquo; is a loose phrase and we want to inquire as to precisely what it means. What developments?  If one is thinking in terms of a national military pact, then if a situation develops in which a pact is being agreed, a common army <Col N="480" /> organised, a common nuclear deterrent and all these things, then of course Deputy FitzGerald is right.  If that is what you mean by the Minister's phrase &ldquo;such developments&rdquo; then he is right, then there would be the protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is useful to have that protection through our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of some use but I made the point previously that it is of some use at the cost of validating something. I made the analogy of a plaster on a cancer.  It is of some use in the sense that the plaster on the cancer is of some use.  It may make the person who applies it feel better.  If you feel that you are doing something you feel good about it.  A great deal of medicine is based on the ritual of doing something to make the person who does it feel better rather than sitting there doing nothing.</P>
      <P>The amendment is of the same order of magnitude.  I do not think it is much better than that.  I do not deny the possibility that the amendment might do a little bit of good but it would be so tiny that the aspect which justifies opposition to it is that it gives a bogus sense of security.  If such developments mean the formal adhering to treaties, of course, we have choice in that respect. I suggest that such developments mean the growing together of economies, the purchasing of resources and companies by the multi-nationals, the inevitable growing dependence of the smaller economies on the larger ones and, therefore, the inevitable transfer of the freedom of choice to the centres of decision making which will be outside this Parliament or this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once you have that power of economic decision being taken outside an area where you can exert any influence then you may have the formal right to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; but you do not have the real right to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It is misleading to pretend that that form is of any value.  It is so misleading that it is a harmful thing to do.  The crucial development in regard to decision making is the development of the subordination of our economy, which is absolutely inevitable and which has already taken <Col N="481" /> place to a great extent in regard to the UK domination of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that such developments would be <i>ultra vires</i> and would not be binding on us.  The reality of economic integration is not within or without the powers of what the Treaty of Rome permits but is a process which is happening inside the economic framework that the Treaty of Rome has produced and encourages. It is the development of the transfer of governmental decision making to Brussels, the transfer of economic decision making to the multi-nationals outside Ireland, the diminution of our power to decide anything, be it governmental or economic, and indeed the inevitable loss of decision in the area of social policy&mdash;we have to equate our social policy with those of the other member States&mdash;which will diminish and in fact abolish our right to decide and to choose.  They are not formal or legal developments.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister for Finance's point that those developments without a new treaty would be <i>ultra vires</i>, would not be binding on us and we would retain a formal power to deliberate on them and to have a decision about them.  I suggest that to believe that that formal power contains real guarantees of decision making and of independent choice is to mislead people.  When you have the situation where you transfer the areas of real decision making outside a sovereign parliament in a country like this then you transfer all the other powers as well.  We will not make the major taxation decisions, the financial decisions, the major decisions about the way we shift wealth around in the Community by financial policy.  We will not make any significant decisions about social policy or any significant decisions, as far as I know, about the major shift of capital inside the Community. We can certainly have a regional policy inside Ireland but we cannot have a major one.</P>
    <P>While this amendment gives a formal protection it does not give a real protection.  I rather quailed because of the threatening attitude of the Minister for Finance when he got up&mdash;perhaps he did not mean it to be threatening but it came over to me like that&mdash;<Col N="482" /> and I thought I would be demolished. I thought he had some arguments which would indicate that I was being irrelevant, that I was behaving improperly, that there was a gross abuse of the rules of the House.  I thought these things would be validated.</P>

      <P>The Minister may not accept this but I assure him that I feel bound to listen to the points of view of others and I feel bound to validate my own opinions very often and to doubt them.  I hope my opinion is continually evolving in the light of that examination.  I am bound to look at such objections, which are offered in a party political way, and to say that perhaps there is some residuum of truth and serious argument in it after all.  The Minister made his opening threat and said he would come back to me.  He said it was a disturbing assumption that one has to approach all Bills with supposition.</P>

      <P>I do not write shorthand. Is there any point in asking the Minister to amplify exactly what he said?  He suggested that the making of suppositions in regard to arguments about a Bill was somewhat impermissible and the suppositions we had been making in regard to the future evolution of the Community and our measuring of this amendment against our suppositions about the future evolution of the Community were somehow improper, or were somehow an abuse of the rules of the House.</P>
