      <P>The drop of £1.3 million shown in the provisional figure for total exports in January, 1972, as compared with January, 1971, is disappointing.  However, the reversal in one month's external trade figures is not sufficient to warrant undue anxiety.  The Government are keeping the situation under close observation, and Córas Tráchtála have recently exhorted exporters to make personal contact with their customers in the United Kingdom to allay any possible doubts about orders being filled promptly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On 9th February Córas Tráchtála strongly urged exporters to take steps to ensure that all their customers in Britain and in the Six Counties would be informed of the normality of commercial life in the Twenty-Six County part of our country by personal contact, by correspondence, or by telephone contact.  This campaign is continuing.</P>

      <P>On the basis of statements of expenditure of health boards in the year ending 31st March, 1972 and estimated expenditure for the year 1972-73 the demand on the rates, would in the absence of special relief, have involved on average, a rates increase of 64p in the £ in the year 1972-73.  This would consist of 16p to cover the increases in health costs in the current financial year and 48p to cover the further increases in the coming year. The additional grants being made available from the Vote for my Department are calculated to limit the rate increase in any area to 30p.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a coast protection problem in the Fahamore-Mahera-beg-Scraggane area of the Maharees. The Commissioners of Public Works have received a proposal from the Kerry County Council under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, for works in that area and they will make an examination of the problem shortly.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners are not empowered to make a grant to the county council for coast protection works; the only way in which they could assist in the matter is by the execution of a scheme in accordance with the Act of 1963.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that Kerry County Council submitted this scheme with many others in 1965?  This road is the only road into the Maharees.  It has been undermined on several occasions in the past few years by tidal waters. Quite recently the people could not move into or out of the Maharees.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree that this is a very urgent matter in view of the fact that this scheme was submitted in 1965?  He should give this matter his immediate attention so that the people can live in happiness without having to fear that the road will be undermined again by tidal waters.  He should give some allocation to Kerry County Council to carry out this job as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I would be very happy to have more money, and more technical staff, so that we could proceed more quickly in dealing with the problem of coast erosion.  The scheme which the Deputy mentioned is second on a list of 18 we got from the Kerry County Council.  Waterville was the first one. I met a deputation about it.  We have written to the county council to say that we expect to start inspections about the spring of this year.  It may be in May.  We will be moving into this scheme pretty soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Maintenance work on the Feale drainage scheme the cost of which is borne by the Kerry County Council is carried out on a seasonal basis.  The season normally runs from the months of May to November approximately.  This year, because of favourable weather and other conditions, it was possible to retain men for a longer period.  Of 20 seasonal workers who started in May, 1971, 15 were retained up to 3rd February, 1972, and one to 16th February, 1972, when work in their respective areas was completed.  Four are still retained in an area where suitable work remains to be done.</P>

If this Hughes estate which I ask the Minister to instruct the Land Commission to acquire and divide amongst the people, is not divided it is possible that some of the people already employed in agriculture in that area will have to leave in order to make room for others to stay.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied that, particularly in the case of primary and post-primary education, the preparation and issue of a white paper at the present time would serve any great purpose.  In fact, it would only result in delaying the implementation of proposals <Col N="171" /> which have already been sufficiently spelt out.  The giving effect to these proposals is vital if we are to provide equality of educational opportunity for all our children and enable them to complete on equal terms within the European Community which we are about to enter.  When the recommendations of the Higher Education Authority in relation to the future provision for third level education have been published and all the interested parties have been given an opportunity of expressing their views in regard to them the question of publishing a white paper concerning all aspects of higher education, including teacher training, will be considered.</P>

As regards milk for manufacturing purposes, it is possible that the recent substantial increase in creamery milk price and the further increases which can be expected following Ireland's entry into the EEC will <Col N="181" /> stimulate production during the winter period.

For instance, while it might be acceptable to advocate consumption of butter as such within the Community, if we as a Government were to advocate the use of Irish butter within the Community, that would probably be considered to be an unfair practice.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that this is to a large extent an interim problem which will probably work itself out after a while due to a number of factors?  The major factor in this case is that the trade is quite close to folding up and some interim injection of capital is necessary particularly in order to keep skilled workers available to our meat industry. If there is any closing down this is a matter of urgency.  The skilled workers will be lost to the industry.  Finally, what does the Minister mean by &ldquo;as quickly as possible&rdquo; because this is extremely urgent and &ldquo;as quickly as possible&rdquo; is not enough.</P>

Where such data was, in fact, supplied an coimisiún has found that it was able to reach a decision in relation to complaints made in 1971 in about nine to ten weeks on average.</P>

      <P>I spoke for a short time on this Estimate last evening.  In order to bring my earlier remarks into some sort of focus, and in order to have some sort of continuity, perhaps I might recap very briefly.  So far as I can recollect I had expressed regret that there was no framework of legislation covering the whole policy on education.  I said it was simply deplorable that the Minister could, by simple decree or order, make drastic changes in the whole education policy.  I referred to the community schools bungle and stated my intention of going into that matter later in greater depth.  I also stated that I am no educationalist but that I have contacts with certain aspects of education for which I have some responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had got to the point about the situation in which I find myself in County Dublin as the chairman of the vocational education committee.  I was describing the experience I had some years ago when I was previously a member of the vocational education committee.  I was trying to get a vocational school built in Clondalkin.  The plans were ready, the consultants were appointed, and a tender had even been accepted.  Nothing was happening and I went with a small deputation to see people in the Department about the delay.  In the course of discussing the situation, I expressed the view that the whole procedure was extremely haphazard. I said that members of the vocational education committee could not possibly discharge their responsibilities to their own satisfaction because of the rate of growth in the area and because of the lack of statistics available to them and the lack of time available to them to follow up the necessary schemes and the facilities that should be made available.  I said that a survey should be made of the requirements of the county, that in making this survey there should be the closest possible contact with the <Col N="217" /> planning department of Dublin County Council and Dublin city and that they would be able to provide an amount of information in relation to projected development; also that the figures in relation to attendances at primary and other schools in the area should be readily available and that on this information decisions should be made as to where schools should be built, the type of schools and site provision.</P>
    <P>At that time I felt I was expressing a view that was important.  The outcome was most unfortunate as far as I was concerned because the school that was ready to go ahead was held up for two and a half years.  The excuse given by successive Ministers&mdash;they changed very rapidly in that period&mdash;was that the national survey had now been started in order to secure this sort of information.  I have no objection to the survey.  In fact I was recommending it very strongly.  However, it was most unfortunate that, as a result, the building of that school should have been held up.  Eventually the school was built to the original plans and specifications. The cost was a good deal greater, after a lapse of two and a half years.</P>
    <P>I considered that this was something stupid.  A generation were growing up in a densely populated area and this educational facility had not been provided. The present position in relation to that school is that it is only half big enough.  That was allowed to happen, even when the information had been obtained from the survey.</P>
    <P>What the Department do in relation to building schools and in deciding the size of schools is to some extent conditioned by the amount of money available. Very often they decide to build schools that are much too small because they have not the money necessary for the building of a larger school.  This is most unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The situation in County Dublin, while it has improved, has not improved sufficiently.  None of us knows where he is going.  This time I returned as Chairman of the Vocational Education Committee.  The whole responsibility has altered.  We now have a regional committee and I <Col N="218" /> simply do not know where the functions of this regional committee begin and end.  When I try to press on with the provision of a school in a particular area I am told that the matter is under consideration by the regional committee.  Who has the responsibility? We have a regional committee composed of people who do this work on a voluntary, part-time basis.  While they may be making every effort and may be extremely able and suitable persons to pass judgement, they simply have not the time and the job is not being done. This is no reflection on the personnel of the regional committee.  The information is not provided on which we can go to the Department and say: &ldquo;These are the facts and it is obvious from these facts that something should be done&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a site in Rathfarnham which we have had for 2½ years.  We do not know what to do about it.  A school is urgently required in Ballinteer, Dundrum. We do not know what to do about it.  There is no indication from the Department in regard to the matter. The over-crowding in the vocational school in Swords is appalling.  Again, there is no indication from the Department as to what our responsibilities are.  The community school idea is now imposed on the vocational education committee.  We do not know what the responsibilities are.  We do not know whether we will put a vocational school in one area or whether the Minister has, in fact, made up his mind that if a new school is to be provided it must be a community school.  We should be brought much more intimately into the Minister's confidence. We should know quite clearly the intentions of the Department.  We should be told what the future policy is to be in the Dublin region.  Where the population justifies it, are we to have more vocational schools?  This should be stated explicitly.  I shall raise no objection.  If the decision is to have community schools, that decision has been arrived at without adequate discussion with the people concerned.  I am thinking mainly of the parents who have a primary responsibility in regard to the type of education provided for their children.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given sufficient <Col N="219" /> consideration to this matter.  He is imposing his ideas.  I know his ideas reflect those of his advisers.  It is not good enough.  It is time that vocational education committees knew where they stood and knew the limits of their responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous problem in County Dublin at primary school level and at junior cycle and senior cycle levels.  Some years ago we tried to get the Department to accept our recommendation that the new vocational school in Walkinstown should cater for both boys and girls.  We could not get that view accepted.  Eventually we had to provide a school for boys only. I want to acquaint the Minister of the present position.  There is a secondary girls school in the area under the auspices of the Sisters of St. Paul, who have done an excellent job.  This school is a wonderful boon to the area.  However, the school is not capable of providing the number of places required. This year selection has already been made of the pupils who can be accommodated next year from the primary section for entry to the junior cycle, post-primary.  There are 35 girls who cannot be accommodated.  None of the other schools in the area can accommodate them.  I have spoken to senior persons in the Department about this, on the vocational side.  We would be in a position to provide accommodation for those pupils in the vocational school.  We could accommodate them temporarily and allow the block that was cut out of the original plans to be provided later in the year and have it for next year.  This should be a mixed school.  The enormous population of the area more than demand this.  The matter requires urgent decision by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about the situation in County Dublin.  I would ask the Minister to let us know what his mind is in relation to this matter.  There is an enormous task to be carried out and there must be co-operation.  Otherwise there will be floundering and the job will not be done as it should be done.</P>
    <P>My personal view is that the vocational education committee, on its own, with the staff it has, is not able to <Col N="220" /> survey the situation as it should be surveyed.  Two or three persons competent to make a survey should be seconded to this work on a full time basis for a short period.  The people acting in an honorary capacity on this regional committee have not got the time and it is not being done.  I want to impress that on the Minister and to ask him, as a matter of urgency, to let us know, in the Vocational Education Committee in County Dublin whether it is permissible for us to take in this overflow of girls to the junior cycle. None of the adjoining schools can take them and every day I am plagued by parents ringing me up.  I have got an assurance from the people to whom I spoke in the Department that accommodation will be found, that if it cannot be found otherwise the decision will be to bring them into the vocational school there.  We have the junior cycle side of the school practically built. More than half of it is occupied and the remainder is to be finished in June but we want permission immediately to employ architects and consultants to get on with the job of designing the senior cycle school.  Otherwise we will again be in serious trouble; we will be behind time and we will have the additional expense of putting in temporary accommodation to start the senior cycle in two years time.  This will happen unless we are told now to start work on this.  This is the sort of co-operation we should have.</P>
    <P>I want to say clearly that whenever I meet officers of the Minister's Department they are extremely helpful but they do not seem to be clear enough as to what the Minister's decision will be in relation to the type of schools that will be provided in the future.  The plans and preparations are not long-term enough to deal with the situation and it is the cause of great anxiety to everyone.  There are anxieties not only in this field but also in the primary section.  In County Dublin there are areas like Tallaght and Blanchardstown where there is a city developing almost overnight. There are people going to live there who have found it extremely difficult to find the deposit for their house. Some of them have borrowed portion of that deposit from relatives or other <Col N="221" /> people.  They are paying that back and also have their commitments on the loan.  They have not got a spare shilling to contribute to the parish for the purchase of a site for a primary school.  A site for a primary school of the size required in Tallaght or Blanchardstown is costing in the region of £25,000.  That is for approximately five acres which could be regarded as an inadequate site.  The school managers have not got this sort of money and they will not get it from the parents because they have not got it.  The sooner there is a decision in the Department to take over this responsibility the better.  The situation at present is that a proposal to build a primary school will not be considered in the Department until the school manager is able to say: &ldquo;I have a site in my own name, fully purchased.&rdquo;  The anxiety this is causing is unbelievable.  The Minister will have to look seriously at this and accept the fact that that sort of money is no longer there and it is an expense that will have to be borne by the State.  If this is the price of the type of managerial control we have had heretofore I do not think the clergy will hold out for it any longer.  I do not think they should be called upon to provide anything more than quite a nominal sum to get the necessary site.  Then they have to pay a portion. I know it will be quite a small portion in the type of area I am describing but nevertheless the responsibility is there.  I do not want to divest them completely of responsibility to provide some funds but the funds required in areas where the people are poor and overburdened must be a very small amount indeed.  This whole question of the responsibility for school sites in a rapidly developing area should be centralised, should be put on somebody's shoulders.</P>
    <P>When we come to community schools we are told that the people in the Department are taking over complete responsibility, that the Vocational Education Committee need not worry.  The situation in the two areas in which these schools are being provided is that we have not got a satisfactory site in either area.  In a number <Col N="222" /> of areas where we require sites urgently and where Dublin County Council have compulsory purchase orders with the Minister for Local Government they have been with the Minister for some considerable time. All he has to do is to confirm the CPOs but he is not confirming them. He is leaving a state of uncertainty there all the time.  I would ask the Minister for Education to use his influence with his colleague in Local Government to get decisions on CPOs as soon as possible in relation to these schools.</P>
    <P>I have assured the people in the Blanchardstown area, where I was selected as a member of the board of the new school&mdash;I do not know who is a member because the whole thing is so muddled&mdash;that a community school is a good thing for the area.  I want to assure the Minister that I will do everything possible to get community schools accepted and to see that they are provided as quickly as possible with as little opposition as possible.  It is a grand thing that the children of people from all strata of society can take the latch off the same door and go wherever they want to after that and that there is no longer any class distinction in education.  I think there was too much emphasis on class distinction yesterday evening.  This is not to condemn Deputy Tunney, whose contribution I admire in many ways.  He was speaking as a man who was a headmaster, and a good headmaster, for quite a number of years. He is speaking from personal experience and I would not attempt to contradict anything he had to say, but I do think he dwelt too much on class distinction.  This is one thing that should remove that.</P>
    <P>When I was on the vocational education committee before and when the present Minister for Foreign Affairs was Minister for Education I was pressing for an upgrading of the scheme in County Dublin.  I was almost assured by the Minister at that time that this matter would be decided very soon and was under active consideration. It is still under active consideration. A couple of months ago I raised the matter with the Department <Col N="223" /> and was assured again that it was under consideration.  I exhort the Minister to analyse what is happening in County Dublin and to make a decision on this all-important matter.  I have made rough notes on the number of schools in County Dublin, the number of pupils and the projected development as we see it.  There is the School of Horology in Blanchardstown.  There are four centres&mdash;Ballyboughal, Kilternan, Rathcoole and Garristown. Some of these until quite recently were day and night centres but they are now night centres.  We are providing teaching services outside the schools in institutions such as St. Anne's, St. Augustine's, St. Loman's, St. Ita's, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Ballyboden Boys' Club, Clondalkin Pipe Band, Donabate Judo Club, Shanganagh Castle, Clondalkin Youth Centre.  We anticipate expansion in Walkinstown, Clondalkin, Lucan, Balbriggan and Dundrum.  We need a new school badly in Dundrum or Ballinteer.  We want to get the senior cycle under way as a matter of urgency in Walkinstown.  We have had a site for two-and-a-half or three years in Rathfarnham but no decision from the Department.  We have Clonkeen Road and Ballinteer, all projected developments that are hanging fire.</P>
    <P>Approximate present attendances of day pupils number 2,670 and at night classes 1,930.  The number of permanent, whole-time teachers authorised by the Department for 1971-72 is 186.  The Minister will appreciate that this number would be higher but we were prevented from employing extra teachers.  In passing, I may say that this is one of the great grievances about the Minister being able to make decrees overnight by a statement.  Last year, secondary and vocational schools brought teachers from England and elsewhere and promised them employment and then the Minister said: &ldquo;You must not employ more teachers.&rdquo;  This caused very serious disruption.  Without any warning there was a clamp down on the number of teachers to be employed in post-primary education.  That is a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> When we raised the matter of staffing and grading previously we were told it was considered that while no single factor was fully satisfactory as a measure of a scheme's clerical staffing requirements, the number of permanent whole-time teaching posts was, perhaps, the most generally acceptable guideline.  On this basis we were told the Department would be prepared to sanction clerical staffing arrangements in committees' offices in accordance with a certain pattern which was stated. On this pattern we would be entitled to a much better staffing at office level than we have.  We are denied this and have been over years and I do not know why.</P>
    <P>We have no Deputy CEO.  The Minister must not be aware of the situation because the CEO is completely overworked and, in addition, he is now handed the responsibility of acting as secretary to the community schools.  I think that he should rightly carry this responsibility and that we should have this link between the work of the vocational education committee where we have a number of elected representatives who must answer to the people and these new community schools. That contact is absolutely essential.  I think the CEO should have the right&mdash; this is not yet clear&mdash;to delegate this responsibility to a deputy.  I am sure that will be done but it has not happened yet.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to impress on the Minister that if he is taking his job seriously he would have decided many years ago as a matter of urgency to up-grade the County Dublin scheme.  It is crazy not to do so now.  The Minister may come back&mdash;I hope not but I am trying to anticipate the possibility&mdash; and say that as a result of the decision to set up community schools instead of vocational schools we shall be hiving off, perhaps, 30 teachers and that will reduce the number.  With 186 permitted and with the vast number of temporary teachers we have in the county we still more than deserve upgrading. Deliberately, I am being parochial because this is the area in which I have some responsibility and in which I know most about educational <Col N="225" /> problems and can speak with some authority.</P>
    <P>I do not want to harp unduly on mistakes made in introducing the community school idea but some things that have now been conceded were the very things that were raised when I went to the Department after the July announcement to talk about the implementation of the proposals.  I raised these very points and I was shot down in the Department.  I cannot be contradicted on this.  I raised the matter of the question of faith and morals being introduced on the final appointment of teachers.  Personally, I saw nothing in it and I appreciated the Minister's view that body like that could easily get a teacher from the farthest corner of the land who would sell himself well but might be a completely wrong choice and that some time should elapse between the board appointing him and the selection being made.  It was decided that on &ldquo;faith and morals&rdquo; he could be dropped.</P>
    <P>I raised this.  The Archbishop's representative was there.  I said this would be misunderstood by many people of minority religions and that it would certainly be used in a way that was never intended by people who would like to interpret it in a certain way and that it would be desirable to remove it.  I am sorry to say that I was more or less rebuked by the representative who said they were not catering for that degree of intelligence.  I had to say, as courteously as possible, that I was meeting that standard of intelligence every day as a politician and I knew the problem would arise.  My objection was rejected by all and sundry in the Department.  Now, it is conceded and considered important enough to be conceded but it was not considered important simply because we, the vocational education committee, and I, as chairman, made the representations.  We were told there would be no move.  At one stage I had to threaten to leave the offices if we would not be listened to and it was obvious that everything we proposed was being rejected.</P>
    <P>We raised the matter of trustees and again it was rejected.  Would the Minister, when replying, tell us if this matter is finally settled?  I understood it was <Col N="226" /> on the second change and that the Minister will now, in fact, appoint the trustees.  But I saw there were some discussions taking place over the weekend that would seem to indicate that this matter is not finally settled.  I hope it is.  I hope the provision of these schools will be expedited and that there will be no more hitches.  Indeed, there need never have been any hitches if the Minister had been more forthcoming and had shared his thinking in all this matter prior to throwing it at the people.</P>
    <P>A draft deed of trust has gone out to those participating in this community school idea.  There are certain little things which need to be cleared up.  I am not now speaking for the religious orders, but a sum of money is required to be provided by the religious orders and by the vocational education committee. Why does the Minister not specify the amount?  Has he discussed this with anybody?  Nobody could accept a deed of trust which does not indicate what these various groups are letting themselves in for and it is my honest belief that the religious orders will not provide anything more than a nominal sum for a school over which they will have very little control and in which they will have no ownership whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Another disquieting feature of the draft deed is the fact that the Minister is almighty and at any time he can wave the wand and change the conditions in the deed of trust.  The trustees should be appointed for life.  Unless they cease to conduct the business of the community schools they should be appointed for life and this should be stated.  The responsibilities should also be stated and defined.  They are not defined in the draft deed.  I would be afraid of a little bit of overlapping as between the board of management and the trustees.  It is expected that portions of the community school will be used by the community at large.  There will be swimming pools and recreational facilities.  If the school were used for a purpose for which it was not intended, would that be the responsibility of management or would it be the responsibility of the trustees?  The Minister might look into this aspect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> There is some difficulty about the term of office of the board of management. It is suggested that it be three years, in the first instance, and five years thereafter.  I assume it is intended to link this with local elections.  Now that rarely works out.  The Minister will recall that the first proposal published was that the religious orders would have the appointment of the two parent representatives.  The last proposal says that each of the religious orders will appoint one of their own and a parent who has a child at the school will be appointed by the other two. How can this be done?  These people are already elected.  The religious orders have gone ahead and appointed two parents.  Now the Minister says the parents must have a child at the school. Neither of the parents has a child at the existing schools and it is most unlikely they will have a child in the new schools.  Is this another complication? Will this be another hold-up?  This is the kind of muddle that arises when things like this are not fully dealt with by all concerned before publicity is given to them.  Kites are flown.</P>
    <P>This is a small matter, but not an unimportant one: an already overburdened CEO is being called upon to act as secretary and have responsibility for the secretarial work of these two schools.  What extra remuneration will he get?  There is no indication that he will get any.</P>
    <P>It is stated that any member of the board may be removed from office by his nominator.  I do not know whether or not this is wise.  It will have to be mulled over.  I can see some complications where the parents have the appointment or election of two members. I can see various influences entering in.  A parent might be elected and might be dropped again in a month's time.  This is bringing it to extremes, but there should be some decision about this.  Unless a person misconducts himself in some predetermined way he should remain a member of the board for three years, in the first instance, and five years thereafter.  This needs tightening up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> There is, too, the question of a rescinding motion.  There should be some mention of the percentage of people present and voting; that should be required to have a rescinding motion carried.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be responsible for the erection of the school premises and the development of the school grounds. Heretofore, vocational education committees had the responsibility of employing consultants, preparing plans, putting up a proposition to the Department, building the schools, and so on.  This responsibility is now taken out of their hands and will be held by the Minister.  Now we were simply told that consultants had been appointed. We asked who the consultants were and, after a good deal of reluctance to disclose the information, we eventually found out that the consultants were a firm from Cork.  In the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee we appointed consultants in two areas.  This was agreed to by the Department.  They did a certain amount of work.  Now they are, so to speak, redundant.  They were not even notified that the Minister's decision has made them redundant.  This is a rather highhanded action and I would plead with the Minister to compensate these consultants.  Like everyone else, consultants have to make their arrangements in advance.  They have to decide what work they are able to undertake and retain staff for that purpose.  The committee do not know what to tell them but we know they are dropped.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that one firm of consultants in Cork should be employed to do a job in County Dublin and, as far as we know, to do all future community schools.  There is a vast sum of money involved and the public should know if one firm will do all this work and how this was decided.  I know there is a certain justification for it and I know that the Department consider that there is a good deal of saving in time and money in making this kind of decision.  I appreciate that this is so because this firm are working in co-operation with a project team in the Department and they have already worked out suitable schedules of <Col N="229" /> accommodation for the schools.  Apparently the design of the schools is such that there is a great deal of flexibility built into the planning and changes can be made without expensive replanning. This is excellent and I realise there must be quite a saving but consultants throughout the country are concerned about this matter.  They have no opportunity to participate, regardless of the location of the school.  I should be surprised to learn that the consultants and architects have not been in touch with the Minister in connection with this matter.  It seems to have been a matter of selection without competition.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations as to whether it is right that the Minister's nominee shall be chairman of the selection board with regard to the selection of teachers and that he will have a deliberative vote in the event of equality of votes.  In this eventuality the Minister's nominee will have an additional or casting vote.  I consider this a dangerous situation.  When I was discussing this matter in the Department on behalf of the vocational education committee I asked that the same thing would happen in relation to the selection board as is agreed in relation to the board of management, namely, that the chairmanship should rotate.  I think the Minister would be well advised to have another look at this matter.  It is not necessary to hold up matters while this is done.</P>
    <P>It appears the Minister can make statements at any kind of function, statements that change the entire educational policy overnight.  The most recent one was to tell the people that unless the post-primary schools had 400 pupils from now on they were to forget about senior cycle education.  It is fantastic that a Minister should have this power to tell these institutions which have provided post-primary education, in some areas for generations, that they cannot provide senior cycle education.  This is without any warning to parents who may have children in the schools concerned.  Now they realise the children cannot finish their education in the schools and it will be necessary for them to transfer to other schools if the Minister implements <Col N="230" /> his announced decision.</P>
    <P>I hope the country will not allow him to do this.  One aspect with regard to community schools about which I have a reservation is the size of the schools.  I do not accept that it is impossible to provide an adequate range of subjects unless there are 1,600 pupils in the school.  A short time ago we were talking about a maximum figure of 400 but now it has suddenly jumped to 1,600.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Via 800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It jumped from 400 to 800 and from 800 to 1,600.  When will it stop?  While smaller schools may not be able to provide the enormous range of subjects that are considered necessary and desirable, they have many compensations and they provide things of real value that are not provided in the schools where the children cease to have an identity and are lost in numbers.  I do not think the Minister is entitled to make this kind of announcement and tell the people that this is what he has decided.  This is not democracy.  A few days ago he told us at Question Time that there were 14 schools involved but I would be surprised if there are not more involved. However, I accept the Minister's figure.  I should like to ask the Minister to deal with this matter at length in his reply; I should like him to tell us his reasons and to name the schools concerned so that the parents involved will know where they stand. Announcements like that made by the Minister should not be made in this manner.</P>
      <P>The salary being offered to the principal of a community school, which will cater for 1,600 pupils, is deplorable. I would ask the Minister to compare the salary he is offering to the person holding such a post with the salary being offered to people employed in the new health boards.  He will be amazed at the difference.  The salary being offered for the post of principal of a community school is disgraceful, having regard to the responsibility involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that the various teachers' organisations are involved in this kind of decision but I wonder if they have <Col N="231" /> been consulted in this case in relation to the salary and allowance for the extra responsibility involved?  Considering that the community school will provide an enormous range of subjects and the principal will be closely associated with the outside community in the provision of various facilities, and the type of public relations it requires and the calibre of the person who must be put into this job if it is to be successful, I must say that I think the salary is deplorable. The Minister must look at it again if he hopes that these schools will be successful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan-O'Higgins referred to school transport yesterday and said there are certain aspects she does not like.  Probably too much money is being spent on transport that could be better invested in reducing the size of classes and in having reasonably small primary schools in which pupils can get individual attention.  This means a lot to the average pupil.  It might be appropriate at this time to refer to an article which was referred to by my colleague Deputy FitzGerald in the course of his speech.  I did not read everything he had to say about it.</P>

      <P>Father Nolan said:</P>
      <P>The great educationalist White-head enunciated two educational commandments, to guard against, as he put it, &ldquo;mental dry rot&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Do not teach too many subjects and what you teach, teach thoroughly.&rdquo; And elsewhere&mdash;&ldquo;Let the main ideas which are introduced into a child's mind be few and important.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is a danger that people like Deputy FitzGerald might regard most pupils as having the same IQ as he has, the same capacity for learning, the same intellect.  This is completely wrong.  I would say that we would have less than a half of 1 per cent up at his level&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The vast majority of them, as Father Nolan said, in the time available during the ordinary school year, are capable only of learning to read correctly, to write correctly and to do accounting accurately.  If they can do those three things properly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This may be so but, if they have not got the intellectual <Col N="234" /> capacity, I do not think they should be confused with a vast number of subjects, and not be able to master any of them, and not be able to go on to learn other subjects.  I will not overdo the quotations but a couple of passages are worth quoting.  He said:</P>
      <P>To speak of our own situation, one subject in the vernacular, a language, mathematics, a science and a &ldquo;hand and eye&rdquo; subject, will discipline the mind and form the understanding as well as, if not better than, four times that number of subjects.</P>
      <P>I agree with that.  The whole theme of this article is that you can try to do too much in the time available and that only serves to confuse the children. The vast majority of them are not able to encompass it.  I agree with Deputy FitzGerald that it should be available for those who are able to encompass it.</P>
      <P>My personal thinking about education and the provision for education is that there is far too much concern for the brilliant child and the brilliant family, and far too little thought for the parents of children who are average or below average.  What is being done for them?  Nothing.  Nothing exceptional is being done for them.  The parents are paying for the brilliant child who will get there whether we like it or not. Nothing can stop the brilliant child.  It is the parents of the dull child who are paying for the brilliant child.  This needs to be considered.</P>
      <P>So much do I think that, that, as a member of the County Committee of Agriculture in County Dublin, I pressed very hard for and got agreement on my suggestion that a number of agricultural scholarships should be reserved for boys with less education than those doing their leaving certificate in the year of competition, boys we knew would be returning to their own farms and who would be continuing as farmers.  We felt that every boy who is interested in farming can benefit from a year in an agricultural college and that the boy with that level of education and intellect requires it more than the other boy.  For this reason we reserve a proportion of the scholarships and give them each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some provision will have to be made <Col N="235" /> if the vast majority of the children are to get the benefits the few get. There is an over-emphasis on brilliance. I am not sure that, in the long run, the over-brilliant person is the best person.  Common sense is a quality that is scarce enough.  A combination of common sense and average ability produces a better citizen than the over-brilliant person who can quite easily go wrong.</P>
    <P>Everybody is told the school to which his child can go and the child can go only to that school.  This is wrong.  The Minister may contend that he has to provide transport and will not provide transport in order to bring a child to a school of the parent's choice.  This is not always right.  It may be right in most cases.  There should be parental choice in the matter.  A parent should be in a position to opt to send a child to the school that other members of the family have attended. There should not be rigidity about this.  In some cases where school transport is provided a child who may be outside the prescribed limit will not be taken on the school bus even as a fare paying passenger.  The Minister is not listening.</P>

    <P>I referred earlier to the complete absence from the Minister's introductory statement of any reference to the work his Parliamentary Secretary is doing in relation to sports and recreation and the preparation of young people in the proper use of sport time in adult life.  Perhaps at some stage before the debate concludes the Parliamentary Secretary will tell the House what he is doing in this regard. He is doing a good bit of work but not nearly enough.  The limitation may be due to lack of money.  I should like to know what has been done in this regard.  There is a deplorable trend developing in relation to spare time <Col N="236" /> and spare money, to spend both in the local pub or lounge bar.  People should be prepared for adult life when we all hope the working week will be shorter and there will be more opportunity for people to enrich their lives. They will not know how to enrich their lives if they are not prepared for it. The Minister's introductory statement should have contained some reference to this matter.</P>
    <P>I represent Ballymun.  I have been attacked there on a couple of occasions because of the Minister's failure to allow the people there to have an all-Irish school.  If people want an Irish school and if the numbers are sufficient to justify it the case should be accepted by the Minister as made. It should not be provided on a limited, grudging scale.  I say that as a person who speaks the language very badly. I regret the fact that I have lost the ability to speak the language as I used. Deputy Tunney spoke here yesterday evening on the subject of Irish.  He spoke as a man with some experience in the matter.  He said that he wanted the children to laugh and to push and to shove through the medium of Irish, to play football and to dance through the medium of Irish.  I send my children to the Gaeltacht every year in so far as it is possible.  I am more concerned that they should absorb the atmosphere than that they should be able to speak the language although I would love them to be able to speak it fluently.  I would not mind about the niceties of grammar if they could express themselves through the medium of Irish.  That is as far as we can ever hope to get.  I get the impression that the people in the Gaeltacht could not express themselves adequately without using English words.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister on behalf of the people in Ballymun whom I represent that, if they produce sufficient evidence as to the number who would attend an all-Irish school, that school should be provided for them. The building is there and there should be no reluctance on the part of the Minister in acceding to this demand.  I know there is opposition from certain quarters from which, perhaps, opposition should not come.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> The booklet, <i>Investment in Education,</i> has come to be accepted by the Department as having the authority of the Bible.  Economics is the criterion. This is particularly the case in the matter of teachers.  While we are, perhaps, spending money unwisely in certain respects there is not sufficient concentration on the problem of reducing the pupil-teacher ratio so that teachers may give the individual attention which the vast majority of children require.</P>
    <P>A vast number of people still have to pay in respect of children attending primary schools.  This arises from the shortage of places in primary schools and in order that the children will be eligible to move in due course to the secondary section of the school.  Parents in my constituency complain about this.  They should not have to pay in respect of their children until they leave the primary school.  We talk about free education but it is not free.  It is a great attempt.  There is no such thing as free education, even in those secondary schools that have opted into the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney made some interesting remarks in regard to choice of teacher.  He mentioned the fact that we have choice of doctor, that an employee in any walk of life who proves unsatisfactory can be dismissed, but that there is no possibility of dismissing an unsatisfactory teacher.  An unsatisfactory teacher could adversely affect a child's life.  A man may have academic qualifications but may not otherwise be a suitable person to act as teacher.  There must be quite a large number of teachers who would fall into this category.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney also referred to the fact that children may be sent to school and on arrival there may be told to return home as there is no heating in the school.  When they return home unexpectedly there may be nobody in the house.  This is a serious matter. He referred to children of tender age going to the primary sections of post-primary schools.  They travel some distance in order to have a foot in to the junior cycle.  They go to school and are told the heating is off.  There is a limited number of them who come out when there is no bus home.  They hang <Col N="238" /> around a town or village, perhaps, for hours or they attempt to walk an unreasonable distance and are in danger on the way.  I do not think enough thought is given to this.  Deputy Tunney referred to this, stressing the importance of a good caretaker in all schools.  He said many people do not realise the importance of a good caretaker. He is speaking with the experience of a headmaster for a period of years and, as I said, a good headmaster.  He said how fortunate he was in having the best caretaker in the country.  I happen to know the man and I agree that he is a dedicated man. If you have a man who is able to anticipate difficulties, this sort of thing does not arise but it is treated too lightly.  I know teachers have a big job in determining where all the children come from and which ones have a difficulty and are in danger.  A greater effort should be made to tell the children or their parents in advance that there will be no school on a certain day.</P>
    <P>When will the Department grow up and when will the Minister have sense and stop insisting on solid fuel being used in boilers attached to schools in this city?  This is crazy.  Here you have, in urban conditions, a dump of solid fuel and subsequently a dump of ashes and no place to go with them, nobody with a vehicle to shift them without a lot of organisation and dependence on other organisations.  When will we decide that oil is the normal and rational thing to use in these circumstances? When will vocational committees and school authorities be able to give up fighting about this?  They fight and eventually they decide that if it is going to delay the school they will agree to it.  They agree to it and have this load on their backs.  It is so crazy that it is hard to understand why the Department insist on it.</P>
    <P>I have children at school doing the intermediate and leaving certificate. For the past two or three years they have been under constant threat that they will not be able to do their examinations because of teachers' strikes.  This is an indication of the unsettled state of the whole relationship between the teaching bodies and <Col N="239" /> the Department.  I implore all concerned to try to bring this to an end and not to have this continuous turmoil among the teaching profession and the continuous anxiety of children who have examinations to do and do not know whether they will have to spend a further year or two at school as a result of something that is completely outside their control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins expressed concern about mentally retarded children particularly moderately-handicapped children not being adequately provided for.  It is only fair to say that in recent times the Department have made quite considerable strides in this area and have done a lot that we had not been doing previously to provide facilities for the education of mentally handicapped children.  However, I think it requires some investigation and a survey to find out the number of children who are denied these opportunities as yet and to find out whether this could not be overcome in some way on a residential basis if they are too scattered in certain areas.  It is a matter of great anxiety to parents and a great deprivation for the children concerned if they do not get education which makes an enormous difference to them.  I have some responsibility for an occupational therapy unit or an industrial output unit for mentally retarded adults.  I have seen adolescents and adults coming in and not being able to do anything at all.  When they are tried out at various things it is amazing the progress they can make.  They can live almost normal lives after a period of training in some job and they can be regarded as people going out to work and living a normal life. I think there is very little difference between the mentally retarded adult and the mentally retarded child because the adult still has a child's mind. I give the Minister credit for much that has been done, but I think the problem has not been fully covered particularly in rural areas.  Solutions could be found for the people who have not been dealt with.</P>
    <P>I had no real intention of speaking on this Estimate.  I only undertook to <Col N="240" /> come in and say something on it because of my interest in education, because of my concern even for my own children, because of my responsibility as chairman of a vocational education committee and because of the enormous changes that have been taking place and that have been announced in recent times by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The two very instructive speeches that followed the Minister's Estimate speech&mdash;the speech of Deputy FitzGerald and that of the Labour Party spokesman on education, Deputy Thornley&mdash;set a very good example in approaching this not from a Party polemical point of view while at the same time not being afraid to criticise where they thought criticism was called for.  In general, the wellinformed speeches including the very detailed and interesting one we have just heard from Deputy Clinton followed on this line and I do not propose to depart from it.</P>
      <P>I think in this area the political parties have very little reason to crow over one another, that the problem which we have inherited is the result of a long, complex and often unhappy history of education in Ireland, the social context of education and the economic background to education. This is a common inheritance with which we are all trying to deal together. So, a debate on the subject can be more in the nature of a cooperative discussion than of a polemical debate.  I think that has been so far the case with this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the speakers who have preceded me in this debate have been teachers or have taught within this State.  I have never done so, though my own education was entirely in this State.  I have been taught in Northern Ireland and have taught and been concerned with education outside this country in widely different conditions &mdash;in one country which would be regarded as a good deal less developed than this and in another which is in many ways more developed, the United States of America.  I would like, therefore, as we all try to bring what we can to this discussion to stand back a <Col N="241" /> little&mdash;I cannot hope to bring the wealth of relevant detail that others have brought and which I am learning &mdash;and look at the general picture. Deputy FitzGerald referred to what he discerned in the Minister's statement as a lack of any philosophy of education. I think that is true, but I do not think it is, as it were, the Minister's invention or non-invention.  I think the philosophy of the Department of Education for many years in the past certainly was one of having no philosophy of education.  That was the philosophy. It was, and when I say &ldquo;was&rdquo;, I am speaking with a large share of &ldquo;is&rdquo; in the &ldquo;was&rdquo;, as there have been changes but there has not been total change&mdash;one of controlled abdication and it still is to a considerable extent that.</P>
    <P>Certainly, in my many contacts as a civil servant with officials of the Department of Education of those days, I found that they were surprised by the idea that they might be supposed to have a philosophy of education, that it would be presumptuous on their part to have such a philosophy, that education was safely in the hands of people who had a philosophy of education and you handed it over to them, that is to say, the education of more than 95 per cent of the children is in the hands, broadly speaking, under the general control, of the Catholic ecclesiastical authorities.  This poses a problem which I think may be unique in the world.  It is a sort of double helix arrangement.  You have on one side a structure of democratic responsibility for education, of which we here represent something like the summit, and you have parallel with that a hierarchical system in which educational responsibility comes from the top down.  In theory at least&mdash;there is a little bit of give and take in both systems&mdash;one is a hierarchical system down from the top and the other is supposed to come up from the bottom, from the people.</P>
    <P>I think that has always posed definite problems and that on the whole there has been and still is a certain ascendency of the hierarchical principle over the democratic.  It has seemed to me when I have seen officials of the Department of Education and <Col N="242" /> Ministers for Education mingling with bishops that I have not noted that they have, as it were, seemed to dominate their social contacts.  I felt that they deferred not merely spiritually but as I thought, it seemed also socially and professionally.  I think we should ask ourselves how healthy that is.</P>
    <P>This situation, this strange symbiosis of the democratic and the hierarchical has had the effect and did have the effect in the past&mdash;and this is something which has been changed and very healthily changed because there have been very healthy changes in this area, and the present Government deserves its share of credit for working in that direction and so do certain members of the Opposition here, Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Thornley&mdash;that for long this subject was insulated from critical debate.  I have sat in that gallery over there listening to these debates over a good many years and have read them as well, but up to comparatively recently this subject was dealt with more or less as one dealt with the Department of Justice Estimate.  One gets up and repeats nice things about the Garda and, generally speaking, one does not criticise the Garda.  I am not saying that the Garda deserve any unqualified criticism&mdash;I do not think they do&mdash;but we are supposed to criticise here and when we stop doing it, it is an unhealthy symptom, and in this area also we have been doing this.</P>
    <P>The idea has been that if you criticise what is actually going on in the schools or what you think is going on, what you are really up to is making some kind of sinister attack on the Church or showing ingratitude for the devoted work of the religious orders and so on and people have been, and to some extent still are, frightened off from serious criticism by that.  I witnessed, for example, in the Seanad the late Senator Owen Sheehy Skeffington repeatedly drawing attention to the problem, and it is a problem, of corporal punishment in the schools and I witnessed the extent to which he was cold-shouldered by Members of this House.  This was a topic that was taboo&mdash;you do not raise it&mdash;and the answer was always the double answer given when people are embarrassed, <Col N="243" /> that, first, there is no corporal punishment in the schools, certainly not for failure at lessons and, secondly, that it was right and justifiable to have corporal punishment in the schools and thirdly, will you please shut up?</P>
    <P>We are emerging from that period. We have not totally emerged from it; I think that is where we are.  As bad areas in any history have left traces behind them as the Joseph McCarthy period in America left traces, so this does leave traces here for which the Minister personally is not to blame or his officials, but for which we all collectively have a share of responsibility. I think it affected the Department itself and that from fairly close association with a notably discreet body, a body which has no liking for publicity, whose habits are not democratic&mdash;I am not saying this in any way is sinister; they are not democratic but are hierarchical&mdash;the Department tended to acquire an ethos of its own which was much the same in inflection as attitudes of people not responsible to democratic process.</P>
    <P>We have come across this very frequently in contacts with the Department and I think the people concerned are not fully conscious of what they are doing or why they are doing it in this relation, when they brush us aside, often tactfully and always politely&mdash; we have no fault to find with them in that respect&mdash;but they do tend to brush us aside and there is a steady undercurrent of benevolent paternalism in their relations to, for example, questions in this House, to public criticism and so on.  It is almost as if the mottoes are that least said soonest mended and that most mendacious of all proverbs &mdash;what you don't know won't hurt you.  This is the most mendacious of all proverbs and most unsuitable for a Department of Education which should surely be saying that it is what you don't know that is likely to hurt you.</P>
    <P>I would here appeal to the Minister and to his Department generally to have a new look at that attitude which has come through in contacts after contacts&mdash;I do not need to go into them all; many of them have already <Col N="244" /> been cited&mdash;of not telling the people, telling the House, giving the impression that &ldquo;It is none of your business; we know what is for the best and we are in touch with people who know even better what is for the best, so just keep quiet and in due course it will all sort itself out&rdquo;.  I should think that a Minister who broke away from that attitude would earn great repute.  I hope the Minister will increasingly develop his Department in that direction and along those lines.</P>
    <P>I shall certainly be accused in some quarters of attacking Catholic education, but what I am trying to do is criticise and question a particular system of Catholic education derived historically from a relation between the clergy and an intellectuallydepressed, educationally - deprived laity.  I am speaking of the past but it is a past which carries a long shadow and which charges and informs the attitudes of people connected with education.  Coming from the 18th and 19th centuries it is a shadow that has overlain the history of education in the Free State and later in the Republic. That is partly reflected, I think, in the Minister's Estimate speech.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;the tip of the iceberg&rdquo; is one that has entered into the history of this Dáil in another context, but it is to some extent when we read a speech like the Minister's&mdash;so informative about certain areas, mainly economic and logistical areas, so uninformative, although his concluding speech may remedy that, about general approach, about the psychology and the philosophy of education&mdash;we feel that we are, indeed, just looking at the tip of an iceberg.  We are not really talking about what goes on in the schools.  That is, as it were, screened off.</P>
    <P>I know it can be, and is argued, that what I call the controlled abdication of a say in the philosophy of education&mdash;at least an overt, articulate say, a say in the democratic sense&mdash;is what the people want, that 95 per cent of them want the Catholic hierarchy and the religious orders to control the education of their children and do not want State interference.  That certainly has been the traditional attitude <Col N="245" /> and I think politicians still tend to assume that it is true.  But is it, in fact, true any more?  It may be true in some areas: I think it is not true in some others.  Is it not rather the case that people, as they become more educated&mdash;and they have been becoming more educated&mdash;are increasingly critical of the educational system and look with increasing impatience to their elected representatives to remedy its defects, to all of us, not just to the Government, but, of course, they must look mainly to the Government?  If that is so, the democratic representatives have the duty to meet that demand, to articulate and to some extent lead it and do that to a greater extent, I think, than has been reflected in the Minister's opening speech or in the general practice of our debate.</P>
    <P>There are some large, related questions that I should like to raise.  In this debate I think we are right to raise both detailed criticisms and larger issues and I hope the Minister will take plenty of time when replying to cope with both although that will take some time, but he has it.  How far do those schools that we still abandon so largely to hierarchical control, inculcate democratic values?  How far do they encourage the challenging, questioning, alert habit of mind on which the growth and strengthening of democracy depend?  How far do their actual working conditions, size of classes and so on, permit them to do so?  That is one aspect of it.  Another is: how far do their managers, principals and other controlling bodies even want them to do so?  We do not know and the Department, so far as I can see&mdash; again, I am open to correction&mdash;do not seem to think it is their business to find out.</P>
    <P>This question, as we consider it today or at any time in the last few years, is much more than an academic question, the attitude to democratic institutions which is being inculcated in our schools and about which we know only bits here and there as they hit us as individuals.  What kind of preparation for life and citizenship is our schools providing?  Certainly, in the case of most and probably of all of us, we know that they are inculcating patriotism, a patriotic spirit.  It is well <Col N="246" /> and good and right that they should do that but what quality of patriotism are they inculcating?  We ask ourselves these questions today in the light of what people are doing, some of whom are the products of these schools and some of whom take up the gun and the bomb.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming all the schools or any particular orders or any particular people.  I am not blaming the Minister individually for this state of affairs nor am I suggesting that it is just the schools that turn out the IRA.  It is not like that; but the schools play a part in this.  Let me illustrate with a little anecdote I heard, just as I came in, of a teacher in a school run by a particular order not very far away who put this question to his class: &ldquo;What is the opposite of white?  &mdash;Black.  What is the opposite of day?  &mdash;Night.  What is the opposite of Ireland?  &mdash;England.&rdquo; We should not make too much of a quip but if there are too many quips like that and if the air is charged with that kind of hint, young people, boys especially, do not need much hinting to see an enemy.  It is fun for a boy to have an enemy.  He is a combative little animal and that is the way he turns and if he is encouraged to see a legitimate enemy at whom he can hit, he will take the hint.  I fear some of our teachers and schools are producing in the guise of patriotism a narrow, intolerant, bitter, fanatical nationalism which makes a target of a particular country and people and teaches people to take little account of those in this island who oppose that point of view.</P>
    <P>Specifically let me put this question &mdash;I put it in no light spirit&mdash;were the seeds of Aldershot sown in some Irish classroom?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, they were not in regard to a particular case. The atmosphere of the home, certain aspects of our official culture, certain forms of commemoration, certain public narrowings of the idea of what patriotism means, may all contribute. Chance contacts may contribute.  Some Irish schoolrooms&mdash;I am trying all the time not to generalise about all the teachers or even any members of a <Col N="247" /> particular group or a particular order &mdash;have contributed to this and some schools are continuing to contribute to it.</P>
      <P>In some of our schools we are turning out little IRA.  That is a problem at which we have, I think, to look. Some of the people concerned in these movements are teachers.  I will not name them.  None of us wants any witch hunts here.  But this is a matter of deep concern.  People have expressed very strong views about drugs here and I think every parent shares fears of children being exposed to drugs and in particular, to hard drugs which may destroy their lives but, personally, I should be just as concerned if I knew my children at a young impressionable age were being taught Irish history from a Sinn Féin or IRA point of view. If I knew they were being indoctrinated in this fashion I should be literally just as concerned as I would be if I knew they were in contact with people who were pushing drugs.  I think a narrow, fanatical view of history and of life, a foreign-hating view, is one of the most dangerous things in the world.  We saw what it did to Germany in our own time and surely this is something we must avoid in our own society.</P>
      <P>The Government have shown a proper concern about some of the results of our educational system and about what people coming out of the system do.  We should not merely be concerned with over acts.  When a young man comes out and does some terrible thing, plants a bomb in a public place, he does it because a bomb was planted before that in his own mind by somebody, by his parents, by a speech he heard, by a teacher in school.  Something has prepared this train of events and he goes out and does something he believes not to be criminal, something he believes not to be cruel, something he believes not to be wicked, something he believes to be perfectly right and patriotic.  He goes and does that because we have formed him like that.  He has come out in that shape out of our institutions and the set of institutions we are concerned with in this debate is the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> I said I do not want any witch hunt here.  What I should like to hear from the Minister is what is being done by way of positive effort to inculcate democratic values.  I think we have a right to inculcate these values provided, of course, that we expose them, as they should be exposed, to challenge, to questioning and to discussion.  We have a right to inculcate these values through schools, through classes and through discussion groups led by people, though not exclusively, who actually believe in these values.  Our civics courses are concerned with the disposal of litter and trivia of that kind; the larger aspects of morality are left to other parts of the curriculum. We inculcate rather severe views, sometimes incorrect views, of sexual morality.  On public morality, I do not think we normally have much to say.</P>
    <P>A basic course in democracy would, I think, have to include an understanding of just why private armies are wrong, irrespective of the sincerity, bravery, patriotism, and so on, which may be possessed by the members of such armies.  The tendency of our schools, of our utterances and our habits of life is to say: &ldquo;If they are sincere and brave, then they must be right&rdquo;.  We tend not to see how wrong they are.  In so far as we let things rip, in so far as we allow that bitter narrow nationalism to flourish within our institutions&mdash;it cannot be denied that it does flourish in them&mdash;then we are putting our young people in deadly danger.  They are in danger because of what they do as a result of this teaching.  They are in danger because of what may happen to them physically. They are also in danger of our reprisals, the reprisals of our society. When they behave in a manner that we have taught them is virtuous, we take them and we put them in prison. In certain circumstances we have executed them.  I do not think we have the right to do these things and I think we have to begin now to educate in this area.  We here must be conscious first and foremost of our own responsibility. Others have responsibilities too. The Northern Catholic bishops very rightly, honourably and courageously asked an important question not long ago: &ldquo;Who, in their sane senses, want <Col N="249" /> to bomb a million Protestants into a united Ireland?&rdquo;  It is certain that a great many people think it is right to do that.  One member of this House who sat on those benches said the other day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If you had been listening, a Cheann Comhairle, you would, I think, understand.  The point is that we in our schools are teaching people to behave in this way.  The brief illustration I was giving was that a member of this House said that it might not be right to bomb the Protestant Unionists into a united Irish state, but why not bomb them out?  He was not a dissident.  He was not a rebel.  I am not blaming him.  He was taught that.  I think the people who asked: &ldquo;Who, in their sane senses, want to bomb a million Protestants into a united Ireland?&rdquo; would want to see to this, to see what is happening in the schools under our control. Are all the people coming out of these schools in their sane senses? Some of them want to do just this. We have to face up to that.  We have to face up to the danger of this form of teaching, this form of infection through teaching, and not only through teaching, but it is teaching we are concerned with here, to the danger this poses directly to our young people, with whose future we are concerned, and also to our whole society in its capacity to hold together and specifically in its economic future, which is now in dire danger as a result of activities which have been encouraged by, among other things, our system of education, our tolerances and our negligence in relation to that system.</P>

      <P>I have already expressed my surprise at the complacency <Col N="250" /> of the Minister in the situation which faces him as Minister for Health with the information available to him from many societies. These societies appear to be more concerned about the danger of cigarette smoking and more conscientious in their sense of responsibility than does the Minister. They appear to be more concerned about helping to correct a developing situation which has led to so much unhappiness, disability, sickness and, in a high percentage of cases, death.</P>
      <P>I have been talking about this subject for many years.  The Minister and the Department insist that the correct approach is to talk to the youngsters, to beam propaganda at the young people, and the Minister is particularly convinced that this is the correct method of dealing with the problem. Although we have concentrated on the children during the years when we took any action on this matter, the end result of the campaign directed at young people has been a continued increase in the number of youngsters smoking.  The increase between 1967 and 1970 was from 31.9 per cent to 35.2 per cent for boys and for girls it was from 10.5 per cent to 18.4 per cent.</P>
      <P>I agree we must direct our propaganda, information and education towards the young people but I do not know why we should consider that young people are able to exercise a control in this matter or to discontinue smoking.  We know that children start smoking at the age of seven years and there is a rapid increase in the incidence of smoking from then on.  The Minister does not appear to think that adults are able to stop smoking and I cannot understand how he expects that children will not smoke in the first instance or, if they are smoking, that they will discontinue the practice.  It is totally unreasonable of the Minister to expect children or adults not to smoke or, if they smoke, to discontinue, in a situation where they are continually encouraged to smoke by newspaper and radio advertisements, by advertisements in magazines and by various poster advertisements throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> The Minister is well aware that this promotion of cigarettes is going on.  He has accepted the suggestion that a notice be carried on the cartons warning people of the dangers of cigarette smoking&mdash;this has been done in the United States since 1964.  In our Bill we have suggested that all advertisements in regard to tobacco products shall contain the information that cigarette smoking is a danger to health. In fact, I do not think the advertisements should be permitted.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an agreed Bill among people of different views and I was very glad to get the co-operation of my colleagues in Fine Gael on the understanding that we would not ask for too much at this stage.  What we agreed to ask for was a notice on the carton and the notice to be carried in the advertisements. Deputy O'Donovan, Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Barry were right when they suggested that we should suppress advertisements which encourage people to smoke cigarettes. This is the obvious, logical and rational thing to do, but if we fail to do that it is reasonable that the people concerned be asked to carry in their advertisements a notice about the danger to health.</P>
    <P>At column 1906, volume 254 of the Official Report, the Minister expressed his satisfaction at the voluntary agreement. He said that the main intent of our Bill was to provide a warning notice.  Obviously he had not read the Bill because it provided for carrying the notice in the advertisements. However, carrying the warning notice on the cigarette packet has been met by the provisions of the voluntary agreement to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the voluntary agreement by the tobacco companies is adequate because it refuses to face the fact which we know to be true, that the most powerful single advertisement for cigarette smoking, the most compelling and compulsive advertisement, is the parent, the teacher, the cleric or the admired person on television who smokes.</P>
    <P>I have given figures to show that <Col N="252" /> the child of parents who smoke is much more likely to smoke than the child of parents who are non-smokers; the figures are 24 per cent where parents are non-smokers and 44 per cent where both parents smoke.  The Minister and the tobacco companies ignore the well-established fact that the whole process of personality formation of a growing child or a young adolescent in society is an imitative one.  It is seen in the behaviour of the child in many ways. The child of parents who smack him will in turn smack another child.  The child of parents who follow a particular sport tends to follow the same sport.  We know that in politics children tend to follow the political background of their parents.  This is so widely accepted as the process of maturation, the growth of an individual child in society, that it does not need to be emphasised.</P>
    <P>The individual is an amalgam of the mother and the father, an amalgam of their standards, their values, their customs, their practices, their behaviour, their attitude to life.  The individual growing up in a family assumes these values.  Therefore the child is the product of the home, the product of the adult, the teacher, the cleric, the politician, the sportsman, the sports idol, the pop idol, or whoever the child happens to admire.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that the Minister is wrong in his failure to accept this a a fact, as a reality.  He must direct his attention to the adult and not only to the child.  He must not ignore the adult.  As I showed last night, he is quite wrong in dismissing the adult as a person it is possible to help to stop smoking cigarettes.  There is a big difference between the person who has a systemic dependence on drugs like heroin, or opium, or morphia, and so on, and the person who is dependent on cigarettes.  It is relatively easy to give up cigarette smoking compared with giving up heroin, or morphia, or opium, or any of the other hard drugs.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the Minister is completely authoritarian in telling these unfortunate people that they must stop taking their LSD, or their amphetamine, <Col N="253" /> or their opium, or their heroin, which are really hard to give up because people become physically dependent on them and simply cannot give them up.  Yet I am sure that very soon we will have laws brought in here advocating punitive provisions of one kind or another for the people who use these drugs and for the people who peddle the drugs, the pushers.  The Minister is completely irrational, completely unreasonable, in his whole approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>It is possible, generally speaking, as we have shown, if the information is made available to people of a particular educational or intellectual level, for them to give up cigarette smoking. We showed that in relation to the medical profession, in relation to the clerical, administrative and professional staff in Edinburgh University, and in relation to men and women in the United States, where one in three men and one in four women have given up cigarette smoking.  We have heard it here from various Deputies who said that because they were convinced by the information at their disposal they were able to give up this habit.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, if the proper educational process were followed by the Minister, if he were to suppress advertisements in favour of cigarette smoking and to begin an educational drive against cigarette smoking, together with the programme directed towards children, in a matter of time &mdash;and it would take time&mdash;we would start to see results.</P>
    <P>The code for the advertising of cigarettes is so much humbug.  It starts by saying that persons featured in advertisements should be obviously over 21 years of age and goes on to say that advertisements should not convey the impression that to be grown up one should smoke cigarettes.  Does the Minister not see the complete conflict between these two proposals in the code?  Nobody in the advertisement must be under 21 years of age&mdash;I agree with that&mdash;but everybody appearing in the advertisement must be adult, must be grown up.  This is the very thing we are talking about.  Because they are grown up, it is the grown up thing to smoke cigarettes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> The tobacco companies have been given the Minister's authority to circulate to all who care to read the advertisements that the grown up thing is to smoke cigarettes, that it is not a young person's habit but a grown up person's habit.  All of us who have been children, adolescents and young adults, know that we spent our lives trying to grow up, trying to become adult, trying to appear to be adult.  That was the greatest ambition of our lives.  One of the manifestations of adulthood, according to the tobacco manufacturers, is to smoke cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Most of the advertisements have an underlying sexual motif, the whole phallic symbolism of the cigarette, the whole suggestion that in some way it is a virility symbol and that, in spite of what the Minister says, there is a romantic connotation at the back of nearly all cigarette advertising.  Adults appear in all the advertisements as cigarette smokers and therefore it is an adult habit.  That is to be established by the tobacco companies with the full authority and blessing of the Minister for Health.  He establishes that for children.</P>
    <P>Then there is the absurd proposal that the advertisements should not over-emphasise the pleasure of smoking, that they should not emphasise inhalation or exhalation and that they should not exaggerate the enjoyment of smoking through facial expression or copy.  That is completely meaningless. If you are trying to sell a product, you try to make it an attractive product to buy.  That is what the tobacco manufacturers insist shall happen.  The overriding instruction they give to the advertising companies is: &ldquo;See that they buy this product.  Make it as attractive as you can to smoke cigarettes.&rdquo;  Therefore the idea of underemphasising or overemphasising the pleasure of cigarette smoking is completely meaningless.</P>
    <P>The code says that advertisements should not present young people in romantic situations in a manner which would obviously tie the enjoyment of smoking to the pleasures of the situations. For example, advertisements should not suggest that a young couple <Col N="255" /> are alone but there is no objection, apparently, to having a middleaged couple, or people over 21 years, in a romantic situation, or alone, with whatever ideas they might have in their mind alone and in romantic situations and smoking cigarettes.  That is not objected to by the code approved of by the Minister for Health.  So the code advocates the idea that if you are an adult, if you are grown up, you smoke and when you are grown up and smoke, you will find yourself in romantic situations and these romantic situations can lead to wonderful results.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister saw through the transparent hypocrisy of this whole advertising code by the tobacco manufacturers?</P>
    <P>No advertising should be placed in school, college, or university media or in comics or comic supplements directed to youth.</P>
    <P>Again, the dishonesty of this proposal. The daily paper, presumably, goes into every college and school.  Weekly papers, news magazines, all the hoardings carrying advertisements, are all available outside schools.  Colleges or universities have access to all of the magazines and all of the newspapers carrying these advertisements advocating that the grown up thing to do is to smoke.  Is there any youngster now who does not carry a transistor set and who, therefore, is not accessible to the tobacco manufacturers and their advertisements?</P>
    <P>These proposals here are not worth the paper they are written on.  They are a complete hoax and the Minister knows they are a hoax and he is party to the hoax.  It is disgraceful behaviour on his part that as Minister for Health he should ask this House for money to spend on dim and equivocal advertisements, at best, I think they could be called, in magazines and newspapers while at the same time tolerating a deluge of very powerful propaganda by the tobacco companies directed at these same youngsters and adults, of course, whom he purports to be attempting, and he now knows unsuccessfully, to stop smoking cigarettes in <Col N="256" /> the first instance.  The figures show he has failed in his programme.</P>
    <P>Then there is the odd provision:</P>
    <P>All current advertising and new advertising, before it appears, to be submitted to an administrator who will determine whether the advertising copy complies with the terms of this code of standards.  The manufacturers have named a senior counsel to be administrator and have agreed to accept his decision as final.</P>
    <P>Imagine a Minister for Health accepting that absurd provision as a safeguard for the establishment of a code, allowing the criminal to appoint the judiciary.  Could it be worse?</P>
    <P>Would it not be interesting to know how many of these proposals put forward have been turned down by this senior counsel who is an administrator and what, anyway, does a senior counsel know about the real process of advertising, of selling a product?  What does he know about subliminal advertisements? What does he know about the appeals to the unconscious drives which are to be found in all of these tobacco advertisements, usually sexual drives of one kind or another, which appear in all of these advertisements and the way in which the message is conveyed in the advertisement?  Certainly, there is no message conveyed that this could give you cancer of the lung.  Certainly, you are not told that you can get a coronary from smoking cigarettes.  You are certainly not told that you could be disabled, invalided, for whatever life you have left to you, from emphysema or bronchitis and that the average individual over 30 who smokes 15 cigarettes a day loses at least five years of his life, on average.  None of that is contained in these advertisements.</P>
    <P>Is that fair to the person who is paying for the cigarettes?  Should he not be told this?  Is this not deliberately misleading by the process of <i>suppressio veri,</i> this refusal to tell the truth? This is all done with the full consent and authority of a Minister for Health who knows full well all the implications of cigarette smoking in a community such as ours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> The Minister will not accept our proposal that the advertisements should carry this, admittedly very weak, notice which he has agreed to put on the cartons.  He says he is disinclined to use any element of compulsion whatsoever.  The whole history of control of drugs is littered with legislation, laws and enactments all containing compulsion of one kind or another and punitive clauses of one kind or another.  Indeed, section 65 of the 1947 Health Act contains a provision for a £500 fine for refusing to obey a ministerial order about advertising something which is effectively poisonous to the individual who consumes it.  Very dictatorial the Minister can be at time but where the powerful, wealthy, vested interests, the tobacco company, friends of his, are concerned, the Minister's moral attitudes are completely suppressed, the moral values that he prates about here when he is bringing in laws about the other, what he calls, dangerous drugs. Instead, his whole approach to this very dangerous, serious problem in our society is to put a warning notice on cigarette packets.</P>
    <P>On 27th May, 1970, he said:</P>
    <P>I have already considered the question of a warning notice on cigarette packets.  I do not see myself readily departing from the view I have already expressed to the House that it is essentially a futile gesture.</P>
    <P>Taken on its own, of course, it is a futile gesture and that is why the Minister is doing it, because he knows it will not have any effect on its own.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that it is out of the question to attempt to suppress cigarette smoking by ministerial order or Government order.  Having accepted that, the alternative is, of course, very much more complicated and it does not simply boil down to a notice on a packet and then in ten years time the Minister will tell us that this was an absurd proposal and that we should never have done it because it has had no effect.</P>
    <P>Even the minimal measures taken by the United States, Canada, New Zealand and other countries, and by <Col N="258" /> Britain to a lesser extent, have shown some effects but they have been minimal, the problem being, of course, one of revenue.  What is needed is an understanding of the problem, the seriousness of the adult's contribution to the problem of smoking among children and information based on the factors which influenced the rest of us, particularly doctors, whatever it was that made us stop smoking in spite of the difficulty of doing so, and the devising of some scheme based on those findings. It must be possible to find out why it was that we very ordinary mortals were frightened into giving up smoking or not smoking at all as is happening now among younger doctors.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that this is a problem that has been seriously tackled by virtually nobody.  I do not care what he may say, I think all he is doing now is paying lip service to the idea of dealing with the problem of cigarette smoking.  Imagine the position if our daily newspapers, our radio service, magazines of various kinds, carried advertisements for marijuana, opium, LSD or amphetamines. It is completely unthinkable, even to the Minister, that this could happen, that he would allow this and then expect people not to use these drugs.  That is precisely what he is doing in regard to the use of cigarettes. At present the unfortunate individual who is still a cigarette smoker finds that the case is made only for cigarette smokers, that the Minister for Health, knowing more about this than any of the rest of us, he certainly ought to, has the direct responsibility of doing something about it and he is doing nothing.</P>
    <P>I believe the least the Minister should do is accept this Bill.  As has been said somewhere, it would at least give an indication that we are serious in our concern and that we are determined to take positive action to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I once again ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude to the second proposal in our Bill and to accept it in the way that it is in the Bill.</P>

      <P>My colleagues in the Labour Party and I are, I suppose, technically asking for the permission of the House to have published a Bill to provide for votes at 18 years of age. The Minister for Local Government indicated last week, or the week before, that the Government had no intention of allowing the Bill to be published. This has been the regrettable practice of Government Ministers for quite a long time.  We saw this particularly in the case of the Bill promoted by Deputy Dr. Browne and others where the Government would not allow the initiative to lie with individual Opposition members in Private Members' Time.  As I said in a short intervention last night the Government should have more respect for the rights of private individuals and Opposition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ours is a simple proposition.  I do not know why the Government are reluctant to accept it.  If they want to show goodwill as regards the local government elections in this matter they could introduce a Bill which, I am sure, would pass in record time providing for votes at 18 in such elections. <Col N="262" /> The proposal to grant votes to those aged 18 would, as regards general elections and referenda, necessitate a change in the Constitution which would require a referendum.  Again, there seems to be reluctance by the House and by the Government to allow the ordinary people to be involved in decision-making. We should not be deterred by the fact that this change would necessitate a referendum.  It could be done quickly and would not involve much expense either to the State or the political parties because I believe, from an interjection by the Minister for Local Government a week or two ago, that it will be done.  We do not know whether it will be done this year, in five years time, or in 15 years time. I suggest to the Minister and the Government that there is now urgency in the matter of granting votes at 18.  I believe it should be done particularly before the referendum is held on the Government's application for EEC membership.  We must remember that the young people about whom we now speak, aged between 18 and 21, are the people who will have to live and work within the system, whatever it may be, whether we join the EEC or not, and who will have to work in a world that is undoubtedly changing very rapidly.</P>
    <P>These people should participate in such a momentous decision as whether or not Ireland should become a full member of EEC.  There are 170,000 of these people to whom the franchise could be given if our proposal were accepted.  It should not be a difficult or expensive operation because I believe it coincides with the general concensus of opinion among the parties in the House and among the people. Some time ago I asked during a debate why the age of 21 was fixed and it was said it was fixed arbitrarily many years ago.  It was the age at which it was believed young people reached maturity.  But I see nothing sacrosanct about the age 21.  I am informed by one of my colleagues that the 21st was a very significant year in the life of males particularly in mediaeval times: it was the age when they were deemed fit to bear arms for the lord of the manor or whoever would lead them into battle.</P>
    <P>The age of 21 for the franchise has <Col N="263" /> been accepted for a long time but not any longer by many countries including some of the European countries. For example, in Belgium in municipal elections those aged 18 or over are allowed to vote.  In Germany, the vote is given at 18; in Sweden, it is 19; in the United Kingdom it is 18 and also in the USA.  In the last British general election the 18-year-olds voted for the first time.  In the presidential election and, I assume, in elections for Congress and the Senate in the USA, those of 18 and over will vote.  Nobody could say now that to give votes at 18 would be giving votes to those who might be deemed to be irresponsible particularly when we recall the result of the last general election in Britain which returned the Conservative Government.</P>
    <P>There is an unanswerable case for our proposition due to changes in the living habits of younger people, and the more general education of young people.  It is now recognised that restricting the vote to those who are 21 and over is unfair and unjust.  In modern times&mdash;and the evidence is all around us&mdash;young people mature earlier, physically and mentally.  These factors must be considered.  Earlier maturity is demonstrated by the participation of young people in various movements.  Some will say these are mostly protest movements but in many cases&mdash;and again there is evidence of this not only here but all over the world&mdash;they protest in very many cases for just and positive causes and against powerful social injustices.  I would interpret the activities of these people as a longing for participation and that longing for participation should, in my view, be channelled properly.  Young people should be allowed to vote at 18 to bring them within the democratic process. If we do not do that, then there is no use our condemning them and describing them as irresponsible.  We advocate votes at 18 so that these young people will be involved, so that they will not be, as they are in so many cases, frustrated.</P>
    <P>I have said that they are more mature. It should also be recognised that there is an injustice towards these young <Col N="264" /> people when we remember that the vast majority are workers and are paying taxes.  Some of them are married and have the responsibilities of adulthood.  They pay income tax.  They pay other forms of taxation.  They pay rates.  Surely they should be given the right to choose those who should represent them in Dáil Éireann, those who become Ministers and members of Government, those who levy the taxes they are required to pay and those who make the laws they are expected to obey.  If they have responsibilities then they should be treated responsibly.</P>
    <P>There is a special case here in this part of the country for granting the vote at 18.  Their counterparts in Britain can vote at 18.  So can their counterparts in Northern Ireland.  To refuse to lower the age here is to maintain still another barrier between the two parts of our country.  This is a barrier that could easily be removed if the Government would agree to accept this Bill and provide for the necessary constitutional change.  Again, a person can be 23, 24 or 25 years of age before he gets his first opportunity to vote.  This is a source of annoyance, especially when one remembers the responsibilities these people have.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this change in the Constitution should be considered with other changes in the Constitution. To that I say an emphatic &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We are pressing for a new Constitution.  If we make what I hope will be a dramatic change in our Constitution these people should be involved in that change.  It is approximately 36 years since we had an opportunity of adapting the Constitution under which we operate.  Surely we are not going to deny the right of these young people to have a say in what should go into our Constitution or what should be deleted from it.</P>

      <P>That is a purely relative term.  However, I will be as brief as I can.  I describe this Bill as non-controversial. Obviously the Government intend to put this on the long <Col N="265" /> finger.  Young people should be given the right to vote, first, on a new Constitution and, secondly, on the question as to whether or not we should become full members of the EEC.  If we deny them that right that will be interpreted by our youth as a sign of total indifference to their needs and feelings.

      <P>The aggravating thing is that on each occasion they have decided that this is something they want to do themselves and they will not let anyone else do it.  If the Minister says that the Government propose in this session to introduce the necessary legislation for votes at 18 we will have nothing to say.  We will be quite satisfied.  But there is a dog-in-the-manger attitude on the part of the Government; they will not do it themselves and they will not let anybody else do it.</P>

      <P>Last week the Minister and, on an earlier occasion, the Taoiseach said that they agreed with the idea of votes at 18.  Why would they not?  Youngsters at the moment are required to do practically everything from 17 years of age onwards.  They can carry arms to defend their country at 17.  There is, of course, an anomaly; 21 is the age for voting but the register is made up in the previous September. Those who are 21 before the 14th of April are entitled to vote on or after that date when the new register comes out, but that means that, until after the 14th April in the following year, the life of that register runs and if an election takes place in early spring they cannot vote and they will be 22 <Col N="266" /> years, or perhaps more, before they get an opportunity of voting.  If they are not around when the register is made up they could be 24 or 25 before they get an opportunity of voting. These young people are asked to carry a great many responsibilities and to do all kinds of work but they are not allowed to vote.</P>
      <P>People are talking about the relevancy of this House and saying that Dáil Éireann is no longer the most important place in which decisions are made.  In the light of that, surely we should bring in these young people and give them the right to say who comes in here.  Even if they replace everyone here with the people of their own choice they are entitled to do that. It is ridiculous that people who are adults in everything except this are refused the right to vote.  Simple legislation would entitle these people to vote in local elections and the Taoiseach agreed that should be done, but he does not propose to introduce that legislation this year.  Why?</P>

      <P>There are people who go around the country talking about how irresponsible young people are.  I do not think they are irresponsible.  A certain few, as in every country, are irresponsible because they can point to the fact that they are not entitled to participate in the formation of a government or in the election of representatives unfortunately they are able to influence others who would normally be prepared to look in a reasonable way at what is being done.  For that reason it would help in the stability of our society if we gave the vote at 18 years.</P>
      <P>I can see no reason why it should be denied except that the Minister and the Government say they want to do it.  Deputy Corish referred to the fact that the Common Market vote will be taken this year.  The people most affected will be the young people.  They will have to live with the situation long after we are gone and it is right that they should be allowed to cast their vote with regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions we have <Col N="267" /> heard about the necessity of having young blood in government.  One cannot expect that there would be many young people in government when we are preventing those who have the most agile minds from voting&mdash;the 18 to 21 year olds.  We are not giving them any voice in the election of their representatives. There would be a tremendous change in political parties and in the political life of this country if we gave young people the right to vote.  There is nothing controversial about it; it is a simple matter of commonsense and I should like to hear the Minister explain to the House why he thinks we should not allow votes at 18.  I propose to give the Minister the opportunity of explaining this to the House; he has slightly more than 15 minutes in which he can decide whether this can be done.</P>
    <P>We have been speaking about a new Constitution.  I assume from what has been said by the Minister and by the Taoiseach that it is not proposed to change the voting age before the changes in the Constitution have taken place.  Does that mean that with regard to the new Constitution the people of 18 years will be deprived of voting? The Minister shakes his head.  Are we to assume that we will have votes at 18 years introduced almost immediately, or are we to assume that the new Constitution is a long way distant?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this proposal. At the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis in 1965 the party unanimously accepted the proposition that votes should be given to people at 18 years.  In fact, we were the first political party to do this and we made the suggestion before the British took up the idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why the Government are opposing this proposal.  At times they have given lip-service to it.  We understand, of course, that as a party they always resist any proposal coming from this side of the House and then when they see the idea is acceptable they introduce it themselves at a later stage.  There may be a second reason for their refusal in this instance, namely, they may be afraid.  Youth abhors equivocation. <Col N="268" /> Youth is generous but it will not be generous when it comes to judge Fianna Fáil.  That is primarily the reason the Minister wants to put off the evil day when he will have to face the people of 18 years.  It is not easy to change an old person but youth is adaptable.  I believe that the youth have learned to judge Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil have learned to judge youth.</P>
    <P>As mentioned by Deputy Corish and Deputy Tully, people at 18 years accept all the responsibilities of adult life.  Many of them have to work when they are 16 years, they have to pay for their social welfare cards, they have to pay income tax and they are eligible for military service.  If conscription were introduced in the morning, as has been rumoured, they would be conscripted.  They have to do all these things but they are not allowed any voice in the government of this country.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about youth being difficult.  Every generation complains about the young people; they say they are not responsible.  We have had a spate of such remarks here.  We all recognise that the best way to deal with anyone who is considered irresponsible is to give him responsibility.  When Fianna Fáil came into this House they were an irresponsible party.  We gave them responsibility, we civilised and tamed them.  Now they are the greatest exponents of law and order in the country.  In fact, they are a bit of an embarrassment they are so strong on the subject, at least they have been in the last few hours.</P>

      <P>Adolescent unrest, which can manifest itself in any society, is best dealt with by giving the adolescent an opportunity to participate in the ordinary affairs of his country, by allowing him to vote in a disciplined fashion.  The alternative is that he will be tempted to indulge in less lawful methods of expressing his point of view.  Nowadays, votes at 18 years are accepted in all the more modern states <Col N="269" /> and it is only right that we should extend the same advantages to our own citizens.</P>
      <P>Article 16.1.1º of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of 21 years, and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by this Constitution or by law, shall be eligible for membership of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I do not know if that means that it needs an alteration in the Constitution in order to give the vote at 18 years. Doubtless the Minister will have legal opinion on this matter and I imagine legal opinion will be that it needs an alteration of the Constitution.  As a layman it appears to me that it does not state this is a constitutional issue. However, doubtless the Minister will give us the views of the Attorney General or whoever advises him on these matters.  This is a very important subject. I do not know what percentage of the population would be covered by people of 18 to 21 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are practical reasons why I have to oppose this Bill at this time.  The House knows that the <Col N="270" /> Government have already announced that they are in favour of reducing the voting age to 18 years for all elections, and that the question will be referred to the people in a referendum.  Deputies opposite quite conveniently made very little reference to the fact that a referendum is necessary to decide this matter.  It is now clear that all parties are in agreement with the Government on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be possible then for all parties to unite in advising the people to vote in favour of the necessary changes in the Constitution to bring this about.  I must oppose the introduction of the Bill at this time.  I want the House to listen carefully.  I have not got much time to deal with it.  If this Bill were passed by both Houses, I would be required to make an order under the Referendum Acts fixing a date for the taking of a referendum which would have to be held between 30 and 90 days from the date of the making of that order.</P>
      <P>Obviously difficulty would arise immediately in relation to the timing of such a referendum.  The referendum on accession to the European Communities will be held shortly.  As far as this House can foresee that is a fact.  The people will be voting in that referendum on a question of fundamental importance for the future of this country and all its citizens.  It is obvious from the debate on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill that all sides of the House are anxious that this very important issue should be put before the people in a clear and unambiguous way and that anything which might tend to complicate or confuse the issue in the minds of the electorate should be avoided.  The House will agree that there can be no question of having a referendum on any other matter on the same day as the EEC referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be practicable to hold a referendum on the voting age before the EEC referendum. <Col N="271" /> It would be quite unreasonable to put the Government, the Opposition parties, and the electorate, to the expense and the inconvenience of a second referendum very shortly after the EEC referendum.  The holding of a referendum on the voting age should not be considered just now.  It would be inappropriate for the House to discuss another Constitution Amendment Bill at this time.  Time and again in this House and elsewhere, Opposition speakers, opponents and supporters of EEC membership, have emphasised the gravity of the decision the people are being asked to take in relation to the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote, if I may, statements made by the leaders of both Opposition parties.  As reported at column 1111, Volume 257, of the Official Report of the debate on 2nd December, 1971, Deputy Cosgrave said:</P>
      <P>At the outset I want it to be clearly understood that we favour a referendum.  We have consistently expressed the view that the people must decide the issue.  Consequently, we approve the task of putting clearly before the electorate in simple language a single question....</P>
      <P>As reported at column 1374 of the same volume Deputy Corish said:</P>
      <P>One of the few merits I see in this proposed referendum is that it is being presented on its own, not tied up, I hope, with local elections or a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>So, quite rightly, they have been anxious to ensure that this issue will be put to the people in as clear and unambiguous a way as possible in order to avoid misleading the people or confusing them.  The question which must be asked on the ballot paper in the coming EEC referendum is: &ldquo;Do you approve the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?&rdquo; The short title of the Bill, that is, the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1971, will be printed immediately beneath that question.  The ballot <Col N="272" /> paper cannot contain any explanation or summary of the proposal contained in the Bill.  There can be nothing on the ballot paper to show that it relates to the question of accession to the European Economic Community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that point.  It has been argued that accession to the Community will affect young people to a greater degree than any other category and that they should be allowed to vote in the referendum. Even if the present Bill were accepted, 18 year olds could not vote in the EEC referendum because they could not be put on the register until the people approved, in a referendum, of a reduction in the voting age.  If the people approved the reduction in the voting age, in a referendum, the names of persons aged 18 to 21 years would not be on the new register which will come into force in April next.</P>

Very shortly after my appointment I put it on the record of the House that I was in favour of reducing the voting age to 18 years.  In all the circumstances I think the House should not give consent to the First Reading of this Bill at this time.  As soon as it is practicable I will introduce a Bill to do exactly what is proposed in this Bill in relation to reducing the voting age from 21 to 18 years.</P>

      <P>When we adjourned this aspect of our discussion I had been putting some questions, one of which concerned the question of the degree of responsibility which our educational system might have for certain social and political developments, including the growth among a section of the young people of the belief that Ireland could be united by the gun and the bomb and should be so united. I asked the question whether the seeds of Aldershot might have been planted in an Irish classroom, a very serious question.  In the interval while other things were being discussed here, the point was put to me by some Deputies that far from this being the case, since it appears that one particular group, the so-called Official IRA, were responsible for this, since they were Marxist oriented, this was not a case of anything growing out of our society, but of alien infection from outside our society altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take that point but I do not accept it.  I do not think it is actually true. I think that these acts of violence, which are very similar, whoever commits them or whoever claims them, grow out of the one ground, which is basically that of ultra-nationalism.  It <Col N="276" /> can be dressed up after that in various ways.  It can be dressed up in religious ways, ideological ways, anything you like, but it grows out of the idea of legitimate hatred of the foreigner.  That is the common ground and I would make very little of the distinction between the various groups.  It would not be proper that we should attempt to discuss the differences between such groups here.</P>

That and only that is what I am discussing.  I am not discussing the Official IRA, the Provisional IRA, their sympathisers in this House, except as regards what we are breeding or may be breeding in our schools.</P>
      <P>I pass from that because I respect your judgment, even a hint of your judgment here.  I shall pass to some other considerations which are related because I think the fact that in some of our schools, by some of our teachers, a narrow, rigid, intolerant nationalism is being produced, is related to other things about how the machine works.  We remember some things which have been said about such a machine.  One question that arises is how far are our schools preparing our young people for life in the modern world, because if you shut people into a narrow nationalist ideology you are not preparing them for life in the modern world, you are shutting them off from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that some interesting people like the late Evelyn Waugh, like W. B. Yeats, have questioned philosophically the idea that people should be prepared for life in the modern world.  Evelyn Waugh said he <Col N="277" /> could imagine nothing more wicked than for a teacher to prepare young people for life in the modern world. W. B. Yeats urged that people generally should not be taught to read and write but should be taught arts like curry-combing and playing on the swifle, whatever the swifle may be.  These are interesting ways of playing with ideas but in fact young people have to be prepared for life in the modern world because that is the only world they are to have a chance of living in and, in particular, when a great majority in this House are urging that we enter I will not say Europe but the expanded European Economic Community, I do not think it is quite enough to say: &ldquo;We ought to learn some French and may be a little German.  These ought to be encouraged.&rdquo;  More serious things are happening.  The general rate, type and intensity of our education are likely to be put to the test whether we go into this Community or whether we keep out of it.  They will be put to the test not just in terms of technical competence in French, German or whatever it is, but in ability to think. The question is: are our schools, comparable with European schools, equipping people to think?  I would accept the point that people cannot be taught to think.  No one person can teach another person to think.  It may not be entirely true, I am not sure how far this is in conformity with what modern educationalists believe, but I do know, because we see it around us every day, that whether people can be taught to think or not they can be taught not to think, they can be discouraged from thinking.  To what extent in our schools, other schools too, but it is our schools we are concerned with, are people daily being discouraged from thinking?</P>
    <P>There is a word, much in use in the 19th century, less now, the word docile&rdquo;, which is often praised by educators, and is supposed to mean &ldquo;capable of being taught&rdquo;, &ldquo;amenable to teaching&rdquo;.  In our daily usage it is interpreted as meaning a person who will do what he is told.  That is a docile person.  It can be argued that there is a real contradiction, that the person who does what he is told without question, and does that regularly <Col N="278" /> and always, is the person least capable of being taught, least capable of beginning to think.  I suspect that that idea of docility, of reception of a statement, writing it down and taking it as true, is more generalised in our schools than in other schools in northwestern Europe or on the other side of the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Here I should like to refer to a great influence now passing from the scene of our educational world in this part of Ireland, the retiring Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. McQuaid.  I want to refer to him with the greatest personal respect because he is a man who throughout his life acted consistently with what he believed to be true, and fearlessly so and I hope it may be given to the rest of us to be able to say that in our retirement as he can say it.  But I want also to ask this: can anyone who knew Dr. McQuaid, who even read those pungent, unmistakable short epistles of his, think that children brought up under that aegis, even under that remote shadow as it was for most of them, were encouraged to think for themselves, to ask questions and then come back with more questions?  I do not think so; I do not think that is how it was.  That is how it may be and I think the changes that are coming and that are needed in education cannot be taken in isolation and as part of the State sector, leaving the ecclesiastical sector, the religious sector, apart.  The changes have to come and I believe are coming all over, and here I want to say I think this is really very important&mdash;that what happens when children are discouraged from asking questions, which has been a large part of the history of our education, discouraged sometimes by the slap, the slap which was described, first of all, as being, and then later on as not being, for failure at lessons, could often be for being too inconveniently bright and asking the wrong questions. I have heard examples of that and I believe them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton, in his very interesting remarks in detail&mdash;I may be wrong but so it seemed to me&mdash;took a rather patronising attitude towards the abilities of human beings generally. He defined them down&mdash;people, in his <Col N="279" /> opinion, were generally well below&mdash; he inferred and, I think, implied, tremendously below&mdash;the level of ability of Deputy FitzGerald.  Deputy FitzGerald is a very able man, probably the most able man in this Assembly and we all have learned greatly from him, but he also is a man who has had great advantages.  He was himself highly educated, born of highly educated parents and brought up by them.  We do not know what a Garret FitzGerald would be like with the same innate intelligence, born in poverty and brought up by teachers who, because themselves confused, were confusing.  It might be that even with the fine intelligence such a man has, he would appear a not very intelligent person as a result of what he had been through.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to seem to criticise adversely Deputy Clinton's speech which I admire, but he seemed to be limiting the possibilities of human beings and to be limiting them in a particular way, because when you are saying that most people are pretty stupid and maybe it is better that they stay that way&mdash;there was an undercurrent of that, even if not so expressed&mdash;in saying that, the people you mainly have in mind whom you are discussing, are people who have not had the basic educational opportunities in the home and school and you are ruling them out and pushing them down.  I think it is the wrong approach in that what we should be looking for is the possibility of liberating the intellectual and spiritual power which is latent in people but which you cannot define in advance. You cannot say in advance that that man is a stupid man and, therefore, you give him a stupid education and still less can you say that a group of people&mdash;and this is implicit in that argument&mdash;are likely to be stupid so give them the education that befits stupid people.  We do not altogether say that but there is a vestige of that in it.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the system has such and such defects but that it is what the people want.  Is it?  I should like to ask questions about that.  This is a very general assumption which I <Col N="280" /> think inhibits our debates a lot.  There are two things I should like to cite here.  One is drawn from Northern Ireland, for which we are constitutionally responsible, and it is an interesting thing found by Professor Richard Rose who wrote a book with which many Deputies, and, perhaps, all, are familiar, <i>Governing Without Consent</i>, which is a study based on a very careful and sophisticated sample of opinions there.  This was at a time, 1968, when on the whole, the Northern Catholic bishops were saying that our people want separate education, that they want Catholic education and do not want mixed education.  They are still saying it to a great extent, but they said it on behalf of our people, the Catholic people of Northern Ireland.  The survey shows the reverse; it shows that by quite a considerable majority the people wanted integrated education, wanted Catholics and Protestants to be educated together, which is a very interesting fact, considering the relations between Catholics and Protestants there which, of course, are far more tense and charged than they are here.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on the affairs of my own constituency&mdash;it is not appropriate that I should do so in this debate, but at the same time these matters are close&mdash;and I should like to refer to a meeting in the middle of this month in my constituency, in Kilbarrack. The Minister knows all about it.  It was a crowded meeting, with hundreds of people present.  The people concerned were parents, from the Kilbarrack area, with about 17 or 18 different associations of parents represented. They were concerned about two things.  One was whether there would be the actual educational facilities for their children as they grew up in this expanding area.  Two officials of the Minister's Department attended, and it was a very good thing that they should attend, and answered questions. One of them referred to the educational situation in expanding Dublin as frightening and this is an aspect on which the Dublin Deputies, probably all of them, would like to hear more comment from the Minister, the problems of education in this city expanding at a frightening rate.  What does the <Col N="281" /> future hold for people, because parents are very anxious about this in terms of any kind of education being available for them?</P>
    <P>The particular point I want to make is that they were asked at this overflow meeting in a not untypical outlying area of Dublin city: what kind of schools do you want?  They voted by a show of hands in favour of non-denominational, co-educational schools.  I do not know whether their wishes will be taken into account to any degree.  There was present the headmaster of one school, Sutton Park School, which is very near me.  I believe this is a Protestant or Church of Ireland school.  He reported and I quote from the newspapers:</P>
    <P>The headmaster of Sutton Park School, Mr. R. Gahan, said the Department had turned down an application to turn the school into a non-denominational one.</P>
    <P>This is very interesting because that is a co-educational school already.  They wanted to turn it into a non-denominational school and make it available in this area where the parents said that what they wanted was a non-denominational, co-educational school.  The Department said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I want to know why the Department said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The officials present could not answer the question or would not.  I hope the Minister will come to this in replying.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister also to realise that this State of ours has become a rather diversified one, that the needs of parents and children in different situations urban and rural are not necessarily always the same and that to decide them by rule of thumb is wrong.  There should be a greater response to local needs, local ideas and to what people say.  As I said at the outset, I am not taking the Minister to task or making any accusations against him.  I think he is doing his best in a situation which he has inherited. I think we are right to criticise him and his Department and that we are also right to recognise that he has made a good deal of progress and, in these discussions we are having here, <Col N="282" /> perhaps more progress will emerge.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald raised the question of people who are a bit ahead of what is supposed to be their intellectual age and are ready to move on to the next examination before the Department says: &ldquo;Move on.&rdquo;  I am very confused about this.  I took up this matter in relation to a pupil in my constituency who was brought to my attention and eventually the Department allowed her to proceed, possibly unconnected with my representations. She did extremely well and continues to do extremely well.  Last week I heard of another pupil apparently in an identical situation who was told there were no exceptions to this rule; there you are and there you stay and until you reach a certain age you cannot be allowed to proceed.  I think that is very unfair.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton suggested that, perhaps, we pay too much attention to intelligent children.  It seems to me the educational system is based on a certain amount of respect for children just below average.  They are the ones who best fit into the sausage machine and come out in the neatest case at the other end.  The people who run into trouble with it are either those who are well above average or below it. Both are told: &ldquo;We do not cater for you; we have only time for this particular type.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer briefly to the question of the Irish language and Dunquin school, as a symbol.  The Minister delivered his entire speech in Irish.  That is all right&mdash;or is it?  It is a little artificial in a Parliament whose proceedings are overwhelmingly carried out in English, particularly when they are mostly intensely political and most meaningful.  In a way, this is a kind of liturgic language the Minister is using when he speaks Irish for this particular purpose.  I should be happier, as would most people who are concerned with the Irish language and the state of the Gaeltacht, if the Minister spoke in English, the language we are all using in the remainder of the debate, but showed real concern for&mdash; I shall not say the people in the Gaeltacht for whom I believe he has concern but I think it is paternalist conpier <Col N="283" /> cern based on what he thinks as the person who knows best&mdash;what they have to say and for what they are asking.</P>
    <P>This is what he has not shown over Dunquin school.  He has believed his own inspectors rather than the parents and has shown very little interest, not merely in what the parents have said&mdash; all right: people say various things&mdash; but for the effort of those parents in keeping that school open.  Granted what that school means to everyone who is concerned with the Irish tradition, it is an exceptional and extraordinary school and there should be room in the Minister's philosophy for a little of the extraordinary and not just for the purely normative and logistic.  I believe it is not in vain to plead with the Minister and I plead that he should look again at this question and say: &ldquo;I thought it might have been the right thing to do.  I thought it was in the interests of the people and the children but I now see they are determined to keep their school open and I respect their determination.&rdquo;  I think he should say that and I hope he will begin to say something like that.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to community schools I think the Minister has changed in an important way what appeared initially to be his line in that respect.  I am not criticising but praising him for that.  That kind of flexibility in the face of criticism is desirable and does nothing but credit to the Minister and his Department.  It would have done both even more credit if instead of taking the slightly petty approach towards criticism which part of the Minister's speech took, he had said: &ldquo;Yes, there was criticism by Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Thornley.  I thought about their criticisms. Some of them were right; some were wrong.  I and the Department reconsidered our ideas in the light of these and other criticisms and then we came up with this.&rdquo;  I think that might be an educational example and I would hope our debates on this issue might be an educational example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on a year of good <Col N="284" /> solid work for education and a year of continued progress in this particular field.  Last year, when the Estimate for the Department of Education was before the House, our minds were preoccupied with teachers' salaries.  We were all very worried about how we would reconcile the three different sections involved.  We realised that parity seemed to be essential but, despite the views of certain people, the Minister reached a solution and I am confident that in the year ahead the few remaining problems left will also be solved.  All the good work done during the year was done in spite of the Opposition.  It is my experience that anything designed for the good of education is hindered in every way by people on the opposite benches, people who hold themselves up as experts on education.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been criticised. Deputy FitzGerald had the cheek to criticise him for, as he alleged, having no policy on education.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien said he believed we had no philosophy in education.  I listened carefully to Deputy FitzGerald.  I heard him say the politician's duty was to satisfy and reconcile.  That sums up Deputy FitzGerald's attitude to the work of a politician and, when we come to examine his blueprint for education, we will, I am quite sure, find he is not prepared to take a stand on anything; he will try to satisfy and reconcile everything.</P>
      <P>Anyone who says we have no policy for education must be living in a world of his own and must be unaware of what is happening.  We have a new curriculum for primary schools.  We have free transport.  We have post-primary education.  We have community schools.  They will affect only a small minority at the outset.  But the real good in all these things, particularly in the community schools, has been shrouded in misrepresentation. We have higher education grants.  We have more schools.  We have more teachers.  We have more money for education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To illustrate how hard it would be for the Minister to reconcile people in this matter, we had an example today of two prominent members on the Fine <Col N="285" /> Gael front bench completely at variance over education.  Deputy Clinton took Deputy FitzGerald to task on the question as to whether it is advisable to cater for individual personalities in education.  Deputy Clinton believes it is.  Deputy FitzGerald was quoted as saying it is not. Then they reached some conclusion that there had been a misquotation in the newspaper and they put their heads together and said it was all right.  That is an example of how hard it is to reconcile views.  When two prominent members of the Fine Gael Party hold irreconcilable views, how much more difficult is it for the Minister to reconcile the views of people all over the country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope you will remain so.  I would appeal to those democratic begrudgers to take their heads out of the sand.  They do not seem to grasp what is happening in education.  They do not seem to realise that Fianna Fáil are giving children an opportunity in education that those in earlier generations never had.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of the new curriculum in the primary school.  This is a liberalisation. It is a big step forward and it will be beneficial to primary education and to education in general.  I like particularly the less rigid timetable.  I appreciate the greater professional freedom given to the teachers.  I can assure the Minister this freedom will not be abused.  The teachers will prove worthy of the trust placed in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as implementing the new curriculum goes, old teachers, like myself, will need to be allowed to work at their own pace.  There is a great deal of goodwill.  I understand there is a proposal to select teachers for familiarisation courses during the summer holidays for a period of three weeks and to allow them five days holidays subsequently. This will not be very acceptable. A course has been held for principal teachers but not many have gone on that course.  It has not proved very effective.  On the other hand, local <Col N="286" /> courses sponsored by teacher organisations at local level have proved both effective and helpful.  No service training should take place during the summer holidays.</P>
    <P>The new curriculum will lead to a very big improvement in education. New subjects will be introduced, such as arts and crafts, and basic skills will be developed.  These will give the children manual dexterity.  The children love these subjects.  The tendency now is to teach children observance of the things around them.  This will lead to the development of the whole person. In the past the teachers told the children; in future the children will find out for themselves.</P>
    <P>The role of inspectors has changed and teachers now find them very helpful. However, I hope there will be no rushing of the transitional period.  It is hard to teach an old dog new tricks. With time and patience we can reap very good results.</P>
    <P>Space will be essential for the new curriculum.  Big classes will be out. There will be group attention and each class will hold five or six groups.  The ideal should be 30 in a class and certainly not more than 36.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his special grant of £55,000 for audiovisual aids.  Further efforts, however, will have to be made to subsidise the provision of all types of aids, such as film strips, and so on.  The setting up of teaching centres is a welcome departure and should prove beneficial to the teachers.  These will cater for all teachers and not just one particular type of teacher.  I know that the INTO will co-operate.  Teachers will be able to swop ideas in these centres.  If the teachers provide the centre, then the Department should pay for it and furnish it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien asked was Aldershot a result of the teaching in our schools.  He feared our schools were turning out little IRA people.  I do not subscribe for a moment to the IRA or their tactics but, remembering that it was the official IRA who claimed responsibility for Aldershot, it would be much more credible to place the blame on those whose philosophy <Col N="287" /> is extreme socialism rather than on the schools of Ireland.  Teachers, both lay and religious, have produced an Irish Ireland which has survived 800 years of persecution, an Ireland that refuses to look upon itself as a part of Britain.  It was the schools which kept alive that spirit which kept us distinct from Britain, which saved us from becoming a mere province of Britain, as the Welsh and Scots did.  There is nothing very wrong with our educational system, nothing very wrong with the system which has produced a country with a decent set of values. Those of our people who live abroad and who come back here all maintain that this country is the best country in which to rear a family.  From his experience in Ghana and the United States, does Deputy Cruise-O'Brien think that those countries have a better type of pupil than the child who obtains his education in Ireland?</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal regarding the library service to primary schools and I am pleased to say that my own county has availed of the service.  It is much appreciated and I compliment the Kildare County Council and the county librarian for their interest in this scheme.  However, even though the grant available is matched by the county council it is inadequate and it is not possible to extend the service to the entire county.  If money can be found I would ask that the scope of the scheme be extended.  We realise that books are a necessity with regard to the new curriculum and the present grant is not sufficient for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Last week a question was asked regarding the pupil/teacher ratio in schools.  It was mentioned that in more than 1,000 city schools there were classes with 50 or more pupils.  This information was the cause of consternation to Deputies opposite.  I agree that 50 children in a class is undesirable but there is something even more undesirable, namely, for a teacher to be forced to teach in a schoolroom with four classes.  I have taught in many national schools and I realise what it means to try to teach four classes in a two-teacher school.  I compliment the Minister on his programme <Col N="288" /> of amalgamation and I am glad to see that it is proceeding.</P>
    <P>In my own parish there is a proposal to amalgamate a local school.  In all country areas there will be a resistance to change.  I would remind those Deputies who interest themselves in matters such as this that the greatest disservice they can do is to advise the local people to resist such amalgamations. There will always be a Montpelier or a Dún Chaoin for those last and lingering troubadours who were in this House earlier this evening.  They are always ready to make a political parade to embarrass the Government despite the effect on the children.</P>
    <P>With regard to post-primary education, we can claim credit for the fact that more children now avail of post-primary education than at any stage in our history.  If any proof were needed of the soundness of our policy it is in this fact.  Fianna Fáil have changed the concept of post-primary education.  No longer does a parent's means decide the scope of the child's education.  We have provided that every child can utilise fully the brains with which he is endowed and the parent's lack of money does not prevent a child from getting an education.  I am confident that the parents of Ireland appreciate this fact.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances new schools are needed.  However, people who are education-conscious realise that they cannot have three science laboratories or three gymnasia in the one small town; neither could one expect to have three good science teachers, arts teachers or maths teachers in the one small town.  Years ago there was a variety act with a man called Bamboozalem who filled out all kinds of drinks from an inexhaustible kettle and he continued to do this throughout the act without replenishing the kettle. Some people have the idea that the Minister has an inexhaustible supply of money to finance the various schemes but if people would consider the matter I am sure they would agree that community schools are the only logical way to provide the best education for all the pupils.</P>
    <P>The one consideration which should outweigh all others is the educational <Col N="289" /> good of the pupils.  It is a pity that parents are not allowed to realise the range of subjects available in community schools.  They should be told about the benefit in having a qualified career guidance teacher to advise the pupil and parents on the choice of education which is orientated towards the ability of the pupil.  In the community schools pupils could be streamed towards an academic or technical education as their aptitudes dictate without the parents having to decide on the school their children should attend.  The result would lead to greater opportunities for pupils, even those who live in sparsely populated areas.  However, parents are not being given the opportunity to appreciate these benefits.  The two Opposition parties have embarked on a programme of misrepresentation with regard to the community schools.</P>
    <P>First, we were told it was a take-over by the nuns and the Brothers.  Later on it was said it was a sell-out of the vocational schools and, finally, the sectarian issue was brought into it.  The people had no thought of anything sectarian in the community schools, nor is there anything sectarian in them, but certain people opposite considered it necessary for their political ends to drag in the sectarian issue and to play on any slight fear that existed.  They have done a great disservice to the schools.  The Unionists will never lack an ally while we have people on the opposite benches prepared to do that. During the year they have consistently shown that they are prepared to sell out the country.</P>

      <P>We were told that the Minister was being dictated to by the bishops, that the parents and teachers were not being represented and that the Protestants were not being represented. All these issues have now been solved but we learned during the course of this debate that both Fine Gael and Labour have taken credit for solving them.  It amazes me how a <Col N="290" /> Minister for Education, who was so much under the thumb of the hierarchy and the Archbishop, was allowed to change his mind.  How did the Minister throw off the grip of the bishops?</P>
      <P>The Minister made his own proposals. He approached the people and they complimented him on the changes he made.  We have now reached the stage where the community school proposals are accepted and are beginning to be understood by the people.  I am confident that where these schools are established the children will get a better education.  We want the cooperation of the nuns, the brothers, and the vocational schools.  It has been said we were anxious to get the religious out of education.  We know the contribution they have made to this country.  They are the people who have to sacrifice most to enable the community schools to go ahead.  The latest proposals prove that the religious denominations have nothing to fear.</P>
      <P>I noticed a certain amount of woolly thinking when questions were asked on this matter.  I made an attempt to throw a little light on it but the Ceann Comhairle, in his wisdom, did not allow me to do so.  Deputy Desmond was concerned about faith and morals. I am confident that the Deputy genuinely thought the proposals were framed with reference to the faith and morals of the teachers.  That proves to me the trend of thought of the Opposition parties.  They never take the child into account.  I am confident that it was to safeguard the faith and morals of the children that this clause was introduced.  It is well to remember that for the moment we will have community schools in certain areas only.  In a years time&mdash;like the teachers' salaries this year&mdash;we will be able to look back and decide who was right and who was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of Fine Gael and Labour to education would be laughable if it were not so lamentable.  There is evidence that certain people over there are prepared to flirt with the educational future of the children of Ireland to catch a vote or two.  Since they are continually changing horses their sincerity is very much in doubt. The biggest laugh of the year was <Col N="291" /> Deputy FitzGerald's blueprint for education and his policy statement.  He said before that a politician's duty was to reconcile matters and he did that in this policy statement.  He attempted to please everybody.  He gave everybody everything they wanted.</P>
    <P>There was no mention in his blueprint of where the money was to come from to finance it.  There was no mention of the children.  The educational future of the child or the child's good did not come into it.  That is the real difference between Fianna Fáil and the Opposition.  We are interested in the educational good of the children of Ireland.  We are prepared to put forward proposals that may not win us votes.  We are prepared to stand on that policy and be judged on it.  I am confident that the people of Ireland will judge us rightly on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton said there was a certain amount of difficulty about the range of subjects or the choice of subjects available to the pupils.  He seemed to feel that, because 18 subjects are available, the pupil would be expected to take them all.  He should realise that there will be a career guidance teacher in these schools who will channel the child to where his abilities can best be used.  He talked about the brainy child.  He mentioned the half of 1 per cent who would be in the same bracket as Deputy FitzGerald.  Perhaps it is lucky for the people of Ireland that it is only half of 1 per cent.  Deputy Clinton also mentioned the dull child.  He talked about a junior cycle and he seemed to feel that it was sufficient for the children in the junior cycle to learn the three Rs, reading, writing and arithmetic.  I could see that Deputy FitzGerald did not agree with him.  I think he was mixed up between the junior cycle and the primary school cycle.  Possibly he had a tricycle in mind rather than a junior cycle.</P>

Chualas an Teachta Bruton á rá nár chóir go mbeadh Gaeilge dá laghad ag na gardaí agus seachtain ó shin bhí an Teachta FitzGerald ag cur in iúl don Aire nár ghá do na micléinn sna coláistí oiliúna freagraí a thúirt i nGaeilge sna scrúdacháin.  Tá a fhios agam féin go bhfuil caighdeán ard go leor ag na micléinn ag dul isteach sna coláistí sin chun aon ábhar a fhreagairt i nGaeilge agus níl aon dabht im aigne ach gur chóir dóibh na h-ábhair a bhaineann le modh múinte, go speisialta, a fhreagairt i nGaeilge ach ní ghá dúinn aon leithscéal a ghabháil le héinne mar gheall ar an bpolasaí sin.</P>
    <P>D'fhiafraigh an Teachta FitzGerald den Aire cá bhfuair sé an chumacht chun é sin a dhéanamh.  Sin é an polasaí atá againn agus ní ghá dúinn aon leithscéal a ghabháil le héinne mar gheall air ach tá mé cinnte gurb é an rud atá in aigne ag dream an Lucht Oibre agus ag Fine Gael an Ghaeilge a chur ar leathaobh nuair a cheapann siad go bhfuil vótaí breise le fáil.  Nach raibh sé sin mar gháir chatha acu cúpla toghchán ó shin?  Tá mé cinnte freisin gur masla don Ghaeilge Fine Gael a thúirt ar an dream sin thall.  Ní h-aon ionadh é go raibh sé d'intinn acu an teideal sin a athrú cúpla bliain ó shin.  Is é mo thuairim féin gur oiriúnaí mar theideal acu &ldquo;Fine Gall&rdquo; ná an teideal atá acu inniu.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Deputy Dr. Browne's attitude to the teaching profession. He asked a question some time ago in which he inferred that the teachers of Ireland were capable of marking a child absent although he was present, with the intention of suppressing the child's attendances and holding him back for a further year, not for educational reasons but, I presume, to gain some financial benefit for themselves.  I am confident that that is a groundless accusation.  I am sure there would be many raised eyebrows if I accused the doctors of this country of signing certificates for people who did not really deserve them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> There are people here who avail of every opportunity to downgrade the teaching profession and particularly the religious in the teaching profession. This has become a little too obvious in the case of Deputy Dr. Browne.  Perhaps he is still smarting from an encounter he had long ago. He has proved to be a godsend to the Unionists.  Any enemy of Ireland who needs ammunition to denigrate our country can find it in the utterances of some members of the Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>The other night during the debate on the Tobacco Bill, Deputy O'Donovan took umbrage at the fact that that debate was being hogged by the doctors.  He felt that they were not really competent to give an opinion on that matter, or on any medical matter, and that other people should be allowed to express their opinions. I would not suggest that somebody who had been in hospital for an operation would feel he was an expert in the field of medicine but it appears to me that, just because they went to school&mdash;and I presume they did go to school for a while anyway&mdash;some people have no hesitation in setting themselves up as experts on education. They purport to be capable of producing a cure-all for every ill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien mentioned corporal punishment in the schools. During the week I got a communication and a questionnaire from Dr. Cyril Daly concerning corporal punishment. We were asked certain loaded questions and the good doctor promised that he would publish the results in the local and national papers.  I should mention that this is the notorious Dr. Daly who was involved in the NBC film where the reputation of Ireland was tarnished and adverse propaganda was used against this country in the USA, which proved a decided disadvantage to anyone there with Irish connections and brought thousands of letters to this country asking if it could be true.  This is the doctor who mentioned that we treat our pigs better in this country than we do our children because when pigs are slaughtered we do not allow them to be slaughtered in the view of other pigs awaiting <Col N="294" /> slaughter.  My impression is&mdash;and I make no secret of it&mdash;that the educational system generally in Ireland suffers from the interest of these misguided, mischievous and misfit medicos who set themselves up as paragons of every virtue and feel they have some special expertise which enables them to speak <i>ex cathedra</i> on education.  I want to tell Dr. Daly that I am in favour of the retention of corporal punishment in Irish schools and I have experience enough to know that there are occasions, and there are pupils, where a slap is the best punishment. That is my answer to Dr. Daly's loaded questions.</P>
    <P>I have slapped many children during my 21 years teaching and I doubt if I have wronged any child.  I have yet to meet a parent or a pupil who said that I had wronged a child or had punished him in an uncivilised manner.  Perhaps, like whiskey, we all mellow with age.  Perhaps I have mellowed. I do not see any sign of mellowing in Dr. Daly, who seems to become more bitter with the passage of time. I know what the average parent thinks of Dr. Daly and his ilk and I feel sure that the parents I know would much prefer to have the education of their children entrusted to the teachers of this country whom he tries to besmirch rather than commit them to the care of any Dr. Daly.</P>
    <P>I would compliment the Minister with regard to the school transport system for which he has now made £½ million extra available.  This scheme must be a burden on the Exchequer. It costs £3½ million&mdash;a very big outlay. At one time I felt that we should have provided the schools first and let the children get to them under their own steam and introduce school transport later but when one looks at the matter in a reasonable way it would seem that we have to provide transport for pupils and that both schemes must go ahead simultaneously.  When this scheme was first mooted in the House it was the subject of sneers and jibes by people who doubted that it would ever be implemented.  It was implemented. There was a great deal of goodwill and co-operation from all those concerned. Today I heard the suggestion made in <Col N="295" /> the House that a pupil living a few hundred yards outside the prescribed limit should not be left out.  It should be obvious that whatever limit is prescribed somebody will be left out.  It is impossible to satisfy everybody.</P>
    <P>There is one case that I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  It is the case of a child attending national school who resides not quite three miles from the school.  In such a case the child is entitled to free transport until he or she reaches ten years of age, at which age he or she is put off the bus.  After two years, at the age of 12, the child will proceed to post-primary school and will be eligible for free transport.  The older, and, therefore, stronger, members of the family have free transport to the post-primary school while the younger members have to walk to school.  The Minister should reconsider this matter with a view to having children carried to school for the whole period of their attendance at national school.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the wonderful work done in an area of which we have only recently become aware.  I refer to schools for mentally handicapped children.  I should like to thank the Minister and his Department for their help in providing a school in Droichead Nua, which will soon be built.  I could not let this opportunity pass without commenting on the excellent work done at local level by local committees.  These people have been unrelenting and unselfish in their work. This is a matter which seems to bring out the best in people.  I would hope that the school, which is so badly needed in County Kildare, will be provided in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with a school which I hope will be provided. I am a member of the vocational educational committee in Droichead Nua. For some time we have endeavoured to provide a site and this month we acquired ownership.  The Minister will realise that in a town of very rapid expansion&mdash;Droichead Nua has the highest growth rate of any town outside Dublin&mdash;and with an industrial complex, a good vocational school, or whatever type of school he proposes <Col N="296" /> to build, is urgently needed.  I would hope that this matter, which has been under review for some time, will soon be resolved and that a decision will be taken.  I have found the Department reasonable enough during the year. Recently the vocational educational committee of which I am a member and the Department found themselves at variance over the suggested closure of the Curragh Vocational School.  The Department received our deputation and I thank the Department for having acceded to our request and for keeping the school open.</P>
    <P>I should like at this stage to mention regional technical colleges which are now only in the infancy stage.  One could hardly say that as yet they have got off the ground but they are well worthwhile in correcting the bias towards academic rather than technical education.  Parents who experience difficulty in placing a child who has got a middling pass in the leaving certificate examination will appreciate how much better that child would be and how much more easily he would be placed if his activities had been directed towards technical rather than academic education.  This is a matter which must be considered in relation to our entry into the EEC.  In international competitions students of our technical schools have proved to be as good technicians and apprentices as any in the world.  The regional technical colleges will provide opportunities for young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to teacher training colleges.  I am pleased that the grant has been increased this year to bring it up to university grant level. I sincerely hope that the difficulties being experienced by students will be ironed out.  A three year course with a degree at the end of it would be the ideal solution.  I realise that there are snags but a solution will be found. I am pleased to know that the Minister has had consultations with the students on this matter.</P>
    <P>The scheme for higher education grants is an excellent one.  There are now 3,500 pupils availing of the grants, at a cost of £900,000.  Prior to the introduction of this scheme, under the county council scholarship scheme <Col N="297" /> there were only 800 places available. The new scheme is a big step forward.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that I should like to raise with the Minister.  It is the question of late applications for university grants.  An applicant may be late by a matter of days in some cases and by a longer period in other cases.  I can well appreciate that there must be a closing date if one is to implement a scheme.  Here I should like to quote a reply that I received from the Minister in this connection:</P>
    <P>As the application for a grant made by...under the Kildare County Council scheme for 1971 was late, she cannot be awarded a grant under that scheme.  There can, therefore, be no question of deferring the grant for her to 1972.</P>
    <P>I am not too happy that there can be no question of deferring the grant.  A pupil whose school life was aimed at the leaving certificate and who got sufficient honours to entitle her to a grant and who has proved that she is suitable for the university has been shot down because of a technicality and loses the grant.  If her parents have not got the money, and they probably have not, she cannot go to university. That is a dreadful penalty to impose on any student.  I think consideration should be given to those late applicants for next year.  I do not know what the numbers are but I believe there is need for sympathy in a particular case like that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thornley praised the &ldquo;consistently good educational policy of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Is oth liom a rá nach bhfuil an scéal céanna agamsa agus bá maith liom dréacht a léamh as an <i>Irish Times,</i> 16ú Feabhra, 1972, ón alt ar a dtugtar <i>Tuarascáil:</i></P>
    <P>Tá sé thar am Pádhraic Ó Fachtna agus a rúnaí Parlaiminte, Mícheál Ó Cinnéide a chur ar a dtrial.  Níl aon cheist faoi ar ndóigh, tá siad ciontach.</P>
    <P>May I translate that roughly?  It is:</P>
    <P>It is high time that Pádraic Faulkner and his Parliamentary Secretary, Michael O'Kennedy, were put on trial.  There is no question, however, but that they are guilty.</P>
    <P>That is the opinion of a group of people whose names appear at the end <Col N="298" /> of the article.  I cannot say who is particularly responsible for that.  I presume it is a case of collective responsibility. They are people who look for a trial and in the next sentence find the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary guilty.  I thought such trials were only held in the Soviet and Soviet dominated countries but now we find Gaeilgeóirí at home sponsoring a type of people's court.  Since that article was written a week ago the people of Ireland have had an opportunity of passing a verdict on community schools when thousands at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis decided that the policy pursued by our party and our Minister was the best one and endorsed all the decisions to date.  I was interested to get today's <i>Tuarascáil.</i> I note that while several heads appear on it&mdash;Cathal Ó hEocha.  Brian Ó Luineacháin, Niall Bléine agus a leithéid&mdash;there is not one mention of the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary nor does it mention education in any way.  If the decision at our Ard-Fheis had been otherwise and if the heads of the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary had rolled at that I am convinced their names would appear in <i>Tuarascáil</i> today.  I am not terribly happy with the type of articles that appear in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I differ with Deputy Thornley there.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have a very proud record in education at all levels.  Every child is getting a fair chance, a chance that was not even dreamed of ten years ago.  In 1957 the total cost of education was £15 million.  In 1972 the total cost is £88 million and there are 200,000 pupils in post-primary education, more than twice the number ten years ago.  We realise that this is proving very costly but I am confident that this investment in the future of our country will pay a very handsome dividend.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his solid achievements during the year.  The people realise that he is pursuing his ideals with sincerity of purpose.  I know the Irish people realise, too, that we in Fianna Fáil are not weather cocks that will twist with every breeze.  We have proved that we are interested in the <Col N="299" /> educational welfare of children wherever they live.  The people are well capable of judging the shallowness of those who try to belittle our achievements. Particularly will they judge severely those who play on the fears of gullible people.  Deinim comhgháirdeachas leis an Aire agus leis an Roinn Oideachais agus iarraim orthu leanúint ar aghaidh leis an dea-obair atá á deánamh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Much as I am tempted to do so, I do not propose to follow Deputy Power and deliver a political speech on this most important Estimate. I have always held that education is such a vital matter and of such vital significance to the nation that it should, if at all possible, transcend party politics.  On the few occasions when Deputy Power spoke as an educationist he was quite good but where he spoke as a politician his speech was more suited to a church gate by-election meeting.</P>
      <P>I said I would not make a political speech and I shall not preach any philosophy or deal with education in a purely theoretical manner.  Deputy FitzGerald has dealt with the whole field of education in a realistic and comprehensive manner but there are certain areas in which I am particularly interested and where problems have to be solved.  I shall confine my comments to these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On every occasion in the last ten years when we have had a debate on education I have started my speech, although I was leaving myself open to being accused of being parochial, by pleading for a university for Limerick. I could not do better tonight than to start in the same fashion.  At page 18 of the Minister's speech he referred to the Limerick Institute of Higher Education.  We were all set in Limerick for the opening of our new Institute of Higher Education last September. After years of struggle and agitation and years of effort we saw our hopes beginning to be realised. Pupils in their final year of their post-primary courses were looking forward eagerly to enrolling in that new institute.  About May or June all our hopes were dashed when it was announced <Col N="300" /> that the college would not open on the projected date, September, 1971.</P>
    <P>There was considerable resentment and disappointment.  Now we are into 1972 and all seems ready for the opening of the college and it would appear from the progress that has been made in the last couple of months that there is a good likelihood that it will open next September.  I want to warn the Minister that while the people of Limerick were really very tolerant, despite the colossal disappointment they suffered last year, any further postponement of the opening date will just not be tolerated.  I was glad to see in today's newspapers an announcement by the director of the institute of the filling of seven key posts as lecturers.  I hope the additional staffing requirements will be filled without further delay and that all the administrative posts and so forth will be filled in good time so that the college will be ready to enrol pupils as from next September.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that at long last the long-awaited institute of higher education in Limerick will be a reality next September.  The Minister will have a terrible row on his hands, will be really in serious trouble, if it does not go ahead on the projected opening date. This new national Institute of Higher Education, as it is now being called, is a good development, not merely for Limerick but nationally, because it represents a new dimension in third level education in that the courses in this College will be technologically and commercially orientated.  This is a very desirable development.  The courses, instead of being along the traditional pattern of university courses and university faculties, will be of a type which we have not had in this country before&mdash;courses in engineering sciences of various specialties, computer science, business administration, secretarial science and languages, and, of course, there will eventually, all going well, be a new national college of physical education on the same campus which I assume will ultimately be part of the whole third level complex in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Looking at the composition of the courses and the different types of <Col N="301" /> degrees and qualifications that will be conferred there, I think it is a pity that the Minister did not go the whole hog, and instead of calling it the National Institute of Higher Education, he called it what, in fact, it is, a university. We are very anxious that this college would be designated as a full university. We know that there was opposition from the vested interests in other universities and a compromise has now been reached in that it is to be called the National Institute of Higher Education.  I suppose there is no point in falling out on the terminology or the title.  The main thing is that this institute will be providing courses of a type that have not yet been provided in this country.  These courses have been geared to meet the technological developments in industry, in science, in engineering and in agriculture for which there is a tremendous need, and this higher education institute at Plassy near Limerick, taken in conjuction with the regional technical colleges to which the Minister referred, will fill a very great need in the educational field, that is, the need for trained technicians, trained technologists and trained experts in various specialised fields.</P>
    <P>The fact that this institute is located in Limerick is significant by reason of the fact that the first industrial estate in this country was established at Shannon and now that the scope of the work of the Shannon Development Company has been extended from Shannon Airport to Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary, there will be further industrial development.  One of the big complaints of the various industrialists, particularly from abroad, who have come to the Shannon region and set up industries there was the fact that in some cases it was an almost impossible task to find trained and skilled people, with an adequate supply of unskilled labour as there would be in any largely rural and agricultural area. There was a serious shortage of trained people but, fortunately, many Irish people who had emigrated to Britain and had acquired skills and expertise there were persuaded to come back and have settled down and got on very well.</P>
    <P>While I have on many occasions down the years been highly critical of the Department because of the dilatory <Col N="302" /> manner in which it approached the establishment of this college, I want to say on behalf of the people whom I represent here, the people of the Limerick region and of the whole area generally, that we are looking forward eagerly to the opening of this college next September.  We sincerely hope it will live up to our expectations and will play an important role in educational development in the years ahead.  If this college is to be as successful as we hope it will be and as I personally expect it will be, much of the credit will be due to the fact that we were extremely fortunate in securing the services of an outstanding young man, the director of the institute, Dr. Walsh, who, since his appointment, against tremendous odds and difficulties of many kinds, has succeeded in getting the college off the ground.  He is now recruiting staff and has succeeded in attracting in the seven appointments made&mdash;I suppose these will be the heads of the various faculties&mdash;people not merely of the highest qualifications but of international standing.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the new college, the national college of physical education, which is to be established in the same place, in Plassy. This is a very desirable development and it, too, will fill a very great need in the educational sphere.  Physical education is of vital importance as part of the national educational process. It is a field which has been seriously neglected down the years and its establishment will ensure that we have an adequate supply of teachers for the various schools, primary, post-primary, third level and so on, which is so vitally necessary. The present system whereby we sent a certain number of people abroad to be trained is not a satisfactory system.</P>
    <P>In addition to these developments in Limerick, there is another in my constituency&mdash;the fact that one of the new regional technical colleges will go up there, the regional technical school. I was particularly interested in the Minister's references to certain aspects of the functions of these institutes.  He mentioned the type of courses that would be provided there.  He did not go into detail about them but referred to them in a broad general way.  I am <Col N="303" /> particularly interested to find that he referred to the need to train technicians and people in various skills and he referred to computer operators and to courses in food technology.</P>
    <P>While food technology and the Minister's estimate may appear to be poles apart I regard it as highly relevant, particularly in view of our entry into EEC and the fact that we are basically an agricultural country and that there must be possibilities for a vast expansion in view of our industrial development in food processing industries.  Naturally, if we are to succeed in food processing it will be vitally important to have people with the necessary skill, expertise training and education in this highly complex science.  This is something which has been overlooked for far too long.  Particularly in an area like Limerick with a huge milk processing industry and a background in food processing of various kinds, I envisage that provision of courses in food technology would be very important in the new regional technical schools or even in the National Institute of Higher Education being established there.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this with Dr. Walsh on a number of occasions and in the course of his fact-finding mission after being appointed to Limerick, he interviewed everybody interested in education including all the public representatives. I emphasised to him that I was very keen on the idea of advanced courses in food technology being provided and felt that the Limerick college was an ideal place to set this up. Certain work is being done in the Agricultural Institute and in the dairy science faculty in UCC but this is totally inadequate to meet the overall needs of the country.  I hope the Minister will bear this in mind.  There might be a possibility of adding this at some future stage, not just at post-primary or technical school level but at the third or higher educational level.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Power one would think all was well in the field of education and that everybody was happy, thanks be to Fianna Fáil.  That was his attitude.  It would be far better for him and for all Deputies interested in education to face the penalties of the <Col N="304" /> situation which in my opinion are that at present education is in a very confused state.  I would hesitate to say that it is in a state of chaos but there is confusion and uncertainty and more and more people are beginning to doubt if even the Minister and his Department know where they are going.  Therefore, it is vital that there should be forward, comprehensive national planning in education.  As a first step towards formulating this type of national planning for educational development, the whole complex field of education must be looked at on a national basis.  Problems must be identified and remedies thought up taking into account our resources which are scarce, as the Minister says.  Unless this is done education will get into more and more trouble.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest&mdash;I think it has been suggested by one or two other Deputies&mdash;that the Minister should consider the whole field of education, assess our resources, examine the various systems and see where we are going and, most important, decide where we want to go.  Having done that, a White Paper should be published outlining the Government's and the Minister's thinking and the attitude of the Department to education. Modern life is highly complex and what may be said about the need for overall, comprehensive planning in relation to the activities of other State Departments is just as applicable, if not more so, in the field of education. The progress any country makes, economically, socially and otherwise, will be largely determined by its educational system.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that in a country like ours which, socially and economically by comparison with other countries can be regarded as underdeveloped, more and more of our financial resources should be devoted to education.  Now, that we are contemplating entry to the EEC and when doubts and fears are being expressed about our survival&mdash;personally I have no doubt about it; I am an ardent pro-European&mdash;and while calls have been made on the Government to gear up our industrial arm, our agriculture, our transport services and other sectors in preparation for EEC entry, too little <Col N="305" /> emphasis has been laid on the absolute need to gear up our educational system. Our survival and progress in the EEC will be determined, to an extent not yet fully appreciated, by the manner in which we can gear our educational system to prepare our people for entry and to provide a pool of skilled persons at all levels in industry, agriculture, in business, in tourism and so on.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I have grave doubts about the ability of the existing traditional policy of the Department to meet the challenge that is there now and has been with us for some time past and which will certainly grow as time goes on.  This type of haphazard, stopgap, patchwork, unco-ordinated policy and legislation that has been coming from the Department in recent years is not good enough and will not enable us to meet the challenge ahead and if we continue in this way we shall find ourselves in serious trouble.  We have had developments in education in recent years; we have had breaksthrough in certain ways; There has been a vast expansion in post-primary education and there has been an enormous increase in the demand for university education.  The Minister and his Department have not kept pace with that demand and it is only now that they are beginning to wake up and realise the need for an educational revolution. The emphasis has changed from the traditional academic subjects to modern technological and commercially-orientated subjects.  There is a very big task facing the Minister and his Department.  In the past the Department of Education was the Cinderella of Government Departments.  It was presided over by a very junior Minister. In my time here it has become perhaps the hottest seat in the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>There is, as I say, a major task facing the Minister.  I do not wish to hurl personal abuse at the Minister but I am seriously concerned with the major problem that confronts us in education.  This problem must be tackled realistically.  There must be forward, long-term planning.  The road must be clearly mapped out.  We must ensure that all systems&mdash;primary, post-primary, technical, technological and university&mdash;are properly integrated so that there will be no overlapping and <Col N="306" /> no duplication.  Constant surveys will have to be carried out to ensure that the systems are flexible enough to meet the changing demands of industry and agriculture.</P>
    <P>Food processing is a very important industry.  From the point of view of education, it has been totally neglected. No attempt has been made to provide proper educational and training facilities.  Certain small beginnings have been made in some areas to provide limited classes, but this is an industry demanding special skill and special training.  It is an industry dependent on the personnel who operate it.  There is a course in the college in Rathmines but, overall, no attempt has been made to meet the educational needs of this industry.  There is a very big task ahead.  If we continue on our present lines we will run into the same difficulties as those which confronted the Minister in the closing of small schools and the introduction of community schools.</P>
    <P>I was involved in the closure of Mountpelier school and I said then that the Minister and his Department must be made to realise that people nowadays want to know what is happening. Parents have a right to consultation. They have a right to have their views heard.  The day of the bureaucratic civil servant and the dictatorial Minister has gone.  Policies and programmes must be spelled out clearly and explained fully.  The people must be consulted.  I urge on the Minister the desirability of initiating a completely comprehensive survey of the whole educational field and publishing a White Paper to enable public discussion to take place on an informed basis out of which will emerge long-term comprehensive planning.  If that is done we will all know where we are going.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given details of the close of one- and two-teacher schools. The total number of schools has been reduced by 909; of these, 471 were one-teacher and 389 were two-teacher schools.  During 1970, the Minister said, 124 schools were closed and the total number of schools now in operation is 3,929.  What are the Minister's intentions with regard to the future closure of schools?  Rumour has it that the <Col N="307" /> next schools to be closed will be the three-teacher schools.  We had, of course, the classic example of that in Mountpelier.  Mountpelier will forever be a memorial to the stupidity of the Minister and his Department.  A grave injustice was perpetrated there on the parents and on the pupils.  There was an ironclad case for a new school but the parents and pupils were coerced, after a long battle, into accepting the closure of the school.  Would the Minister and his Department now make a little gesture of reconciliation to those parents and pupils by providing transport for those of the pupils who elected to go to Killaloe school?</P>
    <P>The Minister made an observation that amalgamation of schools frequently results in overstaffing and he is now increasing the incentive bonus from £200 to £400.  This bonus is designed to attract teachers from the overstaffed schools to other posts.  I understand that the overall situation with regard to the pupil teacher ratio is bad and that it will be a long time before we reach the figure which is recognised as the optimum.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note with regard to primary education that there has been a number of developments in relation to the new curriculum.  The Minister said it has been received favourably and I should like to go on record as stating my approval of the curriculum.</P>
    <P>With regard to post-primary education, matters are getting more chaotic. Not only has there been the controversy about the concept of the community schools but we have the situation that the Minister has refused to sanction the appointment of additional teachers.  During the current school year additional classrooms were provided but in many cases the Department have been unable to pay the grants.  There is one case in my constituency where a secondary school had five teachers on the staff but their appointments were not sanctioned. This was despite the fact that the numbers warranted the employment of the teachers and that the school had an A stream.  The Department were not paying incremental salaries to the five teachers and the authorities were forced to notify the Department that <Col N="308" /> they would have to close the A school. Finally, the Department agreed to sanction the appointment of two of the five teachers.</P>
    <P>There was another case in Limerick where, at the suggestion of the Department, a member of the religious staff went away for three years to train as a domestic science teacher because it was realised this subject was essential for a girls' school.  When the teacher returned after three years the Department would not sanction her appointment. There have been numerous similar cases throughout the country. Last June higher diploma students marched to Leinster House.</P>
    <P>If we want to have a satisfactory educational system it is essential that we have the necessary accommodation and that we provide enough teachers. It is no use talking about various courses and a wide range of subjects if the Department are unable or unwilling to sanction the appointment of a sufficient number of teachers.  I do not think the Minister referred to this matter in his speech and perhaps he would comment on it in his reply.  I have known a number of cases where grants due to secondary schools have not been paid.  I know of one case where a grant for a science block, which was approved by the Department, had not been paid up to relatively recently.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about comprehensive schools and the new approach to post-primary education.  We have a development in Limerick city where a new comprehensive school is in operation and is proving satisfactory.  The Minister went into detail about comprehensive education, where it can be achieved by a larger single unit or, where this is not feasible, through co-operation between existing schools. I have always been in favour of the system whereby in a country schools there were three post-primary schools &mdash;the convent school, the Christian Brothers' school and a vocational school.  Where three such schools existed there was tremendous scope for co-operation, for sharing teachers and for transferring pupils for certain courses.  As a result, a wide range of post-primary courses were available without any controversy as to who was <Col N="309" /> in control.  I think this has come to be known as a community of schools. I have seen this phase used but I look on it as realistic co-operation on the part of different schools.</P>
    <P>In areas where there is one school there is much anxiety about the senior and junior cycles that are being introduced. I know that some principals have received notification that as from a certain date they will not be allowed to provide senior cycle courses.  The Minister should tread cautiously because he will run into serious difficulty with regard to this matter.  He must remember that in many of these towns and in the rural areas it will be difficult to sell this idea of senior and junior cycles.  These small schools, insignificant as they may be when the emphasis is on larger schools, provided an important service for the people and many of the pupils have made their mark in many walks of life, at home and abroad.  In most cases the schools have been run by the religious communities and but for their efforts there would not have been any secondary education in this country in the last 50 years.  The Minister should remember all these facts and he must be careful in his approach to this matter.  I am speaking about places such as Buttevant and Doneraile and other areas mentioned by other Deputies. Deputy Barry is particularly interested in them, too, and he has been telling me about them.</P>
    <P>There has been a colossal growth in the demand for university education in recent years.  As has been said, the universities are now bursting at the seams.  People thought that the complex at Belfield was huge and that it would never be filled, but it is now fast reaching full capacity.  There has been a lot of talk in recent years about student participation in the governing of the universities.  The voice of the students in the democratisation of the universities has been referred to.  To put it quite simply, students are demanding a greater say in the running of their universities.  I believe they are entitled to this say.  The Minister has recognised this to a certain degree, although the manner in which he has recognised it has proved to be totally unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> He has appointed students to the governing bodies of different universities. I know he has done this in Dublin and Cork and I presume the same thing has happened in Galway.  Theoretically this is very desirable.  I am all in favour of student participation and I should like to see much greater student participation.  The manner in which the Minister has done it is working out very badly.  I know of one or two cases where the student nominated was the serving president of the students' council.  More often than not, the president of the students' council is in his final year in college, or he may be doing a post-graduate course.  He is appointed at Christmas and he can serve until June or July only when the academic year ends and he departs from college and goes to another area. A six months period is no use because he might have an opportunity of attending only two or three meetings of the governing body.</P>
    <P>When the Higher Education Authority Bill was going through this House, the Union of Students of Ireland made a very good case for continuity of student representation on the governing bodies.  They wanted three students appointed so that when one retired another student would replace him.  If three students were appointed over a three year period and one dropped out he could be replaced.  I have in mind the case of University College, Cork. Anyone who reads the papers will have seen that the students' representative on the governing body resigned recently because he was no longer a student of the college and, therefore, he could not be regarded as a satisfactory students' representative.  I hope the Minister will fill that vacancy. I have a sneaking feeling that the Minister is not fully converted to the idea of having proper student representation on the governing bodies. Having made a start, it should not be too difficult to devise a method which would give adequate student participation.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about students in general, and about university students.  There will always be a certain section who are more vocal than others and inclined to be wild, but we <Col N="311" /> hear very little about the vast majority of students&mdash;and I am referring to university students&mdash;who are responsible, who attend to their studies and who devote a considerable amount of their time to voluntary work; fund raising for charity and assisting the poor and under-priviledged.  Unfortunately, this aspect of the activities of students does not get the same publicity and is not highlighted in the same way as the activities of the very vocal minority who tend to hit the headlines. I am fully in favour of proper student participation in all aspects of our higher education institutions.  I hope the Minister will devise a satisfactory method of ensuring that there will be proper continuity of student representation.</P>
    <P>Last year there was a row over the night courses at UCD.  I worked my way through college.  I worked during the day and attended university courses at night.  Thousands have done the same thing.  The system was that new courses started each year and it was possible to enrol each year.  Then a cylical system was introduced.  A course was started and until it was concluded at the end of three years, another course could not be started. I condemned that inside and outside the House.  I felt it was a diabolical decision.  It was grossly unfair to hundreds of students who could not afford to go to the university full time and who were glad to avail of the facilities at night.  It is a highly nerve-wracking business, it makes colossal demands on one's physical and mental energies, having worked all day to go to the university at night, attend lectures and find time for study, but thousands have done it.</P>
    <P>Whoever is responsible, the Minister or the powers-that-be, should be ashamed at not being prepared to provide this facility.  More and more of these night courses should be provided in our universities if we believe that education is important.  There is a demand for these courses.  The universities should be shaken up and made realise that we are now in the second half of the 20th century and that we are not back in Newman's day, <Col N="312" /> much as I admire Cardinal Newman and his concept of university education. We must face facts.  It is grossly unfair to the young boy or girl who has the leaving certificate, who does not qualify for a university grant, who takes up a post in a university town, and then cannot do night courses without having to wait for three years.</P>
    <P>Only two courses are provided, a BA and a B.Com.  I cannot see any reason why a wider range of courses could not be provided at night by the universities.  Last year when this row blew up&mdash;and Deputy Desmond was very interested in it too; he might be able to recall the exact reasons which were stated as to why the yearly courses were discontinued&mdash;there was some suggestion about the staff being over-worked or some question about the availability of staff.  I do not accept this at all.  Could the Minister do something about this?  Could he look into it?  There is a very big demand from people who are anxious to pursue university courses at night and this facility should be provided.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister should now seriously explore the possibilities of the concept of the open university. When he is replying to the debate I would be very grateful if he would tell me whether or not this matter has been considered by him and his Department and, if so, what conclusion they have arrived at.  I have also been in favour of the universities providing extern degrees, such as is done by London University, where one can study at home by way of correspondence and tutorial courses and qualify for a wide range of degrees.  I cannot understand why the National University or Trinity College, Dublin, could not provide such courses.  Each university should provide a wide range of night courses and courses for extern students not resident in a university town.  Otherwise the privilege of university education is confined to a relatively few very brilliant students who can obtain university grants or students whose parents can afford to pay for third level education.</P>
    <P>The development of the open university in Britain is a very interesting one.  The fact that this is a small country with a very small population <Col N="313" /> as compared with the population in Britain may make an open university not economically possible.  I am in favour of universities going out to the people, coming down from their ivory tower and making courses available to the largest possible numbers.</P>
    <P>In that context, I come to the next point I want to make.  It is in regard to adult education&mdash;a matter that I have been speaking about in this House for the past ten years and to which the Minister has made no reference in his introductory statement.  Whether we like it or not, whether we recognise it or not, adult education is an integral part of the educational system of all modern democracies.  There have been certain developments here in the field of adult education but, with the exception of University College, Cork, which has done trojan work throughout Munster in bringing the university to the people by means of their adult education courses, universities have not played their proper role in adult education.</P>
    <P>In the 1950s, the then President of University College, Cork, Dr. Alfred O'Rahilly, pioneered the idea of bringing the university to the people in the villages, towns, hamlets and townlands of rural Ireland.  I had the opportunity the other day of seeing the schedule of courses of adult education being provided by UCC this year and was tremendously impressed by the range of these courses.  They include courses of two years duration, of a high academic standard, culminating in an examination on the passing of which the student is conferred, quite properly, with a diploma.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the Minister is financing these courses provided by UCC.  I do not know why UCD, Trinity College, Maynooth College and University College, Galway, are not doing the same thing. There is a certain limited range of adult education courses available from these university colleges but the formula that has been devised by UCC and the way in which they have developed adult education courses is a model that other university colleges should follow. I am not too sure as to what exactly is the financial assistance given to <Col N="314" /> UCC for these courses but I do recall that when Dr. O'Rahilly started the courses he got a certain subvention from the Department of Education and that some time in the 1960s that subvention was cut by half&mdash;from £10,000 to £5,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not referred to adult education in his introductory statement.  I do not know whether he is interested in the matter or not.  In a modern democracy the universities have a vital role to play and they are under an obligation to the community to provide for people in non-university towns the benefit of higher education. There has been a commission examining the whole question of adult education under the chairmanship of that outstanding man, Mr. Con Murphy. An interim report has been published. I understand the final report will be submitted in due course.</P>
    <P>I am tired now of speaking of adult education over the years.  What we need is a proper national system of adult education.  We need the organisation, the structure, the facilities.  It requires to be done on a properly organised basis.  The University College, Cork, courses are so provided.  I should like to see a national system of adult education organised.  There should be a special centre from which these courses could be provided, where the work of the universities in the field of adult education could be co-ordinated with the work of other organisations.  It would be very remiss of me not to pay tribute to the Catholic Workers College and the Dublin Institute of Sociology and to other bodies throughout the country that have been doing very good work in this field.</P>
    <P>It is recognised in all modern democracies that adult education has a vital role to play, that it is an integral part of an educational system.  I hope that when the commission that is examining the whole structure of adult education issues its report, the Minister and the Department will take action so that we can look forward to a situation where not merely University College, Cork, but University College, Galway, the Dublin universities and the other institutes of higher education will play their full and proper role in providing adult education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> The Minister referred to the question of school transport, particularly for mentally handicapped children.  This is one aspect of the work of the Department of Education about which there is no controversy.  Deputy Power appears to be party-orientated in his outlook on education.  However the question of the education of mentally handicapped children is one which can be discussed non-politically.  The Minister has a serious responsibility in this field.  One of the most dramatic and welcome developments in recent years is the way in which the community have begun to take an active interest in the welfare of mentally handicapped children.  There are numerous examples of tremendous voluntary effort in the raising of funds and more recently in the provision of actual educational facilities, in the provision of schools, for these children.  There is one outstanding example in which I have a personal interest.  That is the school at Rathluirc which is servicing a very big area embracing north Cork, east and west Limerick.  It is a school, started by a local voluntary organisation, which has 25 pupils on the roll and is open two days a week.  The children are brought in by mini-buses and all is paid for through voluntary organisation.  This school has not received one penny from the Department of Education.  It did not qualify until recently because the premises were inadequate but now they have 25 pupils and excellent premises and the school should be eligible for support.  The teachers are working voluntarily.  The mini-buses, which travel fairly long distances, are very expensive.  Where local community effort has proved itself in a project of that nature it is worthy of support.  I am not saying at all that the Minister did not do anything about it, I am merely drawing his attention to the fact that the school appears to be geared now.  His Parliamentary Secretary very kindly visited it when he was opening a new school in a particular town during the year and he has taken a very keen interest in it.  So have the officials of the Department.  I appeal to the Minister to come to the aid of this <Col N="316" /> school now and enable it to be set up on a five-day week basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his secretariat have had an extremely difficult year.  Some of the problems which they faced have been with us since the foundation of the State.  They have been inherited from the British colonial set-up and they have defied, in many instances, the best efforts of successive Ministers for Education.  Unfortunately we accepted the inheritance of the British concept of a colonial educational system and as a result of this very uncritical acceptance we now have the almost total absence of a coherent futuristic educational policy. I suggest that this is the greatest single problem facing the country.</P>
      <P>I share the views put forward by Deputy FitzGerald.  I may differ in detail from his attitudes but I feel he has mirrored the impatience of many people with the present system of education. He is correct in saying that there is a revolutionary attitude of thought among the electorate towards the whole structure and system of education.</P>
      <P>Much as I personally like the Minister for Education, and I suppose for an educationalist to become Minister for Education is a supreme honour in any republic, and much as I admire his work to date, I regret that in the field of policy formation his contribution, due to a variety of circumstances, has so far been quite marginal.  This is a tragedy because the very things the Minister is setting out to do are extremely radical.  This is the peculiar perverseness of the situation.  Many of the Minister's proposals are quite revolutionary, particularly the proposals in respect of community schools, the general philosophy and basis of which I support.  Unfortunately unless the Minister pulls up his socks very rapidly in the field of educational policy formation he will go down in history as a man who did not make the contribution which I think he is capable of making.  This is a point I do not make in any personal sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second tragedy is that we have also inherited a system of departmental administration of education which is totally outdated.  This is the second part of our inheritance from the <Col N="317" /> British concept of colonial-style educational system.  Whole tracts and areas of administration and policy in this scheme in Britain have been thrown out, lock, stock and barrel, as no longer meeting the wishes of the people or the needs of the people.  The Department of Education, the lady from Marlborough Street, is still autocratic in structure. She is still vertically conceived in administration.  One might say, and I say this with no disrespect but indeed with a personal regard because I worked with the secretary of the Department&mdash;when I was a trade union servant we had to work together in our different spheres&mdash;that the quality, the temperament, the personality, the effectiveness of any secretary of the Department of Education virtually determines the quality and effectiveness of the whole system of education. In that setting all Ministers for Education are almost irrelevant.  If we look at education today we see that the secretary of the Department of Education is far more powerful, far more influential, exerts a far greater influence than the Minister for Education, who is merely a party political head of a Department for about three and a half years because we have a general election every three and a half years and in accordance with the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party the Minister for Education shuffles upwards every three and a half years.</P>

      <P>Getting back to the influence, the secretary of the Department is more powerful than the political head.  He administers the Department on a day to day basis and negotiates with the trade unions in the educational sector on conditions of employment.  The internal tone of the Department is set by what the staff think the secretary might think about a given proposition, while the Minister somewhat far removed, looks after the Fianna Fáil Party and he will interpret the Fianna Fáil Party as it interprets itself.  The attitudes internally of the Department are determined by people's reactions towards the secretary and, therefore, the political heads come and go very rapidly in the Department every two and a half years.  They leave something behind them, some of them, but more by accident than by design, such as the late Donogh O'Malley&mdash;not a terribly good Minister for all the hoo-ha that has been said about his contribution.  He decided on free education and put it to the Cabinet and then there dawned on him and on the Cabinet the enormity of what he had decided to do.  The late Seán Lemass, as Taoiseach, had a right go at him at the following Cabinet meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the so-called free post primary education came about but I would advance the point here that we in the Republic now have, for good or for evil, a rather ineffective Minister for Education, perhaps, one of the most ineffective in these islands.  I would be very loath to draw any comparison between the Minister and Mrs. Margaret Thatcher.  I think we all know Mrs. Margaret Thatcher's reputation in Britain to-date.  She is probably the most reactionary and conservative <Col N="319" /> Minister for Education the British people have ever witnessed.  I find it very difficult to make a comparison between Captain Long in Stormont and the current Minister here.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister in his reply and particularly in the months ahead in relation particularly to the bringing to finality of the community schools proposals, may yet display the experience, the capacity and the political imagination to meet the accelerating demands of the electorate in the Republic for a more broadly-based, more progressive and, indeed, I might say, a more democratic system of education.  Ironically, relatively speaking, the conclusion I come to is that at the moment Captain Long, from what I have read of his speeches in Northern Ireland and the statements he has made&mdash;and I do get the handouts of Stormont&mdash;on educational topics is somewhat more progressive, so, therefore, the Minister falls behind Mrs. Margaret Thatcher and Captain Long.</P>
    <P>Indeed, if one looks at the MacRory Report in Northern Ireland, one finds that it gives a greater measure of autonomy and a decentralisation of authority to local education committees and a regionalisation of education, one might say, to some extent in Northern Ireland.  That system of education is, indeed, more democratic in Northern Ireland.  It is more progressive at this stage, in fact, in our evolution than it is in the Republic.  These are things one would hardly be expected to say in respect of any comparison between North and South in terms of educational practices.</P>
    <P>The reason, therefore, that we on the Opposition benches are so extremely worried about the situation is that while there has been an explosion of expansion in education in the country, particularly in the second half of the sixties, there has not been a similar matched explosion in terms of the whole system, structure, administration and particularly policy formation of the Department.  I have a great deal of sympathy with both the Minister and his senior staff.  They have my sympathy in having to drag by the bootlaces a hodge-podge of a system <Col N="320" /> into some kind of coherent rational structure.  They have my sympathy but, frankly, I do not think at this stage that the job is being done.  We all know that in 1966 there were about 103,000 pupils in what I would prefer to call the so-called secondary schools. The terms &ldquo;secondary school&rdquo; and &ldquo;vocational school&rdquo; should be abolished in educational practice in this country.  They mean nothing in 1972 and we should try to get these two terms out of our educational terminology, our general vocabulary in education.  We have seen the explosion in the secondary schools sector, so-called, from 1966 when we had 103,000 pupils up to 149,000 pupils in one of our recent school years&mdash;a phenomenal rise of some 44 per cent in just over four years.</P>
    <P>I think it can legitimately be said that this rise is one of the fastest in Western Europe.  It has been quite phenomenal but it has imposed an enormous strain on the Department as the outcome of what one might call a flash decision of a former Minister for Education.  I am not sure that the late Minister was really quite sure what he was doing but he did it and all credit to him.  It came about and we have had the parallel problem of trying to cater for this massive upsurge in pupils, with a building programme in which 55,000 places were provided in post-primary schools over the same four-year period, 1966 to 1970.  This all had to be undertaken by the Department and it certainly was quite a massive development, but the tragedy is that notwithstanding this development there has not yet emerged in any explicit terms a general statement of future policy for post-primary education in particular in this country.</P>
    <P>I very much share the view expressed recently by the general secretary of the Vocational Teachers Association, Charles McCarthy.  He spoke quite recently in Dublin, on 30th January last, and made his demands, as he has been demanding <i>ad nauseam</i>&mdash;to his credit, as we all know, Charles McCarthy has plenty of stamina&mdash;and said that the Government and Church &mdash;I presume he meant the Churches&mdash; should now state in explicit terms their <Col N="321" /> policy on education.  He said that the Government had issued White Papers on far less significant subjects and the debate could not get under way without a general statement on policy. There had been no comprehensive statement from the Church either, Mr. McCarthy said at a meeting of the Dublin Institute of Adult Education Debating Society.  He challenged the idea that the problems of education could be solved through the application of a rigid formula devised in Dublin which could put small communities in peril through the closure of schools.  I shall come to that later, but broadly speaking, Mr. McCarthy demanded that there should be a White Paper on education.</P>
    <P>We had a Dáil Question this afternoon to the Minister for Education from&mdash;I think&mdash;Deputy Burke, who got the brush-off from the Minister. There was no indication of any real anxiety within the Fianna Fáil Party to think about this problem.  I am certain that if Fianna Fáil had any reaction to their own grassroots thinking there would be a different position.  One could take last week's Ard-Fheis which showed that the rank and file of the party were streets ahead, in terms of progressive thinking, of the Minister and streets ahead of the platform itself. That says something for the Fianna Fáil Party when they are ahead of their platform.  It shows how ill or insensitive that platform party must be.  I suppose that is excusable since they were so busy shaking hands with one another. I think there is general recognition within the Fianna Fáil Party of the need for the publication of a White Paper by the Department or by the Government on this matter.</P>
    <P>We are probably unique among western democracies.  One realises this when one looks at the plethora of white papers and reports published in Britain by successive governments or at the documents produced in France, Germany and Sweden.  Even in Sweden where there has been a long succession of democratic governments, successive ministers produce their white papers on their future plans for education.  We have had the amazing situation of virtual one-party rule without having a <Col N="322" /> statement of policy by that party.  What we have had is a hodge-podge of public servants' reactions and statements but never a clear-cut statement of policy on education.</P>
    <P>A recent criticism is perfectly valid. Michael Murphy of UCC, as reported in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of February 5th, said at the education forum meeting&mdash; he is a founder-director of the Education Forum in UCC, that in the absence of clearly-defined educational objectives the <i>ad hoc</i> structure of education reigned supreme.  He said that education in Ireland, especially since the early sixties, illustrated the <i>ad hoc</i> pattern with three classic examples, primary school consolidation, the university merger and community schools, occurring in an unnatural sequence, first level, third level and second level.  The credo of the initiators of the <i>ad hoc</i> system in education seemed to reside in bigness, supposedly resulting in equal opportunities and improved education.  While I do not necessarily agree with his assumptions in regard to size and bigness I do share the view that in respect of these three classic areas of primary school consolidation, university merger and community schools, we have a supreme example of the <i>ad hoc</i> approach of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not know why there is this reluctance on the part of the Minister to get down to work.  We have many educationalists who could make a contribution even within a very short period, if there was a commission on education appointed to map out the general areas of reform for the future. I am certain they could make a report within 12 or 18 months which in many respects would be revolutionary in regard to educational reform.  The Labour Party have suggested to the Minister that he should consider the setting up of a select committee of the House on education.  It is most unsatisfactory to have only an annual estimate on which there can only be a relatively short discussion on education after which we all return our files to their brown paper covers and the Minister says: &ldquo;Thank God that is over.  Did they not drag it out a lot this year?&rdquo;  There is no continuing discussion <Col N="323" /> on education at parliamentary level, no opportunity to meet the staff of the Department and have a discussion with them on educational reform.</P>
    <P>I am in the peculiar position that when I worked in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as an official I had far more contact with the Department of Education and the industrial training side of the Department of Labour and in many respects could exert far greater influence in conveying official views and have access to much more information and have much greater freedom of discussion than I can now as a Member of Parliament because, as a Member of the House one is in a political setting and naturally does not want to prejudice or in any way embarrass <Col N="324" /> public officials who must serve a Government composed of members of a political party.  On the Opposition benches there are at least a half-dozen people who could usefully contribute to the constructive development of educational policy.  That is why I suggest a committee of the House and I hope this will come in the parliamentary reform proposals now before the political parties.  I am certain we shall have this structure and on that basis they could make a very effective contribution to future progress.</P>

      <P>Agricultural land holdings with valuations not exceeding £20 are totally de-rated.  While the net rates payable on higher land valuations depend on the rate in the pound levied in each county the effect of the primary and supplementary allowances financed from the agricultural grant is to reduce the valuation on which rates are assessed below the rateable valuation. The effect of these reductions is set out in the following statement which I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report.</P>

    <P>(1)  The figures for rates are the amounts paid, in lieu of rates, by tenants of local authority dwellings under section 9 of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928.  They are not charges for the houses but for health, roads, etc., services provided by local authorities.  They include some small amounts for rates on purchased local authority dwellings.</P>
    <P>(2)  The figures at (3) and (4) are estimated.</P>

The corresponding figure for Northern Ireland was £20.4 million, of which £4.9 million was provided from rates, and £15.5 million was provided from State grants.  Comparative figures in respect of the year 1970-71 are not yet available.</P>
