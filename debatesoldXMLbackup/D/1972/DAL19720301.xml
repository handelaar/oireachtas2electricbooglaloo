      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Attorney General has yet furnished his observations on the implications of the recent retrospective legislation passed by the British Parliament; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just received observations by the Attorney General on the subject and I have not yet had an opportunity of considering them fully.  Accordingly, I am not yet in a position to make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that the legislation in question tends to make an offence an act which was not an offence or against the law on the date it was committed.  Irrespective of any undertakings which may have been given in the British Parliament, that is the position.  I think the Taoiseach will agree that if that is the position it offends against the European Convention of Human Rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I have indicated in my reply, I received only a short <Col N="680" /> time ago observations by the Attorney General.  I should prefer to examine those observations first before any action is taken or statement made on the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Britain is a party to the European agreement relating to persons participating in proceedings of the European Commission and Court of Human Rights.  The provisions of Article 3 of the Agreement, concerning the rights of detained persons appear to apply only in cases of individual applications to the Commission and Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's contention that it is permissible to continue the practice whereby the files and papers of lawyers visiting internees and detainees may be examined, as they are being examined, by the jailers in the concentration camps in the North <Col N="686" /> of Ireland?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interpreting the meaning of the Convention and that does not mean that I regard it as permissible. The provisions of Article 3 relate to people who will be giving evidence before the court, and it is in terms of the evidence they will be giving to that court, that the special protection inquired into by the Deputy would stand.  Our case to the Commission on Human Rights is a case brought by a State against another State, and not by individuals.  If individuals were called as witnesses, or if they brought the case themselves, this Convention would be used to protect them in the way the Deputy wants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

Surely now is the time to make the complaint so as to ensure that abuses do not occur in the process of the collection of evidence which is going on all the time?</P>

      <P>I am advised that the provisions of Article 3 do not apply to any of the people mentioned, detainees or internees, in our application.

      <P>On 22nd February last, I met the chairman and chief executives of Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus, the B &amp; I Company and CIE.  We reviewed the general tourism situation and discussed the progress of the various measures in hands to attract additional traffic for the coming season.  I am satisfied that the measures being adopted are the best that can be devised in the present circumstances.</P>
      <P>On the specific question of fares, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to questions on 22nd February in the course of which I explained that there is already in operation an extensive range of excursion fares, special interest rates, group rates and other forms of incentive fares which effectively reduce travel costs for many visitors.  In addition, the transport companies, in co-operation with Bord Fáilte, are combining with coach companies, car-hire firms and hotels, guesthouses and farmhouses to offer a series of very competitive package holidays.  These are based on very substantial concessions on published travel and accommodation rates.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether, in view of the need to rationalise the roles of the State-sponsored bodies engaged in tourism and to secure their fullest co-operation with the private sector, he will now take steps to establish a national tourism authority; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte Éireann are the national tourism organisation, set up by the Oireachtas with the function of encouraging and promoting the development of tourist traffic in and to the State.  The board have the central responsibility for the tourist development programme.  This entails the co-ordination of the efforts of the many and varied interests, both in the public sector and the private sector, which make up the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a number of State-sponsored <Col N="690" /> bodies whose functions and activities fall partly within the sphere of tourism. These include the air companies, the B &amp; I Company, Córas Iompair Éireann and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I am satisfied about the role and objectives of these bodies and I do not consider that any significant changes are necessary. Neither do I see the need for the establishment of any additional organisation which in my view would have no useful role.</P>
    <P>There are adequate arrangements to ensure optimum co-operation between the various bodies in areas of common interest.  I have explained these arrangements in reply to previous Questions on 4th August, 1971, and 11th February.  I am satisfied that there is a high level of co-operation throughout the tourist industry, including both public and private sectors, and this is exemplified in the special marketing campaigns now in progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister really aware of how serious the situation is at the moment regarding the State-sponsored bodies?  There are five State-sponsored bodies and eight regional tourism companies actively involved in the tourist industry.  Is the Minister aware that each of those 13 bodies is accountable to a separate board of directors, and that there is no person with overall responsibility for the control of these organisations, and to ensure that their policies are coordinated? The Minister admitted here last week that he had no control over CIE to prevent them from closing their offices in Britain.  Surely there is need for an overall authority to ensure that the State bodies co-ordinate their activities and co-operate with private enterprise, and to ensure that none of them will take unilateral action which might be advantageous to the individual company and which could be detrimental to the entire tourist industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that under Article 4 of the Housing Regulations dated 13th April, 1967, a tenant purchaser who subscribes to a purchase scheme during the first year (or weeks) of the tenancy, would not qualify for any State or local authority housing aids or grants as he would not have the benefit of State subsidy under section 44 (2) of the Housing Act, 1966, or the site subsidy under section 44 (3) or State grant under sections 15 or 16, or local authority supplementary grant under section 26, or temporary relief of rates under section 33; if it is the intention of his Department to deal with local authority tenant purchasers in such a way that persons, and such persons only, are not given housing aids readily available to all other categories without a means test; and if it is his intention to rectify this anomaly by permitting the application of grants and rate relief pending an amendment of Article 4 of the Regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the housing aids referred to by the Deputy is to encourage persons who can afford to do so to provide their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal objective of the local authority housing programme is to provide houses for letting for those persons without decent accommodation who cannot afford to buy.  If a tenant wishes to buy his house during the first year of tenancy he may do so with the equivalent of a 100 per cent loan provided the local authority decide to make a purchase scheme for the house. The tenant would also qualify for discount off the purchase price if he had <Col N="705" /> been in continuous occupation of other local authority houses and his existing house for a period of more than five years.  If a local authority have a demand for purchase type houses it is open to them to provide a tenant purchase scheme with the aid of State and supplementary grants and site subsidy where appropriate.  Tenant purchase houses qualify for the rate remission that applies to other grant-aided houses.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to alter the existing statutory arrangements for the provision of the various types of housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that houses which are purchased within a short while of erection by the local authority do not qualify for the remission of rates and, therefore, the only people who pay full rates from the very start are tenants of local authority houses and those people?  Is he telling the House that because somebody is unable to raise the money to build his own house, if that house is built by a local authority and the tenant purchases it within the first year or so he will be asked to pay the full amount, whereas the wealthy person who builds a house beside him can get a grant of £325 from the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary cannot be serious.  There are no facilities available after five years.  If a person purchases a house he does not get any grant from the Department or the local authority.  The Parliamentary Secretary, therefore, must be aware that such people do not get facilities no matter how long they are in the house.</P>

The remaining portion in respect of which an objection was received was the subject of a public local inquiry which was adjourned <i>sine die</i> with the consent of both parties to enable negotiations to take place.

Further, is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that county councils are not able to provide necessary employment because the grants are not being made by the Department?  In fact, if we were to take into consideration the devaluation in money, we would need to be getting £120,000 more than we were getting in 1965 instead of getting £65,000 less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemption granted by section 43 of the Finance Act, 1968 in respect of vehicles specially constructed or adapted for the use of invalids as drivers applies only where the invalid is wholly or almost wholly without the use of both of his legs.  The key point as to whether any particular vehicle qualifies for exemption is whether it has been specially constructed or adapted for use, as driver, by a person so incapacitated and the fact that a vehicle has an automatic gear change does not rule it out for consideration in this respect.  I do not intend proposing any change in the law on this matter.</P>

      <P>Any action to be taken in regard to such an incident is fundamentally for the local authority, operating under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, or the Sanitary Services Acts.</P>
      <P>I take it that the incident to which the Deputies refer is one which took place at Sandymount Strand last August.  I understand that Dublin Corporation took the matter up with the firm concerned, who claimed that the incident was an isolated one which arose due to a misunderstanding of instructions given to one of their employees and that they have also indicated in a letter dated 29th September, 1971, to the corporation that they had ceased all dumping in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 58 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The approval which was granted subject to conditions by my predecessor on 8th February, 1967, for the erection of a ready-mixed concrete plant on a site on reclaimed land at Pigeon House/Beach Road expired on 7th February, 1972.  I understand that on 23rd December, 1971, an application was made to the planning authority for the continuance of the use of the concrete plant for a further five years and that the planning authority have decided to grant approval for the retention of the use of the plant for a period of five years commencing on 8th February, 1972.</P>
      <P>Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning authority has a right of appeal to me under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, within the appropriate period, that is, up to and including 13th March, 1972.  As I have an appeal under that Act, it would not be proper for me to comment further on the issue of renewal of the permission given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enforcement of planning control and the securing of compliance with conditions attaching to planning permissions are fundamentally matters for the planning authority.  In addition to the time-limit imposed in the grant of approval of 8th February, 1967, there were conditions attached to the use of the causeway across the strand as a means of access to the plant.  I understand that the planning authority kept the enforcement of this condition under constant review and received every co-operation from the owners of the plant and that, in any <Col N="719" /> event, for some time past the access to the causeway from Beach Road has been closed.</P>

      <P>Last night I mentioned the need for a more comprehensive system of providing education, in their homes and in institutions, for the mentally and physically handicapped and I should like to comment on the matter in greater detail.  I should like to see a comprehensive system of education introduced which would ensure that children who are suffering from any kind of physical disability are not penalised later in life by reason of the fact that they are compelled in childhood to spend a considerable amount of time in hospital.</P>
      <P>This is an opportune moment to praise the religious orders for their work in providing education for handicapped children.  All Deputies and parents throughout the country are grateful for the wonderful work carried out by the religious orders and the lay people.  Their job is not easy, it requires dedication and expertise.  I should like to mention, in particular, the Irish Sisters of Charity who run a school in their orthopaedic hospital in my constituency, the Holy Faith nuns and the Sisters of Mercy who do wonderful work.  I have seen the religious orders carrying out their work and no greater tribute can be paid to them than to say that no other group could do their work with such efficiency and dedication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not for us to discuss in detail here the increased number of road traffic accidents in which many children <Col N="726" /> suffer limb and head injuries. Statistics in the United States indicate that before a child reaches the age of 12 years the chances are two to one that he will be involved in a road traffic accident and that he will suffer a head injury which can result in brain damage.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing number of mentally sub-normal children being born, and also an increasing number of normal children who are affected as a result of accidents or diseases.  It is opportune to mention here the cases of those who suffer from spina bifida, hydrocephalus and cysticfibrosis. Voluntary associations have been set try to bridge the gap between the Department of Education and the child in the home.</P>
    <P>Today there was the annual general meeting of the Irish Epileptics Association.  We have not available here the statistics relating to those who suffer from epilepsy.  We have not a treatment centre, yet one of the recommendations the association will make is that a treatment centre be set up.  If the Department of Health do this the Department of Education should attempt to set up a special school for the education of children suffering from epilepsy.  Incidentally, the association are attempting to change the term &ldquo;epilepsy&rdquo; to that of &ldquo;syncope&rdquo; in order to get rid of the old stigma attached to the word &ldquo;epilepsy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When the child reaches the age of 15 or 16 years the problem can be seen at its worst.  Irrespective of where the child receives his education, whether it be privately, with a religious order or under the auspices of the Department of Education, the problem arises in placing the child in society.  Here the greatest gap exists in our educational system and it should be bridged quickly in any solution we attempt to find for the education of the handicapped child.</P>
    <P>In industry a certain percentage of places should be allotted to handicapped children.  It is not sufficient to provide some form of education or skill without having co-ordination and collective responsibility between the <Col N="727" /> Department of Education and the Department of Industry and Commerce. A scheme should be worked out so that when the child is educated to a certain level in a particular skill the people in authority can know where vacancies exist, how many vacancies there are and what are the chances of the child being employed in constructive employment.  This can be very important for children who suffer from any incapacity.  They need to feel that they are doing the job as well as the next, that they are making progress at school as well as the next. They need to feel that they are good at the subject or subjects that are being taught.  We must get rid, as well as we can of the stigma of the word &ldquo;handicapped&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we can see the work that is being done by the Central Remedial Clinic.  We can see the results in the homes.  I should like to know how much money the Department are giving to the Central Remedial Clinic. I should like to know why a special fund-raising committee had to be set up to keep the clinic going, to keep functioning a clinic which was training and educating handicapped children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing fund raising for the Central Remedial Clinic, I am discussing the fact that there should not be any need for fund raising for the education of handicapped children. The Department of Education should supply sufficient funds to enable handicapped children to be educated without having to have so many flag days and charity walks and without different fund-raising committees having to be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> Last year we had the announcement that the Irish Epileptics Association were to get a grant of half the annual pay of one social worker per year towards their educational policy.  That type of thing is not relevant.  It does not carry any weight with me.  This problem should be tackled radically and with courage by the Government.  It has been there for long enough.  It has been swept under the carpet for long enough.  It should be approached in a realistic way.</P>
    <P>Any handicapped child who is going on to take the leaving certificate should not have to do compulsory Irish.  He should be exempted from it.  God only knows the trials and tribulations of having to study under adverse circumstances, without having to study compulsory Irish, the curriculum of which changes from year to year, the spelling of which is subject to change, and the pronunciation of which varies from school to school.</P>
    <P>To my mind, compulsory Irish is holding back many children, particularly those children resident in Dublin city and county.  Compulsory Irish has been murderous from the point of view of the revival of the Irish language.  The Fianna Fáil Government have undertaken a kamikaze operation in regard to compulsory Irish and the Irish language revival movement.  Compulsory Irish has killed the love of the language in many children at a very early age.  It is a difficult language to learn. If it is a learned properly there are many financial benefits to be gained from it. If it is not learned properly the child cannot receive a full certificate at the end of his secondary school education. In your second year in medical school if you do not pass Irish you are not allowed to go on to take your degree.</P>
    <P>The policy of compulsory Irish in the city of Dublin needs to be revised. On the one hand, the Government are attempting to go into Europe.  They are attempting to make students familiar with European languages.  On the other hand, many hours of primary and secondary school education are taken up with compulsory Irish which has shown itself over the years to be non-productive from the point of view <Col N="729" /> that it has not aided or abetted the revival of the Irish language.  In fact, the opposite is true.  It has helped to kill the Irish language, particularly in the city.  I have seen children who were frustrated in their education because they could not come to grips with the Irish language.  I have seen parents who were frustrated with regard to their children's education.  They knew it was being adversely affected by the way Irish was being, and I quote, &ldquo;shoved down their necks by the Department of Education.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot stress too strongly that the party of which I am a member are 100 per cent behind the revival of the Irish language, but we are not 100 per cent behind the compulsory revival policy which has been pursued by Fianna Fáil governments.  One has only to look at the figures.  One has only to look at the number of children who can speak it fluently to see that compulsory Irish has not resulted in the revival of the Irish language. Compulsory Irish should be dropped from the curricula of all Irish primary and secondary schools next year, and the language should be given a chance to be revived because of the love the Irish people have for it.  The language should not be killed by the forced learning of poems and essays and proverbs to get a child through an examination.</P>
    <P>In secondary schools in this city we have experienced the drilling and the learning by heart of different sections of the Irish curriculum, and of playing the odds to get sufficient marks to get the leaving certificate or the matriculation certificate.  How could we possibly hope to revive the language when 77 per cent of the pupils are in classes of 40 and more?  How could we hope to teach any subject successfully, let alone a difficult subject like Irish, and to get the optimum results, with such over-crowding?  The statistics show that 77 per cent of the children are in classes with more than 40 pupils.  This is not education.  This is the herding of children into classrooms, the progress through a curriculum, the marking of the roll, with a certain amount of recreational time, and then back home. Teachers in national schools in the <Col N="730" /> city of Dublin will tell you that they have too many pupils in their classes to be able to cope adequately with them, to be able to cope as they would like to cope with them, and to be able to teach them on the basis on which they would like to be able to teach them.</P>
    <P>The policy of education pursued in the city of Dublin is not at all satisfactory to my mind.  There was a time in this city when a child could go to a national school at the age of four years.  Now the age limit has been increased to five years in my constituency because the classes are so crowded.  It is not unrealistic to suggest that in time it might be raised to six years of age.  I have a 4½ year old daughter who is very intelligent and I cannot find any place in a school for her.  I could afford to send her to a private school.  Why should I because I have money, or if I had money, be able to have extra educational facilities for my daughter when those around me are dependent on the national school and are unable to get their children into a school until they reach five years of age?  It is not a good thing to have a child of four to 4½ years pottering around the house all day with little or no extra stimulation for the imagination.  That is a very important year in the formation of a child's mind.</P>
    <P>I would think that the overcrowding which exists, to the degree that it exists, is of a criminal nature from the point of view that it is merely seen that education is taking place in the national schools in this city when, in fact, we know, the parents know, the teachers know, that education is not taking place as it should take place in the national schools.</P>
    <P>I want to move to a particular aspect of education which has created quite an amount of controversy since the Minister first made his announcement. I refer to community schools.  What the Minister might do or might feel he wants to do in the case of new school buildings is largely a matter for the Minister, the local authority, the parents, the teaching orders and the lay teachers who are involved.  With regard to areas which have been statistically <Col N="731" /> worked out by his Department to come under an official board of management and to be taken over by the Department of Education, that is not the best solution.  Instead of community schools being forced into existence where individual schools exist there should be a policy of a community of schools whereby facilities available in one school would be made available to the pupils of the other, where recreational facilities, such as a swimming pool, available in one school would be made available to the other, where scientific laboratories in a boys' school would be made available at certain hours to the pupils of a girls' school, where facilities in technological schools would be made available to other schools, and that this would be left to the managers of the various schools to work out in practice.</P>
    <P>The question of handing over property to religious orders or of religious orders handing over property to the Government is a matter that has been exaggerated to an unfair degree. Certain people have attempted to imply that the religious orders were reluctant to hand over positions as school manager or as educationalists to lay teachers.  This is not at all the case.  There are many religious orders, the Holy Ghost Fathers, Jesuits, Carmelites, Christian Brothers, Spanish nuns, as in Finglas, who would gladly and willingly hand over the management of the school curriculum and teaching programme to lay teachers. But there are many aspects of school administration which take up a good deal of time.  Providing that the lay teacher was willing to spend the extra hours, sometimes on Saturday and Sunday, sometimes involving the burning of midnight oil, in management work, I do not think the religious orders would have much objection. That is my view from consultations I have had with them in regard to handing over the management of secondary schools to lay teachers.</P>
    <P>I want again to point to the dedication and achievements of religious orders in the field of education, not only in this country but on the missions. The first order that comes to <Col N="732" /> mind is the Holy Ghost Fathers.  Every Deputy knows the wonderful work they do at Rockwell College, St. Michael's, Blackrock College, Templeogue, St. Mary's Rathmines, and also on the missions.  For many years this has been the best contact this country has had with other countries.  We have the reputation of being the island of saints and scholars.  Religious missionaries have shown their enthusiasm for education.  I wonder does the Minister acknowledge the full extent to which parents and students have depended upon religious orders for their education.</P>
    <P>It would be most unwise to advocate any change in the present system because secondary school education has not as yet been proved to be intolerable, the religious orders have not been shown to be lacking in ability to educate.  I would leave well enough alone.  Otherwise, the Minister may have the education of many students thrown back to his responsibility.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word or two about a matter that the Minister did not mention in his introductory statement, namely, the National Council for Sport.  In July, 1969, the Taoiseach set up a fund of £100,000 to be distributed in such fashion as would stimulate the development of sport.  At that time, while welcoming the £100,000 and the recognition of the need for a more organised approach towards the provision of recreational facilities, I condemned the smallness of the provision.</P>
    <P>Last night I was browsing through some statistics and I find that, for instance, the amount of money which has been spent by successive Fianna Fáil senior and junior Ministers in sending Christmas cards to their constituents approximates to the amount allocated for sport in 1969.  It works out at something less than 2p per child per year.  Therefore, I would appeal for an increase in the provision for the stimulation of sporting activities.  They should increase this figure to a realistic level which I think, at the very least, would be £500,000 this year.  What, in fact, is being given for the stimulation of sport all through the country is <Col N="733" /> little more than the cost of the new swimming pool on the Mellowes Road, Finglas West, £136,000.</P>
    <P>The swimming pool which will be provided, as announced earlier at Ballymun, will also cost £136,000.  I am in the fortunate position in regard to sport that I am able to announce to my constituents through the Dáil that before the year is out they will have two full-size Olympic swimming pools.</P>

      <P>On 5th August, 1971, when speaking on the Adjournment debate in regard to recreational facilities, I was told by the Chair that it was the responsibility of the Department of Education.

      <P>As regards the physical education of the boys and girls of my constituency I should like to make my constituents aware that in West Finglas they will have a 25 metre swimming pool before the end of the year.  As regards the stimulation of physical activity in Ballymun I can also tell my constituents that with the help of Deputy Clinton and Deputy Belton we have procured plans, finance and a site for a £136,000 swimming pool and spectator accommodation for 150 people in Ballymun satellite town.  I feel sure these swimming pools were not provided without the advice and support of the Minister for Education and I thank him for anything he did in this regard.  The Government have always said they have collective responsibility which means there is co-operation between Departments.  Here, we have a case where the Department of Local Government and the Department of Education have co-operated.  The National Council for Sport will be very pleased to hear that two Olympic size pools are being made available in my constituency before the year is out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, as regards sports facilities in my constituency, we have four new football pitches and a new handball alley on Mellowes Road.  The new community centre was built at Mellowes Road with 1/- weekly collections from <Col N="735" /> the tenants of West Finglas who number 35,000.  The centre now has one of the most active gymnasia in Dublin city.  One need only visit the centre to see the result of the £800 granted to it last year by the Department of Education for gymnastic equipment.  On any Monday, Wednesday or Friday night one can see hundreds of children participating in healthy, athletic activity.</P>
    <P>All this was accomplished because the people of West Finglas were determined to provide themselves with a gymnasium-cum-community centre.  On behalf of the people of West Finglas I thank the Minister and his Department for the £800 grant following my representations. I sincerely hope their application for funds this year will be considered on its merits and that they will get a further grant of at least the same amount as last year.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to the members of the National Council for Sport who are all voluntary.  I think they should draw up a prototype plan which could be priced on a package-deal basis for every local authority and every type of school.  I can envisage such a plan comprising a 25 metre pool, a 25 metre gymnasium, three or four squash courts and handball alleys built, perhaps, on the Barna or some other such system and costing about £45,000.  It is not sufficient for the Parliamentary Secretary to refer merely to prototype plans. He should give details of the plans envisaged.  I hope that in summing up the Minister will not omit the question of sport as he did in his brief.  The Parliamentary Secretary rushed in in an effort to fill the gap in his speech.</P>
    <P>I would like to have more details as to the position of youth officers in the suburban areas of Dublin and in the various parts of the country.  I should like more information, too, regarding the regional council of sport that has been suggested by the National Council for Sport.  I would advocate the carrying out of a survey within the Department of Defence for the purpose of ascertaining what recreational facilities are available within their ambit and which could be used by students of primary, secondary and vocational <Col N="736" /> schools and by various organisations and groups in the city and country.  On the verge of my constituency there is a section of the Department of Defence in which there are three handball alleys but no member of the Albert College of Agriculture can obtain permission to play handball there during breaks. Most of these students are from the country and are very interested in handball.</P>
    <P>I might mention here the wonderful work that has been done by the Handball Association in sponsoring the handball championships.  Following representations made by me two handball alleys were built.  One of these was at Finglas but, unfortunately, it was built under the old system and does not conform with new designs although its measurements may be all right for international matters.  The other was built at Kilbarrack and it, too, was built under the old system.  Perhaps this indicates a lack of consultation between the Department of Local Government and Education.  I should like to know whether there is a member of the Irish Handball Association on the National Council for Sport.  I do not think there is because if that had been the case, handball alleys built recently would have been built in accordance with the new design laid down by the World Handball Championship Association.</P>
    <P>On many occasions here I have raised the question of these facilities. The Department of Education should recognise that handball is one of the most relaxing games that any student can play.  At UCD where a high proportion of the students are from rural areas there have never been any facilities for this game.  That is something that amazed me during my time there as a student.  Although a great politician of the past is Chancellor of that University, no facilities have been provided for handball, this game which originated in this country and spread throughout the world.  This is a scandalous situation and one that I hope will be remedied in the near future.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the new College of Physical Education is to be sited but I understand that there have been applications from 2,500 students <Col N="737" /> for the first year.  Deputy Coughlan inferred that it is to be built in Limerick but there was no reference to this in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech.  Perhaps the Minister could tell me where the college is to be located.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I have been keeping my ear to the ground, it is obvious that Deputy Coughlan has more information than I on the matter. I suggest that all students who are selected for admission to this college will be given the 100 per cent grant to cover living accommodation and fees.  It is important, in particular, that they get a grant towards their accommodation because those of us who have been at university are aware of the malnutrition of many students while they are trying to budget their money.  Because of the high fee and the cost of books and also the rents of bedsitters and flats which, we all know, are astronomical, students have to cut down on food expenses.  I suppose we may take it that rents for accommodation in Limerick will be astronomical also when the students go there because students at higher education level are not always the easiest to cater for.  They can be very high-spirited which, of course, is only natural.  A boy of 18 years of age setting out on an intensive course of physical education should have sufficient funds to ensure that he does not have to go on a bread-and-tea diet which is the sort of diet that many students at university are on at the moment.  The ideal situation would be one in which living-in accommodation was provided. Living on the campus is an intrinsic part of university education.  I am glad Limerick is getting a higher centre of learning.  It justly deserves it. For too long students from Limerick have been victimised because of the heavy expenses their parents have had to meet in order that their children might get a university degree or diploma in Galway, Cork or Dublin.  I know when I was at university we all had the greatest sympathy with these undergraduates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> The cost of maintaining a student in Dublin at the moment is astronomical. It is prohibitive for anyone in Limerick, unless he is extremely welloff, to send children to a higher centre of education in Dublin, Cork or Galway.  Because of that, the concept of free education for all and of equal opportunity for all is negatived.  Not only will fees have to be paid by the State and books and travel facilities provided by the State, but some form of maintenance grant will also have to be given to students attending higher centres of learning away from home. In years gone by Trinity College provided living accommodation on the campus.  That was the ideal situation. The number of students has now increased so much that living accommodation on the campus cannot be provided for all of them.  A hostel is being built at Belfield.  I trust a hostel will also be built in Limerick.  The Department of Defence give a very liberal allowance indeed to cadets taking degrees in Galway University and the Department of Education might take a close look at these allowances.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Council has been praised by the National Sports Council.  The National Youth Council have done wonderful work both in Dublin and throughout the country. They have succeeded where others failed.  They help the aged, the poor and the homeless as well as stimulating worthwhile activities amongst the youth.  The appointment of full-time youth organisers in suburban areas, working hand-in-hand with the different associations in the area, will be a great step forward.  Only those who operate in the field of public service appreciate the hardships and the difficulties suffered by the underprivileged in this city.  There are parts of the city which must be the worst slums in Europe.  The children go to school from the slum dwellings and the education they receive in the school is negatived by the environment to which they return every evening.</P>
    <P>A new detention centre is being provided in Finglas West to replace Marlborough House.  The latter has been condemned for many years by Dublin Corporation and was only kept <Col N="739" /> standing because it was battened with wooden posts.  I hope Finglas West will get priority in the appointment of a full-time youth officer.  In that way it will be possible to integrate children from broken homes who run foul of the law into the life of a normal community. The results Finglas West have achieved as a community are there to be seen.  These boys from the new detention centre can be integrated into the gymnastic classes, the swimming, the football teams and the various other sports catered for in that area. That can best be done by the appointment of a permanent full-time youth officer.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education have fallen down on the job of encouraging sport.  Deputy Molloy, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education at the time, was given charge of the new section set up to administer the £100,000 provided for this laudable purpose.  There was no special canvass to discover who was interested primarily in sport and who would best serve the section because he had that particular qualification.  Apparently some 40 civil servants were appointed to this section.  There were obviously no very bright ideas forthcoming from the section and so the Minister circularised sporting associations and asked them how he could spend this £100,000.  The result was the £100,000 was chopped up into little bits and the little bits were handed out to different sporting organisations.  This, of course, was of very little benefit.  Indeed, the £100,000 itself would only cover the cost of the Christmas cards sent out by Fianna Fáil Ministers during the past 15 years.  Such organisations as An Oige, the Inland Fisheries, the different shooting clubs, the coursing clubs, the hunting clubs, mountain climbing, adventure sports, the Boy Scouts of Ireland, Gasoga Caitoilicidhe na hÉireann, na Fianna scouts, the gliding clubs, swimming associations, sailing clubs, sailing schools, particularly that in Baltimore, the Handball Association, which acquitted itself so well in sponsoring the world handball championships last year&mdash;all these associations have shown their ability <Col N="740" /> and have proved themselves capable administrators of their different organisations.</P>
    <P>We have a mongrel-type department of sport; we should, to my mind, have a full department of sport, a full Ministry of Sport, Recreation and Environment. I called for the setting up of a Ministry of Sport 18 months ago and the response I got was the National Council for Sport.  That in itself is progress and I am grateful to the Taoiseach for giving his junior Minister that bit of authority.  I will not be happy until I see a full Ministry of Sport as other European countries have.  Sport, recreation and environment go hand in hand.  How often have we seen sporting amenities being spoiled by the Department of Local Government giving planning permission to a factory to throw its refuse in a particular area?  How often have we seen a river polluted and rendered useless for canoe races and fishing?  How often have we seen the drinking water in camp sites for boy scouts, which hitherto provided excellent facilities, polluted by the effluent from local authority housing estates or factories set up with planning permission?</P>
    <P>We have a great need for a full Ministry of Sport and Environment and there is nobody in this House or in the country who would condemn this concept.  Many people have called for a Ministry of Environment and a Ministry of Sport and a combination of the two is practical.  They are interwoven in their function of the protection and provision of recreational facilities.  We have many low-cost sports in this country which provide us with an international reputation as sportsmen.  We saw last year in Madrid the Irish Amateur Boxing Team achieving a very high standard of athletic performance in the European boxing championships and we have only seen the very tip of our athletic ability, our sporting ability, in the field of international competition.  I know many cases of athletes from working class areas in Dublin who could carry on their athletic activities and compete internationally, if provision should be made, as it is made in Great Britain, whereby they will not suffer a loss of income in relation to their <Col N="741" /> jobs or be sacked when they go abroad to represent this country in international sport.</P>
    <P>Some provision for this should be made in the coming winter, particularly as we are now in the year of the 1972 Olympics, and the 1972 Olympics will be the yardstick by which we can judge this new section of the Department of Education.  We are not going to be able to judge it by the number of medals the Irish Olympic team bring back but we can quite rightly and correctly judge it by the number of participants this country sends to the Munich Olympics and the sailing Olympics at Kiel.  We are not a country which participates in winter sports but we are an island surrounded by ports, an island where there is a sailing club in practically every port, which competes at interclub level.  We are a country which has one of the best sailing schools down in Baltimore, but in order to get that established, they had to work hand in hand with the French.  Anybody who is interested in sport should pay a trip to Baltimore where he will see the wonderful provision made by this club for training teenagers in the arts and skills of sailing.  At the same time as this school training association was set up, we had the Minister for Finance coming in here and committing a deed for which I will be a long time in forgiving him, when he raised the tax on yachts up to 33? per cent.  This at one stroke killed the sport of sailing in this country.</P>

      <P>The Chair would point out for the information of the Deputy that he has been referring to a Ministry of Sport which would require legislation.  The Chair has allowed the Deputy to go some little distance, but he may not advocate legislation on an Estimate.  The Deputy is confined to the administration of the Department by the Minister and is not permitted to range at large over adjacent subjects.</P>

      <P>In speaking of the responsibility of the Department in regard to sport.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary was very upset when he saw in relation to the sport of sailing, <Col N="742" /> in which the National Council for Sport are very interested, the stimulating of this natural amenity around our coast, inland sailing and sailing on the sea, another Department of State, showing a lack of co-operation between different Departments, knock that sport on the head with massive taxation.  We are coming up to the Kiel Olympics where the Irish Sailing Association will be sending a team and I say that the action of the Taoiseach in giving the Department of Education in July, 1969 a certain responsibility was either an empty political gesture or a realistic deed.  To my mind, it was an empty political gesture&mdash;£100,000 in 1969. And what this year?  Little more than the cost of one swimming pool.  How can the lower paid section of our community participate in these recreational facilities when on the one hand they are being priced completely out of the market, out of the sport&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair cannot permit the Deputy to go any further on that theme.  The Chair has been lenient enough with the Deputy in regard to the matter but at this stage the Chair is informing the Deputy that we are concerned with the administration of this Estimate during the year which ends on the 31st of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious to me that the responsibility of the Department of Education with regard to sport has been overlooked by this House, by the Minister in his opening statement, and by spokesmen for the different parties. Either the Department have responsibility for sport or they have not.  If we have a National Council for Sport they will be interested in the way in which the current amount of money allocated for sport will be spent.  They must be interested in the amount of money that will be given to subsidise the training of our Olympic team for the sailing events at Kiel and also for the athletic, boxing and field events that will be held at Munich.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is not the case my concept of the Parliamentary Secretary's responsibilities and my interpretation of the speeches made by people in Fianna Fáil are wrong.  If the National Council <Col N="743" /> for Sport are merely a political tool of Fianna Fáil they will not be long in disbanding.  Legislation provided for the allocation of money to the National Council for Sport through the Parliamentary Secretary.  If I cannot discuss the Olympic Games, the training facilities and the sports participated in by Irish athletes under an Estimate which covers the National Council for Sport something is wrong and I think the judgment of the Chair in this regard is defective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Parliamentary Secretary was obviously out of order in discussing the COSAC week in July but I shall not make any comment on it because I will be out of order.  I should like to see as many people as possible participate in COSAC week which has been arranged through the National Council for Sport.  I should like to see greater co-operation between the Department of Education through the National Council for Sport and the armed forces.  Those of us who have an interest in sport have thought that the armed forces were not given the proper stimulus necessary to encourage them to come up to international level.  The National Council for Sport can provide this stimulus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what the Garda Síochána did in the past in international rowing and boxing events and I am sure the Army could participate in international sports, apart from cross-country running and show jumping.  We will judge the success of the National Council for Sport and the activities of the Parliamentary Secretary not only on the COSAC week in July, 1972, but on the number of participants who go to the Munich Olympic Games.  Great credit is due to the GAA, the Football Association of Ireland, the Irish <Col N="744" /> Amateur Boxing Association, the BLE Association, the Rugby Football Union, the Handball Association and the Association of Outdoor Sports, An Oige and the other organisations who cater so well for sport.  I have seen at local level the wonderful spirit that is built up and the recreational facilities they have provided without any burden on the State.  I know of the many members for whom they cater, again without any burden on the State.</P>
    <P>We should re-appraise the situation with regard to sport.  We should give serious consideration to expanding the scope of activities of the National Council for Sport, of providing them with legislative power and not just have them as an advisory body to the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is appropriate to give them credit for the work they have done to date and to wish them the best of luck with the arduous task ahead of them.  The prototype plan, on which I hope the Minister will elaborate, and the possibility of more money being made available, are matters which should be dealt with by the Minister.  I should like him to refer to the fact that his Department have responsibility for the administration of this money for the stimulation and co-ordination of sport.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has insulted these 20 members, notwithstanding the fact that here are a group of people who come together on a regular <Col N="745" /> basis in order to consult about the future of sport.  As one who is closely associated with a number of sports groups, not least in the city and county of Dublin, I can inform the House that the National Council for Sport are functioning extraordinarily well.  Out of a membership of 20 or 25 persons, not less than 18 or 19 are present at every meeting and this is a wonderful tribute to them.  I accept entirely the criticism that the moneys made available to this council are not altogether adequate but it is fair to point out that the council were set up in 1969 and at that time the £100,000 given was a fair indication of the future intentions of the Government in relation to sport generally.  The unfair criticism offered to these excellent people, and to the concept generally, by Deputy Byrne is a very humiliating attempt to denigrate people working on a voluntary basis.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's attempt to supress my right to free speech in this House is to be condemned. It was an hysterical intervention based on my exposure of the Deputy's unfair condemnation of what I consider to be an excellent body of people and an excellent organisation, the National Council for Sport.  We have to get our priorities right.  I agree that sport is a very important priority in terms of the nation's health.  A healthy nation, so the cliché goes, is a wealthy nation.  I accept that, but I am entitled to protect the good name of these people who have been serving with honour, integrity and dignity on a free and voluntary basis on the National Council for Sport.  It is a tribute to the work being done by them that in the city of Dublin we have Olympic games organised on a residential association basis.  This did not exist before and it is to the credit of the organisation that they recognise the necessity for activities of that kind. Deputy Byrne offered unfair and mean criticism of these people and of the whole concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in this country what I call &ldquo;the knockers within&rdquo;.  We have enough knockers without the country <Col N="747" /> but we also have knockers within the country.  We seem to have a great capacity, as a nation, for running down one another and for running down our own institutions.  At this time in our history we should pull ourselves up by our shoe-straps, as it were, in the intellectual and philosophical sense, and stand up for one another.  We should stand up for the idea of Ireland, instead of giving the enemies without the opportunity to use our own expressions of view in relation to given institutions as fodder against ourselves.  This is the time to say that.  We have the knockers within and the knockers without, and the enemies within and the enemies without.  This country has suffered enough from people within who are anti-everything.  This is why I get so annoyed when I hear Deputy Byrne expressing a point of view against a grand organisation.</P>
    <P>Many organisations have received small sums of money, I agree, since 1969 to support them.  Many organisations around the country appreciate the moneys, however small, which have been given to them to help them to attain their objectives.  That has happened since 1969.  Could we not give credit where credit is due?  I have no doubt that there are other Deputy Byrnes in the country who lend support to my theory of the knockers within and without.  He is one of the knockers within and he should be ashamed of himself.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to detain the House at any length.  I had intended to make a short contribution on the subject of the community schools and the Minister's standard of integrity on this whole issue.  He has been consistent on the issue of community schools and this is to his credit.  I do not believe in sycophancy and I do not believe in giving credit where credit is not due.  On this issue I give credit where it is due.  I do not think I have the reputation of being a person who goes around tipping his hat to people just because they happen to be in given places.  I will be as critical as the next, but a great deal of credit is due to the Minister for his stand on community schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> There is one Dublin county councillor&mdash;I expect I cannot mention him because he is a close relation of mine &mdash;who supports the Minister in his stand on community schools.  I do not want to go too near the familial bone but, nevertheless, it is fair to say that he is one man who in this whole controversy stood up honourably and was counted in the context of the Minister's own stand.  A leader writer in some national newspaper, which I cannot quite remember at the moment, said that the Minister did not give a lead on this issue and other issues.  If his stand on the community schools cannot be described as leadership, I would not know how it can be described.</P>
    <P>The real tragedy in this case was the attitude of the Opposition parties. Their performance was tragic to say the very least of it.  Whatever we can describe ourselves as, I would hope that we could describe ourselves as non-sectarian.  One of the foulest allegations made against this party and the Minister in the community schools controversy was an allegation of sectarian bias.  I have had the privilege of representing the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown since April, 1965.  This constituency has a very large number of people who are not Catholics.  For almost seven years now I have had the privilege of representing all sections of the community and I have never had one complaint against the Fianna Fáil Party of sectarianism. We might be accused of a lot, but please do not accuse us of sectarianism because that accusation is not true.</P>
    <P>The most hurtful suggestion you could make against any political party in this part of the country is that they are sectarian.  In the past 50 years there have been isolated incidents in which it could be suggested that there was sectarianism but, in the main, we have not got a bad record in that connection. In fact, we bend over backwards, and rightly so, to show a lack of bias to any section of the community in that context.  The Opposition parties do not seem to be able to make up their minds as to what policy they have in relation to community schools <Col N="749" /> and the future development of postprimary education.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, you had Deputy FitzGerald oscillating from, apparently, wholehearted acceptance of the idea of community schools to a completely defeatist attitude, the impossibility of realising it in the practical situation in which we find ourselves. He floundered around in most unusual fashion.  He made a number of accusations which were totally without foundation.  It only served to show his own lack of familiarity with the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>He accused the Catholic bishops of attempting to take over the religious secondary schools and was sharply rebuffed by the religious themselves for this piece of fanciful nonsense.  He then dropped that particular accusation like a hot potato but persisted in propagating the notion that the Catholic bishops wanted to take over the vocational schools.  Cardinal Conway has recently given the lie to that accusation.</P>
    <P>I felt that quite a number of his colleagues were not associating themselves with him.  He is spokesman for the Fine Gael Party on education and on many other things.  I am getting quite confused as to what exactly is his front bench ministry, he speaks on so many subjects at such great length, with apparent erudition.  So, I am just assuming that he is the spokesman on education.  When he finally plucked up the courage to issue a policy statement the best he could do was to try to placate as many of the institutional interests as possible by producing a hotchpotch which went a bit of the road with everyone without regard to whether anything could be achieved in these circumstances.  The only people that he did forget to mention in the context of this fanciful document, this pleasing document, a document which set out to please everyone and did not succeed in doing so&mdash;the only people he forgot to mention were the children and of course, in the usual fashion, he studiously avoided any question of the overall cost involved.  The most charitable thing that can be said about the statement is that he was forced to <Col N="750" /> accept the lowest common denominator of conflicting views within his own party.</P>
    <P>That is the only way I can read this statement from Deputy FitzGerald, for whom I have&mdash;let us be fair about it&mdash; a respect.  He is an extremely able Deputy, energetically able.  As for some of his hand-me-down statements, from time to time these are questionable but I give him credit for his extremely energetic and able fashion of putting forward an argument.  That cannot be taken from him and it is not my intention to take that from him.  As an Opposition Deputy, he does a good job and I hope he will continue to be an Opposition Deputy doing an excellent job for a long time to come.</P>

I leave it to the people to decide whether they should have him in office or not. The lowest common denominator of the conflicting views within the Fine Gael Party were accepted and that is produced as a policy document on community schools.  There is probably a limit to what Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Clinton will accept.  However, that is just a point of view.  I hope it is taken in the best possible sense.</P>

The Deputy will have an opportunity of replying.  I at all times ensured, when I was mentioning Deputy FitzGerald, that I was in no way personal to him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My best advice to the Deputy is that he should keep quiet. He ought to be good enough&mdash;forgive me&mdash;to allow me to conclude the brief contribution which I intend to make on this extremely important Estimate. Deputy Desmond, with the assistance of occasional forays from Deputy Noel Browne and Deputy Justin Keating and, from time to time with the assistance of our friend, Deputy FitzGerald, has sought from the very beginning of this debate to make a sectarian issue of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>When he found, as he did find, that this was not the card to play, he tried to take credit, in a most unfair fashion, for what emerged eventually which, in my opinion, was the Minister's thinking all along.  He was prepared to discuss, to have conversations with various group interests and so on.  When he introduced his community school proposal, in the first instance, my personal interpretation of his thinking at that time was that it was at all times subject to revision, subject to adjustment.  What finally emerged was the Minister's and it was not as a result of pressure from Deputy Desmond or Deputy FitzGerald who tried to make, and almost succeeded in making, a sectarian issue of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond has done this without making any attempt to understand the attitude of either the Protestants or the Catholic community in this sensitive area.  He has chosen to ignore and to misrepresent the views of the Protestant Churches and the efforts of successive Governments to meet these views in a practical and in a realistic way.  He and other people have helped to propagate abroad the idea&mdash;and here again I talk about the enemy within, within ourselves, within the confines of our own shores&mdash;that <Col N="752" /> we discriminate against the Protestant minority in the matter of educational provision, despite the fact that it is accepted and acknowledged by the Protestant Church authorities that the opposite is the case.  I can support that proposition because I have been on many deputations with various interests in the context of the community schools matter&mdash;I will not say controversy because those who made it controversial are the people who did not want it to succeed and who introduced all sorts of obstacles in an effort&mdash;unsuccessful&mdash;to prevent the idea coming to fruition.</P>
    <P>The tactics adopted by Deputy Desmond were for purely party political purposes, again as I see it, as a purely personal point of view, as all points of view are.  For purely party political motives he has done grave damage to the image of this country abroad and has provided a readymade debating point for those Unionist politicians who are finding it extremely difficult to justify real sectarian practices in the Six Counties.  This sort of thing is not unlike his party leader's statements over the weekend from the Labour Party conference, packed to capacity&mdash;a room holding only ten is packed to capacity when there are ten in it&mdash;a euphemism.  We will not go into that.  Some of his own leader's statements at the Labour Party conference at Wexford were used to considerable effect by the hostile British Press and by the hostile British media. It was wonderful to see an Irish politician in this part of our country attacking the Government and, of course, the British using it to suit their own particular purposes as, indeed, Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien's point of view has been used to some considerable effect by the British in the United States of America, against the best interests of this country and against the best interests of what we are trying to achieve, namely, the reunification of the country.  It is that type of damage that accusations of sectarianism and the accusations which were made in the context of the debate in relation to community schools do to this nation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputies to be very careful <Col N="753" /> about the charges they make having regard to the climate of the times.  The community schools controversy is, I hope, now resolved and it is to the Minister's credit that he was not diverted from his path despite all the criticisms flung at him.  Despite these he pursued what he considered to be the right course and he has now been proved correct.  He can hold his head high on that account.  But for Opposition Deputies to take or attempt to take credit for what has emerged as the almost-final community schools policy in the Department of Education is, I think, a lie and a slander on the Minister.  They made every effort to subvert it; they did not succeed.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have shifted ground so often on this subject that it is an eloquent testimony to the Minister's stand on the matter and I think nobody doubts that these are the Minister's proposals or that future generations of Irish children will have cause to be grateful to the Minister who had the courage of his convictions.  And they were his convictions.  So many stories emanated from the Opposition in regard to community schools that their efforts became almost farcical in their bid to prevent the proposals coming to light as has now happened.  At the time I did not have an opportunity of putting my point of view on record in regard to community schools but I am glad to have done so now even at this late stage and to pay tribute to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The most hurtful aspect of the matter &mdash;we can all appreciate honest, fair controversy&mdash;the most foul accusation against the Minister and consequently against the Fianna Fáil Party was that in some way we were a sectarian party. Nothing is further from the truth.  The House has only my word for that.  I cannot go into my own family background in the context of being brought up in a community but I was never asked to make a judgment of a person on the basis of his or her religion.  I was brought up to believe&mdash;and the beliefs of this party are based on the same fact&mdash;that you judge a man or woman on his or her merits, his or her achievement as represented by the <Col N="754" /> contribution he or she makes to the community in any situation.</P>
    <P>Anybody who thinks that people in this part of the country are judged in the light of their religious beliefs is evil. Nothing could be further from the truth.  If I have to continue to repeat that I shall do so because as often as the cry of sectarianism is raised in this House it will be used by what I call the &ldquo;knockers&rdquo; without&mdash;those who are only too glad to be hostile to us. Statements of that kind reflect badly on the country and it is statements of that nature which are used by our enemies with which to whip this nation and justify their own infamous policy in regard to the areas where they consider they have jurisdiction for the time being.  There is no doubt that in the Six-County part of this country for the past 50 years there has been a gross and humiliating form of sectarianism practised through what I would describe as the system of administrative violence.  I imagine the British would do anything to justify their being there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While speaking more or less in favour of this motion last evening I indicated that I would be in favour of a three mile radius and, in certain circumstances, a five mile radius so far as the purchase of land is concerned.  In Westmeath when a farm of 300 or 400 acres is offered for sale, we contact the Land Commission. They send their inspectors to the area and very often report back to us to the effect that there is not sufficient congestion inside a mile radius of the estate concerned to justify their purchasing it.  The aim of the Government should be to acquire the greatest pool of land possible between now and our entry to the EEC so that such land will be ready for division among small farmers and landless men and so that accommodation plots can be given to deserving persons and to people who may have land on the 11-month system and who may have been earning their living for 20 years or so by dealing in cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the extent of the problem facing the Minister in this respect.  The present Minister is adopting a more progressive attitude than was ever adopted by any of his predecessors. He is to be complimented <Col N="757" /> on that.  For many years he has been an independent-minded man.  Perhaps he has suffered for that.</P>
    <P>I would regard anybody who is trying to make a living on a holding of less than 30 acres as being nothing less than a slave.  Such people are entitled to better treatment from the nation than they are getting.  Farmers have been in the front-line trenches in every war that we have experienced, whether national, social or economic. In order to illustrate the enormity of the problem facing the Minister and the Department I would point out that in 1969 there were 353,000 farms in Ireland and excluding holdings of between one-quarter and five acres there were 31,232 farms of less than 30 acres in the province of Leinster.  In Munster the number of holdings of less than 30 acres was 31,176; in Connacht the figure was 49,333 and in the Counties Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan there were 25,086 such farms.  These farms totalled 136,725 and they can be considered as being uneconomic holdings. These farmers are entitled to more land and that is one of the reasons I would go along with a five-mile radius. The number of holdings that can be classified as uneconomic amount to 45 per cent of the total number of farms in the country and we find if we take into consideration those holdings of between one and five acres, that the total number that can be considered as uneconomic is 60 per cent.  Of course, many people with holdings of less than five acres are not depending on their holding for a livelihood.  Since the pool of land that would be necessary to render these holdings economic is not available, we can understand the extent of the problem facing the Minister.</P>
    <P>So far as land is concerned, the issue has never been one for politics. There is no doubt as to the need for a major re-organisation of the structure of the Land Commission so as to reverse the present unhealthy trend towards the elimination of the farm family.  Therefore, it is necessary for the Land Commission to acquire more land for division.</P>
    <P>Up to recently some politicians, including myself and, I think, the <Col N="758" /> Minister, had been saying that the days of the Land Commission were numbered, that they had accomplished much of their work.  However, as I see the position now there has never been more need for a body like them than there is today.  I say this so that the land will not fall into the hands of foreigners or, indeed, into the hands of Irish speculators.  There should be restructuring of the Land Commission to enable them to acquire the greatest pool of land possible which they can sell if necessary, let on a long-term basis, or allot to smallholders as they have been doing.  In certain cases land should be given to farmers' sons and landless men.  The commission should be agents for the purpose of administering a land policy.  Too much of our land is falling into the hands of national speculators&mdash;builders, doctors, veterinary surgeons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and other people who are not interested in land but who are interested in evading income tax.  Such people are not making the best use of land they acquire while there are many small farmers existing in slavery.  These small farmers sometimes make arrangements to get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but when they go to the auctioning of whatever land they are interested in they may find that the local veterinary surgeon or some other such person buys the land.  Is it any wonder that very often there is much frustration among smallholders on this account?  There should be an accelerated drive on the part of the Land Commission to build up uneconomic holdings to conform with modern requirements and by that I mean that they should aim at holdings of not less than 60 acres of good land.  The family farm must be capable of yielding a standard of living that compares satisfactorily with what is available to those engaged in non-agricultural employment.</P>

      <P>Deputy L'Estrange will appreciate that this is not a general debate.  The motion relates to the distance of an applicant <Col N="759" /> from the farm that is being divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I want to say that the policy of the Land Commission up to now in adhering to the one-mile limit has resulted in untold harm.  The work force in agriculture has declined by 173,000 during the past 20 years.  Almost 40 per cent of persons born since the establishment of the State have emigrated permanently. This can be attributed to the lack of powers of the Land Commission and to their being confined to a one-mile limit.</P>
      <P>I might point out also, that Ireland is the only country in the world that has suffered a decline in population. Our population has decreased by 6 per cent during the past 50 years while the population of the world generally has increased by about 85 per cent. The decline in the number of people between 20 and 45 years of age has been more rapid in the past 50 years than in the preceding 50 and has declined during the past 20 years at a greater rate than at any other time since the Famine.  In many cases the Land Commission were forced to give land to unmarried people, including some old bachelors, because they were not allowed to go outside the mile limit.  If they had not had to work within that restriction they could have given land to young married men who would have made a success of it.</P>
      <P>Because of the failure of Land Commission policy the number of farms decreased in the ten years 1956-1966 by 34,000.  Now some people would claim that the terms of this motion would result in differentiation as against the people of the west because if the distance is extended from one mile to five miles that will prevent those in the west getting land in the Midlands.  We do not want any discrimination against the west.  Those of them who have migrated to the midlands have made excellent use of the land.  If the extension asked for is made, then instead of the land going to speculators and others, it will go to small farmers and landless men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many landless men in Longford/Westmeath.  Some years ago <Col N="760" /> I gave the Minister a figure of 500 young people with no land.  Though they had no land they were engaged in farming.  They took land on the 11-months system and they made a living for themselves and their families. Because farmers are generally better off today land is no longer being let on the 11-months system and these unfortunate men now have their backs to the wall.  The Minister promised last year that he would give these sympathetic consideration and actually some of them have got farms.  They will make excellent use of them.</P>
    <P>This enlightened approach by the Minister is very heartening.  Until the Minister took the initiative and made certain changes, no matter how deserving a small farmer was, if he was outside the mile limit, he just was not considered.  I know one area in Westmeath in which three unmarried brothers, all well over 50, got farms from the Land Commission.  In the same area there were two splendid young men, one with eight children and the other with six, who had gone to the local bank manager and purchased 18 acres of land and 20 acres of land respectively.  They purchased tractors and they raised cattle.  One had 15 or 16 cows and the other had 22 or 23 cows.  They were working a sevenday week and it was not a 40-hour week but a 100-hour week.  Because they were less than 200 yards from the land being divided both of them were passed over and three old bachelors all got farms.  This is a retrograde step. Rules and regulations are made to be broken but it was not until the present Minister took office that a more enlightened approach was adopted.</P>
    <P>I know a case in which land was divided into eight farms and four of those farms were given to four bachelors well over 60.  Struggling farmers who were just slightly outside the limit got no land.  These are the people who should get consideration.  Land should be given to young married couples with families and not to old bachelors.  In the Scully Report we find that in 54 per cent of the farms in the west the owners are unmarried and over 55 years of age.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission are responsible <Col N="761" /> for the plight of agriculture.  Their policy has been short-sighted and this iniquitous regulation has done untold harm.  I know of a farmer with five young children who was refused land because he was over a quarter of a mile outside the limit.  He had only a path into his house and he could not bring in any machinery.  Had he got land along the main road where the land was being divided he could have built a new house and provided his wife and children with frugal comfort. But the Land Commission refused to consider him for no other reason except that he was outside the one mile limit. In this particular case two farms were given to two bachelors over 60 years of age.  When Deputy Moran was Minister for Lands he said there was nothing sacred about the mile limit but when one approached the Land Commission one was invariably told this was the regulation.</P>
    <P>Land bonds have been mentioned. The Minister promised he would do something about land bonds.  The quicker he does something really radical about them the better it will be. At the moment it is nothing short of legalised robbery.  I wrote to the Minister about a case in which land was taken in 1967 and the man was promised 4½ per cent bonds.  He has not yet been paid and I think the bonds are now worth only £50 or £60 for every £100.  In the meantime he has bought a bit of land and he is paying interest to the bank.  This is absolutely unjust. If the Minister wants to get the maximum pool of land he will have to alter the present policy because, as Deputy Barrett said last night, nobody wants land bonds.</P>
    <P>I want to put to the Minister something which has happened and is happening at present.  There is a farm of land of over 300 acres.  The man concerned is a building contractor in Dublin and he is prepared to give it to the Land Commission but the Land Commission tell us that there are not sufficient farmers inside the mile area. There are farmers in Westmeath who are quite prepared to take this three and four miles, but as Deputy Tully stated, if you get sufficient inside the mile, then allocate inside the mile, and <Col N="762" /> if you go outside it, go outside. It would be much better to extend the mile to three miles or five miles so that the Minister would get the maximum amount of land.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on his more enlightened policy over the years and I hope he gets his head with regard to his policy for the western farmers which was announced three years ago.  It is an excellent policy to leave those people on their own small farms and to give them a few days work in the week at tourism, forestry, road work or industry, so that they can keep their small farms and through a combination of what they get out of the farm, plus the few days work, they can work in their own interests and in the interests of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank the Deputies for their contributions to this debate.  It is always nice to be praised or to have something friendly said about one, so I appreciate the remarks of Deputy Tully and Deputy L'Estrange so far as I am concerned. We discussed this motion in almost the same terms about 11 months ago and I was rather surprised that Deputy Tully sought to re-introduce it so soon because all the reasons I gave less than a year ago for rejecting the motion are, in my opinion, still valid and nothing has happened in the meantime to suggest that the change proposed in the motion ought to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that if the Land Commission were to extend the area within which farmers could qualify for land to a radius of five miles from the estate being divided, it would involve the Land Commission in questioning people in 80 square miles.  I tried to work this out&mdash;and I am not a noted mathematician&mdash;and it is something like 75 or 80 square miles, and this shows, I think, that the proposition is not sustainable. I have often stated in this House that the real problem, which was indicated by Deputy L'Estrange, is that we do not have enough land to cope with the problems of the thousands of farmers whose holdings are <Col N="763" /> now too small.  The truth is that we would need to take over the State of Texas, and maybe a couple of other States as well, before we could solve in a purely agricultural way the problems of the farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>We are not alone in this.  Other European countries and Governments have been working very hard in trying to reduce the incidence of fragmentation of farm holdings and I think it is true to say that all European Governments at present are trying to give farmers an opportunity of making the best of their land by giving them a single unit farm.  I do not accept now, and, indeed, my view on this has hardened in the past 12 months, that good farming&mdash;certainly the best farming&mdash;is possible where the parent holding and the parcel are separated by a considerable distance, and I can assure Deputy Tully and Deputy L'Estrange that if they were in my position, they would discover that every year there are literally thousands of applications from farmers who have land three, four and five miles away from their parent holding to the Land Commission to take it from them and give them some land closer by.  At the same time, there is, as I have said and as is agreed by the House, the practical problem that we simply do not have enough land to give every applicant what he desires and all the Land Commission can do in the circumstances with whatever land they have is to do the best job they can to build up farmers' holdings to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>The mile limit is not a rigid insistence on a precise mile.  This has been pointed out here by myself and my predecessors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Your predecessors stuck to it; you did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did extend it a little, but the mile as such was never, in fact, a rigid rule.  It was a practice rather than a rule.  There is, of course, always the possibility of a re-arrangement scheme where congestion exists, a re-arrangement scheme involving the migration of one or more of the congested <Col N="764" /> landowners to some other part of the country.  As I see Deputy Tully's view, the gravamen of his case is that migration should be ended.  I accept what Deputy Tully says, that the people who have come to Meath, Kildare, Dublin and so forth from the west were made welcome as, indeed, they were by the people of the east, but it is obvious that if there were to be an extension to three miles, as suggested by Deputy L'Estrange, or to five miles, as suggested by Deputy Tully, there could not possibly also be any migration.  I think Deputy Tully would accept the logic of this.</P>
      <P>I still hold the view that as far as possible migration from one county to another should end and this for social rather than for other reasons, because I would simply like to have employment for our people in our own counties and obviate the necessity of their having to be shifted, and it is the view of the majority of the Deputies in my county that migration, except within counties, should as soon as possible be terminated.</P>
      <P>We come back always to the question of the possibility of a farmer making a success of his business, and this is very closely connected with the type of farm he operates.  It has been well proved in every country, not just in Ireland, that if a farmer is operating on three or four parcels of land scattered here and there over a radius of two or three miles, his overall result is poor.  He has transport problems, management problems and so on, and there is a very significant increase in costs involved in the working of a parcel of land which is appreciably separated from the main farm.  These costs increase still further as the distance between the parcel and the main farm increases, so that you get a diminishing return from your investment, especially, as I have said, in labour and transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned last March, in the previous debate, the findings of a survey on this subject which had been carried out in Europe just before that time.  The findings revealed that in the sample covered by the study, although travel time between the parcels had been reduced by the advent of motor <Col N="765" /> transport, the costs of the transport were high and constituted a significant item in the total investment required. These costs were regarded by the survey team as a waste, and the recommendation was that they should be eliminated by a restructuring programme designed to create more compact farms.</P>
    <P>Of course an experienced farmer knows this anyway without the aid of scientific research.  We can all envisage a certain acreage which can be worked by one man if it were in a compact unit but which would necessitate the employment of help if it were broken up into several parcels some miles away from each other.  Not only will the costs of working the same acreage of land increase but the owner will almost certainly find himself very restricted in the type of enterprise which is then suitable.  This is a very significant point and one which I would ask the Deputies urging us to accept this motion to consider carefully.</P>
    <P>Granting all this then, the State, having invested in the purchase of land, must have regard to the optimum return obtainable from the investment and a person getting that must, in his own interest, make a similar judgement.  Last March I mentioned several reasons why the parent holding and the parcel should be as close together as possible.  These include the necessity nowadays of avoiding the creation of additional traffic hazards; the campaign by planning authorities to discourage the creation of farm openings leading directly on the main roads; the legal liability of farmers for skidding conditions created by stock on roads; and the difficulty of protecting an isolated parcel against trespass and damage.  There is no need for me to elaborate on these points this evening.</P>
    <P>In brief then, the weight of evidence, if I could use a legal phrase, is very much against the idea of allowing the Land Commission or asking the Land Commission to extend their radius of operation as regards the division of land to five miles as against the present, roughly, one mile limit.  This <Col N="766" /> is the evidence not merely from the thousands of requests from farmers in this country who want to give up land which is much nearer than five miles away from them but from all over the world as shown by the desire of farmers to have their land in a compact unit if at all possible and, if not, that any additional land should be as close by as they would desire.</P>
    <P>From a practical point of view I do not really see how the Land Commission could interview people over an area of 80 square miles every time they are dividing land.  I must say I admire the capacity of Deputy Tully to be able to talk for 40 minutes, and persuasively at that, on a proposition which I regard as totally unsustainable and which I think that the Deputy himself, on reflection, will realise is unsustainable also.  It is just not practicable. As Deputy Sylvester Barrett said, if the officials of the Land Commission are slow in dealing with applications within a radius of a mile, what would be the position if they had to examine everybody within 80 square miles every time they were going to divide a piece of land?  It is just ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sylvester Barrett also said that an anomaly existed in County Clare.  He did raise this problem last year.

      <P>Deputy L'Estrange had a query about the acquisition of land by speculators.  Although not really relevant to the debate this is a very important matter.  It is one with which I dealt in the House before and I think I made the situation clear.  As regards the Deputy's query all land is required for the purpose of division.  In regard to the case the Deputy was talking about, the Land Commission through their inspectorate will certainly put all the facts before the Commissioners who are responsible for making the ultimate decision.  As Minister, I am satisfied that, in general, the information furnished to the Commissioners by the staff is comprehensive.  That is really all I have to say on the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> Deputy Tully said to me before we took this motion that we would not have to sit here for three hours if I said I would accept it.

I take the other view for the reasons I have offered to the House and believe it would be a retrograde step to change the present policy along the lines suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this motion is an important one.  I believe Deputy Tully had very good reasons for bringing the motion before the House.  I have something to say which I believe will come in for quite an amount of criticism because it is something that very few people seem to agree with.  I believe the Irish Land Commission are doing a good job and I find that most of the officials from the inspectors to the men laying the fences are doing a very good job.  I said previously in the House that in regard to the division of land Solomon himself would not be able to divide land to the satisfaction of everybody because land is something which everybody wishes to own.  It stirs the emotions of almost everybody in an area when land is being divided.</P>
      <P>I have seen estates which the Land Commission have divided up.  I have seen houses, outhouses and fences which they have erected and I have been impressed by the work they have been doing.  If the Department of Local Government were as stringent in seeing that their houses were as well built as those built by the Land Commission, then all the houses in the country would be in much better condition.  I am only speaking of the Land Commission in Leix/Offaly, North Tipperary and Carlow/Kilkenny as they are areas I know well and in all those areas they have done wonderful work. It is very easy to ensure a good job is being done if, in fact, the people in charge look after it.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that.  I wish to enlarge the points I want to make.  I believe some figures are very relevant in regard to the Estimate for the Department of Lands.  In 1961-62 the allocation to that Department was £2,327,880 and for 1971-72 the allocation was £4,161,000.  Therefore, the amount of money given to the Land Commission in ten years was not even doubled.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1961-62 were granted £60,145,160 and in 1971-72 they were granted £72,772,000.</P>

      <P>I am coming to it.  The Department of Lands have not been allowed capital on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with other Departments and, therefore, they are not in a position to carry out work on the wide basis it is essential they should carry it out on.  In regard to the five-mile limit it is absolutely impossible for the Land Commission to carry out the necessary work because they are working on a shoestring.  The referendum on the EEC will be held some time during the summer months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been put off my point.  The point I am getting at is that the Land Commission have been too confined and restricted by the funds put at their disposal.  Like any individual, they should be enabled to purchase land on the open market and to divide it among people who need it in the area concerned.  In ten years the price of land has increased four or five times and because of this the Land Commission are limited in the amount of land they can acquire and divide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is quite relevant.  It is that the Land Commission should be enabled to expand, that they should be given sufficient capital, and I particularly urge that they be allowed to give land over a five-mile radius.  Occasionally a second son or a third son who would not fall in for the family holding could be given land within a five-mile area. This should be considered.  As I have said, the price of land has quadrupled in the past ten years and yet the Land Commission have not had their amount doubled.  I suggest that they should be given more capital and in this way be enabled to give land to people already engaged in agriculture, to people who do not own land but who have their own cows and send milk to the creameries, who rear pigs and sheep and so on.  They should be entitled to land.</P>
      <P>If the Land Commission are to pursue an effective policy it is essential they be given sufficient funds with which to do it.  I suggest that the land policy referred to in the white paper on EEC entry is not sufficiently detailed.  If we are to face up to Common Market potential it is essential that the Land Commission should be encouraged to purchase more land. They should be enabled to acquire all the suitable land that comes on the market.  The Minister-said it should be possible to ensure that Irish people should be able to get land in their own immediate localities.  I agree with this because people in their own localities will appreciate the type of farming and will be better able to use the land there to the best advantage.  At present there are safeguards in the Land Act to prevent foreigners from buying land but many people are not satisfied.</P>

All suitable applicants within a range of five miles of an estate should be given land.  Where possible, the land should be divided among the people in the area. Having regard to the amount of mechanisation in agriculture the old limit regarding distance is no longer relevant.  Many applicants who are living within the one-mile limit or even the five-mile limit find that the rents being charged are exorbitant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the purpose of the motion is to allow the Land Commission more room to be selective in the way they allocate the limited amount of land in their possession. They should not be limited in their choice to those who happen to live within a mile of an estate but should be able to consider those living outside that area who might be in a better position to work the land more efficiently.  I support the motion as framed on that basis.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Land Commission should ensure that they are able to give whatever land they have to smallholders or landless men who are best able to work the land.  They should not be constrained by any rules which were set in the thirties when transport and other matters relating to farm management were not as developed as today.  While it might have been difficult in the thirties to manage a farm that was more than a mile away, with modern transport it is easy to do so now.</P>
      <P>I foresee certain difficulties in setting a five-mile limit if it is expected that everyone within that radius must be interviewed and given a hearing.  If a person living, say, 4.8 miles from the estate is not interviewed he could have a grievance.  Obviously if everyone within the five-mile limit had to be interviewed the administrative job involved in allocating any estate would be very much greater than it is at present.  This would mean that the complaints already being made about land being too long in the possession of the Land Commission would be even more vociferously expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think the proposer of the motion has in mind that the Land Commission should keep going out as far as possible and when they have enough suitable applicants they should stop interviewing.  Obviously there will be room for doubt about what constitutes a suitable applicant and if the five-mile rule is applied I can foresee people who are within this area becoming aggrieved.  I can envisage many difficulties and ill-feeling developing <Col N="773" /> after the division of an estate.  However, on that basis I shall not reject the proposal out of hand, but it is a difficulty that must be dealt with because there is the danger of bad feeling arising afterwards.</P>
    <P>The solution to the problem is for the Land Commission to expand considerably the manner in which they allocate land.  The present system of giving people land from an estate which has been taken over is not the only way.  The Land Commission should consider the possibility of giving land to farmers on a long-term lease where this is appropriate.  Also, they should consider giving low interest loans to enable farmers to buy land that might come on the market.  Alternatively, if the Land Commission have bought land they might be prepared to allocate it to people within the county if they were able to put up some money themselves in addition to money the Land Commission would give at low interest rates.</P>
    <P>There are certain advantages in this system.  A man will not purchase land by means of a loan unless he has definite and worthwhile plans in mind regarding repayment of the loan.  At the moment the inspectors go round and they count the number of stock the man has, but they are not as well equipped to assess his capacity to make a good job of working the land as is the person concerned.  The man would be the best person to judge this if he knew he had to repay the loan.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that must be considered. While I would not be in favour of going over completely to a credit system, it should be tried in a few areas to find out if it provides a better criterion for dividing the land than the present systems.  Different estates could be allocated by way of different systems and this might get over the various difficulties that possibly lie behind this motion, at the same time meeting the valid case which is the basis on which the motion was introduced.  We cannot afford to be over-dogmatic in our approach to this matter.  We must be as experimental and pragmatic as possible and find the best way of giving land to the smallholder <Col N="774" /> who can make good use of it.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the consideration displayed by those who took part in the debate.  It showed that in most cases they had a clear understanding of what was meant by the motion but there were exceptions. I did not agree with many of the comments made and I regret that the motion was the cause of someone being insulting to the Minister.  During my time in the House the Minister has never been insulting to anyone and it is unfortunate that a Deputy should be allowed to behave in this way, particularly as the person concerned is a rare visitor in the House.</P>
      <P>Apparently some of the newspapers misreported a comment I made here last night about the Land League.  An official of the Land League suggested to me this morning&mdash;and when I read the three newspapers I realised which newspaper he had read&mdash;that I had said the Land League were breaking the law and that I would not be prepared to support them when they broke the law.  In fact, I went out of my way last night to point out that I believed the Land League were a law-abiding group and that I was prepared to support them, but that off-shoots of the Land League who have been breaking the law, and who apparently have encouraged others to break the law, would get no support from me.  I do not think they would get any support from any sensible person inside or outside this House.</P>

      <P>The Land League, like other organisations, are entitled to make peaceful protests.  I understand that at least one inspector has advised the Land Commission that it is not wise to purchase land in an area where the Land League are active.  If this is so, it is a mistake.  I was told very definitely that this has happened.  I asked for the source and I was told it was a letter which had been sent to a Fianna Fáil TD in a certain area from the Land Commission.  When I checked on the Fianna Fáil TD's name, I discovered that that Fianna Fáil gentleman does not grace the benches of <Col N="775" /> this House.  Maybe he has ambitions that way and therefore he was hawking around a letter which he thought would be of some use to him locally, even though he was stabbing his Minister in the back.  These things happen in the best regulated parties.</P>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Barrett missed the point.  I grant that he has a knowledge of the west of Ireland which I have not got, and I am sure he will accept that I have a knowledge of the east of Ireland, and particularly in my own constituency which he has not got. I can understand his point of view when he talked about what would happen if everyone within five miles of and area had to be interviewed before an extra half acre was given to somebody.  It was Deputy Kavanagh who pointed out that 51 per cent of all the land in the west is congested so I can understand Deputy Barret's difficulty.</P>
      <P>I did not say that everyone within five miles of an estate should be interviewed before the estate is divided.  I said very clearly that when the inspector goes down he should start on the edge of the estate and go around in circles until he had enough eligible people.  We have accused the Land Commission inspectors of going around in circles, and peculiar types of circles at times.  When we get the results we sometimes wonder at them.  Despite what was said here tonight, I believe that the Land Commission inspectors are given a job to do and do it to the best of their ability.  If we who know about the matter at local level find that it is wrong, that is just too bad.  I am quite sure they are not so dishonest as to do some of the things that are suggested about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Land Commission inspectors are so hide-bound with regulations that they insist on carrying a book in their pockets and, every time something comes up, they look at that book to see if they are allowed to do something and, if they are not allowed to do it, it is not done.  This is what I am trying to break down.  I do not know whether the Minister is quite aware of the situation in relation to the half-mile.  It is quite wrong to say that <Col N="776" /> a man who has no land cannot be considered if he lives more than half a mile from an estate.  If it had been a mile in both cases, perhaps it would not have looked so bad over the years. Now we have the &ldquo;half-milers&rdquo; and the &ldquo;milers&rdquo;.  It reminds me of Santry.</P>
    <P>We should not confine the allocation of land to people within a half-mile or a mile of an estate, and not go outside that no matter how well qualified those outside that area may be.  Deputy L'Estrange said that to his knowledge &mdash;and to my knowledge too&mdash;people have been debarred from getting land because they were a few hundred yards outside what the Land Commission inspector thought was the regulation distance.  The Minister very fairly said that there is no such regulation.  It existed only in the mind of a senior Land Commission official who handed it down.  There is nothing in the Land Acts, and there is nothing in any written regulation made in this House, which says that a landless man must be within half a mile, and a smallholder must be within a mile of an estate, or he is disqualified from getting a portion of land.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to do in this motion is to get the House to accept that the conditions should be relaxed so that the Land Commission inspector will get the best type of applicants in the area.  I believe he can do this without having to do all the extra work which has been suggested.  Deputy Barrett and Deputy Bruton&mdash;and the Minister confirmed it later&mdash;talked about the tremendous amount of work which would be involved and the big number of people who would have to be interviewed if this were put into operation.  First, I am not suggesting that everyone in the area should be interviewed.  Secondly, I am not suggesting that every man woman and child has to be interviewed.  As we all know the number of eligible people in a five-mile radius might be 100.</P>
    <P>When we go to the Land Commission on a deputation they can tell us the colour of the hair of the eldest child and what school the children went to.  The information they have picked up is very well documented. The &ldquo;nosey parkers&rdquo; who want to <Col N="777" /> hinder or help&mdash;I do not know which &mdash;supply this type of information to every public body.  The Land Commission have files and the Special Branch are only trotting after them when it comes to the information they have on applicants.  It is not necessary to interview everybody and the number who would be interviewed would not be nearly as great as is suggested.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments made&mdash;and it was made last year too&mdash;is that the pool of land is not big enough.  Of course we cannot supply land to everyone who wants it but will somebody tell me why a man with 300 or 400 acres of land which he is ranching should be allowed to buy every bit of land that comes up for sale in the area?  Every acre he buys is depriving some man who is in need of a bit of land.  This should be stopped.</P>
    <P>Despite the 1965 Land Act, and despite section 45 of that Act, foreigners are still buying land.  The Minister supplied me with an answer to a question over 12 months ago which horrified me.  Literally thousands of acres have been allowed to pass into the hands of foreigners.  Deputy Enright was ruled out of order when he referred to this.  I just want to make the passing reference that if we cannot do more to solve the problems of the landless men and the smallholders before we enter the EEC, if we ever do enter it, the first thing that will disappear will be the Land Commission.  I make that prophesy because they will not be able to compete with the prices which the continentals will be prepared to pay for the good land of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister had his tongue in his cheek when he was referring to the man who does not want to have his holding broken into two or three pieces because of the time it takes to go from one place to another.  If he lived in County Meath he might take a different view.  The man who has a small amount of land, and who must take conacre, often has to travel four, five, ten, 15 or 20 miles to and from his farm.  He must do it or he ceases to be a farmer.  Would it not suit him better if he were able to keep the portions of his holding even within five miles of each other?  Farmers are <Col N="778" /> continually looking for &ldquo;swaps&rdquo; so that they can have their portions of land together.  It is good that this should happen.  The opposite is the case with regard to the conacre farmer. I mentioned some of them who had to go out of business because they were not satisfied.  I am afraid I would not be prepared to agree that the cost of transport either in Europe or in this country is so great that it would put anybody out of business.  The man who travels around the country in a car at night could, I am sure, afford to spend a few shillings on diesel oil for his tractor during the day.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's other argument about the traffic hazards, he has a point but, of course, the man with the tractor is no more dangerous than anybody else on the road.  In fact, he is usually more careful.  It will not mean any additional openings on to the road from the field.  They will use the existing gates.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of stock on the roads, what we are trying to do here is to get stock off the roads.  As the Minister must know, the man who has no land or only a small portion of land uses the long acre.  The guards do not co-operate.  They are very antiagriculture when it comes to the question of a man using the best grass in the place.  They cannot see why the grass should be cropped by somebody's cows.  The Minister knows that the cottier puts the cows out only to make the place look better.  The guard will not accept that excuse and will usually prosecute.  One poor old lady was in court five times in two months because, having two or three cows and not enough land to feed them, she used the long acre.  If land were given to people like that it would take stock off the road rather than put them on to it.</P>
    <P>There is something which happens and I do not know whether it is done deliberately by the Land Commission or not.  A farmer may be within a mile of an estate that is to be divided. Somebody is brought up from the far end of the estate and is given the land nearest to him, with the result that he is then over one mile from the nearest part of the estate.  This should not happen.  I have got complaints <Col N="779" /> recently that this did, in fact, happen. The Land Commission should be more open about this.  So far as we are concerned, we want the regulations to operate so that those who are entitled to land will get it.</P>
    <P>As the Minister was generous in saying, particularly in Kildare and Meath, migrants have been treated as if they belonged to the place.  The Minister may not be aware of the fact that the bitterest opponents of additional migrants being brought in are those migrants who have already got land in the area.  I have attended numerous meetings.  They ask why should people be brought from Mayo, Galway or Donegal and given the land that they want.  They may have been there only ten years or a little more.  It shows that they realise the difficulties and that it does not help anybody to bring in other people and to give them land which they want for themselves. I happened to be present with a deputation to the Land Commission seeking more land than the 45 acres.  There was a farm going in an area.  It was felt that if they did not get an addition now, they would never get it.  This is a matter which the Land Commission will have to decide on.  It brings out Deputy L'Estrange's point about the number of eligible farmers.  What is an eligible farmer?  Who is an eligible applicant?  Does the Minister consider and, if so, will he convey his opinion to the Land Commission, that a conacre farmer who has been taking conacre consistently on or near an estate should be entitled to be considered for an addition?  There may be an estate which for years has been let either for tillage or grass and people who are just over a mile or two or three miles from that farm have been taking the land in conacre and have built up a living for themselves, even though they were paying excessive rent for the land. Is it not terribly annoying to them to find when the land is being divided that they are ruled out because somebody in the Land Commission years ago decided that a mile was far enough or, in the case of a landless man, that a half-mile was far enough?  These are <Col N="780" /> terribly important matters which should be considered.</P>
    <P>I have already said, and it must be repeated, and it cannot be repeated too often, that, as far as I know, this Minister does not interfere in the allocation of land.  I have again and again pointed out to people in my constituency that I consider that the Land Commission should not be influenced by politicians of any party when it comes to the question of allocation of land.  I have taken into the Land Commission people of every political persuasion. I have given them a recommendation if they were worthy of it and if they were not worthy of it I would not do it. Maybe I would do them more good if I did not give them a recommendation. That is another of the things that a politician has to put up with: he never knows.  If a man asks for a recommendation when applying for land, he is entitled to get it.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing which is terribly important.  Perhaps the Minister would do something about this. The Land Commission seem to have a right which is given to no other State body, that is, the right to give a vague reply to every letter written to them. If a Member of this House asks for information which the Land Commission have, that information should be given.  It is not enough to send out a stencilled reply in which certain items are filled in, sometimes incorrectly. Deputies do not want the information for themselves.  They need it to pass it on to the people who put us here. It is bad enough to get a stencilled reply but when the information contained in it is incorrect, it causes a bit of trouble and it does not help the blood pressure.  The Minister might suggest to the Land Commission that if a Member of the House&mdash;there are not so many Members&mdash;asks for information, that information should be given if it is available.  We are not interfering.  We are simply looking for facts.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to accept the motion, which simply means that if a farm is being divided the Land Commission inspector or inspectors should be able to find the number of people eligible for the land by starting <Col N="781" /> on the outskirts of the farm and moving outwards in a circle until eventually he finds enough people.  In that way we will improve agriculture <Col N="782" /> because we will be getting the best type of farmers.</P>

      <P>During Private Members' Time, Deputy Byrne, sensitive soul that he is, approached me and challenged me with making certain allegations against him in relation to charges, which he did not make, against the National Council for Sport. I would not like to upset the Deputy in any way.  I came into the House when he was about half-way through his contribution and I probably misunderstood what he said.

      <P>I hope the Deputy will now be able to have a restful night and that he will accept the withdrawal of my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before Private Members' Time I had been dealing at some length with the question of national and secondary schools in my constituency.  I had made the point that a number of national schools are required in the area and <Col N="784" /> in particular in the south-eastern part of that vast connurbation known as Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown.  I said that during Private Members' Time I would avail of the opportunity to obtain figures which would prove my case in relation to the necessity for both primary and secondary schools in that area.  The figures I have are interesting. A report was prepared for the Dublin Vocational Education Committee by a well-known firm of architects and planning consultants.  This report was presented to the VEC on the 5th May, 1971.  It was entitled &ldquo;Location of Second Level Education Facilities in Co. Dublin South East Suburbs&rdquo;.  Its authors were the firm of Delaney, MacVeigh and Pike.  The report was produced in a concise manner and is an excellent summary of the needs that I am referring to.  A preliminary report by the consultants, dated July, 1970, preceded the production of the County Dublin draft development plan which was drawn up in 1970.  The report reached a number of conclusions and I would ask the House to bear with me while I quote from the document at some considerable length because I consider it necessary to have some of their conclusions on the record of the House so as to support my argument when the Minister and his officials are studying the contributions on the Estimate. In the report the following conclusions were drawn:</P>
    <P>(a)  The Clonkeen catchment area contained approximately 12,700 persons in 1970 and was expected to increase to 13, 350 persons by 1975.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Cabinteely catchment area contained approximately 12,000 persons in 1970 and was expected to increase to 20,000 by 1975.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Cabinteely/Shankill catchment area contained approximately 16,300 persons in 1970 and was expected to increase to 24,500 in 1975.</P>
    <P>Apart from any sociological observations that anyone might like to make on these figures they must be seen to support fully my argument for the need for increased educational facilities for the areas mentioned, particularly at secondary level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> The draft development plan was adopted by Dublin County Council on the 11th February, 1971.  The report tells us that the land use allocations confirm the findings of the preliminary report, and that:</P>
    <P>Since much of its contents (objectives) are only concerned with the 5 year statutory period 1970-75, it is necessary to see beyond this period as far as catchment areas for a district educational facility is concerned. The 1970 Draft Plan (p. 83) makes provision for a Vocational School site at Cabinteely and Deansgrange.</P>
    <P>The report deals with the need for educational facilities and it has a rather interesting observation on growth development in this south-eastern suburb. It is an interesting survey and those who are familiar with the area realise the vast influx there has been of people into the area over the past decade.  I am a native of the Dún Laoghaire/ Rathdown area.  I was born in it and I am very familiar with it.  There has been a huge influx into this suburb. Land in the area is now at a premium as a result of that influx and, as far as Dún Laoghaire Corporation is concerned, there is no more building land available and the corporation is now using land given by Dublin County Council.  That will give some idea of how serious the situation is.  I quote again from the report:</P>
    <P>
      <i>1975 and Beyond:</i> Ultimately, development's landward spread will be halted at the Dublin Mountain foothills or base-line.  For medium term purposes it is suggested that urban development is likely to proceed as far inward up to the line of the proposed trunk road from the city by-passing Bray and generally known as the Enniskerry bypass.</P>
    <P>Those indigenous to the area know where that is.</P>
    <P>Drainage facilities would have to be provided for much of these lands but the inevitability of their being developed is not difficult to imagine when it includes premises&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I do not think I should name the particular <Col N="786" /> premises, but there is there a very large tract of land.</P>
    <P>In the short term, therefore, the Bray Road would form the landward boundary of the study area; in the medium/long term, the Bray Road would form the axis or spine of a five miles long by one and a half miles deep linear subsurb.</P>
    <P>The report then deals with catchments, the Cabinteely and Deansgrange sites and the question of services and transport. I am sure the Department has this excellently prepared report.  It is a report which sets a headline for reports.  It sets out briefly exactly what the problem is.  It discusses the problem briefly and reaches very definite conclusions and all this is done in the space of four and a half pages.</P>
    <P>I have a note from Deputy Byrne in which he acknowledges my withdrawal of the charges I made against him.  I hope we will now be able to forgive and forget the particular incident.  I appreciate the Deputy's note and I refer to it in order to get it on the record of the House.</P>

I know he will take action on what I have deliberately read into the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A national school is very badly needed by the Sisters of Mercy in Dún Laoghaire.  I have made representations to the Department about this and I have received the usual acknowledgements. I am most anxious that something should be done.  The existing school dates back to the middle of the <Col N="787" /> last century and is in a very poor state of repair.  It has none of the facilities that are now demanded.  I make no apology for describing schools like this as &ldquo;national schools&rdquo;.  I am proud to say that my own children are attending the national school in Blackrock where they are receiving an excellent education.  I see no reason for the sort of snobbish sensitivity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are about the size of the Dáil floor there, which is a fair size for any class.  I make no reflection on the facilities that were available in my time.  Times change.  I wish we would stop sneering at our educational system because it only results in bringing all sorts of things into disrepute, not least of all our teachers.  A high enough tribute cannot be paid to the Christian Brothers who, through dark and evil days, educated our forebears free and voluntarily.  I mention teaching orders generally and laymen and laywomen. They make a great contribution and we should recognise it. I know we do recognise it, but we should remember when we criticise our educational system and engage in this kind of national sneering contest for which we have a great capacity, we are bringing all these persons into disrepute. I personally do not think that is good enough.</P>

      <P>I must say that the Minister and the occupants of the Chair must have heard enough on this subject to last them for a lifetime.  I can promise that, unlike other Deputies who have spoken, I am not going to talk a lot on education, although I gave a large chunk of my life to being educated and in recent times have given a large chunk of my life to trying to educate other people.  One Deputy had great sport with this Estimate.  He sported all around the place with it <Col N="788" /> but I will not continue on that line. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle very rightly tried to bring him back to education but he had great difficulty in that matter.</P>

      <P>I will not be apologising to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;do not worry.  I was here.</P>
      <P>On this matter of community schools, there is no question that the Minister did change his mind.  I do not hold that against the Minister or against his integrity either.  If a man in high office, as a result of serious public pressure, decides that he has to change his approach, I admire that man all the more.  I do not believe in this cod that goes on&mdash;a man has not got less integrity because he changes his mind.  The truth is that he has more integerity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews was not accurate when he said that the Fianna Fáil Party were not sectarian about this matter, but they definitely were.  I do not know where it came from, and I am not necessarily blaming the Minister for it, but we had a real example of sectarianism by Fianna Fáil in relation to the Bill called the Contraception Bill when they would not allow a free vote to take place.  That was all they had to do and there is no doubt that that Bill would have been carried in the House, if there had been a free vote.  Both the other parties had allowed a free vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to dilate on that, Sir; I am going to be much faster than various other Deputies who talked for hours on this subject in the past few weeks.  I did say while the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking that whatever we may say about Northern Ireland, there has been no sectarianism in education in Northern Ireland.  I challenge the Minister: did the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin not speak out about the community schools in the South County Dublin area?  Everybody knows he did and I despise this pretence that this has not happened.  It apparently is a matter of <Col N="789" /> saying it did not happen and it did not happen.</P>
    <P>I may say that I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary on one thing he said belatedly in his speech.  I do not agree with the trendy Deputies who continuously attack the Christian Brothers order for teaching boys love of country.  I do not agree with that attack and I do not care who disagrees with me.  I was never at a Christian Brothers school in my life&mdash;at no time was I in a Christian Brothers school &mdash;but Deputies who talk in this way against the Christian Brothers order for teaching boys to be national are people&mdash;it does not matter how they may think themselves&mdash;who decry this country.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that the Christian Brothers gave free education in this country before it was available anywhere else in the world.  I was told by one man who had been at a Christian Brothers school, that at the beginning of the term an envelope was handed out to each boy in the class but there was never a comment of any sort if it never came back.  I take it that what was in the envelope was &ldquo;The fee for this term is £1&rdquo; or whatever it was, but there was never any comment of any sort if the envelope never came back.  That is as near to free education as anybody will ever get in this world and I could not care less about what other people think.  Having said that, I want to say on the opposite line that I do not agree with physical punishment in schools, although I do think that, provided it is not excessive, it does less harm than sarcasm or cynicism from teachers.</P>
    <P>I want to speak about what has been, in fact, a more serious matter in education, that is, the method which was in operation for so long in selecting young people to be trained as national teachers.  First of all, there was a general competition in the Gaeltacht and that, of course, ruled out everybody else in the country.  In other words, all the people in the midlands and in the eastern parts of the country were ruled out.  Then, to make matters worse, the Department proceeded to say: &ldquo;We are getting too many Kerry people and, therefore, we <Col N="790" /> are going to get a percentage in accordance with population from Kerry, from Connemara, from Mayo and from Donegal&rdquo;.  The result of this kind of game is that you reduce the standard of the people becoming national teachers and that is what happened. The result was that the pupils&mdash;and I have this on the very best authority&mdash; who came from the national schools into the secondary schools in this city in the late thirties, forties and fifties were much inferior to the pupils who came from the national schools in the twenties and early thirties.</P>
    <P>I told the House before the kind of education I got in a national school in South Tipperary.  It was a two-teacher school&mdash;one trained teacher and one junior assistant mistress.  At the age of 11½&mdash;and I was by no means the youngest boy in the class, so let nobody think that I am engaged in boasting of any sort&mdash;what had we done?  I was 11½ years of age in sixth class and there were three or four boys a good deal younger.  Let me read out what we had done, having heard this cod talked that you must have enormous schools with six or eight teachers and must take children 20 or 30 miles to this kind of school.  That one teacher looked after third and fourth classes together and fifth and sixth classes together.  The total number of boys in the school was about 50.  The junior assistant looked after half and the senior teacher looked after the other half, and in fifth and sixth classes, there were roughly 12 boys in the class. We had done the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>&mdash;completed it; we had done algebra to quadratic equations; we had done the first book of Euclid, the whole of it; we had done arithmetic as far as practice and compound interest; we had done mensuration, Greek and Latin roots and a great deal of what would now be called biology, botany and zoology.</P>
    <P>This was from a single teacher, a man who, in fact, used to play football with us.  It is right that I should pay a tribute to him, the late Richard Griffith.  He managed one of the Griffith shoe shops in Talbot Street afterwards when he retired.  We have heard this nonsense that you must have <Col N="791" /> six teachers to teach this kind of thing. Perhaps I was lucky, but let me say this, that he never got the Carlisle and Gregg premiums.  I do not think he was as good as the national school teachers in west Cork who put untold numbers of men into the customs and excise in the British Civil Service and to whose schools boys came from all over Cork and Kerry and lived in the neighbouring houses so that they could attend there and do the examination. When people talk this kind of nonsense it gets under my skin because I know from my own experience it is not true.</P>
    <P>What must be done is to get people who are interested in their vocation and who have a real interest in small children.  To do that is to set up a worthwhile system of education.  It is codology of the development section of the Department of Education.  Where do these people come from?  Did these people who are in the development section of the Department of Education ever teach a class?  Or if there be one or two who did teach a class what influence have they in the place?</P>
    <P>I am delighted to hear that the system of selecting teachers for training, especially national teachers, has changed for the better in recent years. However, why is it that the Department of Education will not recognise the service of secondary teachers abroad except in certain cases, and these not necessarily the best cases?  If teachers are in the third world they are not likely to be doing as good work as if they are working in the six northeastern counties of this country or in England or Scotland.</P>
    <P>I should really like to know who decided that the two-teacher schools should be closed down.  Where did that crazy idea come from?  A school is a worthwhile local centre and the minute you start taking the children from the local village into the neighbouring town ten or 15 miles away, you are centralising again; you are doing the exact opposite to that to which every Government Deputy gives lip service, decentralisation.  I asked a question here a few weeks ago and I got a truthful answer from the Minister.  He told <Col N="792" /> me there were about 1,250 classes in the primary schools in this city with more than 45 pupils in them.  If we take the figure 40 as being reasonable, there are 90,000 children in primary schools in this city in classes bigger than 40.  I can say from my own personal experience in a secondary school that I was only once in a class in which there were 30 pupils, boys of 13 or 14 years of age.  Perhaps, again, luck was with me.  It is literally true to say that we learned nothing.  I well remember the teacher chasing a pupil over the desks on one occasion, the pupil having given him some backchat or something like that.  This was in a class of 30 pupils, not 40 or 50 or 90, as, indeed, there were at times in this city.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I know, gave detailed answers that day in the House and said he was now training more teachers than ever before, building more schools than ever before and so on.  I do not say the Minister is to be blamed for the situation he finds on his plate, but the fact is that this is a very serious defect in our educational system. What number of pupils can a primary teacher cope with?  I ask this question with respect, having regard to the fact that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows a great deal more about this than I do.  Perhaps I should have consulted him beforehand, but since I did not, let me give my own opinion.  I think that 25 pupils is reasonable and fair.  The better secondary schools in this city used to have fewer than 20 pupils in a class.  Many of them had A, B, C and D classes&mdash;I do not know what people think about that: some of them might think it was a bad system&mdash;with a mixture of students of different capacities in each class, and this was regarded as a worthwhile approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House much longer, although I think I have spoken for the least time of any Deputy in the debate.  Although the Parliamentary Secretary promised he would be only five minutes, he got caught in some in-fighting with Deputy Byrne and this delayed him considerably. Anyway, the Parliamentary Secretary did not speak too long in the debate, <Col N="793" /> but other Deputies did speak altogether too long.  I do not think the longer they spoke the more they contributed to the debate; in fact, I think the less they contributed to the debate.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about reformatory and industrial schools.  I take it most of us saw the former Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Kingsmill Moore, and his wife on television in relation to Marlborough House.  Marlborough House conjures up visions of a super establishment, the place where Winston Churchill was born, the home of the Marlboroughs of England.  Of course, this Marlborough House in Dublin is a completely different thing as described on the television programme. It consists, in fact, of two rooms, a great barrack of a room underneath and one general dormitory above.  In this barrack room underneath and in the general dormitory above there are boys from seven years of age to 17.</P>
    <P>I do not mind what efforts have to be made to deal with that kind of situation.  I am not going to say this is a disgrace only to the Government, because it was there before they came into office, even though they are a long time there; it is also a disgrace to the country.  I am glad to see there is money here for St. Laurence's Finglas, an increase from £15,000 to £50,000.  However, what astounds me is that we were told that St. Laurence's of Finglas was built and completed a year or so ago.  Why is it not in operation? We were told by the representative of the Department of Education on that television programme&mdash;a great defensive operator, a great stone waller&mdash;that it would be in operation at the beginning of next year.  What is the cause of the delay in a situation which is so disgraceful to the Government who happen to be in office at the moment and to this country which happens to be a great deal longer in existence than the Government?  I should like to ask the Minister a question about this situation.  Why is it that the capitation grant for reformatory schools at £4.50 a week is greater than the capitation grant for industrial schools at £4.25 a week?  The Government have been more generous than <Col N="794" /> preceding governments in this direction but I do not think much of particular things they have done.  I believe they are being misled by the trendy people, the people who attack the Christian Brothers in this House.  I do not know how much I have contributed to this long debate in the 20 minutes I have spoken.  I will contribute some other time at greater length.  I would not have contributed at all but for the fact that the debate has gone on and on and I thought it was about time that somebody came in and said something that has some relevance to education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is common enough for a speaker, when rising to speak on an Estimate, to say that the particular Estimate is the most important one which comes before the House for discussion.  Some people think that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, because it deals with our basic industry, is the most important Department, others think that the Department of Local Government, because it affects the lives of everybody in an intimate way, is the most important.  There are Deputies who think that the Department of Justice, which is responsible for law and order, is the most important and I suppose some Deputies could also lean on the side of the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Health.  Anybody who gives considerable thought to it will eventually decide that the Estimate for the Department of Education is the most important Estimate from the point of view of the future of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education and his Department are charged with educating the youth of this country to a stage where they will be able to earn their living in an interesting and gainful occupation but, more important than that, the Minister and his teachers are responsible for educating the youth of the country so that they will grow up and develop into good Irish citizens, who will have respect for law and order, who will have a love for their country and who will have respect for their fellow citizens.  Surely that is a very important Department and one which must be run in the most efficient <Col N="795" /> way possible to get the best results.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that during his student days a young person should not get bad example from the institution which is educating him.  By that I mean that it is essential that there should be harmony in the Department of Education, in each system of education, between one system of education and another and that there should not be squabbles or misunderstandings or fighting for places because all this is bound to reflect on the minds of adolescents and is bound to damage them and set them out in life with the wrong ideas and, perhaps, with warped minds.  It is also essential that there should be harmony between those in charge of one system of education and another.</P>
    <P>It is essential that one religious group should not be afraid it will be dominated by another.  In a new system such as we have had since the era of free post-primary education there are bound to be teething troubles but I think there have been too many troubles and squabbles between the vocational system, the traditional secondary system and to a lesser degree the primary education system.  That is due to the fact that we have not a definite policy within the Department of Education and more particularly that a definite plan has not been unfolded to the people and explained to them.  They have been left in a state of uncertainty and when one group of teachers are uncertain of their future this causes fear and fear causes agitation. That is what we have going on in the educational field at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department initiated changes in post-primary education by means of kite flying and they let the kites go a certain distance.  The Minister sent senior officers of his Department to preside at various meetings around the country to try to sell a policy.  It was obvious that would not be accepted.  These officers must have come back to the Minister with unfavourable reports.  There were reports in the newspapers after each meeting about violent differences of opinion and that did a lot of harm.  I <Col N="796" /> believe the cause of the trouble is that the Minister did not work out a policy and spell it out clearly and distinctly to the interested people, the interested people being the teachers in all systems and the parents of all children.  That was not done.  As a result a considerable amount of harm was done.  Considerable harm has been done from the point of view that the minority religious group here have become afraid that in some way or another they will be taken over and swamped.</P>
    <P>Because they seek information, because they ask the Minister to spell out this and that, the Opposition in this House are blamed for making trouble.  As I understand it, the function of any opposition in a democratic assembly is to clarify changes in the law and changes in policy for the people.  We were particularly unsuccessful in getting from the Minister a clear indication of what his policy is on many branches of education.  The Minister has changed his policy entirely in connection with the community schools.  He has departed from the first policy he tried to sell and he now talks about a community of schools.  I do not think the people of the country clearly understand what that means.  It is thrown out loosely to them.  I do not think the Minister's party are happy about his policy.  I had an opportunity this evening of looking at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis Clár and the first resolution, under the Minister's photograph, seemed to call on the Minister to vest management of all schools in vocational education committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It was there, anyway.  I believe in harmony as between one system of education and another and I agree with the Minister that there should be cooperation between one system of post-primary education and another so that there should not be unnecessary duplication and consequent waste.  The way the Minister will get that cooperation is to be frank with all concerned, to be frank with the people, with the vocational education committees, with managements of schools run by religious bodies and of private schools.</P>
      <P>The Minister raised quite a storm in my constituency by interfering behind closed doors with the building of a vocational school.  I do not wish to go into it in detail here because I did that elsewhere.  I will say that trouble arose over the building of a vocational school in Cavan town because of the changing of the site from one place to another.  The trouble was that the Minister did not take the vocational committee into his confidence from the beginning.  He had sent somebody down before I found out about it in another way altogether. I give that as an example of complete lack of planning in the Department.</P>
      <P>Something I heard in the last few days would seem to bear that out. We know that in Limerick an institute for higher education in the form of a technological college is being provided. I am very glad Limerick has got this institute of advanced education. I was at by-election meetings in Limerick when the Minister's predecessor, the present Minister for Transport and Power, promised the Limerick people they would have a full-blown university and he indicated the spot in Limerick where it was to be built.  In any case, the university, properly so called, did not materialise. In its place Limerick was given an advanced college of technical education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was part of the plan for that college that a training centre would be provided for teachers of physical education. That promise was made about four years ago.  A section of the new institute in Limerick was to be used to train teachers in physical education <Col N="798" /> so that they, in turn, would come out and act as teachers of physical education. My information is that that teacher training school in Limerick was to be built and ready for students on 1st September next.  On the basis of that assurance, Sion Hill Physical Training College and Ling Physical Training College arranged to close down in June of this year and they arranged with the pupils that from the beginning of the next school year they would be trained in Limerick.  Ling and Sion Hill arranged that they would dispense with their teachers and that most of these teachers would arrange to take up duty in Limerick on 1st September next.</P>
    <P>However, a gentleman from the Department accompanied by a consultant from England went to Limerick to find that there were no plans and that no steps whatever had been taken to make the necessary accommodation available to receive the students from Sion Hill and Ling.  Students from across the water found that the only accommodation available was completely unsuitable, that some rooms were being taken over, widely separated throughout the city.  There were only four schools available in which the teachers who would be trained in Limerick could do practical work in their sphere.  All this came as a complete shock to Sion Hill and Ling. What is to happen?  The 35 girls who were attending Sion Hill and Ling have been told there is no accommodation for them in Limerick or elsewhere in the country.  They are being sent to Great Britain to be trained at a cost of £1,000 per head to the State until 1st January next, but if my information is correct they are being told they can return to Limerick on the 1st of January next to continue their studies. Having started in Dublin and having been transported to Britain they have been told that they are coming back to Limerick to continue their education there.  My information is that this is quite unrealistic because building has not commenced on the new Physical Training Institute in Limerick.  The contract has been signed but the completion period mentioned in the contract is 30 months.  As we all know contracts are rarely completed on <Col N="799" /> time.  In my opinion these students who have been taken into school in Dublin under false pretences, because the managements of Sion Hill and Ling were misled, will have to spend perhaps three years of their four-year course in England at a cost to the State of £1,000 per three months.  That shows a complete lack of planning, foresight and proper arranging for the implementation of policy.</P>
    <P>The teachers of these girls are quite upset that these young students should have to go to England.  It is not desirable that people who are going to come back here and teach students should be trained in what some people in this House would call an alien atmosphere. It is desirable that these teachers should be trained here.  Some of these young girls may remain in England and their services as teachers will be lost to this country.  What will happen the present teachers in Sion Hill and Ling?  They are completely upset.  Where will they go?  Has any provision been made for them?  They will not be retained in Sion Hill or Ling because, on the information given to them by the Department of Education, arrangements have been made to close down as from the end of this school year.  That is educationally unsound. Furthermore, if through some miracle which I cannot see happening, the building of the new college was completed in less than a third of the 30 months specified in the contract, there would be about 140 students, both male and female, coming back to Limerick next January.</P>
    <P>The upset caused by the lack of planning is to be deplored.  This is a classic example of the lack of planning in the Department of Education at present.  The wrong solution has been decided on in this case.  These students should not be sent to England.  Sion Hill and Ling have been doing an excellent job for the last number of years in training physical education teachers.  They should be encouraged and helped financially and otherwise in order to retain the present students in Dublin until their training has been completed.  I appeal to the Minister to do that.  It would be better to do <Col N="800" /> that than to call the parents of the students together, as I understand it is proposed to do in the near future, and try to sell them the idea of completing the education of these students in Britain.  I hope that the Minister on reflection will come to the conclusion that my suggestion is the right one.  I hope also that he will have an explanation for the House about this apparent bungle.</P>
    <P>Before I come to other points in the educational field with which I wish to deal, I would like to follow up a point which has been raised by Deputy O'Donovan.  This point refers to Marlborough House.  The Minister's predecessor set up a committee to report on reformatories and industrial schools. That committee were appointed in 1967 and reported in 1970.  There were a number of points on which the committee were very definite.  The committee did not wait to complete their report but sent a recommendation to the Minister indicating that Marlborough House, Glasnevin, should be closed forthwith.  That was done some time after 1967.  The committee presented their report to the Minister in 1970.  They repeated that recommendation that Marlborough House should be closed down forthwith.  In the summary of major recommendations it is interesting to note that when the committee were dealing with St. Conleth's Reformatory, Daingean, they recommended that that institution should be closed down at the earliest possible opportunity and replaced by modern schools conducted by trained staff. They also recommended that the remand home and place of detention housed at Marlborough House, Glasnevin, should be closed down &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;. They did not say &ldquo;as early as possible&rdquo; in regard to Marlborough House.  They wished it to be replaced by a more suitable building with trained child-care staff.</P>
    <P>A short time ago I raised the question of Marlborough House with the Minister.  I gathered from the Minister that Marlborough House is to be kept open for an indefinite period to deal with some cases which could be called difficult or problem cases.  I understood that Marlborough House was to continue to be operated by untrained staff <Col N="801" /> recruited from the labour exchange. That is a deplorable state of affairs. It is deplorable that these problem children who need more care than other children should be housed in this appalling building and should be under the care of untrained people.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister did not have an opportunity of watching the television programme &ldquo;Encounter&rdquo; because it was screened around the time he was dealing with his resolution at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  I watched the programme in which a former judge, Mr. Kingsmill Moore, and his wife appeared.  They inspected Marlborough House and their description was horrifying.  It appears there are two large uncomfortable rooms in which small and big boys are kept. While they were at the house they saw two little boys huddled like little rabbits in a playground.  If the Minister had seen this programme I am sure he would have been shocked.</P>
    <P>The Minister was represented on the programme by an officer from his Department.  I do not want to blame him but he took on a man-sized job. He was trying to do the impossible; he was trying to justify the present system of reformatory and industrial schools and the retention of Marlborough House.  He tried to do this in the presence of a priest who was experienced in this kind of work and in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Kingsmill Moore, who are well known for their interest in young people and in law reform.  Mr. Kingsmill Moore practised in the courts as Senior Counsel for many years and he presided in the High Court and the Supreme Court.  It is three years since the Minister received a report on this matter and it is at least five years since the interim recommendation to close Marlborough House was made.  I am asking the Minister for the good name of the country and in the interests of the unfortunate children to close Marlborough House immediately.  There must be other places that could be used.</P>
    <P>I disagree completely with trying to run reformatory or industrial schools on the cheap.  I disagree with the practice whereby religious orders are given a certain capitation grant to <Col N="802" /> look after children.  Through the courts the State deprives these children of their liberty in the interests of the children themselves and of society.  Having done that, it is the duty of the State to provide proper accommodation for them and to pay for that accommodation, supervision, training and reform.  The State should not depend on the charity of the religious orders who, in the past, have been exploited both in the educational field and in this area of child reform.</P>
    <P>It is fundamentally wrong that these institutions should be run on the basis of providing a capitation grant of so much per head and on the assumption that the balance can be got anywhere. Someone, either the children or the teachers, will suffer under such an arrangement.  These institutions should be financed as Mountjoy Prison is financed, as are the schools for mentally handicapped children, or as are the Government Departments.  This is not the area to economise in; this is not the place to continue the old system of financing that has obtained during the years.</P>
    <P>When I was looking for a report I accidentally came across a report of a commission on the reformatory and industrial school system between 1934 and 1936, presided over by the former principal district Justice of the Metropolitan Court, the late Mr. George Cussen.  The capitation system was the method used to finance these institutions. The report stated that at that time in school A there were 89 children and the school medical attendant was paid £4 10s per year for looking after them; in school B the medical attendant was paid £6 10s per year for looking after 62 children; in school C the medical attendant was paid £7 for looking after nine children and in yet another school he was paid £11 for looking after 139 children.</P>
    <P>I was interested to find out what the State paid in the thirties towards the maintenance of the children.  The report stated :</P>
    <P>Schedule showing basic scales of State contributions to reformatory and industrial schools under the Children's Act, 1928-1929.</P>
    <P>For all ordinary cases, 6s per <Col N="803" /> week; for youthful offenders for the first 13 weeks, 2s per week; for the following 26 weeks, 1s per week.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of system we have inherited. In 1972 we should get away from it and get rid of Marlborough House.  I am sure that the people were shocked at what they saw and heard on the television programme.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate a suggestion was made that the religious orders, and the Christian Brothers in particular, were attacked.  I want to go on record as saying that in the last 100 years the secular priests and the Christian Brothers have carried out an excellent job of work under difficult circumstances and in difficult times. They were inadequately paid and were it not for the fact that they contributed their salaries towards the running of the schools it would not have been possible for the schools to operate. I think my fees when I was in secondary school were £39 a year but it would not be possible to run schools on that kind of money if the religious had not contributed their salary to the upkeep of the schools.  At a time when we are changing from one kind of educational system to another, it would not be proper if we did not pay the religious orders the tribute they richly deserve.  So far as I am aware nobody in this House attacked the religious orders or the Christian Brothers.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the teaching of history.  I regret to say that when I was going to school history and geography were bundled together and taught as one subject in the Irish language to children who did not understand the language and who could not take in the instruction.  As a result, most of them at that school did not know any history or geography.  Deputy O'Donovan said that anyone who taught children love of country had his full support.  I want to say they have my full support also. I believe that boys and girls should be educated to have a love for their country, and to respect their country.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Cruise-O'Brien was speaking about the other evening was not the instilling of love of country <Col N="804" /> into pupils but the engendering, unconsciously undoubtedly, of hatred of another country, hatred of our old enemy, England.  That is not good for children.  I do not know whether the people who write the history books are to blame or whether some teachers of history are to blame.  I do not believe that any good purpose is served for this country or its adolescents by continually harping back to the barbaric injustice inflicted on this country by England in bygone days.  That will only make people unsettled and fill them with hate.  It will make it more difficult to have an ordered society here.  It will certainly make it more difficult to unite the country.  I think that is what Deputy Cruise-O'Brien was talking about, and I agree with him if that is what he was talking about.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few points which might be helpful in regard to the various levels of education.  Strangely enough I regard primary education as the most important.  If a child has not got a sound primary education&mdash;they used to say a sound national school education; call it what you like&mdash; eventually he will not be successful in the field of education.  Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that there should be an adequate supply of fully trained teachers in our primary schools.  At present we have not got that.  It is necessary to make do with the best that is available.  People with the leaving certificate, who never spent an hour in a training college, have to step in and take charge of the youngest children.  I am not blaming them for doing that, but they are not qualified to do it.  You might as well ask me to act as a doctor.  I do not know anything about it and I would be likely to do a lot of harm.  Untrained people teaching infants are likely to do harm just as any professional man could do harm in a field for which he was not trained.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier this evening to the teacher/pupil ratio.  The Minister admitted a few weeks ago that there are something like 12,000 classes in which there are over 45 pupils.  At any rate, he said that there <Col N="805" /> were a great number of classes in which there are over 45 pupils.  I am told that a ratio of one teacher to 50 pupils is quite common.  This is unsound.  It is indefensible.  A new curriculum was launched on the teachers in the past few years and yet they are confronted with these huge classes.  I want the Minister to give the House an assurance that classes will be reduced to a manageable and workable level.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice told us that since he became Minister no Garda barracks has been closed down, giving the impression that the policy has changed.  I want the Minister, when he is replying to this debate, to tell us what his policy is on the closing down of smaller schools, because it does not appear to be clear.  The teachers, the parents and the students are entitled to know.  If Government policy were made crystal clear on this point, there would be fewer demonstrations and fewer protests.  We want to know exactly what the policy is.</P>
    <P>There are complaints amongst the teaching profession about the standard of the text books in the primary schools.  The INTO have been pressing, as I am sure the Minister well knows, for up-to-date and more suitable text books.  I am told they are complicated and difficult to interpret.  Under the new system a child is supposed to be able to understand and do a lot of work on his own and to move from one stage to another, but I am told that the text books are such that children need practically constant supervision and help.  Having regard to the size of the classes, which I have complained about, that is just not possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne spent a long time talking about physical education and sport, for which the Minister has responsibility.  The Minister should provide adequate playing grounds at every primary school.  Some schools have been built in recent years, and no playgrounds were provided.  There is not much use in talking about swimming pools, gymnasia and advanced things of that sort, if we continue to build schools without providing them with playing grounds.  What is called a general purposes room should be <Col N="806" /> attached to every primary school where the children could congregate on a wet day and amuse themselves and indulge in recreation.</P>
    <P>That brings me to secondary education. In this age vocational education, or technical education, should get pride of place.  The emphasis should be on it. I know that for the professions we must have academic education, but we are exporting most of the professions, with the notable exception of the legal profession because they are not an exportable commodity.  Under statute they are not acceptable outside our jurisdiction.  Engineers and doctors are being exported wholesale.  Therefore the emphasis should be on vocational education.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be interested to note that in my constituency, in the last year for which figures are available, 63 per cent of the students who enrolled for post-primary education enrolled in vocational schools.  That is a higher percentage, I am told, than in most counties.  It is certainly higher than in Monaghan or in Louth, the other two counties in the region.  Therefore, the emphasis should be on vocational schools and I would ask the Minister to bear that in mind.  There is a policy at the moment of down-grading certain vocational schools.  In my constituency two or three have closed down and others are to be reduced in status and the fear is that they also will close down.  The school in Virginia is unique in that it was provided by the people of the area, at their own expense, and handed over to the vocational education committee.  There are fears that this school will be closed down.  The people of Virginia have no desire to gobble up other educational establishments but they are very anxious that they should be allowed to retain the school which they built and that it should be retained as a fully fledged post-primary education establishment in which the intermediate and leaving certificate courses would be followed. The people of Virginia are not concerned as to where else there may be schools.  They are not envious of other towns in the area.  They are very anxious that the school which they <Col N="807" /> built and paid for and handed over should be retained.</P>
    <P>In the post-primary sector also there are complaints about the grant of £25 payable in respect of a pupil attending secondary school.  This amount of £25 was fixed about five years ago.  In the meantime, wages have doubled, building costs have doubled, the cost of living has soared, taxation has gone sky high.  I know it will take money to increase the grant but if £25 was only adequate when the grant was introduced it follows that it must be grossly inadequate now.</P>
    <P>I am also told that there are complaints about the reluctance of the Minister's Department to sanction the appointment of extra staff in secondary schools even when a case can be made for the appointment of such staff. Surely, that is false economy and not in the interest of education?</P>
    <P>It has always been regarded as departmental policy that a first-class library is a necessity in the academic type secondary school and, indeed, in any post-primary school there should be a suitable library.  I want to ask the Minister now whether a grant is available to a school management which wishes to provide a library and reading facilities for its pupils because a school management recently wrote to the Minister's Department asking whether a grant would be available for the provision of a library and received a reply from the Minister's Department. The person to whom the reply was addressed, having read the letter, could not decide whether a grant was available or not.  He solicited the help of the other teachers in the school who in turn studied the letter and they could not know, and do not yet know whether a grant is available or not. The letter was couched in the words of the oracle.  Nobody knew what it meant.  It could mean anything or nothing. I would ask the Minister when replying to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, in regard to whether a grant is available for a school library or not.</P>
    <P>Canteen facilities in schools are almost a necessity because it is the policy of the Minister to close down small schools and to enlarge schools and to aim at 400 children on the roll <Col N="808" /> of each leaving certificate type school. If the numbers in a school are to be increased the catchment area must be increased.  Children of comparatively young age will have to travel by bus at 8 p.m. and return home at 6 p.m. Canteen facilities should be provided. The cost would not be too great. Provision should be made for hot meals for children in all these schools.</P>
    <P>There is something that I, as a member of a vocational education committee, was rather surprised to hear, namely, that there is no oral test in modern languages.  I understood that grammar was becoming less important in modern languages and, indeed, in the Irish language and that if one could speak Irish in a satisfactory manner the difficulties in regard to grammar would be overcome.  In this modern age the whole point in teaching German, French, Italian or Spanish is that the pupils will be able to take up positions involving speaking these languages either at home or abroad.  If our tourist trade were not going through the dreadful time that it is going through at the moment we would require many people here who could speak German, French, Italian and Spanish in our hotels.  Bear in mind that the teachers, in pursuance of departmental policy, are encouraged to lay the emphasis on the spoken language but, as there is no oral test, if the teachers were to follow the departmental instructions or exhortations and concentrated on the spoken language, a great percentage of the students would fail the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations. It is the leaving certificate that I am concerned with.</P>
    <P>The Common Market is dragged into every discussion but it could legitimately be brought into this mater. If we are going into the Common Market and if we will be associating with these other countries, it will be no use being able to read their languages if we cannot speak them.  Some slight move has been made: you can have an oral test now if you apply for it. That is to come into operation this year.  That is not enough.  There should be a compulsory oral test for the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> The late Senator Baxter of Cavan, who was a great friend of the late General Mulcahy, Minister for Education, was instrumental in having an oral test in Irish.  He found difficulty in making that oral test compulsory. It is compulsory now and I understand that since it became compulsory the failure rate in Irish has dropped considerably. The failure rate in Irish is as low as 4 per cent and in French it is as high as 34 per cent.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to introduce oral tests in modern languages.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the twin subjects of history and geography.  Each is a matriculation subject and accepted as such in the matriculation examination and yet in most schools the two subjects are treated as one.  In the intermediate certificate history and geography are treated as one subject; in the leaving certificate they are treated as two.  Since both are matriculation subjects they should be treated as separate subjects from the beginning so as to provide pupils with a wider range of subjects, something about which we hear so much.  This cursory treatment of Irish history as not a very important subject to be bracketed with another has the result mentioned in this debate by Deputy O'Brien.</P>
    <P>At Question Time I raised with the Minister the high rate of failure in mathematics.  I did not get a very clear answer.  He said it was difficult to give. I was talking about failures in mathematics, physics and chemistry.  He did not give a definite rate but I gather from what he said that the failure rate in these subjects is around 40 per cent. If we get a failure rate in these subjects of over 30 per cent we must look for the cause.  This could be because the papers are unnecessarily difficult or because we have the new system of teaching mathematics which is completely foreign to older teachers who may have difficulty in imparting the knowledge or in getting the students to follow the instruction.  If that is so, there should be many more refresher courses for teachers who are past their youth to enable them to deal with the new system.</P>
    <P>It could also be because mathematics <Col N="810" /> is a difficult subject which not everybody is capable of learning and becoming proficient in.  If that is so, such students should be channelled away from maths at an early age, certainly at intermediate standard, if not earlier. The high rate of failure in these subjects calls for an investigation into the programme and system of teaching in these subjects.</P>
    <P>Any politician is struck in the course of fulfilling his constituency duties by the many young people and their parents who come to him in September and October of each year, parents of students who have completed their secondary education.  These students have no idea what they want to do except that they want a job.  I tell them that is the hardest thing they could ask; that if they tell me what they want to do I can see if there is any vacancy and do my best to get a post for them.  The students have no idea of what they want.  The cause of that is that there is no proper career guidance course which is a &ldquo;must&rdquo; in this age of young people who are sons and daughters of parents who did not enjoy&mdash;this is a compliment to the Minister's predecessor &mdash; post-primary education and who are not, therefore, well qualified to direct their children as to what career they should follow. They need help.</P>
    <P>There is no use turning out students with leaving certificates without guiding them as to what they should do.  There should be a career guidance officer or teacher in each school who would take an interest in the students, their background and aptitude and try to direct them towards one career or another. Some schools in my constituency really do take an interest, particularly in the girls, and get them interested in banks or Guinness examinations or something like that, but far too many are left not knowing what they want to do. This applies particularly to boys.</P>
    <P>We come back to the Minister's proposal to aim at a target of 400 pupils in a school qualifying for the senior cycle. I think that is not practicable, certainly in rural Ireland and if insisted on it will mean there will be one or two leaving certificate centres in the county and <Col N="811" /> that children will be travelling too far on buses.  That is not in the interests of education.</P>
    <P>I hope the points I have made will be of help to the Minister and that he will take them seriously.  I have not dealt with university education but one matter that has been brought to my notice is that in certain subjects students may pass their first examination, particularly in medicine and some other subjects, and then find that they cannot get a place in the second year and have to spend another year in the first year group and sit for the examination again.  Surely there is something wrong there and I should like the Minister to look into it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan dealt with the question of physical punishment.  It is my opinion that in this day and age physical punishment should be avoided. Any teacher who cannot control a class without resorting to physical punishment is lacking something.  If there is an isolated case of a child who cannot be controlled otherwise, such child should not be sent to an educational establishment at all.  I was interested in the word &ldquo;sarcasm&rdquo; in the context in which Deputy O'Donovan used it.  I do not know whether sarcasm from teachers is as prevalent as it used be but it is something that can cause much hurt and damage to a child and can result in leaving him with an inferiority complex.  In the past it was much too common a weapon.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister is not responsible directly for handicapped children.  I think he has responsibility for children who are handicapped physically.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I would appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to fit these children in so far as possible to earn their living.  Of course, the Minister is not responsible for housing mentally handicapped children but there is a waiting list in this respect that would make any self-respecting public representative blush.  Somebody suggested here today <Col N="812" /> that there should be a place in industry for the physically handicapped.  This would present a difficult problem because it would result in interference with private enterprise but it could be encouraged.  As I have said here before, the biggest employer of labour by far is the State and its subsidiaries, the local authorities.  I know of no reason why a percentage of places in the State service and in the local service should not be reserved for those who are handicapped physically whether they have been handicapped from birth or became handicapped as a result of polio or some other disease.  They could be employed as telephonists and in many other spheres but one could not demand of private enterprise that they employ any particular person.  The State has a maternal responsibility to the less well-off citizens and the unfortunate physically handicapped are among those.  So far as the mentally handicapped are concerned all we can do is look after them.  The physically handicapped are at a disadvantage on the open market.</P>
      <P>The last matter I wish to mention relates to the building of schools.  A school may cost as much as £200,000 to build but in all cases there should be proper playgrounds and in the case of vocational schools there should be facilities for rural science as well as for recreation.  It would be a scandal if the Minister should permit schools to be built on inadequate sites.  That is all I have to say on this subject.  I would not be doing my duty as a public representative if I did not contribute to the debate which concerns a subject that is fundamental to the welfare of the country both for today and for tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cott</NameTxt>
      <P>The one outstanding characteristic of education in this country is its resistance to change, its total inertia.  That is a most undesirable trend.  What should characterise education is dynamism, progressiveness and the flexibility to adapt itself to a changing society in a changing world. The utter stagnation in education has been brought about by a number of factors and these are, first, education is administered by a central authority &mdash;a Civil Service dependent on the <Col N="813" /> Government of the day; secondly, the place of the churches in the education system; thirdly, the lack of professional educationalists; fourthly, the total lack of co-operation between teaching interests and the Department and, lastly the lack of a White Paper on education, a lack of an overall statement by the Government outlining aims and policies for education.</P>
      <P>Our present system has been moulded down through the years by the interacting forces of Church and State.  The result has been the growth of a system that is essentially rigid.  The basis of this system goes back to the Intermediate Education Act of 1878 and from then a forced uniformity was imposed on us.  To this day that same uniformity is with us.  That was a system that made Pearse remark in &ldquo;The Murder Machine&rdquo; that &ldquo;The programme bulks so large, there is no room for education&rdquo;.  The only major change that we have made since the establishment of the Ministry of Education in 1922 was the abolition of the payments-on-results scheme which was abolished in 1924.  Since then no major initiative in the educational field has been undertaken.  Undoubtedly a few offshoots have been developed on the original system but the same uniform system remains.  We have developed no national philosophy for Irish education. All we have done is to try to inspire and foster the national ideal and we did this by giving the Irish language, literature and history pride of place in our schools.  I must say that we managed even the language question very badly.  This was referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick and by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.  I now wish to refer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain we overdid this nationalism.  We overdid the fostering of the national ideal.  All we succeeded in doing was establishing a narrow biassed concept of nationalism which, in essence, was anti-British.  Down through the years we have perpetuated a craven intellectual subservience, the sort of subservience demanded by our erstwhile overlords, and we have made no attempt whatsoever to lift our educational system out of that hideous morass.  We have forced a so-called <Col N="814" /> academic education down the throats of our young people irrespective of whether or not they were mentally equipped to receive it.  We have given no cognisance to individual aptitudes, talents and skills.  We have ignored completely international developments in science and technology.  We have made no attempt to equip our system to meet the demands of a changing society.  Instead we have continued to orientate our pupils through this imposed system into stations in life for which they are neither equipped nor suited.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a former teacher, I am firmly convinced that our educational system has hampered our development mentally culturally and technologically. Because successive Governments have given insufficient attention to education the whole system has been allowed to drift.  The Department of Education, I am sorry to say, have assumed the role of guardian of the system.  This is a tragedy.  Let me emphasise the existence of a fixed pattern in a very rigid academic system with an example or two.  In a survey carried out on the 1962-63 leaving certificate the results showed that almost all boys took Irish, English and mathematics; 88 per cent took Latin; 30 per cent took physics and/or chemistry; 21 per cent took French.  In the same academic year, 64 per cent of girls took French; 4.7 per cent took physics and/or chemistry.  I should like to have the comparative figures for more recent years.  I regret I have not had time to obtain them, but I have no doubt that a similar survey today would show very little change. A report on a survey published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 4th May, 1971, showed that the number engaged in technical studies at post-primary level per 1,000 engaged in predominantly academic studies in the year 1965-66 were as follows: Austria, 520; England and Wales, 240; Finland, 670; France, 120; the Netherlands, 440; Ireland, 31.  Those figures tell a very obvious story.  Unless our school population is very different indeed from that in other countries, many pupils here are following courses which are totally unsuited to their talents and attitudes.  Corrective measures on the <Col N="815" /> part of the State are required to strike a more equitable balance between the academic and the vocational sectors of the system.</P>
    <P>I contend that the Department must become the originator and initiator of policy, ideas and development.  We must break out of the set pattern of two distinct and separate streams&mdash; on the one hand, private, denominational and academic and, on the other, public, non-denominational, with a curriculum mainly practical in character but for the most part outdated. The Government can no longer neglect their responsibility.  Problems besetting education of geographic selection and curriculum must be overcome if we are to utilise fully our existing resources.  I fully realise that the Minister is doing much to solve this very complicated problem, to say the least of it, but this cannot be solved by producing blanket schemes for the whole country, especially without consultation with all those involved&mdash;the parents, the teachers, the managers, the committees and the different church hierarchies.</P>
    <P>Each specific case must be given individual treatment and changes and developments must depend entirely on local circumstances.  Catchment areas cannot and should not be strictly defined.  The wishes of the parents and pupils must be given due consideration. A special case must be made for small colleges.  Here I have in mind in particular the non-Roman Catholic colleges because we all know that such colleges could not survive if their catchment areas were strictly confined. Their viability depends on drawing pupils from a large area.</P>
    <P>Now, if any system is going to work, the teachers must be given their due posts of responsibility.  Furthermore, their promotional prospects must be assured.  A realistic scheme of allowances in respect of qualifications and responsibility must be introduced.  I am sure the Minister fully realises that the existing system of allowances for qualifications is an insult to the profession. For spending an extra year at university, for example, reading for and obtaining a higher diploma in education the allowance is, as far as I remember, something like £25.  I should <Col N="816" /> like to know how far that kind of money would go in the life span of a teacher towards paying for that one year.  I do not believe it would go very far.  The system of political appointments of teachers and political allocations of posts of responsibility must be discontinued.  This is doing a great diservice to education as a whole.  This system is in existence, as we all know, in the vocational education controlled schools.  Unless and until the Department are adequately staffed with professional educationalists no true progress can be made towards rationalising the system and up-dating and modernising the approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a teacher and he should know that teaching is not just a job.  Teachers should not be regarded by the Department or anyone else merely as clerks.  They are, after all, charged with the mental, physical, moral, social and religious development of our young people.  That is a tremendous responsibility and we should endeavour to select only those who are fully equipped to carry out that task.  For too long the standard of entry into the professions has been far too low.  This applies not alone to teaching but to many of the other professions as well.  Medicine is another that comes to mind.  Many factors are responsible for people unsuited to those professions becoming members of them.  The lack of vocational guidance is a very big factor and we find, particularly at university level, that people undertake courses of study for which, on obtaining a degree, there are very few outlets and many drift into teaching for want of a better job.  Another factor is that the salary of teachers has been much too low to attract any qualified and capable personnel. Others are called into the professions for proficiency in a form or forms of intelligence manifested in a written State examination.</P>
    <P>I submit also that the training given to teachers is totally inadequate.  In some cases this is merely an extension of the leaving certificate course in a boarding college where the same rules and regulations still apply.  In one such college, I believe that the female students were not even allowed to wear <Col N="817" /> patent leather shoes in case they might act as mirrors.  This is laughable and tragic but it is true.  Such a system of training certainly does not enlighten the future teachers and it certainly cannot possibly broaden their horizons and cannot equip them to develop the full personality of the child.  It cannot equip them to help the child to realise his or her full potential in life.  It is stunted and it damages.</P>
    <P>I also think that the higher diploma in education should be altered.  Its scope, first of all, is not broad enough. The academic side is overplayed and there is far too little emphasis placed on practical methods of teaching and teaching practice.  I also think that the course should include a series of lectures on the humanities and the sciences so that students would at least have a working knowledge of these disciplines. I suggest to the Minister, and this is just an idea, that instead of having a higher diploma in education constituted as it is now, it would be more beneficial for the students to be engaged in full-time teaching for a period of, say, six months from September to the end of February, with a further four months to the end of June, to be engaged in a full-time course of lectures, with specific times set aside for the continuation of teaching practice.  This, I think, would be beneficial because in a course of studies such as the higher diploma, the students learn of methods of education and the psychology of education and they are dealing with situations which they have never experienced.  If they had at least a few months of full-time teaching practice, such a course would be much more meaningful and beneficial to them.</P>
    <P>I think also that during the first six months or so of full-time practical teaching regular work study sessions should be held with inspectors and psychologists during which there could be an exchange of experiences, problems and ideas and in that way many difficulties that arise in a classroom would be overcome.  Furthermore, it would help to weed out those who have no vocation before they had taken their examinations.  This must be followed through.  There is no point in having such a course for 12 months <Col N="818" /> and then dropping it and having no follow up, but I will come to that in a little while.</P>
    <P>I believe that corporal punishment should be abolished once and for all. Again, speaking as a former teacher, I know that it is administered only by those who should not be in charge of pupils.  It demonstrates without doubt a major defect in the personality or character of the teacher who administers it.  Such people have no place in a classroom.  The true teacher, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, should be in control of his subject or subjects and should exercise a discipline by his very presence, a discipline based on respect.  Again from experience I can truly say that if the teacher is not respected and not in command of his subject material, in order to exercise discipline, he must have recourse to corporal punishment or to sarcasm which, needless to say, is much worse.</P>
    <P>Many teachers have very serious problems and they need help by way of subject material and psychological advice.  I suggest to the Minister that this could quite easily be made available by way of summer courses which should be organised on a massive scale and cover a wide range of subjects.  To make this really effective the inspectorate and the psychological service must be greatly expanded.  I am sure the Minister is fully aware that the psychology of education and the methods of education are shamefully neglected.</P>
    <P>I had the honour once to conduct a summer course for teachers on nuclear physics and I can say that that course was highly successful, but we have heard practically nothing about it since.  The subject material is increasing and becoming more complex every year.  There is need to concentrate, revise syllabuses and there is need to conduct summer courses for teachers every year, not alone on purely subject matter but, as I say, on the psychology of education and the methods of education.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the Minister that we adopt here something along the lines of the American system, the system known as the credit system whereby teachers are given recognition for <Col N="819" /> summer courses attended and examinations passed every year.  Teachers there are given considerable incentives to attend such courses.  They are given reasonable living allowances and if they are married they are given an allowance for their families as well.  The credits result in greater remuneration for them. That is a very worthwhile system.  It is a system that would not involve any great capital outlay and I would strongly urge on the Minister that he would introduce it as far as is practicable.</P>
    <P>There is need for involvement and participation on the part of teachers if our educational system is to be a success. By means of such summer courses, at which teachers should be invited to read papers, their interest and enthusiasm can be fired.  At the moment they are being stifled through frustration. Teachers very easily get into a rut.  In their first year they are very enthusiastic; they prepare notes but you very often find that they are still using those very same notes 20 years later. That is a very bad system which should not be allowed to continue.  Again by means of refresher courses this system can be changed.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to teach a subject like one of the practical sciences without a suitable laboratory and suitable equipment.  I found that the secondary schools in the bush in Africa were far better equipped than our secondary schools here.  That surely is a very poor reflection on us.  I would ask the Minister to make liberal grants available for the equipment of schools. It would also be an incentive to increase the number of university scholarships and it would certainly be an advantage to teachers to really introduce a career guidance system.  We have made a very small attempt at doing so.  A few years ago a summer course was held for teachers on career guidance, but the system is not working and it never will work, because it was envisaged at the time that teachers or a particular teacher who attended the course on career guidance would be given adequate time during the week to attend to this subject.  Most teachers have a very heavy schedule <Col N="820" /> and they are not released from their regular work to attend to career guidance.  Hence I think it is true to say that it is practically non-existent.</P>
    <P>It would be of considerable assistance to all teachers and to education in general to expand the inspectorate and to change its role.  The inspector should really be an educational adviser. He should be able to help teachers with their problems and make suggestions to them regarding methods, <i>et cetera</i>.  Instead I think it is fair to say that the average inspector is a glorified clerk.  The psychological service is also understaffed and is not satisfactory.  A lady teacher in Cork who had a number of neurotic children told me that on numerous occasions she has asked for their assistance, but her requests have been repeatedly ignored.  They probably had such a very heavy workload that they could not possibly attend to all queries but one would imagine that at least her requests would have been acknowledged. We have, too, in Cork a system known as Part 6 Education, that is, one day per week to comply with the school leaving age.  I asked the Minister quite some time ago if it was intended to end this system and I still have not received an answer from him.</P>
    <P>I was asked to raise this point and I would be obliged if the Minister would let me know about it.  It is serving a very useful purpose at the moment and it would be a shame to abolish it.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to expedite the building programme for Cobh.  As he is aware, the technical school there has very little accommodation and they are trying to run classes in an old dilapidated hall, which is not fit for occupation.</P>
    <P>I have received a complaint about the free school books scheme.  I believe money is being given to vocational education committees every year to give to the less well-off pupils for the purchase of books.  In many cases £8 and £10 is given to pupils.  Needless to say the books are not purchased. Those in charge of the scheme are not permitted to give any money for the purchase of books to pupils <Col N="821" /> whose parents are not medical card holders.  There can be borderline cases and the regulations should be relaxed to facilitate such people.  It would be far better if the teachers bought the books, kept them in the schools and let the children use them during the year.  They could be collected at the end of the academic year and most of them would be suitable for use the following year.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make as much money as possible available for the education of the mentally and physically handicapped.  It is true to say that we rely on the generosity of people to provide money for the special schools for mentally and physically handicapped.  They deserve consideration and financial help from all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the previous speaker has said about the free books scheme.  Under the scheme if a boy's parents are medical card holders he gets free books.  At the end of the year he can sell those books to a neighbour's child who is not entitled to free books.  The first boy can then go back to the school and get another set of books in his new class.  This is a loophole in the free books scheme.  I agree with Deputy Cott that it would be much better if the teacher kept the books in the school and the children were given the use of them.  I am sure the Department have received many complaints from the teachers about what is happening under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the Irish language.  I was not here when the Minister introduced this Estimate.  When I got the Official Report to find out what he said I discovered his speech was in Irish and that he had not said anything in English.  My Irish is not sufficient to allow me to read and comprehend the Minister's speech.  We hear a lot of talk about the Irish language.  We had a half-hour of nonsense about it on Telefís Éireann last Saturday week when we heard and saw different people arguing for and against the language.  A vocational teacher had great difficulty in trying to put forward his point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the fault of most of us that the <Col N="822" /> Irish language is not spoken as much as it should be today.  People like me who were born after 1922 grew up under an educational system in which we left school at 14 or 15 years of age, or with our leaving certificate, with a very good working knowledge of the language.  Since then we have not used it in our everyday lives.  We all talk about our love for the language and that we will never see it die.  If we tried to speak the language more we would make ourselves better understood to the fluent Irish speakers.  If the language dies it will be because we have let it die.  It has been left to die by people who are full of great thoughts about the language but who will not use it.  If we do not use the language in the ordinary course of conversation in Leinster House, in the bars and elsewhere, we cannot hope to see it revived.  It will be a great tragedy if the present generation do not revive it and carry it forward again.</P>
    <P>Somebody made the point that when we stand up here to speak on education we have our minds focussed on 20 or 30 years ago and that many things have changed since then.  One of the things I was glad to see changed was the method of teaching Irish.  I can see from my own children that there is now much greater emphasis on ordinary conversation and much less on grammar. I heard Professor Seán Ó Tuama say that if we could revive conversational Irish in the next 50 years we have a million years in which to revive the grammar.  The grammar will come from the spoken language.  The important thing is to converse in the language, no matter how ungrammatical we may be.</P>
    <P>At one stage this evening there were only four Deputies in the House, including the Minister, Deputy Cott and I.  Three of them were teachers. I would say there are more teachers in Dáil Éireann that there are members from any other profession.  That being so, this being the legislative Assembly and the teachers being in the engine room of education, as it were, one would think greater influence would be brought to bear on the Department of Education to bring the educational system up-to-date, to make it what it <Col N="823" /> should be, for the formation of the youth.  I am less qualified than any of the other three Deputies now in the House to speak on the subject of education.  On the other hand, I am a parent, and parents form a vitally important part of the educational system.  If there is not an atmosphere of encouragement in the home which gets children to assimilate what they are being taught, I do not think we will succeed in making the necessary progress in education.</P>
    <P>With the advent of free post-primary education in the past few years it became highly important that there should be a willingness on the part of parents to send their children to school. This has become all important.  We seem to have been thinking on the line that we educate our children so that they will get better jobs on passing the leaving certificate.  There has been a pounds, shillings and pence mentality about education.  The mentality has been that if you send a child to school until he gets the leaving certificate and then he goes out digging roads the four years he spent at post-primary education have been lost.</P>
    <P>Education should be regarded as an end in itself, not as the means to getting more money and better jobs. We have not got this across yet.  Lots of leaving certificate students who came out in the past few years and who failed to appreciate this have become frustrated and disenchanted with post-primary education.  If we cannot educate the parents to the idea that boys and girls on leaving post-primary schools at 18 years will not necessarily get better jobs, we will not be succeeding. We will have turned out a lot of graduates who are not educated and who will have made very little use of the ten years they spent in post-primary education, mainly because they thought it would earn them more money than somebody else.  I am afraid this is not easy to rectify.  We must bring it home <Col N="824" /> to parents and students that there is not a guaranteed amount of money for the child who has secondary education. Indeed, we would hope that the levels of income for all sections of the community would rise to such an extent that all boys and girls at 18 years would have the same level of income.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cott and other Deputies spoke about physically and mentally disabled children and the necessity to provide more money for them.  There is the story in the Bible about the man with the five talents.  That is what an educational system should do&mdash;teach man not to bury his talents but so to better himself that he can increase the amount of understanding and goodwill he can bring to the community in city and country.  In this field of the physically and mentally handicapped, most progress has been made in Cork due to the efforts of the polio after-care association.  As the Minister knows, they have set up factories for the mentally and physically disabled.  This has filled a great need.  The schools under their care are more advanced than similar schools in England or in many parts of America.  At the moment people from America are studying the system with a view to applying it at home.</P>
    <P>Deputies last week got a circular from Dr. Daly asking them if they would fill in &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the question of corporal punishment in schools.  The circular was to be completed and returned in seven days.  I got one of those circulars and I agreed with the sentiments expressed in it. However, instead of sending it in within the seven days I kept it for nine days.  Then I wrote into it that I did not favour the prohibition of corporal punishment but neither was I in favour of using it.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2nd March, 1972.</P>
