      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach whether there is any reason why no legislation has been introduced in this past week in view of the fact that so often we are informed that there is a build-up and that there is not enough time for legislation?  A week has gone by without any.</P>

      <P>The Estimates are part of the Business of the House and we want to get them through, naturally. The Minister for Local Government is away at the European Environment Congress and there is a Bill currently before the House for which he is responsible. The Deputy can be assured that it is hoped to resume consideration of legislation next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Following certain information which I have received it may be necessary for me to speak for a little longer than I had originally hoped to do.  One of the disappointing things which has come to light in the past week is the reply from the Minister to a parliamentary question of mine.  I asked him for up-to-date information relating to Appendix A of the Report of the Consultative Council on the General Medical and Hospital Services.  Appendix A refers to the hospital statistics for each year ended 31st December.  I asked the figures for 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1971.  This is the biggest Estimate for Health ever introduced in this House. It is clearly indicated that the amount of money which the Exchequer will allocate to the Department of Health in future years, and the amount of money which will be collected from the rates will escalate so that in the very near future the Estimate for the Department of Health will be the <Col N="1629" /> largest Estimate of all.  The reply I got was that the figures would take some time to compile and that the Minister would communicate with me in the near future.  I put down the question specifically to obtain the information to show the gradual systematic increase in the cost of hospitalisation in the hospitals mentioned at pages 131, 132, 133, 134 and up to 140 of this report, otherwise known as the FitzGerald Report, named after Professor Patrick FitzGerald who was the chairman of that consultative body.</P>
      <P>Not having these figures renders what I am going to say open to argument. On the 27th October, 1971, when I asked the Minister for Health the average weekly cost of maintaining a patient in a teaching hospital in Dublin I was informed that it was estimated to be in the range of £60 to £80 per week. That was for the year 1970-71.  Since then we know that costs have increased. In one of the best teaching hospitals in Europe, St. Vincent's, the chairman of the board estimates that prior to April it will cost £90 to maintain a patient in that hospital.  In quoting a figure like that it is important to remember that no hospital has a breakdown of the cost of their out-patient services as distinct from their in-patient services. There are the hospitals outlined on page 131 of the FitzGerald Report, with the capitation cost, total annual cost per occupied bed, total daily cost per occupied bed, but it is only in certain cases, such as district hospitals or county hospitals where little or no out-patient service is provided, that a fairly accurate figure could be arrived at as to the weekly cost of maintaining a patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One fault of hospital administration arises from the fact that the majority of para-medical staff&mdash;laboratory technicians, radiographers, and so on&mdash; whose work nobody can praise sufficiently, have a five-day week which results in very few hospital tests being carried out on Saturdays and Sundays. If a general practitioner comes across a patient needing hospitalisation on a Friday the patient will be provided with nursing care on Friday, Saturday and Sunday but the routine hospital <Col N="1630" /> investigation will not begin to take place until the Monday, when the technicians resume work.</P>
    <P>Some time ago there was a strike among laboratory technicians in certain hospitals.  It had got to the ludicrous stage where technicians were ascertaining as to whether or not patients needed certain blood tests carried out before they would come into the hospital. They did provide an emergency service. I am not condemning them in any way. Many of the hospital staffs are underpaid for the work they do.</P>
    <P>I want to support Deputy Tom Meaney in the praise he gave yesterday to the nurses and medical staff of hospitals who work long hours and are dedicated to the welfare of patients. He defined such service correctly as a vocation.  Many of these people sacrifice time and leisure to the care of the sick, for which they deserve great praise.</P>
    <P>There is a great anomaly in the Dublin hospital services.  I refer to the power which the Minister for Health has under the 1943 St. Laurence's Hospital Act.  That Act entitles him to complete control over that hospital which is administered by a board of governors.  There are 20 or more on the board of governors but the quorum is three.  The St. Laurence's Hospital is the only hospital in the Twenty-six Counties where the Minister for Health has total responsibility for administration.  I am very suspicious of the regulation that any person employed on the medical staff of St. Laurence's Hospital must sign a legal undertaking that he will never speak or write or say any words about this hospital either during the time of his employment with the hospital or at any time after he has left the hospital. It is interesting to note that of all the people who have ever been elected here one of those who has ever served in St. Laurence's Hospital can claim the privilege of this House and not be taken to court under the Minister's regulations forbidding anybody to criticise the services and the buildings in that hospital.</P>
    <P>I want to praise the staff who give devoted service to the patients there but I want to condemn the facilities which have been provided by the <Col N="1631" /> Minister.  In regard to any grants the Minister may give to this hospital to repair boilerhouses or provide laundries or restaurants, the prime consideration should be the patients.  People have mentioned the Hardwicke section of the hospital, which is 300 years old.  That started off as a house of industry.  As was stated recently by one of the consultants to the hospital, it is not often that a hospital has the privilege of celebrating its bi-centenary.  Up to the time that we took control of our own affairs, in 1922, hospital services were few and far between.  They consisted largely of voluntary hospitals.  In the case of Temple Street, a group of ladies of the Vice-Regal Lodge had adopted the idea of taking in four or five children from destitute homes.  That was the position before the hospital was taken over by the Sisters of Charity, who have since done such good work.</P>
    <P>I am fed up hearing Deputies on one side or another criticising the religious orders for the work they do and alleging that they have vested interests in the hospital services.  I have worked with religious orders in hospitals and I can assure the Minister that the day he interferes with religious orders running hospitals&mdash;whether it is the St. John of God Brothers, the Sisters of Charity, the Sisters of Mercy, the Blue Nuns or any other order&mdash;that is the day he will rue and the day that the hospital services, inadequate as they may be, will start to deteriorate.  We have seen sufficient of lay administration in State hospitals and the type of facilities provided.</P>
    <P>I mentioned briefly yesterday the fact that the operating theatre at St. Mary's Hospital, Cappagh, Dublin 11, which is the only operating theatre of its kind in this country, designed for specialist inter-articular surgery under sterile air conditions, had to be financed from the reverend mother's purse.  Application had been made to the Minister for Health for a grant towards this project and it was not forthcoming.  There are three surgeries like this in the British Isles and three in the rest of Europe, but when the Sisters of Charity in Cappagh Hospital want to make progress because they <Col N="1632" /> want to see their patients get the best possible treatment, the Department of Health for some reason completely ignore their application.  I do not see any reference to it in the Estimate or to the provision of any grant for 1972-73 to offset the expenses involved in the erection of this operating theatre.</P>
    <P>The FitzGerald Report is one of the best examples of the dedication of the medical profession, of which Deputy Meaney spoke yesterday. Within six months, at the request of the then Minister for Health, Deputy Flanagan, they compiled this exhaustive and well researched report which was accepted in principle but about which very little has been done.  I shall refer briefly to one or two sections of the report but I shall do so at a slightly later time.</P>
    <P>There are too many aspects of medical care in this country which have not been receiving the priority they should and I have formed the opinion that unless a group of parents are driven together in a common cause, such as happened in regard to the spina bifida matter, and the Epileptic Association, and in regard to the mentally handicapped, no help is forthcoming from the top.  This country at the moment, from the health point of view, seems to be directed by voluntary bodies driven together by despair into seeking aid from the Minister.  It is because of this, because of the excellent work done by those voluntary bodies, that on 1st October, 1971, the Minister produced a regulation whereby people who suffer from mental handicaps, spina bifida, epilepsy and hydrocephaly can obtain free medicines without any income assessments.</P>
    <P>However, there are three other groups of people in our society, and from statistics the Minister has produced to us indicating the life span of the people of this country, we find that the life expectancy of people is 50 years.  However, during the past ten years we find that people have been living longer.  Although they are living longer, there are three diseases not listed in the document of 1st October, 1971, which are common in that age group. <Col N="1633" /> One is the disease knows as arthritis, be it osteo-arthritis or rheumatoid-arthritis. It is a disease which in many cases can cripple a person so badly that he finds it very difficult to walk or even to move about the house. I think every Deputy in the House will have a close relative or a friend who suffers from a severe degree of arthritis. This disease, although it is difficult to define it specifically, is described as being mild, moderate or severe.  Can the Minister tell me which disease cannot be defined as mild, moderate or severe?  This classification of illnesses ranges throughout all medical text books.</P>
    <P>The second disease omitted from the October list of illnesses which do not qualify for assistance is bronchitis.  In a climate such as ours, bronchitis is perhaps one of the most common illnesses among people of more than 60 years of age.  Not only is it common in so far as its incidence among the population is high but also the classification of the illness could be described as being common.  By that I mean it is a disease which has acerbation and remissions: during the summer it may ease off but during the winter, particularly the winter we have had which lasted eight months, it is rampant and severe right into the month of June.</P>
    <P>The third illness is that of emphysema, a complication of bronchitis. Neither of these diseases was included in the October list and I will say why I think they were not.  Of course it is only my personal opinion.  They were not included&mdash;had they been included a lot of hardship to many families would have been eased&mdash;because the bill for medicines to the Department of Health and to the health boards would be much higher than the total amount required for treatment of the diseases which were included in the October list.</P>
    <P>I say without intending any insult to the Minister that the majority of those who applied for assistance on 1st October, 1971, were people already in a position to obtain assistance from local health authorities.  Those who could not get assistance were suffering <Col N="1634" /> from those other illnesses and the incomes of these people would have prevented them from obtaining relief otherwise.</P>
    <P>There is one special aspect of this which I should like the Minister to consider.  He might not be aware that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board will not take on people after a certain age.  They will not insure people who have suffered previously from an illness. They will not, for instance, insure a person for treatment, hospital or otherwise, of a duodenal ulcer or a gastric ulcer if they have had previous treatment for that.  By doing this they have shown they can keep down the cost of premiums, but at the same time they are preventing people from availing of these facilities.</P>
    <P>I know of many people who are unable to meet hospitalisation costs because their premiums have increased. I am not interested in the figures given by the Minister when he quoted a person earning £2,000 per year who had a hospital Bill of £600 and who could apply for assistance or tax relief. This is a hardship which need not have occurred.  There is no need for the health boards to be so strict in the allocation of assistance to people suffering from ill-health.  In my view the health board could best be defined as a board established to help people suffering ill-health.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to reconcile certain statements made by the Minister with regard to increased hospital costs. Approximately two weeks after the first increase of 50 per cent was announced, the Federated Union of Voluntary Hospitals in Dublin issued a statement to the effect that the 50 per cent increase would not be sufficient to cover costs for the coming year and that a further increase would be necessary. This is not good administration. Deputies have an obligation to criticise where criticism is necessary.  I know that the Minister and his officials have the interests of the people at heart but possibly the bureaucracy of the health services has got out of hand and, perhaps, they cannot keep tabs on everything that is happening.</P>
    <P>Recently I sent a patient&mdash;a person <Col N="1635" /> earning a modest wage&mdash;for an X-ray and he received a bill for £8.40.  The hospital concerned was St. Laurence's Hospital.  Perhaps at the end of the year the man may be able to claim for income tax relief.  Nevertheless, for any young couple who are trying to pay rates, to set up house, or who may be trying to save to buy a house, it is impossible for them to pay these costs. If a patient is sent for a barium meal test the bill can be in the region of £20 if he is an out-patient unless he is covered by the 15p contribution.  In this connection with regard to the amount estimated to be collected in the full financial year&mdash;in the region of £5,300,000&mdash;it is interesting to note that this is greater than the total amount allocated from the sweepstakes to the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  It appears the Department cannot lean on this fund for much longer to get them out of trouble when they run into debt.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the proposals made by the Minister in his regulations with regard to the establishment of the hospital boards.  These appear to be most unclear.  It is proposed to have three regional hospital boards&mdash; one for Dublin, one for Cork and one for Galway.  The board in Dublin will look after the health boards in that area; Cork will do the same for the two health boards in their area and the same will apply to Galway. This is proposed in order to rationalise the health and hospital services provided but in the statistics shown we find an allocation of funds for the provision of an intensive care unit in Galway Regional Hospital and also in Merlin Park.  This notwithstanding the fact that the FitzGerald Report was unhappy about the proximity of these two hospitals and was disturbed that the facilities would be unnecessarily duplicated.  The hospitals are only a few miles apart; to my mind, it would be better to have one wellstaffed intensive care unit.  I do not wish to infer that if intensive care units were provided in both hospitals they would not be well staffed but there would be a duplication of equipment and unnecessary administrative and maintenance expenses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> The section proposing the establishment of the new hospital bodies has created considerable disquiet among Deputies.  I should like to give the Minister notice about our considerable reservations with regard to this section.  We will oppose and we will call for a division unless our recommendations and suggestions are met in the Minister's reply.  We cannot accept what is stated in this section.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's statement it is said:</P>
    <P>These boards will also play an important role in the examination of the budgets of hospitals and in allocating financial resources.</P>
    <P>Surely it is the responsibility of the health boards to help finance the hospitals, to help in the allocation of financial resources and in the examination of the budgets of hospitals. These boards must have some function in this matter.</P>
    <P>Reading through the health board regulations, I noted that the health boards have power to set up sub-committees to visit hospitals.  I would welcome the establishment of regional hospitals if I thought they would have teeth, if I thought that members of the Dublin Regional Hospital Board could visit St. Ita's Hospital at Portrane and, for instance, recommend the erection of units to replace the temporary units there which might not be conducive to the rapid recovery of patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the Deputy has not read the document in connection with this matter.  The regional hospital boards will examine the budgets of voluntary hospitals and co-ordinate and integrate them with the regional health board hospitals. The regional health boards do not examine the budgets of voluntary hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would have been better if the Minister had explained this in his brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was explained in detail when the Health Act was being discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Without getting into an altercation with the Minister on this <Col N="1637" /> matter, the Minister's brief states: that these boards also will play an important part in the examination of the budgets of hospitals and in allocating financial resources.  There is no mention, though, of voluntary hospitals. Many statements have been issued by the Irish Medical Union and the Irish Medical Association opposing the health regulations.  The Minister deserves a certain amount of credit for the information contained in his brief which indicates that he has made attempts to meet some of the points raised by the medical associations.</P>
      <P>Regarding the appointment of consultative staff at teaching hospitals, one point I should like to make is that in Great Britain where there is probably the most socialist medical service in the world the teaching hospitals have the power to appoint their consultant teaching staff.  My own opinion is that qualifications do not in any way indicate the ability of a consultant to impart his knowledge to students.  The health service in Britain is far more bureaucratic than ours although ours seems to be heading in that direction, too, but since the hospitals there have the power to appoint their consultant teaching staff, I would be inclined to leave the matter open here for a while.</P>
      <P>I have said here before that the idea of the regional hospital boards, the health boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal is a blueprint of the British system.  I have supported the rationalisation of the more than 70 hospitals and institutions in the Dublin area and I support also the rationalisation of the 225 odd hospitals and institutions that are outside the Dublin area.  It is not difficult to realise how great are the administrative expenses of these hospitals and institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that part of his speech dealing with health statistics the Minister refers to volume 4 of the McKinsey Report the purpose of which is to help and direct the health boards in the allocation of their finances.  However, I must tell the Minister that volume 4 of the McKinsey Report is not available in the Dáil Library and neither has it been circulated to Deputies.  Therefore, if a Deputy wishes to read the volume he must <Col N="1638" /> go to the Department of Health and see the Minister's copy.  How can we be expected to contribute constructively on the contents of the report if it is not available to us?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The volumes of the McKinsey Report are in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wishes to check, he will find that they were not there on Friday last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of health boards who are Deputies have had the McKinsey Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so but other Members of this House have not had it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not go on because he will not convince me.  My communication over the whole of the reorganisation of the health services is absolutely unique in the history of this House.  The amount of communication and documentation is unique.  The Deputy may talk for the next hour but he will not convince me or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in any way attempting to decry the Minister regarding the amount of information he gives us.  Perhaps this information is unique but, if so, it is unique in a relative way in that the information given to us by previous Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Government has been such that it has prevented Deputies from contributing constructively to debates.  All volumes of the McKinsey Report, except volume 4, are in the Dáil Library but where are we to see the one that is missing?  I should like to have seen the contents of that volume before making my contribution here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked questions in the House and I have been insulted by the Minister, to my great surprise, in that he refused to answer questions.  When Mr. Kevin Boland and Deputy Blaney were Ministers they answered questions. I have been referred continuously to the health boards and told to write to them for information.  This happened to Deputy Begley in December, <Col N="1639" /> 1971, and Deputy Donegan suggested on the Adjournment that surely the Minister should not refer every Deputy to the health boards for a reply to questions.  This would increase the bureaucracy of the health boards.</P>
    <P>This party&mdash;and I speak with the full authority of the Fine Gael Party on this&mdash;are not totally satisfied with the way in which the health boards are administering the local health services. The Minister supports me in this statement because he said that some health boards questioned the timing for the establishment of these bodies and suggested that the proposed regulations should be deferred for some years, until the new administration under the health boards had settled down.  He said that the Eastern Health Board also suggested that the administration of the Dublin Regional Hospital Board should be tied in with that of the health board and that, as regards the timing of the establishment of the new health bodies, it would not be wise to wait.</P>
    <P>Let me say this to the officials of the Department of Health.  This party are recognised throughout the country as being a responsible party.  We do not make wild allegations.  In the Minister's statement he admits that some health boards have questioned the timing of the establishment of the hospital bodies.  Perhaps in years to come it may be necessary to establish these bodies.  If you refer to the powers of the three regional hospitals you will see that many of the committees which they are empowered to set up are duplicated by health boards who can set up similar committees.  It would be interesting to know the number of visiting committees and sub-committees which have been set up by health boards since their establishment. It would also be interesting if we could obtain the figure&mdash;but I doubt that we could&mdash;for the number of times these sub-committees have met.  It would be interesting to know the number of times the sub-committees have reported back to the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>With regard to the selection and <Col N="1640" /> appointment of hospital consultants, this party will not become involved in medical politics as such.  The Irish Medical Union and the Irish Medical Association have condemned the powers given to the voluntary hospitals under which they retain the right of appointing consultative staff.  When the pool of consultants was set up for county council and local authority hospitals, it was understood that there would be an interchange of consultants, that they would serve so many years down the country and then come up to a city hospital, and that there would be a rotation type of scheme.</P>
    <P>Because of Fianna Fáil policy this was dropped and county surgeons and physicians were left in the county hospitals where, I might add, they do a great job of work, a job of work second to none.  There is one county surgeon and one county physician. They might have a registrar and they might have a houseman if they are lucky.  They are on duty 24 hours a day for 365 days a year.  They cannot take holidays unless they can get a locum with the same qualifications as themselves who is willing to go down the country and take the appointment. Having regard to the number of consultants in the country, this is very difficult. It is not surprising to know that many of the services in these hospitals are slowing down.</P>
    <P>Any Department, association or union who change for the sake of change can be making a grave mistake. At least at the moment if these appointments are being made they are being made by the boards of the voluntary hospitals and they are not being made by Comhairle na nOspidéal.  If that were the case, let me warn the House that every politician north, south, east and west would be lobbied to use their influence to obtain a consultancy appointment for somebody.  Our party have stood firm and fast over the past 50 years on the principle of trying to avoid that type of political jobbery.  We must not allow that type of corruption in appointments to creep into our hospital services.</P>
    <P>We have heard criticism of the voluntary hospitals.  I stand wholeheartedly behind them because without <Col N="1641" /> the voluntary hospitals we would have no hospital services to talk of.  Without the likes of the Reverend Mother building her operating theatre over in Cappagh and without the likes of the nuns in St. Vincent's Hospital building their hospital with a certain amount of State aid, and without long-term planning and years of foresight on the part of people like the Mother Mary Aikenhead nuns who are building one of the best geriatric homes for underprivileged people at Madonna House where would we be?</P>
    <P>How could you compare their work with the bureaucratic 40 or 50 hour week of the lay people involved in the services?  They deserve the greatest credit.  They work non-stop.</P>
    <P>Mark you, they would be fairly happy, I believe, to relinquish the authority they have over the administration of these hospitals if they could be assured that those who would replace them would dedicate themselves to the same extent to this particular work.  Where, in Europe, would one find better institutions for handicapped children than those run by the St. John of God Brothers here?  Nowhere.  One of the best hospitals in the British Isles is St. Vincent's Hospital in Elm Park. This hospital has been achieved as the result of the Reverend Mother in 1934 buying the land out there and drawing up plans.  The nuns got precious little help from the Government in this project. There were many private contributors to the building of that hospital. One cannot praise enough the dedication and the work done by the nuns and brothers involved in hospital care.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>In most cases, I would expect that contracts by the regional hospitals board would apply where a consultant was needed to serve a number of hospitals under different managements.  Otherwise, it seems likely that the authority employing the consultant will remain as at present, that is, it will be the health board or the voluntary hospital body concerned.</P>
    <P>As far as the effectiveness of the services will be concerned, I do not think that this change which I have <Col N="1642" /> made will of itself be very significant.</P>
    <P>Here we have change purely for the sake of change.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Many views were expressed on the size and membership of the bodies.</P>
    <P>Of course, views have been expressed. We know that the majority of the members on Comhairle na nOspidéal will be from the medical profession.  The chairman and vice-chairman will be appointed directly by the Minister.  The remaining 11 members will be appointed in consultation with the medical profession, the Irish Medical Association and the Irish Medical Union.  The majority of those charged with the care of our hospitals will be from the medical profession.  There are people who argue that doctors should not have a majority on health boards. Some people whom I had thought responsible in their attitude to health apparently think that doctors might have a vested interest in the administration of the health services and might use their position to forward their own interests.  Anyone who has any experience of hospitals knows the work these people do.  They are not in the profession for money.  If they were in it for material gain they would now be in the United States of America where they could make money.</P>
    <P>What kind of remuneration does a consultant in a voluntary hospital get? He gets a great deal less than Deputy L'Estrange or I get here.  I was speaking to a consultant recently who attends a voluntary hospital seven days a week.  He spends 24 hours a week in the operating theatre and two days a week in the out-patients department, apart from his ward work, and his remuneration is slightly over £2,000.  There is no travel allowance or any other allowance.  Let nobody think these people are trying to hide their money in farms or that they have a vested interest in this.  It may surprise some to learn that a consultant gets 12½p per day for each bed under his control in one Dublin hospital. Let no one try to convince me that these men are attempting to further their own material interests. Those who have experience of hospitals are most appreciative of the services <Col N="1643" /> they get in hospitals.  Many patients would be surprised to learn that the consultant who visits them at midnight or at 2 o'clock in the morning gets 12½p for his work.  I believe there are a number of Deputies who are unaware of this.</P>
    <P>Later in his speech, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>A number of those consulted suggested increasing the membership of Comhairle na nOspidéal and of the Cork and Galway Regional Hospital Boards.  I have also had very many requests for representation on each of the bodies.  Clearly, I could not accede to all these requests without having an unmanageable and ineffective membership on the bodies.  Accordingly, I have not increased the membership of the bodies and realise that in choosing members I will have a difficult task in balancing the conflicting wishes of many of those who were consulted. I hope it will be taken by all that my final decision on this, when I take it, will be a reasonable one, taken in the interests of the services as a whole.</P>
    <P>My party have decided to support the health boards but we have requested the Minister to defer the appointment of the three regional hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal because we think this will lead to more bureaucratic control in the administration of the health services.  The health boards, justifiable as they may be, have not served the people at local level as well as the local authorities did.  An interesting feature is the fact that four years ago 33.3 per cent of patients were holders of medical cards and entitled to free treatment.  On 31st March this year that figure had dropped to 27.6 per cent.  The first figure of 33.3 per cent is based on the population figure of the 1966 census and the 27 per cent is based on the 1971 census which showed an increase in the population.  The numbers relatively are far less.</P>
    <P>The Minister attempted to justify the figures at that time on the grounds of the increased income of people through the country.  I dispute this.  I <Col N="1644" /> think the reason why the number of health cards has dropped is that since the health boards were set up they have adopted a slide-rule, bureaucratic system of administering some health cards and eliminating others.  It was greatly appreciated that the CEO of the Eastern Health Board, two days after I had raised the question in the Dáil last week or the week before, announced that he was bringing in a special system whereby&mdash;let me quote the example he gave&mdash;a person earning £35 a week who had mortgage repayments to meet on his house, rates to pay and insurance premiums and other regular unavoidable expenses, would have all these deducted from the income on which he would be assessed and only the amount of his take-home pay would be considered in regard to the allocation of medical cards.  A husband and wife earning £16 net between them would qualify for a full medical card.  In qualifying for a full medical card now one does not have the stigma attached to going to a health centre or dispensary and joining a long queue.</P>
    <P>Since 1961 our party have advocated, through its Just Society policy document the abolition of dispensary services. We were pleased, and we supported the Minister last year, when he introduced the provisions whereby in the Eastern Health Board area dispensaries were abolished.  From my own personal experience I find the hospitalisation rate of medical card holders has been reduced to an absolute minimum and the improvement this means in family environment is tremendous. There is no long queue for the chemist at the dispensary: that has gone.  People can now go to a private chemist and get medicine on special prescription.  I have never seen such a change in the attitude of patients since 1st April.  Instead of people reluctantly accepting the system imposed by previous Fianna Fáil governments, they are relaxed, co-operative, responsive and much of the stress and strain which they suffered has been removed.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Minister has made many changes but one of the changes which has resulted in improvement in medical care has been the choice of doctor service in the Eastern Health <Col N="1645" /> Board area.  I do not know how it will work in other areas but there are still sections of the general medical services which need to be improved.  I would mention the armed forces.  A private soldier, married, with three or four children, can obtain medical attention in hospitals free of charge.  He could do this prior to 1st October, 1971, but since then he has to pay 15p per week under the 1971 Health Contributions Act.  He had that free service prior to the introduction of that Act and now 15p per week is being deducted from his pay.  He has not had a pay increase since 1970: we know all the difficulties about that and how it has been delayed. There is grave unrest among all ranks in the armed forces because of the medical services which I believe should be controlled by the Minister for Health and not the Minister for Defence who knows nothing about them; neither do his officials.  The colonel in charge of the medical services might know something about them but, as far as I know, he is extremely overworked and it is not possible for him to find time to engage in drawing up new health services for the armed forces.</P>
    <P>I have met constituents living in Finglas, Navan Road, McKee Park, Blackhorse Avenue, North Circular Road, Willow Park and Ballymun who are in the armed forces and I see the expense they incur should any of their children become sick and need general medical services at home.  I mention the matter on this Estimate because I believe it is the responsibility of the Department of Health to provide medical services for everybody in the country.  I have asked previously whether the Minister for Health intends to extend the general medical services to the dependants of members of the armed forces and repeatedly I have been told there is no intention at present of doing so.  The wives and children of private soldiers are among the most underprivileged if they become ill and have to call in a private doctor.  There is no provision for them to get free medicine or free medical attention.  I sincerely urge the Department to consider including the armed forces, particularly those under the salary level which the CEO of the Eastern Health Board specified <Col N="1646" /> recently, in the new general medical services.  They are among the most underprivileged people in the city of Dublin in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Begley will support me when I say that there is a shortage of general practitioners in Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Clare and Kerry. I would ask the Minister for Health to come to some arrangement with the local authorities or the health boards to offer scholarships to some students in the areas who intend to practise medicine on condition that when they qualify they would undertake to spend three years in those areas.  In this way you would have a continuous flow of newly-qualified doctors without any family commitments and without any children to educate.  They would provide a very essential general medical service in an area of the country where no service is provided at the present time.</P>
    <P>I worked for some time in Kenmare dispensary and district hospital and I was aware of the lack of a doctor in the Kilgarvan area which caters for approximately 1,200 people, not all of them medical card holders.  A colleague who was in college with me applied for this position and was appointed.  A few weeks ago I got a telephone call from him stating that it would not be viable for him to participate in the choice of doctor service. The Department of Health did very little to alleviate the position.  I asked a supplementary question in relation to a question tabled by Deputy John O'Leary.  It was not adequately answered.  We believe that the situation has now been rectified.  I quote this exception to prove the rule.</P>
    <P>The rule is that the western seaboard area of this country is as undermanned as India, Pakistan or the Central African states as regards doctors.  I have practised in those areas and I have been in areas where the nearest doctor is up to 25 miles away.  I have seen patients suffer serious illnesses because of the fact that there was no medical attention available.  Over a year ago I asked the Minister for Health a question regarding the number of dispensary positions in the western seaboard area from Kerry to Donegal which were not filled <Col N="1647" /> and the number of dispensary positions which were filled by temporary appointments.  As Deputies we are entitled to a certain amount of information which can help us to contribute to the Health Estimate.</P>
    <P>It is sad that after 50 years of home rule we have an ambulance service which has shown very little improvement, that we should have an ambulance service which is duplicated to such an extent that, if one wants to get a patient into hospital in the Eastern Health Board area, that patient can travel by taxi by courtesy of Dermot Ryan, a member of the Fianna Fáil executive.  In Dublin you have the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service which is run by the Department of Local Government and you have the Eastern Health Board ambulance service. There is close on one million people living in the Eastern Health Board area and when these ambulances are out on calls they are substituted by taxis from the Ryan group.  On many occasions I have had a taxi to take an infant into hospital because it would take too long to get an ambulance.</P>
    <P>We also have the Stillorgan Ambulance Service, a cardiac ambulance service.  It is only fair to say that whereas this is a private service run by Mr. Gleeson it is perhaps one of the most up-to-date cardiac ambulance services in Europe.  This was set up soon after the first cardiac ambulance service in the world was set up in Belfast.  If you have a coronary in your home you can have full treatment by this ambulance service.  This has saved many lives and has minimised cardiac damage to the utmost degree.</P>
    <P>I have said on many occasions that this country needs a national ambulance service run by the Department of Health, not by the Department of Local Government.  I am fed up listening to Deputies criticising doctors for not travelling to the scene of accidents. Recently an accident happened about 200 yards down the road from where I live.  Somebody rang me and I immediately drove down to the scene of the accident.  When I got there the patient had already been taken away in an ambulance.  It took me only a <Col N="1648" /> minute to get there.  This type of criticism regarding doctors not travelling to emergency accidents is unjustified.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government in their bye-laws forbid a doctor to carry an emergency siren or any light, temporary though it may be, on his car.  This means that during the months of June, July, August and September, when traffic is heavy on the roads with people going to the seaside, a doctor has no way in which he can indicate to other drivers that he is on an emergency call.  The Department of Health should have a look at this regulation.  This may be the last time I shall ever speak on a Health Estimate in this House and I want to say that the Department of Health should see if it is possible to change this regulation and whether a doctor can have some type of a flashing light on his car, which is forbidden by the present regulations under the Department of Local Government. In 1968, when I came from County Kerry to this city to practice, I tried to do this because the traffic was extremely heavy.  I was informed that under the regulations I was forbidden to do it. Yet I have heard people from Longford and Westmeath, Deputies from my own party, coming in here and criticising doctors for failing to go to the scene of accidents.  How can they get through the traffic, and if they get there, how are they to get back? I was recently in a situation which I shall never forget.  On Christmas Eve the caretaker of the dispensary in which I work in Ballymun was seriously ill, so ill that I took her into the car to drive her straight to the hospital, and on the way she died. There was no way in which I could get through the traffic.  There was no way in which I could indicate to the traffic that I was in a hurry.  Perhaps the lady might have lived; perhaps she might not have lived, but at least it would have been some consolation to her family had she arrived in the hospital alive.  I know that bureaucracy can get out of hand and that one law can contradict another, that as we go on Parkinson's law takes over.  However, let us keep things simple.  If we <Col N="1649" /> keep things simple they will turn out to be successful.  The Minister goes on to say, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I hope it will be taken by all that my final decision on this, when I take it, will be a reasonable one taken in the interest of the services as a whole.</P>
    <P>Much of what the Minister says in this is vague, non-specific and, to my mind, a lot of it is unworthy of comment except a section on page 3, paragraph 3, which again I quote:</P>
    <P>To this end I have arranged for Messrs McKinsey, the firm of management consultants who reported in relation to the health boards, to make recommendations on the administrative procedures and the staffing of the new bodies.  I expect that their report on this will be available as soon as the new bodies are ready to become functional.</P>
    <P>I have said already, and I repeat it to the officials of the Department, that the McKinsey Report, volume 4, is not available to Deputies in the Library. I shall now refer to something which I have raised in this House time and time again.  I have raised it here to the point of being criticised severely as being even a crank.  It is the question of drug abuse in this country, which first came to our notice in 1966. Deputy L'Estrange was the first to mention it.  Then Deputy Clinton mentioned it.  Then it was put on the long finger until 1969.  I came in and I was aware of it.  I drafted a Private Members Bill which would act as an interim measure until such time as the Minister for Health had a comprehensive Bill to produce in the House for full discussion.  I called, with our own shadow spokesman for Health, to the Minister's office and I presented him with a copy of this Bill.  It was short, simple and direct.  To my mind it would have achieved something in that it would have been an adequate deterrent and would have brought the legislation up to the level of that of Great Britain and France.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health told me and Deputy Dick Barry, our spokesman on Health, that he would have no objection whatsoever to granting us a <Col N="1650" /> First Reading of the Bill.  The First Reading merely means that it goes into print.  He could oppose it on the Second Reading if he wanted to or if he dare.  I doubt very much if there were many Deputies in the benches of the Fianna Fáil Party who would have opposed a measure that was going to try to curb the growing problem of drug abuse.  In November, 1971, the Minister for Health assured us that he would introduce legislation during that session to curb drug abuse.  In March, 1972, he assured us that legislation was in its final form of drafting and that he would have it before the House shortly.  Then suddenly the bubble burst.  The Taoiseach announced here one day the legislation that was to be taken before the Easter Recess and there was no mention of any legislation in relation to drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Recently, in reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Health indicated that he intended to introduce legislation in the current session to deal with this problem.  Leading up to this in January, 1972&mdash;and I believe that I have here in my hand the Bill which the Minister will introduce here&mdash;I asked the Minister for Justice whether there was any evidence of increased abuse of heroin or the selling of heroin in this country, and the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, answering for him said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I repeated that question about a month ago and the answer I got was that there were two people who had a charge against them for the illegal possession of heroin.  One of them had a charge against him for marijuana, barbiturates, morphine, pethedine and many other drugs, which could best be described as a cocktail.  The judge at the time of the court case recommended that this man be referred to the Dundrum treatment centre.  If I refer to something which has happened under the auspices of the Department of Justice in relation to drugs, the Chair could rule me out of order but I know he will not because he has heard the Minister for Health himself saying that the Bill is the responsibility of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has misled this Dáil on two separate occasions in <Col N="1651" /> the past two sessions, and I am giving due notice that unless this legislation is introduced during this current session there will be a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health on the Order Paper which will be taken as soon as possible.  The parents of the children of this country are completely and utterly bemused by the attitude of the different Departments at the present time.  They may have talked a lot about youth education, about producing a film outlining the dangers.  The Minister may have panicked and been pushed into taking the drug diconal off the market following the death of three teenagers in this city.  But what about other parts of Ireland?  This problem is not confined to Dublin city.  I will not mention any other parts of the country because there are Deputies who think the rivers in their constituencies flow with holy water.  Some of the largest areas of drug abuse are outside the city, in provincial towns and villages.  I know of a case where 24 teenagers were arrested in one town approximately six weeks after certain allegations had been made.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Bill, if he introduces it, will contain provisions similar to those in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971, presented to the British House of Commons by Reginald Maudling, the Secretary of State for Home Affairs.  This contains certain schedules and classification of drugs.  The Minister will follow the same pattern he has followed previously in issuing a blueprint of the British health services. The Ministry of Home Affairs in Britain is like our Department of Justice and I have always said that the misuse of drugs should be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice because it is a criminal offence.  Yet the Minister for Health has persisted in retaining this responsibility.  I do not think it should have anything to do with the Department of Health.  The only part the Department of Health should play, as far as drug abuse is concerned, is in providing adequate treatment to ensure that, as far as possible, drug addicts are given a chance to go back to as normal a life as possible following their mistakes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> Schedule II of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971, contains a list of approximately 75 drugs which are classified as A drugs and certain other definitions relating to these compounds.  If a person is found to be in illegal possession of any one of these drugs he is sentenced to a maximum of 14 years imprisonment.  If a person allows the consumption of these drugs on premises he owns, rents or occupies he is guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>Class B drugs contain substances such as amphetamine, codeine, cannabis and marijuana.  A person can walk into a chemist in Dublin and buy codeine but in Britian a person in possession of any of these drugs is sentenced to a maximum of five years. There are about ten drugs in that section and provision to add other drugs to it.</P>
    <P>Part III contains drugs which are classified as the C drugs.  These contain among other things a drug called Pemoline.  For any ladies who may be interested, this is a constituent of every slimming tablet prescribed in this country apart from one slimming tablet.  If, under the British Act, you are illegally in possession of a slimming tablet you can be sentenced to up to two years.</P>
    <P>The Private Members Bill which Deputy Dick Barry and I attempted to introduce here last November would have helped to curb the escalation and the explosion that has been occurring in the sale of heroin in this city since January.  We warned the Minister.  We pleaded with him in private.  We said: &ldquo;Take our Bill and introduce it yourself as an interim measure, purely as a deterrent.  The Garda drug squad will catch these people.&rdquo;  Nothing has been done.  We are working under the 1934 Act and section 78 of the 1970 Act.  What is the penalty for a member of an international drug chain who comes into this city?  Where in Europe will they find an easier market with little or no penalty&mdash;six months and/ or £50 unless on indictment they go before a jury in which case they can get a heavier sentence.  Not one case since 1966 has gone before a jury.  It has been said publicly in court by <Col N="1653" /> people who are in on drug charges that they would rather be fined and spend a couple of months in prison here than go to England where they have this type of legislation or go to France and risk 15 years or go to Russia and risk the death penalty or to Japan and risk life imprisonment. Only two countries in the world, Russia and Japan, have got rid of the drug problem.</P>
    <P>What type of provision is there here?  If, on Saturday night, a member of the Garda Síochána suspects that an individual is selling heroin in an establishment in some part of this city, are the officials of the Department of Health aware or is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of what that garda has to do?  He must first of all find a chief superintendent and travel with the chief superintendent to a district court judge and there have a search warrant sworn out which will last for 24 hours.  We have made such a mess that I cannot help suspecting that the Government have become alcoholic in their attitude, that there is total inability to initiate any activity. Sometimes change is for the best.  Not only is change for the best in this particular case but it is demanded by every parent in the country.</P>
    <P>I have seen in the city of Dublin as recently as yesterday a male creature about 28 years of age who was a vegetable as a result of being on drugs. He had no mind of his own.  Is there no one in the Fianna Fáil Party aware that this is going on?  Have Fianna Fáil dissociated themselves from the grass roots so completely that they do not know that there is in fact a problem, relative though it may be, that it exists in the Taoiseach's city of Cork and in many other places?  Do they think that because they have many cumainn and plenty of money they will get back into power?  Surely, there must be a social conscience?  Surely, there must be realisation that the only way to combat the drug problem is by providing adequate deterrent?  Has not that been shown in New York?  Is the Minister not a great reader of medical journals and research papers?  Has it not been shown in New York that the cure rate for heroin addicts is less than <Col N="1654" /> 0.01 per cent over five years?  Has it not been shown in New York that heroin is being sold to children under ten years of age and that parents have discovered their children injecting it into the pulp of the teeth?</P>
    <P>These may be fantastic stories to journalists and others who may not be <i>au fait</i> with the position.  The problem continues, and at the present time in the city of Dublin, where the Drug Squad is mainly centred, composed of nine people and one doctor, there are 176 cases before the courts for illegal possession and/or selling of Chinese heroin.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter in January and again in March and I was told that no such thing existed.  Members of the Drug Squad, concentrated in Dublin as they are, are rendered ineffective because they have to take the drug addict or possessor down to court, put him on remand, prepare the case, go back to court with it.  Time is wasted. The accused is in and out of court on remand.  An effort is made to sell as much as they can while awaiting trial.</P>
    <P>I would not stay in this country if I thought that the present attitude of the authorities would persist.  One reason why many people like to live in Ireland is that they love the country and the people in it and the Christian attitude that has prevailed, but if this hazard of the killer heroin is allowed to continue, there is not any point in staying here.  We have the weakest drug laws in the world and there is no initiative whatsoever.  I did my best.  I am not experienced in drafting legislation. I had assistance and I drew up what was regarded by experts as being more than adequate deterrent legislation. At the same time as the heroin epidemic has hit Dublin it has also hit London.  Liberal intellectuals smoke marijuana claiming that it is not a drug, that it is only as bad as alcohol. Alcohol has wrecked enough homes in this country.  It has driven thousands of people into mental hospitals.  It is the main or a contributory factor in 50 per cent of the fatal accidents on the roads.  Yet the Minister for Health will claim that the effects on the brain of marijuana and alcohol are similar.</P>
    <P>I may be a member of the Pioneer <Col N="1655" /> Association but I did take a drink when I was a student.  To my mind, the hazards associated with drinking while driving and drinking while working near machinery are very grave. What should be said is that marijuana is every bit as dangerous as alcohol. The consumption of alcohol has been legalised.  We realise now that possibly it should never have been legalised. One out of four patients admitted to hospital is admitted because of alcoholism, yet the Minister for Health says that marijuana is only as dangerous as drink.  Good God, I hope I never see the day when one out of four patients are admitted to hospital for smoking marijuana, because even if it is only as dangerous as drink, drink is a hazard.  The American Medical Association reported last year that 10 per cent of chronic marijuana smokers were born mentally defective. If that figure has not been substantiated it certainly has not been contradicted.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a section of the British Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971.  It contains provisions whereby medical practitioners cannot prescribe certain drugs.  Yet in this country we had the unfortunate situation where certain doctors prescribed one or two drugs which possibly, had they been a little <i>au fait</i> or had the Department of Health been a little more aware of the drug problem, might not have happened.</P>
    <P>There is one provision in this Act and it is that any member of the police force can apply off his own bat to a justice of the peace, somewhat the equivalent to our peace commissioners, for a search warrant which remains effective for 24 days.  This is a great improvement on our existing legislation whereby a member of the Drugs Squad has got to go out on a Saturday night, get a chief superintendent and a district justice together and have a search warrant signed.  I will not go further into this except to refer the Minister for Health and the Department to page 639 of the Public General Acts and Measures of 1971, Part I.  In that he will find the legislation he will introduce.  I know it and <Col N="1656" /> I am not boasting or bragging or being complacent about it.  He will just copy it straight out.  What the British do he does.  One would think it is a British Parliament we have here.  Everything they do we get.  They should drop the word &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; altogether.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that Deputies are extremely grateful for the speed with which Professor FitzGerald's Committee brought out their report.  It makes very interesting reading and it is very simple to read with very little medical jargon.  I am severely hampered from further contributing to the debate but I wish to raise two matters arising from this report.  There are a few hospitals with which I have had contact.  One is the Mallow County Hospital which has been mentioned by Deputy R. Barry.  On page 109 of the FitzGerald Report, paragraph 9.43, we find this:</P>
    <P>Mallow County Hospital is a 98-bed hospital in a modern building providing a general medical, surgical and maternity service and staffed at consultant level by one surgeon and one physician.  This hospital is 23 miles from Cork and is serving an area from which access to Cork is easy.  The area north of it, around Rathluirc, is convenient to Limerick.  We recommend that the role of this hospital be changed to that of a Community Health Centre and that its acute hospital functions be transferred to Cork and Limerick Hospital Centres as appropriate.</P>
    <P>On this I want to say that the Fine Gael Party oppose totally this paragraph of the report.  My party have decided that Mallow County Hospital shall retain and improve the medical, surgical, maternity and paediatric services it provided heretofore and that it shall not be downgraded to the status of a community centre.  I think the people of that area are grateful for the work and the research Deputy R. Barry has put into this.  The report on the same page refers to Bantry County Hospital and at paragraph 9.44 it states:</P>
    <P>The position of Bantry County Hospital is not easily resolved.  This <Col N="1657" /> is a 128-bed modern hospital 56 miles from Cork City and serving the relatively isolated area of West Cork some of which may be up to 100 miles from Cork.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, I practised near that area and I had occasion to use the surgical services in Bantry County Hospital, for which I was very grateful at the time.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>The present area served by it has a resident population of the order of 40,000 and is a popular tourist centre during the summer.  To leave it without a hospital would involve hospital patients and their visitors in journeys to and from Cork and it is open to the objection that medical risk might be involved for some emergency cases.  On the other hand it must be accepted that with the proposed reorganisation of the hospital services in a small number of highly developed hospital centres, small isolated hospital units such as that in Bantry, will be limited in the scope and quality of their work and cannot hope to provide a service of the standard available in the major centres.</P>
    <P>Let us take that from a national point of view.  Bantry County Hospital is 100 miles from Cork.  Limerick is 100 miles from Cork.  If a doctor had a patient, let us say, in a village in Dublin, and the nearest specialist hospital was in Limerick he will get an ambulance and send a child with an appendix away down there.  The best he could do it in would be two hours, driving at 50 miles an hour non-stop, which he could not do with a sick person.</P>
    <P>Surely the officials will have to have another look into all this.  To have Bantry County Hospital downgraded to the status of a community health centre just is not on.  For a start, those roads in West Cork, as mentioned in the report, are not adequate. I have travelled over them on many occasions.  They are bumpy, they are twisting and you just could not take a sick person to Cork at great speed for an emergency operation in the type of ambulances we have.  The terrain in the south western part of the country is different <Col N="1658" /> from that in the rest of the country.  This factor should have been taken into account.  It is not possible to use a slide rule in a matter like this.  I am not accusing the Minister of doing this but certain sections may have received more consideration than others.  Bantry Hospital should be retained, extended and sufficient services provided to cope with the requirements of the area.  At the moment a maternity patient in County Kerry who might have complications would have to be sent to Cork for treatment.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the slide rule was used to a considerable extent with regard to the Roscommon County Hospital.  The report of Professor FitzGerald, Senator Alton and others was of considerable importance.  Their terms of reference were: to examine the position in regard to general hospital in-patient and out-patient services in the State and to report in outline on the future organisation, extent and location of these services taking into account the changing pattern of demand, the impact of developing specialisation and the introduction of new techniques so as to secure, with due regard to the national resources, that the public is provided in the most effective way with the best possible services.  This has been accepted in principle but the Minister has backtracked in one or two instances.</P>
    <P>On 30th July, 1970, I raised on the Adjournment the matter of drug abuse. I had been a Member of the House for a year and I thought I should say something about the matter.  Perhaps I have said too much about it since, perhaps it has been wrongly edited and documented; these are the hazards of attempting to effect change.  On 30th July, 1970, at column 2866, Volume 248 the Minister for Health stated:</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne has been doing a beautiful piece of self-advertising by exaggerating wildly the state of drug-taking in this country.  I hope he is pleased with himself for this beautiful piece of self-advertisement.</P>
    <P>At column 2867 of the same volume, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well <Col N="1659" /> that I and the health authorities have taken every possible step to deal with drug addiction here.</P>
    <P>At that time the Minister and the authorities had done nothing.  The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>I have also made it absolutely clear to everybody that I cannot stop drug addiction.  No Minister for Health in any country in the world can stop it.  Let us get rid then of this nonsense of pretending that by making a wordy speech Deputy Byrne can suddenly find a Minister for Health who overnight will eliminate drug abuse.  All we can do is control it as far as lies within our power.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated &ldquo;No Minister for Health in any country in the world can stop it.&rdquo;  The Minister is condemning himself out of his own mouth.  He has shown his inability to initiate any activity in this matter.  From the Official Report I have quoted it can be seen that he has made no effort, that he has refused to make any effort to cope with this problem.  The Minister continually tells us that a Bill is in the final stages of drafting.  I referred earlier to the Bill introduced by Mr. Reginald Maudling&mdash;the position in relation to our country is that the Bill is in the final stages of transcription.</P>
    <P>I condemn the Minister with regard to this matter.  I will table a motion of no confidence in him if this legislation is not brought before the House, as he stated three weeks ago.  The people are fed up with the inactivity and the inaccuracies coming from the Government side of the House through the mouth of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of hospital facilities in the north side of Dublin, the situation is disgraceful.  In July, 1970, I asked the number of children on the waiting list at Baggot Street Hospital to have their tonsils removed; the answer was 50.  The Minister said he was taking active steps, in conjunction with the hospital authorities, to have the waiting list reduced. A month ago I asked a similar question and was told that 458 children were on the waiting list.  There is <Col N="1660" /> one children's hospital on the north side of the city.  There are three on the south side.  There are more people living on the north side than on the south side.</P>
    <P>I have alleged on a number of occasions here that central heating in places where there is no control over it can have an adverse effect on upper respiratory tract diseases.  These diseases include rhinitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, tracheitis and bronchitis.  It has been shown that for office workers who are in their offices for only eight hours each day, five days per week, the incidence of these diseases has increased by 33 per cent.  In Wuttenburg in Germany, where troops of the British Army were housed in high rise flats, it has been found that among those living above the third-storey level the incidence of these particular illnesses has increased by more than 30 per cent in adult male personnel.  These facts have been well documented and reported.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister whether he would set up a committee to investigate the effects of central heating which is compulsory in the high rise flats that have been built in this country.  In the 3,200 units at Ballymun the flat dwellers have no control over the central heating.  The control is in the hands of one person as the boiler house and the temperature is gauged by an outside thermometer.  At St. Michael's Estate there is a similar system.  I shall explain to the Minister how the system works so that he may understand a little better.  There is a boiler house where oil is burned.  This heats the water and the hot water then flows through pipes that are underneath the floors of the dwellings and the only control is at the central point.  This is the situation in Ballymun where almost 30,000 people are housed.  When I worked in that area as a dispensary medical officer I found that the incidence of these illnesses increased phenomenally compared with the incidence of the same illnesses among people living in houses where they had control over their heating systems.</P>
    <P>Recently I did a certain amount of preliminary research into this matter.  I am not qualified to put forward an <Col N="1661" /> elaborate statistical assessment but I have found that two out of every three patients from the Ballymun flats who consult me suffer from respiratory tract infections.  There have been women who have come to me suffering from depression and who told me that they never had ill health before coming to live in the Ballymun flats.  The Minister for Health has told us that the chief medical officer and no evidence to indicate that there was any association between central heating and upper respiratory tract diseases in so far as Ballymun was concerned.  When the Minister's attention was drawn to the report drawn up at Zurich, he, for some inexplicible reason, stated that conditions in Zurich were totally unrelated to conditions at Ballymun.  They were only unrelated in so far as they were much more favourable in Zurich than in Ballymun, because in Zurich there was controlled central heating in flats.  Regarding the report on the BAOR personnel at Wuttenburg the Minister attempts to criticise the report because of some typographical error.  It ill becomes the Minister to adopt such an attitude.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to sanction any application that may come before him from the Medical Research Centre for research concerning the Ballymun flats.  In this respect an invaluable report could be produced and the Minister's Department, I am sure, could obtain the co-operation of the 20 or more doctors who work in the Ballymun area in tabulating these diseases in their own time.  When statistical proof came before the Minister I would expect him to act immediately in requesting the Department of Local Government to have the central heating charge removed in respect of each flat at Ballymun.  It is a ludicrous situation that a tenant of one of these flats must pay £1 a week for central heating and that this heating results in ill health to his family and which, in turn, costs him more money in terms of medical expenses. When a person is taken from a condemned house in the city and given accommodation in Ballymun he is asked to sign an agreement to pay for, among other things, his central heating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was referring to charges imposed by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon.  I misunderstood you.  I was referring to it in passing.  I apologise.  I will make no more reference to the charge.  I will merely say that there is a charge. I have ascertained that the charge for the central heating in Ballymun can be twice the rent in certain cases.  A child breathes at three times the rate of an adult and the children are breathing in dry air in the flats.  When they go out in the open the mucous of the respiratory tract is completely dried up.  The first line of defence against infection is the mucous of the respiratory tract.  This is completely dried up in the child.  The germ multiplies and they have an infection. There is evidence in Ballymun that proprietary antibiotics are no longer effective in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister&mdash;as I know he will&mdash;to accept my word for the fact that central heating of the type provided in Ballymun is contributing to ill-health.  When I asked the Minister about this matter he said that the chief medical officer of the Eastern Health Board had no evidence that there was an increase in respiratory tract diseases in high rise centrally heated local authority dwellings.  I asked him from what possible source could the chief medical officer of the <Col N="1663" /> Eastern Health Board have obtained this information and he admitted there was no such possible source.  Therefore, his reply was misleading to the extent that it indicated that there was no evidence available and therefore the problem did not exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister then changed his attitude slightly and said that, as a person working in that area, if I had any evidence of any association between respiratory tract diseases and central heating I should forward it to the chief medical officer.  I want to tell the Minister that from a random survey of patients recently, I found that as many as two-thirds of my patients from high rise flats suffer from respiratory diseases.  I have compared them with patients from houses, from groundfloor flats and maisonettes and the incidence is not the same.  The Minister would be doing a very good job in the field of social medicine if he would set up a small efficient commission&mdash;and many doctors would work on it voluntarily&mdash;to investigate this matter.  The statistics are readily available since the enactment of the new Health Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not know that in June, July and August the central heating in Ballymun is turned off.  The facts which I have given will eventually be published in one of the medical journals and, given these facts, the Department should consult with the Department of Local Government and the Meteoroligal Office before cutting off the central heating arbitrarily on 1st June.  They should equate the temperature of the atmosphere with what is needed in the high rise flats.  I have gone into flats in Ballymun in June and I have seen people wearing their winter woollies because it was so cold.  The flats are constructed of concrete and there is very little timber in them.  This has been the worst June weather we have had for a long time. The humidity comes out through the walls.  I am giving the Minister some very important information.  I am quite sure no Minister has ever received more important information because 3.200 families are involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> I want to refer now to the dental service.  It is fair to say that as soon as a person opens his mouth you know whether he comes from the North or the South because I have never seen such a bad dental service as we have in the Twenty-six Counties.  There may be improvements coming but they are long overdue.  There is room for a great deal of improvement.  There is room for a speeding up and a streamlining of our dental service.  I put down a question to the Minister regarding the dental clinic in the out-patients department of Temple Street Hospital which is the catchment area for the north side of the city of Dublin. I asked the Minister for an assurance that the clinic would not be closed down.  Deputy Flanagan was Minister at the time and he assured me that he would get in touch with the hospital authorities and the clinic would not be closed down.  A week later it was closed down.  Much to my surprise the Ceann Comhairle disallowed another question and I had to wait for six months.  During the six months many children living in the north side of the city had to do without any dental treatment.  Last week or the week before the Minister, in reply to a question, said that they could travel from areas like Ballymun, Kilbarrack, Donaghmede and Finglas all the way to St. James's Hospital, which would take half the day because of traffic conjestion, get their teeth seen to and travel all the way home again.  Picture the position of a mother having to do this with two or three children.  This is not bringing a service to the people. It is taking a service away from them.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the Minister is very hopeful here and, when he comes to reply, I should like him to give me an assurance that the dental out-patients department in Temple Street Hospital will be re-opened before the end of the summer when the children will be returning to school.  There is no point in pretending dental care is available unless the patients can get the care. Insured persons can get dental treatment because contributors can insist on getting their rights.  There should be a scheme similar to the choice-ofdoctor scheme to enable people to get <Col N="1665" /> dental treatment from private dentists. The incidence of pyrrohea, dental caries, abscesses and so forth is quite high.  I have never seen so many dirty mouths and teeth as I have in the last year.</P>
    <P>A pregnant woman with a medical card is entitled to free dental treatment at the local health centre.  This treatment is limited because she cannot get an anaesthetic while she is pregnant.  She cannot be given codeine tablets.  These are dangerous in the early stages of pregnancy.  There are a few things which can be given in the treatment of a pregnant woman with dental problems.</P>
    <P>With regard to speech therapy I asked the Minister some time ago if he would carry out a survey to find out the number of children needing speech therapy.  He told me a survey had been carried out.  That survey was carried out almost ten years ago. Surely a new survey should be carried out now, a survey to ensure that we plan in advance for the needs of the community.  I am interested in speech therapy.  I was in school with boys who went to the back of the class and became quite withdrawn because they could not express themselves.  They had stammers, cleft palates, hair lips or some other defect; there might have been something wrong with their noses so that they had a twang in their voices and there were certain words they could not pronounce.  As I say, these became withdrawn and never reached the best of their abilities.  The Minister has set up a school of speech therapy in Dublin and the first graduates should be coming out fairly soon. We should know where these are most urgently needed and scholarships should be provided to ensure that these people will give at least two or three years service in those areas in which they can be of most use.</P>
    <P>A survey was carried out in Britain on the educational standards of children from 1950 onwards.  The children were graded into groups.  Personally, I have not much time for this kind of thing, but I suppose it is one way of doing it.  I believe all people are equal. This survey showed there was a high incidence of speech defects in children <Col N="1666" /> from the lower income group.  I take this to mean children whose parents are in receipt of social welfare, unemployment assistance and so forth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter does not really arise.  The report dealt with the progress made by the children and the question of speech was not referred to in particular.  Capacity of expression would be a matter for the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If another Minister is involved, then it is a matter for that other Minister, and I cannot see how it could be argued relevantly on this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I thought the Minister was capable of apprehending my argument.  Where there is inability in expression because of a physical defect, that, in my opinion, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Education has no responsibility for speech therapy. He may provide people to teach elocution, but I am not talking about elocution.  I am talking about trained medical speech therapists and I am saying that there does not appear to be any systematic planned programme in relation to the placing of these speech therapists when they graduate.</P>
      <P>We know there is a shortage but what about long-term planning?  Has the Minister carried out a survey to see whether there is a greater incidence of speech defects in one section of the community than in others? The report produced in Britain, irrelevant as the Minister might think it is, dealt with many other things apart from a child's ability to learn and the educational standard reached at a certain age.  There are certain types of speech therapy and speech ailments which do not recognise race, class or creed.  God knows the Department spend enough money and for the Minister to say here that the bulk of this money goes on wages is not good enough: let us get some research done into the problems of our society. Let us do something realistic, produce figures and plan in advance.  Let us know the number of children who will need specialist help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have we referred at any time to <Col N="1667" /> the report of the American Medical Association indicating the number of children who will be involved in road accidents before reaching the age of 12?  Have we referred to the number of those who will be involved and will suffer brain damage or the number who will be killed?  How many of those who suffer brain damage will have speech defects?  We are going nowhere because we have not adequate provision for institutional care of mentally handicapped children and we have not adequate provision, either made or attempted to be made, for the employment of handicapped children.  How much money have the Department given to the Central Remedial Clinic?  If it were not for people like Deputy Haughey, who is chairman of the fund raising committee, the clinic could be gone out of existence now.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister took over this Department we have had a threatened strike by junior hospital doctors; we have had nurses, with whom I have had the privilege and pleasure of working, parading outside this House with banners in the rain.  There was a threatened strike of dispensary doctors so that they could get a day off in the week.  There was a most unfortunate strike&mdash;that is the only reference I shall make to it&mdash;by psychiatric nurses and then there was a strike by dentists. This country is the only one in the world that has sufficient hospital beds, medical staff, nurses and money to provide an excellent health service.  No other country can boast of surplus doctors, nurses and hospital beds.  We have an extra source of income through the Irish Sweepstakes which costs the Minister or the taxpayers nothing.  Yet, what have we done but cause an escalation in the charges with little or no improvement in the facilities?</P>
    <P>It broke my heart recently to read about the Minister allocating the best part of £500,000 to St. Laurence's Hospital for improvements.  I saw it happen in 1967 and 1968: they put new lino on the floors and so on but apart from the intensive care unit they built, what other facilities have been provided?  Where else is the money <Col N="1668" /> going?  The boiler house at St. Laurence's will not make that much difference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall refer to the allocation of repairs.  If the Minister wants something that is not repetition he can have it.  On page 8 of the statistics circulated for the information of Deputies in connection with the Estimate we have set out: major hospital building projects completed since May, 1971, and, under these Voluntary Hospitals&mdash; additional floors under operating theatres; central laundry; electrical wiring; provision of boiler, <i>et cetera</i>; additional staff accommodation, new nurses homes, residential accommodation to relieve overcrowding, <i>et cetera.</i> Under Health Board Hospitals, we find: mortuary and <i>post mortem</i> theatre; toilet facilities, two houses for medical officers; accommodation for domestics, nurses' flats.  What I am saying is that much money voted here is spent on the provision of facilities which do not directly benefit the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not anti-Catholic or anything like that but in St. Vincent's they are building a new chapel and there is money allocated for that.  I like to see new churches being built but is this the Estimate on which we should be voting money to build a new chapel?

      <P>I was suggesting to the Minister that of the 225 hospitals we have around the country and the 70 odd hospitals we have in the Dublin area it would be far better to concentrate on the building of efficient wellequipped units rather than on trying to justify this massive expenditure as a result of inflation.  You have duplication, not only in the Dublin area; you have increased salary costs because so many staff have to be employed.

      <P>I want to conclude as I am sure Deputy Tunney wants to speak.  The Minister will read what I said about the diconal and the heroin but I should like to mention something about emperin.  There was a scare in <Col N="1672" /> Australia about this.  I think there was only one case reported of any abnormality which occurred in the uterus as a result of this drug during pregnancy. The Minister should have a look at that and assure us that there are no dangerous side effects from this.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the Minister cooperating with the Irish epileptic society in so far as they want to change the name of this disease from epilepsy to syncope in order to remove the old stigma.  At the inaugural meeting of this society it was recommended that the classification of this disease should be so changed.</P>

      <P>I should like to see the Minister giving money towards research into the question of autistic children. Some progress seems to have been made in the USA regarding this.  I should also like to see him starting his campaign in regard to drug abuse, particularly in regard to education in the schools.  I should like to refer him to an excellent booklet entitled Television Report on Drugs, A to Z, Series of Reports prepared by Earl Ubell, science editor, WCBS-TV.</P>
      <P>I have no intention whatsoever of insulting any Deputies in the Minister's party as regards this.  I speak to the Minister when I say&mdash;I think the Minister heard what I said&mdash;that it is not quite correct for him to encourage a misquote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Some schools for deaf children and handicapped children around Dublin could do with support from the Minister from the point of view of the erection of therapeutic accessories.  St. Joseph's School for the Deaf in Cabra do excellent work.  They have got quite a large number of boys in there receiving treatment.  They have, I believe, through their principal, Brother Wall, made application to the Minister for Health for a grant towards a swimming pool which they hope to build.  This is in my constituency.  I know the good work these brothers do, and I should be grateful if the Minister would take note of this application and expedite the provision of the necessary funds.  The history of this institution goes back many years, and the fund raising has been quite successful.  The Minister for Local Government, due to other commitments, has not been able to help them, so I should be grateful if the Minister would do so, as he has done in regard to St. Mary's School for the Deaf in Cabra.</P>
      <P>I should also be grateful if the Minister could help St. John of Gods in Islandbridge.  This is a religious order who look after mentally handicapped children.  They have raised a large sum of money and need a small grant to complete the pool.  The fact that this pool is situated in St. John of God's Institution necessitates a grant from the Department of Health and not the Department of Local Government.  I should be glad if the Minister could tell me whether this money will be forthcoming from the Department or if he would let me know the appropriate authority from which it can be obtained.  Swimming has great therapeutic value, and I would urge the Minister to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I would like to ask the Minister to consider is the erection of a fever hospital on the north side of Dublin where new housing estates are expanding all the time.  Another point &mdash;and I think I asked this yesterday&mdash;<Col N="1674" /> is if he would have another look at certain chronic illnesses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <P>With respect to my colleague, Deputy Dr. Hugh Byrne, perhaps it would be fairer when Deputies are clearly embarking upon marathon speeches to extend to those of us who are seeking to get in on the debate the courtesy of intimating in advance that this is their intention. I sat here for some two-and-a-half hours last night in anticipation of participating in this Health debate and again this morning since the House assembled at half past ten.  Had I any idea that the speech of my predecessor was going to last so long I would at least have taken the precaution of having some refreshment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the grandiose schemes which we hear about from the Minister and the Department of Health, the proposals for improvement, the voluminous documentation which is disseminated and the advice we receive from the various consultants in the matter, it seems to me that there has been as yet no significant change in our health services especially in so far as the mass of our people are concerned. There is no evidence of the implementation of comprehensive coverage for our people and there exists widespread bewilderment, anxiety and indeed hardship in respect of entitlement to various health services.  All the talk we have heard and all the documentation we have read has merely led to greater confusion in the minds of the people.  As far as the majority of our people are concerned the poor law system still exists and there has been no radical change. The system is still riddled with class distinction of various kinds.  There are still too many grades of medicine and too many classes.  This is evident from the retention of the odious means test which still applies to applicants for medical cards.  Nothing positive has <Col N="1676" /> been done to provide a single comprehensive scheme.  Indeed, the Minister's new proposal has added to the numbers and categories to which I refer.</P>
    <P>We have in the lower income group bracket the medical card holders. Then there are the social welfare contributors, who are obliged by law to pay 50p per week for a social welfare stamp for certain coverage under the health services.  There is a further category&mdash;perhaps they might be termed the self-employed&mdash;who are obliged to pay £7 a year for certain of the health services.  Then we have the voluntary health contributors and the higher income group.  It is unfortunate that when we were recasting the health services we did not seek to bring about a merger of the various categories.  There was certainly scope for including all the contributory classes, all those who are insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  All those people should have been granted free medical services.  The medical card holders, normally working-class people, are in fact social welfare contributors as well.  It is difficult to understand why in this instance we retained the old, odious means test for medical cards and brought in a new category of social welfare contributors when the medical card holders are social welfare contributors as well.</P>
    <P>As continued evidence of class distinction in respect of the various grades of medicine and the entitlement of the various classes we have a continuation of different types of accommodation in our hospitals.  We have public wards, semi-private wards and private wards.  With the various distinctions that are made we cannot blame people too much for thinking that there are different grades of service and that there is better treatment for the rich than for the poor in our system.  It is difficult to convince the holder of a medical card that he or she receives similar treatment to the man of money or the person in the public ward of a hospital that he or she receives the same treatment as those in the private wards.</P>
    <P>While we welcome certain new features of the health services, such as <Col N="1677" /> the abolition of the dispensary system and the granting of the choice of doctor, many of the reforms which we have repeatedly called for from these benches have not as yet been implemented. From my experience as a public representative I think it is as difficult as ever to secure a medical card.  We must still contend with the odious means test and the income limit which has been fixed by the various health authorities for the granting of medical cards is utterly ridiculous.  We were led to believe by the then Minister for Health, the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley, that there would be a liberalisation of the means test for medical cards and that only the income of the breadwinner would be taken into account, that the income of other earners in the household would be disregarded.  I am satisfied that the old poor law system still applies, that there is still a notional figure in the minds of the CEOs of our health boards, in the nature say of £15 per week for a man and wife, if a medical card is to be granted.  A figure in excess of that is likely to mean that one does not secure a card.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that allowances are granted in respect of the children in the family, the rent of the house may be taken into account and other factors such as the health condition of the family and the urgent need for a particular service, but the yardstick, the income limit which has been fixed by the CEOs, is absurd and bears no relation to the actual minimum wage being paid to the working classes.  I do not know of any working class man, especially a married family man, who is in receipt of a wage as low as £15 per week.  He simply could not survive on such a wage.  Any married man who has less than £20 a week is in serious financial trouble.  He is dragged down to a subsistence level of existence even on £20 a week.  The yardstick which is applied is insulting and must, of necessity, prevent large number of persons from securing medical cards.  It has also meant the withdrawal of cards from persons who had had them.  It is greatly to be deplored that this kind of test should continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> In most instances an income limit of £16 a week for a man and his wife applies.  The income limit applied by CEOs in the case of a single man is £11 a week.  Here again there is a great absurdity.  Is there any man who could work and live on £11 a week? There is no such wage in existence in this country.  It is less than half the normal wage.  There are allowances such as £1 per child in a family and the rent may be taken into account.</P>
    <P>We see evidence here that the means test is being invoked more rigorously than ever before and more and more working class people are being deprived of medical cards.  Medical cards have been withdrawn to a large extent since the establishment of the regional health boards.  I believe that this is the policy of the Minister.  He is on record as saying&mdash;and this, of course, was an intimation to health boards that they should conform to his wishes&mdash;that he did not believe that the new system would mean an increase in the number of medical cards issued.  That statement was taken by CEOs as an intimation to them, implied or explicit, that they should cut back the allocation of medical cards, that there were too many of them in existence for the Minister's liking.  Of course, the only effective method of reducing the number of medical cards is to apply a more rigorous means test.  This is being done.</P>
    <P>It was anticipated that when the new income limit would have been decided&mdash;we deplore that it should be fixed at £15 or £16 for a married person&mdash;it would be known to the public, that there would be uniformity, that there would be a national average, that people would know their entitlement. If that had been the case anxiety and suspicion would have been allayed as to whether there is preferential treatment in the allocation of medical cards.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to indicate when he is replying whether he will insist that the ridiculously low income limit which he has fixed for the purpose of medical cards will be made known in all regions so that people will know exactly where they stand. I sincerely hope that before he considers <Col N="1679" /> making the limits public the Minister will face up to the reality of the situation and accept from us in the Labour benches that the figures of £15 to £16 per week for a man and his wife and £11 for a single person are utterly unrealistic and bear no relation to the cost of living or to the actual average wages paid.  I submit that the figure of £16 a week is lower than the minimum rate prevailing for the worst paid category of workers; it is lower than the rate for an agricultural worker and lower than the rate for a forestry worker or county council worker.  It is lower by far than the average minimum wage paid to an industrial worker.  It is an absurdity, an insult. These yardsticks are retained only for the purpose of deliberately and positively reducing the number of medical cards issued and as a result of this serious hardship accrues.</P>
    <P>The means test involves inroads into the privacy of family life.  It means for the working class the submission of certified wage statements from their employers.  It means the visit by a home assistance officer to the home of the applicant for an on-the-spot inquisition.  While not reflecting on home assistance officers, who merely do their duty, I feel it my duty to say that the mass of the honourable working class people who feel they are entitled to a health service, not as a charity but as of right, deeply resent the intrusion into their family life and private affairs by home assistance officers.</P>
    <P>Again let me say, without reflecting on home assistance officers, that they accept a norm of subsistence level of existence.  Their minds are coloured by the law they have been accustomed to operate, which derives from the old poor law system.  I deplore the continuation of this system which is humiliating, degrading and which is deeply resented.  Insured contributors, whether medical card holders or otherwise, expect a comprehensive health service devoid of any trace of this odious poor law system and are prepared to pay for it by increased contributions in their social insurance stamp.  They already pay 15p per <Col N="1680" /> week in their social welfare stamps for health services.  I believe the mass of our working class people insured under social welfare would be quite willing to contribute a considerably increased amount for the feeling of security and pride they could have in a comprehensive health service which would not have attached to it the insecurity, humiliation and degradation inherent in the present system with its investigations, interrogations and ridiculous income limits.</P>
    <P>The Minister must accept responsibility for the present situation because it is in existence with his approval. We have evidence of his direct interference in the affairs of the health boards.  He has said on a number of occasions that the number of medical cards should not be increased under the new system because the amount spent on medicine would be too great.  We know how officials interpret these suggestions.</P>
    <P>I therefore ask the Minister to scrap the present ridiculous income limits which the various health boards are applying and bring in a reasonable limit through which the mass of our working people can have access to medical cards without going through the ordeals and the humiliations and the official visitations I have mentioned. I would be thinking in terms of a limit of £25 per week as being the amount required in these days to maintain a family, in these times of high prices.  I also suggest there should be more generous childrens allowances so that all working class families would be enabled to avail of the health services many of them so badly needed. We want realistic income limits for a start.  As well, the idea of the limits remaining static and rigid should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>Earlier, the limit was £12 a week. That was maintained for a number of years.  It is now in the region of £16. This should be changed immediately with the advent of the 14th round of wage increases and with prices increasing daily.  In other words, all I am asking is that the Minister should fix realistic income limits and have them flexible so that they would keep pace with the increased cost of living <Col N="1681" /> and with increases in wages awarded to compensate for that.</P>
    <P>We want a clear unambiguous statement in this respect so that doubt will be eliminated from the minds of our people.  At the moment application forms issued by health boards demand particulars of the gross wage with no regard to deductions for income tax, rent and so on.  This is greatly to be deplored.  We require a system under which need shall be the criterion and not means.  We also suggest that the 15p per week contributors under the limited eligibility scheme should be integrated with the other working classes.  I also suggest that the Department issue a booklet, devoid of verbiage, to be quickly distributed throughout the country so that our people will be clear as to their entitlements.</P>
    <P>Still dealing with the application of a means test, I wish to refer to another important category of people, those who are disabled.  Here again we have the application of an archaic means test.  This has meant that many mentally and physically retarded people who have no means of livelihood, no income of their own, have been denied that better sense of security and status which they so urgently require.  I understand that the legislation and the proposals for the health services with regard to this matter indicate that only the income of the applicant may be taken into account.  I presume it will require a ministerial order in order to put this provision into effect.  However, many people who apply for a disabled person's allowance or an infectious diseases allowance are turned down because the income of the family is taken into account.  It is wrong that these unfortunate people should be deprived of a small allowance of their own and I would appeal to the Minister to rectify this matter.</P>
    <P>There are very many disabled and mentally retarded people whose lives have been blighted by the callous approach of the authorities in refusing to grant them an allowance.  Such a refusal is not conducive to recovery to better health.  I believe that under the present legislation the means test <Col N="1682" /> should apply only to the applicant and the chief executive officers should be informed accordingly.  We cannot provide institutional treatment or rehabilitative treatment for all of these people and many of them are a burden on their families.  They are entitled to a sense of status, dignity and independence and should have an allowance of their own.  If it is clear that they have no means of their own they should be entitled to a disabled person's allowance or an infectious diseases allowance, as the case may be.  I would appeal to the Minister to take some action on this matter.</P>
    <P>Since their establishment, the regional health boards have been a disappointment.  It is difficult to point to any significant achievement on their part which was not accomplished by the county councils when they had responsibility for running the health services.  Perhaps it is unfair to be overcritical of the boards because they are in the formative stage and should be allowed to develop, but it must be stated that so far they have been a disappointment.</P>
    <P>There is a sense of aloofness which was not evident when the local authorities had control of the health services.  We miss the close-knit control, the discipline, efficiency and dedication which was evident in the small health authorities.  It may be that with the establishment of local committees and with greater liaison between public representatives at local level and the regional boards that this suspicion will be eliminated.  Therefore, the sooner the local committees are established the better.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that people in these large regions, away from the centre of the regional health boards, feel alienated. Public representatives feel deprived of having an effective say in the important matter of health and in the maintenance of our hospitals and institutions. There is also a sense of resentment that local councillors will not have an effective voice in the disbursement of the rates they are obliged to provide for the operation of the health services.</P>
    <P>Consequently, in many of our local <Col N="1683" /> authorities there is reluctance and hostility on the part of local representatives to strike a rate in respect of the demand for the health services because they will not have any voice in its disbursement. It is considered that the health demand on the rates, which constitutes such a crushing burden, should be the responsibility of the Government.  The sooner the local committees are established and are seen to operate the better.  At this stage there is an unhappy relationship between the counties and the health boards.  It is desirable that we should have liaison, co-operation and consultation so that the services will be as efficient as possible.</P>
    <P>There is the impression that the functions of the regional health boards have been usurped, not so much by the Minister for Health but by the specialists he has called in to advise him on this important matter.  I am referring to McKinsey, FitzGerald, Buchanan and others who are deciding how the health services and other services will be developed, with a complete disregard for the views of the public representatives and the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no evidence that there have been any arms imported from Libya.  I would be inclined to follow up this report but, at the same time, would not accept it as being true.  The same goes for what was reported to be said by the President of Libya.  We have had it monitored but there are certain difficulties in translating from the Arabic and we are waiting to be quite clear as to what was said.  In the meantime we have made clear as possible what are our views on violence in the North of Ireland, that this violence should cease, and that it would be a matter of the gravest concern to the Government if there was any truth in the interpretation of the Libyan President's remarks.  The Ambassador was asked to indicate that, if arms are being supplied, such supplies should cease at once.  He was asked also to ascertain the fullest information about any supplies which might have been sent already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept one interpretation of the President's remarks as being that the President merely put the question to Britain as to how they would react to his supplying arms to Ireland in view of the fact that Britain was supplying arms to enemies in his territory?  Surely the Minister should have been able to obtain a correct interpretation of what was said so that any doubt that exists could be cleared up immediately.</P>

      <P>A firm estimate of the cost of restoration work arising out of the recent incident at the German Embassy has not yet been framed.</P>
      <P>The level of protection to be provided to a diplomatic mission at any particular time is a matter for the Garda Síochána who from time to time review the level and extent of security in the light of all the circumstances.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Garda Síochána have improved substantially the guarding of all embassies, but would the Minister ensure that these decisions to provide adequate protection for embassies are taken irrespective of whether there is a specific request from any foreign concern, having regard to the fact that this country has now become of interest to so many subversive and anarchist organisations throughout the world?

      <P>I accept the obligation. The Deputy will appreciate that in normal times the degree of security <Col N="1690" /> must be a matter of judgment for the Garda Síochána.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that two public statements issued by Bord Fáilte in the past week have given rise to a considerable amount of concern in regard to this whole issue? One statement was contained in the draft plan issued by Bord Fáilte in which they advocated the opening up of a new gateway to Pan American and TWA.  The second was in an interview given by Mr. Joe Malone, the Bord Fáilte manager for North America, to an international travel journal called <i>Travel Weekly</i>, in which he said that the admission of one US carrier to Dublin would greatly benefit the Irish tourist industry.  The Minister will agree that these two statements are in direct conflict with the views consistently held by the chairman of Bord Fáilte and the director-general over the past 12 months on this issue.  Has the Minister any comment to make on those two statements?</P>

We are used to this.  At the same time, when we are negotiating I do not know what influence it has on the home situation, or on those who are negotiating on the other side.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has received a report on the condition of the primary school in Castlebar, County Mayo, which was built eight years ago and at which there is a teachers' strike in progress; if he will list the defects found; and how soon it is expected that all the defects will be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The school in question, which was built in 1963-64, has a septic tank system of sewage disposal while water is obtained from a well on the site which is 42 feet deep. It has been discovered that the water supply is contaminated and investigations which were carried out suggest that the principal, if not the sole cause of the trouble, arises from the fact that the drains were not properly laid by the builder who erected the school.  They were not jointed or bedded as they should have been and as a result the sewage from the school toilets seeped into the soil and affected the water supply.  The drains have been relaid properly but, unfortunately, the contamination of the water supply still persists and may continue for some time.  The water can be used for the flushing of the toilets but not for drinking or washing purposes.  The Commissioners are continuing their investigations into the question of how best the situation might be remedied but, unfortunately, in the circumstances, it is not a simple matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an interim measure, the Commissioners have arranged to have supplies of water for drinking and washing purposes supplied regularly to tanks which have been provided at the school and this arrangement will, I hope, be acceptable to the teachers and parents concerned.  The Commissioners also propose, subject to the concurrence of the local medical officer of health, to have a porcelain candle filter fitted to the supply pipe from the well.  This filter would, I am advised, <Col N="1700" /> be capable of removing all pathogenic organisms from the water.  I appreciate, of course, that there might still be reluctance to use the filtered water for drinking purpose but there should be no hesitation about its use for other purposes.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a new well should be sunk on another part of the school site.  The Commissioners would have this done at once if they could be sure that the supply from that source would not also prove to be affected by the sewage permeation of the soil as the present well is.  The site, I should point out, is restricted in size and it is not possible to say what the sub-surface conditions are.</P>
    <P>Apart from the water supply difficulty, I am advised that conditions at the school are satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I must say that nobody regrets more than the Commissioners and I do that the situation which I have outlined should have arisen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the teachers will return now as a result of what we have done.  The question of a legal remedy against the contractor who built the school was raised and, if we could have legal redress, we certainly would, but I have been advised that such a remedy is not available to us. I understand the contractor is not in the business any more.  May I say I am glad this sort of thing does not happen very often.</P>

      <P>The land in question was acquired from Mr. Patrick Fahy, Bailindooley, County Galway, for the erection of a fishery research station for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The vendor made it a condition of the sale that he would have the right to use the land for grazing until it was required for building operations which at the time of purchase were expected to start within a relatively short period.</P>
      <P>I am not at present in a position to say whether the fisheries research station will be erected on this site or for what other purpose the site may be developed.</P>

      <P>The selection of allottees is a matter that is exclusively reserved to the Commissioners.</P>
      <P>In the present instance I am informed that this small property was divided last March amongst two local smallholders.  The parcel allotted to the person referred to in the question contains 30 acres of rough land, subject to turbary rights, with a rateable valuation of only 25 pence.  Prior to allotment he had had a continuous letting of the parcel of upwards of 20 years.  His existing holding comprised 68 acres, rateable valuation £9.50, which is estimated to be the equivalent of 26 acres of good land.  I should like to add, since Deputy Finn is not here, that the situation involved here concerns my immediate neighbours and my parents' immediate neighbours and friends for a long time.  I should like to reiterate, perhaps, wearily on this occasion, that the function in this matter rests with the Land Commission and not with me and long before I became Minister for Lands I had made representations on behalf of many, if not all, of the neighbours in question to the Land Commission but it is their function and not mine to decide.</P>

They were doing their very best to acquire this land from the owner on a voluntary basis. They had been working out details of a life annuity scheme, and so forth, for a very long time.</P>

I am not putting a tooth in that but that does not mean to say that the Land Commission cannot pursue their interests on behalf of the local congests.  It means that a legal situation was created which causes difficulties for the Land Commission. <Col N="1710" /> They must now try to undo an existing situation before they can create a situation where they can again hopefully, on behalf of the congests, try to take over this land.</P>

      <P>I regard this as a very important matter.  Would the Minister not agree that it would be a very good thing for a child to pursue a course up to the age of 15 years? He has recently raised the minimum age for leaving school to 15 years. Since it should be possible to have the child go through the intermediate course and to sit for the examination would he consider taking steps to formulate such a policy which would be very beneficial to a large number of children in this country?</P>

There are children of 14 years in the intermediate certificate class and by virtue of this rigid rule they will be held back.  This can have a bad psychological effect on children.

      <P>I think we all welcome the Minister's recent decision to raise the school leaving age to 15 and we fully support it.  Would he not agree that relatively few of the children of this country do not, in effect, do the intermediate certificate examination and that those who do not are not able to do so because their parents cannot afford to have them in school? In view of the very few who do not do the examination would the Minister take some action to implement the policy to enable children to do the intermediate examination?  I am not terribly impressed with the rules and regulations of his Department, as he probably knows, but I feel this is an important issue.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 to 50 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four modern European languages included in the post-primary school curriculum &mdash; French, German, Italian and Spanish.  For me to seek to instruct the schools as to the order of preference that might be accorded to these languages or to seek to influence pupils as to the language or languages from this group which they should study would be tantamount to my seeking to exercise an authority which I do not possess.  Furthermore such <Col N="1717" /> action could not be justified on educational grounds.</P>
    <P>I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement showing the number of pupils studying each of these languages during the years 1969-70 and 1970-71.  From these figures it will be seen that there is an increase of 7,695 in 1970-71 as against 1969-70.</P>
    <P>There is continuing development in the facilities for teaching these languages. For example, as an encouragement to the use of up-to-date teaching methods my Department gives grants for the purchase of audiovisual aids for use language classes.  Provision <Col N="1718" /> is also made for language laboratories in the design of many new schools. Summer courses are organised for language teachers and through these courses teachers are trained in the use of the most up-to-date methods, particularly in regard to the teaching of the spoken language.</P>
    <P>During my recent visit to Germany I discussed with a number of persons the teaching of foreign languages generally. The methods employed in the teaching of German in Irish schools were not discussed.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P Just="Center">MODERN LANGUAGES</P>
    <P Just="Center">1.  The number of pupils studying the four modern European languages for the school-years 1970-71 and 1969-70 was:&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 27th April, the future of the pilot area scheme is being considered in the context of the EEC directives on structural reform and the recent report on western agriculture by Dr. Scully of my Department. A farm development scheme to conform with the EEC directives is now being prepared.  It is expected that this scheme, which will be introduced early next year, will replace most of our present measures of assistance for small farmers, including those operated in the pilot areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is likely.  The thing to bear in mind about the pilot area experiment is the very fact that it was an experiment.  The purpose of the experiment was to determine norms which would guide future planning of small farm operations in poor land areas.  A great deal of very valuable information has been accumulated in this regard.  The very fact that the treatment of the pilot areas <Col N="1728" /> was special, in that the farmers in the areas got treatment over and above people in similar areas that were not fortunate enough to be in pilot areas pointed up this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister should consider this matter closely with a view to possibly continuing the pilot area scheme if this can be done.</P>

      <P>The recent reduction in the prices of Irish and other butter on the British market reflect (a) a decline in consumer demand following the very substantial increases in the price of butter on that market during the past year or so, and (b) an increase in the quantity of butter available on the market.  Fluctuations in the price of Irish butter on export markets do not affect the price on the domestic market here, which continues to be subsidised <Col N="1734" /> by the Exchequer to the extent of £176 per ton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no fixed price or uniform scale of prices payable by creameries for milk.  While milk supplied to creameries for manufacturing purposes must be paid for on the basis of its butterfat content, the price per unit of butterfat varies from creamery to creamery.  It is determined by the creameries themselves and depends on a variety of factors such as the operational and marketing efficiency of the individual creameries, the degree to which their production has been diversified, and the non-milk activities carried on by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The Cratloe site for the new milk processing plant, which the Dairy Disposal Company proposes to establish, was selected because of its location in relation to milk supplies from both the Limerick and the Clare areas. I understand that the company considered that any other location would not offer the same advantage.  The new plant will be in addition to the company's existing plant at Lansdowne, which is already handling milk from both of the areas mentioned, and the company aims to have it operational as early as possible in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that no sites were examined other than the Cratloe site?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>All possible reasonable sites were considered on their face value.  It is my opinion that <Col N="1737" /> the best thing to do in this case is to consider the future of both the Lansdowne plant and the supply of milk from the Clare area and certain areas of Limerick together because, if you did not do that, the chances are that you might compromise the Lansdowne creamery operation and jeopardise the jobs of the workers involved there, as well as possibly diminishing the scale of the operation that might be necessary in the future. I think the Limerick-Clare grouping as now envisaged is the best way to cope with the Limerick-Clare situation that the Deputy and I are talking about.  It would be very wasteful, indeed, to adopt measures that might conceivably run down the Lansdowne plant and make less than full use of the plant that is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Clare suppliers were not aware until now that it was intended to have a site which would serve Lansdowne and suppliers in the Limerick area as well as Clare suppliers. Perhaps the Minister is not aware that Clare suppliers on the west coast who supply about 20 million gallons annually considered a more central site would be better for producers on the west coast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate such thinking but I think the Deputy will accept it as a localised approach to the general question of creamery development.  Since it is localised and concentrated exclusively on the interests of Clare alone, in that way it is not an objective view.  In order to get an objective view it is necessary to consider the milk supplies that are available on the other side of the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider it would be an economically sound policy to have costings? Bulk collections or multi-tank collections could come from areas 50 or <Col N="1738" /> 60 miles west of the proposed site and this could be a factor in reducing the price of milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplies of skim milk on offer by dairy farmers generally are much greater this year than in previous years because of the higher prices being paid and the overall expansion in milk production.  To meet the situation the Dairy Disposal Company have announced plans for a new milk powder factory at Cratloe, County Clare to cater for skim milk supplies from the Limerick and Clare areas and it aims to have the factory in operation as early as possible in 1973.  The company's existing milk processing plant at Lansdowne which is already handling milk from both Limerick and Clare will, of course, <Col N="1740" /> continue to utilise as much skim milk from Clare as its capacity will permit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending erection of the proposed factory, would the Minister ask the Dairy Disposal Company to investigate any possible outlets into which the extra skim could be channelled? In anticipation of some kind of diversification, farmers sold their calves and for a year or two they have not been accepting the full supply of skim from the creameries.  Possibly the Listowel plant may be able to accept some supplies.  At the moment several thousand gallons of skim are not being used.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to the Deputy's questions on 25th November, 1971, and 22nd June, 1971, comparison trials with some cattle breeds and breed crosses have been held by the Agricultural Institute and the results showing live weight gain figures have been published in scientific journals and annual reports of the institute.  In the case of the more recently imported breeds, figures based on trials in this country are not available but if trials held in other countries are taken into account, comparative ratings for live weight gain based on the various breed crosses would be estimated as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that salmonellosis in cattle is being recognised more frequently than formerly in this country where it has always been present.  This is no doubt due in large measure to the greatly expanded diagnostic facilities available to herdowners through the recently established regional veterinary laboratories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that as well as detection being increased there is significant evidence that the disease has increased as a result of intensification, and would he not further agree that the attention of food, particularly meat, inspectors in many of the countries we supply is being more and more concentrated on the question of contamination by salmonellosis in meat?

      <P>The first question seems to imply that the garda cannot or do not enter public parks for the purpose of enforcing the criminal law.  This is not correct.  Not only do the ordinary powers of the Garda extend to public parks but, in the case of parks owned by the Dublin Corporation, they are given additional specific powers by the relevant bye-laws made by the corporation in 1966.  Likewise the Garda have specific powers in respect of the Phoenix Park.</P>
      <P>The number of assaults, robberies, <i>et cetera</i>, reported to the Garda as having been committed in public parks in the city from 1st January of this year to 8th June was ten.  Prosecutions have already been brought in respect of eight of the ten.</P>

      <P>The detection rate for indictable crimes is being maintained at about 80 per cent, the highest for any large urban area in the country.</P>
      <P>The number of gardaí in Limerick is higher than ever.  It has been substantially increased in recent years and the total strength is now 175.

      <P>As indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 63 and 64 of 24th February, 1972, the present levels of reconstruction grants payable under the Housing Acts, 1966 to 1970, are under review.  Consideration of the level of assistance available for the improvement of existing houses occupied by elderly persons will be included in that review.  Some elderly persons suffer from physical disabilities and can qualify for the special assistance recently introduced for the adaptation of their houses to suit their needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the extent to which the following recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Care of the Aged have been implemented: (1) the recommendation in paragraph 5.2 that a special survey of the housing needs of the aged be carried out as part of the five-yearly housing assessment; (2) the recommendation in paragraph 5.6 that a percentage of all dwellings provided be reserved for elderly persons; (3) the recommendation in paragraph 5.7 that special sheltered housing be provided for the elderly; and (4) the recommendation in paragraph 5.9 that immediate action be taken by housing authorities to rehouse elderly people in rural areas who are living in dangerously unfit dwellings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A circular letter was issued to housing authorities in May, 1970, conveying the recommendations of the interdepartmental committee on the care of the aged in relation to housing and asking them to study the report <Col N="1777" /> of the committee and to adopt the recommendations as far as practicable.</P>
      <P>As regards the assessment of the housing needs of elderly persons, housing authorities gave special consideration to the requirements of this category of persons in the first general statutory assessment of housing needs carried out under section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966.  The recommendation of the committee for a special survey of the housing needs of elderly persons will be adopted in the next general assessment of housing needs to be carried out by housing authorities.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the committee set out at paragraphs 5.6 and 5.9 of the report have already been adopted to varying degrees by housing authorities.  I have requested the authorities to aim at providing at least 10 per cent of their programme as special housing for elderly persons.  The numbers and types of dwellings to be provided in individual housing schemes are determined locally by the authorities having regard to the particular needs of their areas.  A number of elderly persons are rehoused in the normal way by the letting of dwellings through the operation of approved schemes of letting priorities.  Details of persons so rehoused are not available in my Department. Special schemes designed solely to accommodate elderly persons have been, and are being, provided by housing authorities, particularly by Dublin Corporation.  Over the past five years housing authorities have provided a total of over 1,700 prefabricated, demountable and mobile dwellings.  The bulk of these dwellings have been used to re-house elderly persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the recommendation of the committee in paragraph 5.7 of the report, work has recently started on a pilot project for sheltered housing for elderly persons in Limerick city.  This project, which has been developed with the co-operation of Limerick Corporation, will combine individual residential units with community facilities, and has been designed specially by the National Building Agency and the corporation to tie in with the committee's recommendations.  It is intended as a prototype scheme for <Col N="1778" /> sheltered housing for inspection by housing authorities generally, and it is hoped that as a result, they will be encouraged to provide similar schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that progress is being made particularly in regard to rehousing elderly people in rural areas?  Many of them are living in condemned dwellings and at present they are finding it difficult to get accommodation in the normal schemes which naturally are catering for the young married people with families.  Has he had a report on the number of schemes submitted to him by county councils which have a certain number of houses included in the schemes which are suitable for old couples?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

In that way I am kept informed of the number of dwellings that are included in schemes especially to accommodate elderly persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 134, 135 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>In correspondence which I have had with the Dublin County Council Tenants' Association over the last couple of months I have explained fully the policy governing purchase schemes generally and the reasons why the demands which they make in relation to Dublin County Council's approved scheme cannot be met.  The sale prices of the houses in this scheme are the minimum which could legally be approved having regard to the provisions of section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966, and the regulations made thereunder.  Apart from any other consideration, I have no power to vary the prices in an approved scheme during the period for which the scheme is valid.  Dublin County Council's scheme remains valid until the 23rd March, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> For these reasons, there is no scope for negotiation regarding the terms of Dublin County Council's approved purchase scheme and there would be no point in my meeting the tenant's representatives to discuss it.</P>
    <P>If Dublin County Council wish to continue selling their houses after next March they can only do so under a new scheme in which prices are based on market values then current.  Having regard to present trends in house prices this will almost certainly mean that the prices will be substantially higher than in the present scheme which were assessed two years ago, in June, 1970, and which, having regard to house price trends since, must now represent very good value.  I would, therefore, urge any tenants, who are genuinely interestd in purchasing, to do so without any delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think it in the circumstances a useful exercise by him to meet the representatives of the tenants' association and to explain his point of view to them?  If there is a legal difficulty in effecting a change in the existing scheme why does the Minister not take steps to initiate a change in the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must be aware that this scheme which has been brought into operation recently is most unjust to the tenants who are now on strike as no purchase scheme was available to these tenants from 1936 until 1972?  I would like to state that four times the representatives of the tenants' association requested the Minister to meet them and he has repeatedly refused to do so.  Had he met them they might very well not be on strike today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a very serious situation here all over County Dublin?  In these circumstances where there are so many people involved the Minister should strain a point, meet them and hear what they have to say.  There is no hope of selling a house and I am sure he is interested in selling houses to thtese residents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very keen that local authorities should sell as many houses as possible.  Generally speaking, I think the House and the Deputies present will accept that, as far as meeting deputations is concerned, I am pretty reasonable.  I make a point, as far as I can within reason, of seeing persons and groups of people who ask to see me.  However, on this question of house purchase schemes and the price that local authorities have put on houses, which has been sanctioned by the Department, my experience is that whenever a new purchase scheme is devised there is an immediate attempt on the part of the tenants to have the purchase price reduced.  It would be all very well if there was some way in which that figure could be reduced and attempts to do so had some possibility of success.  In the first year when I came into the Department I met many groups of tenants who had had a purchase scheme drawn up for them by the local authority and who wanted to speak to me about the level of the prices.  I was repeating the same points to all of these deputations and it was a useless exercise, because as the law stands I did not have the authority to change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the purchase scheme as drawn up by the local authorities.  It has to run its full period and, as Deputies have heard, it runs until 1973.  Therefore, I am reluctant to meet groups where there is absolutely no leeway for me.  I know the type of argument and the points that tenant groups make when it is a purchase scheme they want to discuss with the Minister.  I have discussed probably purchase schemes with 16 or 17 different groups over the last 18 months to two years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
