      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of undue delay being experienced by applicants generally for medical cards in the Western Health Board area.  I understand that any delay which may occur in particular cases is usually due to the applicant failing to supply essential information required by the board.</P>
      <P>As regards persons holding medical cards issued by the county council when it was the health authority, the position is that a general review of all existing medical cards was necessary prior to the introduction of the reorganised general medical service.  It was the most thorough undertaken for a number of years and, as a result, a number of persons were found to be no longer within the standards adopted by the board for the issue of medical cards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health why, in cases where a farm is jointly owned by two full-time farmers and the valuation is over £60 but less than £120, the owners must prove, unlike other farmers, that their income is less than £1,600 to qualify under the health contributions scheme; and if he considers this practice to be a discouragement to joint-ownership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the existing provisions for deciding limited eligibility for health services serve materially to discourage joint-ownership of farms.  Nevertheless, whenever consideration is being given to a review of these provisions, I shall bear the Deputy's contention in mind and examine it further.</P>

      <P>The total number of medical practitioners in general practice in this country at present is approximately 1,400.  I regret that I have not separate figures for each of the past three years, but I have no reason to believe that there has been any significant variation in the number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1128" /> for Health if he will take steps to promote the improvement of dental care for the chronically sick, the disabled and the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the limited resources available to them, particularly in dental personnel, health boards are concentrating mainly on the provision of dental services for eligible children.  Consequently, these boards as yet are in a position to provide only a restricted dental service for other eligible persons, including those in the categories referred to by the Deputy.  However, in the operation of this service, health boards are expected to give priority to persons who require dental treatment for urgent medical reasons and there are special arrangements for providing such treatment for the chronic sick, and others with long term ailments, in health board institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total number of health education officers in each of the health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no health education officers as such employed by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very many of the officers employed by health boards are involved in health education in the course of their <Col N="1129" /> normal duties e.g., medical officers, dentists, public health nurses, health inspectors, assistance officers <i>et cetera.</i> Lectures on health subjects are arranged and given for local groups by such officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this particular aspect of health is an important one which warrants the employment of health education officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be an extension of the health education service in general.  As the Deputy knows, the service is extending, particularly through talks on TV and TV spots, lectures by the Irish Heart Foundation and the Cancer Society and propaganda by the Irish Dental Association. When finances can be provided, there will be special health education officers, but I cannot say when that will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the ratio of doctors to population in the choice of doctor scheme; and if he believes that this ratio is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>At 30th September, 1972, the ratio of doctors to eligible persons in the choice of doctor scheme was 1 to 720, approximately.  I consider this ratio to be satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the estimated cost of the choice of doctor scheme for the first full year since its inception; if the cost will exceed the original estimate approved by his Department and, if so, by how much; and if he will indicate the factors which have contributed to any excessive cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the implementation of this scheme was a phased one.  It was introduced <Col N="1130" /> in the Eastern Health Board area on 1st April last and in the rest of the country on 1st October.  Assuming a continuation of the present level of demand on the service and no significant increase in the number of eligible persons, it is estimated that the general medical services will cost £8.5 million in the current financial year. This figure includes the cost of the dispensary service for the areas in which it was in operation up to 30th September and an appropriate amount of the cost of the public health nursing service.  The estimate compares with an estimate of £7.5 million made for the current year in 1971 before the scheme commenced.  Both figures include a provision of £0.5 million for a number of schemes to provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed medicines for persons not in the full eligibility category.</P>
      <P>The main factors contributing to the higher estimate are (a) inflation in the prices of drugs and medicines and (b) excessive demands on the scheme in Dublin.  Inflation accounts for about £½ million in the increase in the estimate. In general, for the area outside that served by the Eastern Health Board, it seems that adjustments in the original estimates for the present year will be those called for only to allow for inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give an estimate of what it would cost in a full year, apart from this year, and can he say was the £7.5 million for this year or was it for a normal year's operations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The £7.5 million was the estimate for this year in which the dispensary system operated in the whole of the country except for the Eastern Health Board area up to September 30th.  It is impossible for me at this moment to anticipate the cost for next year.  As the Deputy knows, we are in touch with the Medical Association, the Medical Union, and the Eastern Health Board, in order to make possible a reduction in the numbers of consultations in the Eastern Health Board area, in which there were nine visits per annum per each eligible person, and 16 items of <Col N="1131" /> prescription per eligible person, compared with 4½ consultations per person per annum in the rest of the country and a prescribing rate of about six prescriptions.  Negotiations are taking place in order to bring down the number of consultations to a reasonable figure without any deterioration in the essential service to be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No estimate of this kind has been made, nor would it seem practical to make one.  I would, however, point out that about 16 per cent of the population are covered by the schemes of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board but that this group accounts for only 10.5 per cent of the bed-days in acute hospitals.  This would seem to indicate that the demands by this group on hospital services are on the whole relatively light.  However, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and my Department will shortly be discussing possible future modifications in the board's schemes.  The point referred to by the Deputy is among the matters which will be discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A major accident plan for Dublin was settled in 1969 in agreement with the hospitals and other organisations concerned.  The purpose of this plan is to co-ordinate and control the facilities available for the definitive treatment of the seriously injured in the event of a major accident involving a large number of serious casualties.</P>
      <P>I take it the Deputy has in mind the response of the Dublin hospitals to the problems of treating the many patients brought to them as a result of the recent bombings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite what the Deputy has stated on radio and what is stated in the editorial in the current issue of <i>The Irish Medical Times</i> of which he is editor, I am satisfied, from comprehensive inquiries which I have made, that the hospital arrangements made for dealing with casualties were excellent and I have great pleasure in availing myself of this opportunity to congratulate all of the staffs concerned and of <Col N="1133" /> thanking them for their magnificent work in treating and comforting the injured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a rehearsal following the O'Connell Bridge House explosion to test the effectiveness of the scheme.  It operated satisfactorily.  The scheme does not ordinarily operate when there are not 25 or more seriously injured persons.  It is a most elaborate scheme.  It would take me at least ten minutes to describe it to the House. It includes the complete co-ordination of the Garda, the fire brigade, the hospital and medical services, and there is a centre at St. James's Hospital to co-ordinate the whole of the action required in connection with this.  There are radio controlled cars moving to the scene of the accident and there is a control centre in Dublin Castle headquarters.  As a result of our recent experience, discussions have already taken place to upgrade the scheme even further so that it will be more efficient.  I can assure the House that the scheme of co-ordination is as good as could possibly be devised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, and as I have explained in the House, there is a complete policy in regard to services for senior citizens, contrary to what was recently stated in an article in the newspapers.  It includes the appointment of a sufficient number of geriatricians for the rehabilitation and assessment of aged people.  The difficulty is that there are not many geriatricians.  They are difficult to find, so we are having discussions as to what the qualifications for the post could be other than those of a person who describes himself as a geriatrician, with the special discipline of the geriatrician.  We are discussing how we can find people to perform these services if actual geriatricians do not present themselves for appointment when vacancies are notified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether consideration has been given to the establishment of a national service in co-operation with local authorities whereby trained social workers would visit old people who are living on their own, maintain contact with them and ensure that their needs in respect of medicine and food are met; and whether consideration has been given to the devising of a State-aided care plan for looking after old people in their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of their normal function, health boards provide a domiciliary medical and nursing service for those, including the aged, who require such services.  A special register of elderly persons is maintained in each area by public health nurses who undertake such visitation as may be required.  Over 700 public health nurses are employed for this and other purposes by area health boards throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In order to promote and expand community services for the aged, a special scheme of grants was initiated in 1968 to enable area health boards to encourage voluntary agencies to accept greater responsibility in this respect.  The amount authorised to be spent by health boards on this service has grown from £50,000 to £300,000 in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assist health boards and voluntary agencies in using these funds to the best advantage three social work advisers have been appointed to my <Col N="1136" /> Department for organisation and liaison purposes.  I am glad to be able to say that there has been a steady growth in the number of social service councils and other voluntary bodies active in this field.  The social service councils are representative of all sections of the community, including officers of health boards, in their areas of operation and they have helped considerably in co-ordinating the social work of voluntary agencies with that of the statutory authorities.</P>
    <P>Central guidance and co-ordination will be provided by the National Social Service Council which I established last year.  Professional social workers are employed by social service councils, by other voluntary agencies and by health boards.  Apart from domiciliary medical and nursing care, the range of services provided for the aged may include chiropody, physiotherapy, laundry, meals-on-wheels, assistance with home decoration and repairs, and the provision of material aids such as bedding, clothing and fuel.</P>
    <P>In addition to the sum of £300,000 provided for the community care service, I have provided £150,000 in the current year for the development of a home help service.  The general scheme is explained in a leaflet prepared in my Department last year.  I circulated copies of that leaflet to Deputies with the documentation in regard to my Estimate earlier this year.  For the Deputy's convenience I am sending him a further copy.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that in my view the responsibility of domiciliary care should rest wherever possible with voluntary organisations assisted in the way I have described above.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Minister says, does it not appear, especially at this time of year, that there are too many deaths of elderly people that are not discovered for a number of days, too many deaths caused, apparently, by lack of facilities for these elderly persons?  Does it not seem there is a lack of co-ordination in the sense that, apart from those voluntary groups, nobody seems to be involved sufficiently in looking after elderly people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy, without specific reference to what he says, that a great deal has to be done to develop voluntary services in co-ordination with the public health service.  A new programme manager for community services has now been appointed to the Eastern Health Board.  There were delays for various reasons that we were unable to overcome; but now that a programme manager has been appointed his duty is to establish in the first instance some pilot areas within the Eastern Health Board area in order to see how best to operate a complete community service.  Community services are still lacking but progress is being made gradually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>On 31st December, 1971, the latest date for which figures are available, 15,961 persons were receiving in-patient treatment in psychiatric hospitals in this country, of whom 14,922 were in public mental hospitals and 1,039 were in private mental hospitals.</P>
      <P>The total represents a proportion of 5.4 per 1,000 of the population. The corresponding figure in 1961 was 7.3 per 1,000.</P>
      <P>I regret that statistics are not yet available regarding the average length of stay of patients, but an analysis of discharges during the year ending 31st December, 1970, showed that 50 per cent of the total number of discharges had required treatment in hospital for a period not exceeding one month; a further 25 per cent had required treatment for a period not exceeding two months; 18 per cent had required treatment for a period exceeding two months and not exceeding 12 months; and 7 per cent had required treatment of more than one year's duration.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question relates to the charges arising out of the capital contribution required by the ESB for extending the electricity supply to the site.</P>
      <P>It has always been the practice of the board to request a contribution towards the cost of such an extension of their supply lines if expected revenue appears inadequate to cover the cost of the extension.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the board that it is not possible to reduce at present the contribution for supply to the development at King's Hill.  It is understood from the board that because of the low density of houses on this site the cost of the network per house is approximately 50 per cent higher than the average cost for housing schemes elsewhere.  According as houses on the site are completed and occupied, and the revenue to the board can be more accurately assessed, refunds against the contribution required can be considered.  The board have so informed Westport UDC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The unrest in Northern Ireland in recent years has made it very difficult to make reliable forecasts of tourism revenue.  As the situation in the North during the next few months will materially affect tourism here in 1973, it is not possible at this stage to give a meaningful forecast of tourism earnings for next year.  I am, however, informed by Bord Failte that the board expect <Col N="1146" /> some increase in tourism revenue in 1973.</P>

      <P>May I remind the Minister of a statement he made the other day to the effect that the whole solution to the problem would be forthcoming in the next couple of months and as a result we need have no fears about the tourist situation in this country?

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently with the best will in the world we are looking forward to the continuation of a loss of revenue in tourism, whether there is an improvement or not.  There may be an improvement over last year but it looks as if the trend will be a downward one.  Has any consideration been given to subsidising the industry which has taken a hard knocking over the past year and more than likely in the coming year will face adverse circumstances once more?

There will be increased funds at the disposal of Bord Fáilte to secure an expansion in the industry next year but fundamentally it is the opinion of everybody involved in the industry with whom I discussed the matter that no real progress will be made unless there is a political settlement and unless there is reconciliation and peace in this island.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Press release issued by the Government Information Bureau on my behalf of the 2nd December, copy of which as been placed in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic purpose of the air agreement is the attainment of parity of operations between the airlines of the two countries on routes between the two countries.  The balance of operations has been substantially in favour <Col N="1149" /> of Aer Lingus and the UK authorities sought consultations in the matter in July last in accordance with the provisions for review in the agreement.</P>
    <P>In the talks which followed in September and December the UK authorities sought to have the balance redressed and, in particular, pressed for the elimination of the fifth freedom services between Manchester and the Continent which they held to be in conflict with the terms of the agreement.  The agreement provides that in the operation of services the primary objective is the provision of capacity adequate to cater for the traffic between the two countries and that in the case of fifth freedom services capacity should be related to (a) traffic requirements to and from this country, (b) the traffic requirements of the area through which the airline passes after taking account of the air services of the airlines of the States comprising the area and (c) the requirements of through airline operations.  The UK authorities pointed to the fact that on many of the routes the Aer Lingus fifth freedom traffic exceeded that carried between Dublin and Manchester or between Dublin and the points served on the Continent and that British and continental airlines are in a position to provide all the capacity required between Manchester and the Continent. It would be uneconomic for Aer Lingus to operate these services at a reduced capacity, even if this course were acceptable to the UK authorities. An understanding was reached on the basis that the present Aer Lingus third and fourth freedom services between the UK and Ireland would continue and that their fifth freedom services at Manchester would be phased out over a period of years ending in 1978.</P>

      <P>External trade returns for the first ten months of the year show a rise in merchandise exports of £85.2 million and a rise in merchandise imports of £45.1 million.  The import excess in this period was therefore £40.1 million lower than in the corresponding period of 1971.</P>
      <P>Our surplus on net invisible receipts is likely to be some millions of pounds less in 1972 than in 1971 as a result of lower tourist receipts, but in the light of the trade returns it is clear that there will be a substantial improvement in 1972 in the balance of payments on current account as a whole.</P>

      <P>Fóir Teoranta does not directly employ staff.  Under a management agreement staff services are provided by the Industrial Credit Company.  Fifteen people are engaged on a full-time basis on the work of Fóir Teoranta and in addition the accountancy and administration services of the ICC are available to the Company.</P>

    <P>The chairman of Fóir Teoranta is in receipt of £750 a year and each of the ordinary directors receives £500 a year. <Col N="1164" /> There are seven directors, including the chairman who is a retired civil servant. Three of the ordinary directors are managing directors of firms in the private sector, one is a chairman of a firm in the private sector, one is a trade union official and one is a rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>As the information requested in Questions Nos. 41, 44 and 45 is in the form of tabular statements, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.  I do not propose to indicate the total equity or total capital of any concern which the Fóir Teoranta investment represents as I consider that this would be an infringement of the concern's right to privacy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.</P>
      <P>The Documents and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Act, 1945, does not apply to a document over 100 years old which is wholly in print.  It was only in the case of a limited number of books with manuscript annotations that the need for export licences arose.  The standing instructions issued to customs staff provide for only a selective examination of books to enforce export controls, and customs officers would have difficulty in coming upon manuscript annotations in a small number of cases from among what is understood to have been many hundreds of volumes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The value-added tax applies to food and other essentials at exactly the same effective rate as that which applied under the former sales taxes and it was, accordingly, estimated that the introduction of the tax would not be a factor in causing the prices of these commodities to rise.</P>
      <P>With regard to certain household goods, constituting a relatively small fraction of household expenditure, it was not possible to align precisely the incidence of the VAT with that of the former taxes.  It was expected that there would be a need for minor price adjustments in such cases which should not, however, affect significantly the level of prices generally.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to assess precisely at this stage the likely overall increase in 1973 in the price of food and household items arising from EEC entry and other factors, including normal market forces.  In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy O'Leary on 14th November in which I agreed with the general tenor of the Economic and Social Research Institute view, published in the Quarterly Economic Commentary for autumn 1972, that food prices seem likely to rise in 1973, although not so rapidly as in 1972.  The rise in nonfood prices has slackened off considerably during this year and it is hoped that this trend will be maintained in 1973.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the rate at which the unearned gains of land speculators are taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear what the Deputy has in mind in referring to the &ldquo;unearned gains&rdquo; of land speculators. If the speculators are engaged in the trade of dealing in or developing land, then the profits of the trade would be regarded as earned income for tax purposes in the same way as the profits from any other trade so carried on.</P>
      <P>It may be that the Deputy is thinking of a person who purchased land, with an eye to the future, and then in a few years' time sells it for an enhanced sum.  In such a case, the profit derived would not be chargeable to tax at all unless there was some indication that the seller was in some way engaged in the business of dealing in land.  Tax is chargeable on the profits or gains arising from the business of dealing in or developing land as follows:</P>
      <P>In the case of an individual:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income tax is charged at the standard <Col N="1172" /> rate of 35 per cent on the profits arising after deducting admissible expenses and the allowances and reliefs to which he is entitled.  In addition to income tax, sur-tax is charged at rates of 15 per cent, 30 per cent and 45 per cent depending upon the level of total income.</P>
    <P>In the case of an incorporated body:</P>
    <P>Income tax is charged at the standard rate of 35 per cent and, in addition corporation profits tax is charged at the rate of 7½ per cent on the first £2,500 of profits, and 23 per cent on the balance.  However, corporation profits tax paid is allowed as a deduction in computing profits for income tax purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Customs control in intra-Community trade is based largely on prescribed documentation prepared by the exporter which is required to be authenticated by the local customs and produced with the goods to the customs in the country of import.  Since last October the Revenue Commissioners, in collaboration with Córas Tráchtála, have been engaged in an extensive information programme designed to bring to the notice of exporters and all other interests concerned the nature of the documentation and the form of customs supervision of their operations required to enable it to be authenticated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme includes a series of meetings of interested parties arranged under the auspices of such bodies as the Confederation of Irish Industries, Chambers of Commerce, shipping companies, forwarding agents and so on.  These meetings are addressed by officers of the Commissioners on the implications in the technical customs field of accession to the Community. Information material is distributed and familiarisation courses are provided for personnel whose function it will be to handle the new documentation.  In <Col N="1173" /> addition, specially trained customs personnel for some time past have been calling upon major exporters, particularly of agricultural produce, with a view to identifying the kinds of problems most likely to arise and determining how best to resolve them.</P>
    <P>The commissioners are producing a series of leaflets bearing on all important aspects of EEC customs requirements. Some of these have already been issued and the balance will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>I cannot say when a drainage scheme for the Bonet catchment, in which the areas in question are situated, can commence.  As I explained to the Dáil on a number of occasions, the question has been raised as to whether the economic and social returns from drainage schemes are sufficient to justify the heavy capital investment necessary for the service.  With a view to reaching a conclusion, a full cost/ benefit study of arterial drainage proposals for selected catchment areas has been put in hand.  This study is making good progress and it is hoped the result will be available next year. In the meantime, consideration of a number of drainage proposals including the Bonet catchment is being suspended.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1972</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 23 November, 1972.</P>
      <P>The object of the draft order is to continue in force the Housing Act, 1969, for two years ending on 31st December, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Housing Act, 1969, is a temporary measure which will expire on the 31st December, 1972, unless continued by an order made by me after it has been approved by resolution by each House of the Oireachtas.  The purpose of the Act is to reduce the loss of habitable houses by providing statutory controls over their demolition or change of use.  This it does by <Col N="1182" /> requiring generally that the permission of the local authority must be obtained for the demolition or change of use of a habitable house.  In dealing with an application for permission the local authority must have regard to the state of repair of the house and the adequacy of the supply of housing available in their area.  The authority can refuse permission or they can give it subject to conditions, either requiring the provision of alternative accommodation or the making of contributions towards the cost of providing it.  Where permission is refused, or granted subject to conditions, there is a right of appeal to the Minister against the decision of the authority.</P>
    <P>The Act came into force in July, 1969, and returns received from local authorities since then indicate that it has been effective in reducing the loss of habitable houses to the housing stock.  In my view, the effectiveness of the Act cannot be judged by these returns alone because its very existence must provide a deterrent against indiscriminate housing losses.  Activity under the Act has, naturally, been greatest in Dublin city and the local authority there have pressed strongly for the continuance in force of the Act.</P>
    <P>While there has been a continuous upward trend in national housing output in recent years, accompanied by a continuing improvement in overall housing conditions, I consider that it is still necessary to retain the controls provided for in the 1969 Act for the further temporary period now proposed. Accordingly, I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> When the Planning and Development Act, 1963 was enacted this party pointed out that a serious deficiency in that Act was the absence of any control over the demolition of dwellings being used for human habitation and the absence of any adequate provisions to control the change of user of such houses from dwellinghouses to offices or other such buildings.  In fact, in the Seanad Senators of this party advocated the amendment of the law so that proper control could be exercised in relation to dwellinghouses <Col N="1183" /> in order to prevent these dwellinghouses being pulled down and families being evicted from them, and to prevent these houses being changed into office blocks or office accommodation or being put to commercial use.</P>
      <P>I think it was as a result of the speeches made by members of this party both in the Houses of the Oireachtas and outside it that at last it was conceded by the Government that there was a deficiency in the Planning and Development Act, 1963, and the Housing Act of 1969, which this order seeks to continue for a further period, was enacted.  We welcome this piece of legislation as filling a serious gap in the Act of 1963.</P>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister for Local Government a few questions in relation to the Act of 1969 which he seeks to continue, and I think this is the appropriate time to do it.  It is necessary, under the provisions of this Act, that, before a person pulls down a dwellinghouse or a building that is being used for human habitation, he should apply to the housing authority, and the housing authority may grant his application or refuse it or grant it with or without conditions.  I should like to ask the Minister how many applications for demolition have been made under the Act of 1969 and how many of these were granted <i>simpliciter,</i> how many were granted subject to conditions, and how many were refused.  In particular, I should like the Minister to tell us if the conditions attached to the permissions granted under this Act were observed in all cases and, if not, whether prosecutions were taken against the people involved or whether the provisions of section 2 were enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the type of activity which this Act was enacted to stop, the penalty set out in the Act, a maximum fine of £100, is inadequate.  Admittedly, there is provision for a six months' sentence and there is provision for a fine of £10 per day for every day on which the offence has been continued, but when I was reading that I wondered did that mean that a person <Col N="1184" /> would be fined £10 a day until he reinstated the house or rebuilt it.</P>
    <P>There is another section which gives the housing authority power to take action if they are satisfied that the owner of a house is deliberately letting it run down so that it will become beyond repair and so that he will then have an opportunity of getting possession of it and turning it into a suite of office blocks or something else.  That is section 5 of the Act with which we are dealing and, in effect, it says that where a housing authority are of the opinion that a person has for the purpose of evading the provisions of the Act caused or permitted a house to deteriorate to the extent that it ceases to be a habitable house the authority, if they think fit, may take certain action.  I would like to ask the Minister if he is in a position to tell us how often this section has been invoked by housing authorities since it was enacted.</P>
    <P>The penalty for failing to comply with a notice under this section is simply a flat fine of £100 without any provision for imprisonment but, again, the housing authority has power to go in and do work and charge the cost to the owner who had violated the section.  These are some of the things concerning the Act with which I would like to deal.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to continue the entire Act with the exception of section 11. Section 11 is a section which made an addition to subsection (7) of section 66 of the Act of 1966.  Section 66 of the 1966 Act, I regret to say, is a very long section but the relevant subsection said that a demolition order made in respect of any works the execution of which is necessary for compliance with the requirements of the order required that the work be carried out in accordance with such conditions.  The Act with which we are dealing now added to that:</P>
    <P>including conditions requiring the taking of such reasonable steps as will ensure that the works either while being carried out or when completed will neither cause injury to any adjoining or adjacent building nor interfere with the stability thereof.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> It is proposed by this order not to continue that section which adds those words to subsection (7) of the Housing Act, 1966 and I would like to ask the Minister why it is not proposed to continue those precautions because it does seem to me reasonable, where a demolition is being carried out, to require that no damage will be done to adjoining buildings.  It may be that the Minister's answer is that there would be common law rights there at any rate but there might be doubt about that since the demolition will be carried out here under a statutory requirement.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I should like to avail of this opportunity to deal with at some length.  As I have said, before a person demolishes a dwellinghouse or a house which is being used for the purpose of a dwelling, he must apply to the housing authority for permission to demolish it.  If any person is dissatisfied or aggrieved either by the granting of the permission by the housing authority or by the refusal of the housing authority to grant the permission or by any conditions attached to it, he has a right to appeal under this Act but the appeal lies to the Minister for Local Government. I want to renew the protest that I have been making over the years in regard to appeals lying to the Minister for Local Government under the Planning and Development Act and under this Act instead of to an independent tribunal such as the Circuit Court or even a less formal tribunal provided it is independent and provided it is set up in a way that will inspire public confidence.  It can be seen clearly from the Act with which we are dealing today that it has within it the power to add enormously to the value of property. For example, take a tenement house or a house that is let in flats to a number of families and the owner gets them out in some way or other because he wants to demolish the house and sell the site for development &mdash;he need not demolish it; he can sell the house for development provided he is in a position to assure the purchaser that he is at liberty to pull it down and put something else in its place.  The power to decide whether or not that can be done lies with the Minister <Col N="1186" /> for Local Government.  I say that that is a power that should not vest in one man.  It is a power which can add enormously to the value of property or can devalue property.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, an influential speculator could buy a house at grossly under value from the owner in the knowledge or hope that he could get permission from the Minister for Local Government on appeal to do the necessary development.</P>
    <P>I say that an amendment in the law in regard to appeals under this Act is long overdue.  As far back as 1969, the very year in which this Housing Act became law, the Fine Gael Party through me as the then spokesman on local government introduced a measure into this House to take planning appeals and, it would follow, appeals under this Act, from the Minister for Local Government and to hand them over to an independent tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how the Deputy can argue this point on the order before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> With the greatest respect, Sir, it is being sought to continue an Act which makes it obligatory on a man who is going to demolish a house to apply to a housing authority for permission to do so and says that if he is dissatisfied with the decision he has a right of appeal and that that appeal lies to the Minister for Local Government. That is what I am objecting to.  I want to develop that argument a little to prove that I have been consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far back as 1969 we advocated that that system should be changed, that it should be handed over to an independent tribunal.  We brought in a Bill which the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Kevin Boland, opposed but on the concluding Stages of that Private Members Bill he assured us that he would introduce a Bill to do substantially what he said should be done.  That Bill was introduced in 1969 and it is still on the Order Paper not having been processed through this House.  I know the Minister has promised that a Bill <Col N="1187" /> will be introduced which will remedy what I am complaining about and I know that the Taoiseach told me several times last year that the Minister for Local Government was working on the Bill.  I would like to see that Bill brought into the House quickly and I would like to see the machinery for appeal under this Act changed because there is grave dissatisfaction in the country about the operation of these appeals.  Let me get away from the big business appeal for one moment and tell the Minister in relation to this machinery which he seeks to retain that I know of a young couple in County Cavan who are applicants for planning permission to build a house.  They were refused once.  They applied again in respect of another site.  Their appeal has been in the Minister's Department for months and months.  I would invite the Minister to look at the file and to see the letters which I sent from this young married woman.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I know, but we are discussing precisely the same sort of machinery.  I invite the Minister to look at the letters from this young married woman, Mrs. O'Donnell from near Bailieborough. County Cavan which I have sent on to him.  They are pathetic.  If the sort of delays that occurred in that case are to continue under the Housing Act, 1969 it is just too bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appeals system under the Act with which we are now dealing is unsatisfactory and it does not command the respect of the people.  It should be scrapped and it should be changed.  I do not want to get personal but the Minister for Local Government is a human being like anybody else.  He is a politician and he is subject to the pressures to which all politicians are subject from people who support them. <Col N="1188" /> That is the main reason why I say that it is not fair or reasonable that a Minister should have, by signing his name, the right to decide whether a dwelling house in the city of Dublin is worth £5,000 or £50,000.  The Minister is human.  He is a politician and he is subject to political pressures as any other Minister or any other Member of this House would be.  As recently as 22nd November the Minister conceded that in his capacity as Deputy Robert Molloy he is expected to make representations because when we were dealing with the County Management Act the Minister stated in reply to Deputy O'Donovan:</P>
    <P>I have no intention of interfering in appointments made by way of the executive function by managers.  I can give that assurance wholeheartedly to the Deputy as Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan said:</P>
    <P>That is all I want.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>That is not to say that as a Deputy I will not continue to make the ordinary representations which every Deputy is asked to make.</P>
    <P>That is all right if Deputy John Geoghegan or Deputy John Donnellan was making representations but here we have the farcical, absurd position where Deputy Robert Molloy, as a Deputy for a Galway constituency, will be making representations to Deputy Robert Molloy, Minister for Local Government, who will be sitting as judge and jury and final appeal tribunal in a matter that can decide that the value of a piece of property in Dublin is £5,000 or £50,000 or £150,000.  That is a responsibility that nobody should be asked to shoulder.  I am not casting, and it is not necessary for the purpose of my case to cast any aspersions on the integrity of the Minister.</P>

The Bill which the Minister's predecessor introduced and did not proceed with is not a completely satisfactory measure because there is a section in it which gives the Minister the right to get his hand back into the <Col N="1190" /> appeal in some way.  That should not be in it.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say about this measure.  We are prepared to continue it at the Minister's request.  In fact, we believe we were instrumental in bringing it in.  We believe that some of the penalties are not adequate.  I believe that the planning machinery in it is faulty in the extreme.  It is wide open to the abuse which political pressure exercises on a Minister who must stand at the next election if he intends to continue in public life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the inadequacy of the penalties, could the Minister say if he has any intention of doing anything about this?  As it stands, the penalties for demolition are so slight that local authorities feel that the power they have is totally inadequate. The Minister must have received representations from local authorities on this matter because a penalty of £100 for demolishing a house is as nothing to the gain to the developer, who having got away with it, is able to build something on the site which is worth much more.  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked a question as to the significance in this context of a continuing penalty. I understand from local authorities that it is of no significance and that the effective weapon they have is a <Col N="1191" /> £100 fine.  This is clearly completely inadequate.  Will the Minister not recognise this fact and the need urgently to deal with this problem because while he speaks about his order having some effect in reducing the loss of habitable houses to the housing stock, he did use the word &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; and not &ldquo;eliminate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If the order were effective, the penalties effective, the Minister would be able to say that this order had been effective in eliminating the loss of habitable houses but the fact is that it is not.  It may have reduced it somewhat and there are some reputable developers who would not wish to undertake an action contrary to the law, who although they could well afford the £100&mdash;it would mean nothing to them in relation to the value of what they would get&mdash; would not engage in that kind of activity.  I am quite sure that the order has had some effect where they are concerned, but there are many people who are not reputable and, in my constituency, we have had the demolition of a number of houses without permission, in respect of which the action taken by the local authority is quite inadequate and can only be inadequate because of the total inadequacy of the penalties provided. What does the Minister propose to do about this?</P>
      <P>I notice that he referred to the upward trend in national housing output; in recent years accompanied by a continuing improvement in overall housing conditions and I would like the Minister to indicate what he means by that. Of course, there is an upward trend in housing development.  After many years of pressure from these benches, the Minister has been operating policies which have had the incidental effect of increasing the amount of private housing but in the area where the Minister is directly responsible, local authority housing, where he has a much more direct responsibility, the increase is negligible, far below the increase in private housing and there is in fact no improvement in overall housing conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people who can afford houses <Col N="1192" /> can borrow money now more readily from building societies if they can afford to do so and build houses for themselves, but for those who cannot afford housing, the conditions are worse and not better.  The Minister knows that, in the city of Dublin, whereas when this Dáil was elected, a couple though they could not then or for a very long time before that get a local authority dwelling, when they got married and had got to the point of having a child, whatever overcrowded or insanitary conditions they had been forced into by inadequate Government housing policy, they had some prospect of getting a dwelling, which would have been a flat in Ballymun at that time which would normally be of high level and imposing a hardship on people with children, but from the beginning of 1970&mdash;I have not got the exact date&mdash;not long after I was elected, I found the position which I still find that no family in the ordinary way will get local authority accommodation until they have two children. That is not an improvement.  It is a deterioration and the Minister should accept that fact and face it.</P>
    <P>The increase in private dwellings is not improving that position at all and I would ask the Minister to indicate what he means when he speaks about an improvement in overall housing conditions when there has been a deterioration to the absolutely unacceptable situation in which when people get married and are not in a position to afford the purchase of a dwelling, with the level of deposits and repayments they have no possibility of getting accommodation until they have two children and should they be unable to have two children, it is the case with some couples, they will remain apparently for the rest of their lives living with in-laws or in whatever substandard expensive exploitatory private accommodation they can get hold of. That is a situation we cannot accept and I do not think that a measure of this kind which does not eliminate but merely reduces the loss of habitable houses is having the necessary effect.</P>
    <P>I therefore, ask him to tell us what action he proposes to take to make this order effective where it is now ineffective <Col N="1193" /> for all but the more scrupulous developers and to explain his curious reference to the improvement in overall housing conditions when so far as the city of Dublin is concerned, and it represents a very large part of the country, conditions remain extremely bad and there is no visible prospect of any improvement because the Minister is continuing his refusal to permit an increase in local authority housing which stands today at the level of no more than 60 per cent of what it stood at 22 years ago when the country was much less well off than it is today.</P>

      <P>The Minister in seeking the authority of the House to continue in force the Housing Act of 1969 really made a very poor case for it. His statement gave one the impression that it was something which somebody had wakened up to at the eleventh hour, felt that this was running out and something would have to be done to keep it in force.  The main portion of the Minister's statement was taken up in telling us what the Act was all about and those of us who have been in the House for some time have a fair idea of what the 1969 Act was about and a fair idea also of the defects and deficiencies in it.  It is surprising that the Minister would not avail himself of the opportunity to correct that situation and not only to correct the defects in the 1969 Act which was really bringing in something to prop up or do something about the deficiencies that existed in the 1963 Act.  One would imagine that what he would do is to bring in amending legislation to correct all the defects and deficiencies in the whole of the 1963 Act.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to deal with the 1963 Act.  I am merely regretting the fact that when the Minister was coming to the House, he did not come in for something worthwhile. The Minister talks loosely about the fact that the purpose of this legislation is to reduce the loss of habitable houses and is not in a position to tell us what the history of this has been since it was introduced.  As has been asked <Col N="1194" /> already, in how many cases was this effective?  The Minister goes on to say that this is not the full proof, even if he had the total number of cases where the 1969 Act operated to prevent the loss of habitable houses; but we have no figures and no case is made here for the retention of this, even though we all know it is necessary, that more effective legislation is necessary, for the preservation of habitable housing.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether or not the 1969 Act has any application whatever to local authorities, whether they are bound in any way by it.  Local authorities can be quite ruthless in their own demolition process in that people who have lived their lives in certain areas to a ripe old age can be very badly treated because the corporation and the local authorities concerned do not seem to be bound by anything contained in this legislation.  If that is so, it is quite wrong that we should enact legislation which binds the ordinary developer, builder or owner of property but does not bind the local authorities concerned.  I should like to hear the Minister's comment on this because I have known of a number of cases where people were ruthlessly treated by the local authorities and it appears they had no defence.  Some of them were housed in a new district and had to pay much more for their houses.  The new accommodation might be better but it was not their homes in the same sense as were the more humble dwellings in which they had lived previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was right to deal with this whole question of the appeals mechanism and legislation which we have at the moment.  It is one of the many defects in the 1963 Act which was incorporated in the 1969 Act and which the Minister now proposes to continue.  There has been widespread criticism of this kind of legislation where the Minister is judge and jury, where he can make and break people, and where the political pressures to which Deputy Fitzpatrick referred operate and have been known to operate.  I cannot understand why the Minister wishes to retain this power for himself because the workload <Col N="1195" /> involved must be enormous.

      <P>I want to make it clear I am completely in favour of the continuation of any legislation that will preserve habitable houses and that will ensure people are not thrown out without adequate accommodation being provided for them elsewhere.  By this I mean they should not be moved to a completely new area because that is not proper alternative accommodation.  I do not think builders or developers should be allowed to move people ten or 20 miles for what they call the interests of good development.  I do not think human beings should be treated in that way and developers should not be given power to do this.  The purpose of legislation is to ensure that people who are helpless are protected and assisted.  My only regret is that the order was not stronger and more effective.</P>

      <P>The Minister's declaration that there will be changes and that legislation on the appeals machinery in the 1963 Act is pending is rather like St. Augustine's prayer: &ldquo;Lord, make me pure but not yet&rdquo;. The Minister has said that the parliamentary draftsman is dealing with this matter and that eventually the Minister will not have any influence in the decision making.  We can suspend our judgment on that until the Bill comes before the House.  It is simply stating facts to say that the most powerful lobby having the ear of this Government is the building speculator lobby, a lobby that will be of immense importance to the Government in any election.  Obviously, it is open to misconstruction when the Minister has the final say in decisions which may in some instances mean that millions of pounds are made in profits.  At least we have the Minister's word that this is to be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This order does not appear to have been satisfactory in preventing the demolition of habitable houses, in this city.  The Minister made the point that it has been some kind of deterrent, that more habitable houses would have been knocked were it not for this order. That may be, but we cannot say it has been satisfactory in eliminating the problem.  It is stated that the local authority must have regard to the state of repair of the house and the adequacy of the supply of housing available in their area.  With regard to the second point regarding the supply of housing, no habitable house in Dublin should have been knocked down in the past five years because there has been a shortage in the supply in the Dublin area.  In addition, there is the situation where there is business development on the site of a former habitable house, a site which would be of immense value if a supermarket or an office block were erected on it.  In such cases the speculator has no hesitation in assisting the buildings on the site to fall into disrepair.  Who is to know, when the speculator applies to the local authority for permission to demolish, whether, in fact, the disrepair was induced or whether it was due to age?  We all know cases where lead was removed from roofs.  We all <Col N="1198" /> know of cases in which the demolition squad arrived in the dark of night to demolish a particular building.  What machinery is available for the purpose of discovering whether disrepair of partial demolition has been due to the process of time or whether it has been aided by some human agency?  This Order does not prevent the demolition of perfectly sound houses suitable for habitation in the city of Dublin.  In cases in which the authority gives permission subject to certain conditions, such as the provision of alternative suitable accommodation or a contribution towards the cost of such accommodation, the situation has been most unsatisfactory.  We all know of cases in which rent controlled dwellings have passed into the hands of people anxious only to demolish and erect in their place supermarkets or office blocks; in such cases the tenants have not been given satisfactory compensation by any means.  Where accommodation is offered it is never equal to the accommodation the tenants lost.</P>
    <P>This order is too weak to withstand the ravages of the speculator prepared to invest a large amount of capital, There is no proper balance as between his interests and the interests of the tenants.  Certainly there is no protection for the homeless under this order. As I say, it is most unsatisfactory.  It provides no proper control, no effective antidote to the glaring weaknesses in the original Act of 1963.  Where demolition is concerned there is certainly no assurance that the situation in Dublin will be any better in the future.  The housing situation for those under £2,000 a year, and that includes the great majority, is becoming worse.  I say this in reference to the Minister's declaration that an upward trend in housing output continues.  Parents with one child here in this city face a bleak prospect indeed.</P>
    <P>The penalties provided under this order are not sufficiently strong.  It is a pity the Minister did not consider an upward trend in the penalties provided for demolition without permission.  It is a little odd that no such increase was sought.  Amending the provision would not have caused the draftsmen any great difficulty and it could have made <Col N="1199" /> the order efficacious.  We all know that for the past five years in Dublin many habitable houses have been demolished. The local authorities are in a rather passive role in all this.  There seems to be no provision for active surveillance by local authorities.  There is, of course, a shortage of staff.  Indeed, in Dublin, we are still without a city architect and we have no elected council.  Perhaps one should not then wonder at the situation which obtains, a situation in which housing continues to get worse.  Young married people are forced to live with their in-laws and, when they are living with their in-laws, no matter how overcrowded they may be, overcrowding does not enter into the calculations because of the ridiculous points system adopted.  There are situations in which there are ten or 12 people in two or three rooms but, because the young married people are living with in-laws, the question of overcrowding does not arise.  The local authority has worked to the best possible advantage with the resources available.  What is really wrong is the paucity of financial assistance for national housing.</P>

      <P>We can talk of the ineffectiveness of this order in preventing the demolition of habitable houses. Demolition has not been prevented in Dublin.  The order does not protect the community against the speculator, the speculator who appears to have the ear of the Government.  This order will run for two years, unfortunately, or I should say, perhaps, until the next general election.  There is no protection for the tenant in low rent accommodation, no protection for those in need of housing.  The Minister says it is his intention to remove the final appeal from himself to an independent body, but there is no evidence of this change of heart in this draft order; it continues something which has proved ineffective in practice and gives no guarantee of improving a situation during the period in which the draft order will operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>He also suggested that speculators deliberately, or in some cunning way, demolish empty houses. The point is that, once local authority houses become vacant, the corporation must rush out and board up the windows to prevent demolition by vandals.  This point has not been highlighted sufficiently.  I have seen local authority houses which were almost wrecked by vandals who had no thought for the people waiting for housing.  Unless the windows are boarded up immediately they smash them, and wreck the inside of the houses.  While I condemn the speculators, I do not think they enter into this picture half as much as the vandals who wreck houses belonging to local authorities, or to the people, if you like.</P>
      <P>I can find no words strong enough to condemn people who destroy flats and houses, and not only put extra costs on the city, but deprive many families of housing which they are urgently awaiting.  They could be and would be given those houses were it not for the wanton acts of the vandals who damage them.  As far as I remember, in the 1969 Act there is provision whereby a local authority can carry out repairs to a private house which is in danger of becoming unhabitable and send the bill to the owner of the house.  I do not know of one case in which this has happened. I suspect that there may be some weakness in the law in that respect. The Minister might have a look at that aspect of housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, who is the ultimate authority on planning permission, could tie in two things.  At present the Planning Act states that the mere granting of permission for development does not automatically ensure the right to demolish the house.  There is a time gap here.  Some builders <Col N="1201" /> apply for planning approval to develop an area and, having got it, they assume that they have the right to demolish existing buildings, which they have not got.  The Minister might look at these two Acts and ensure that there is no time lag between them.  It should be impressed on a developer that the fact that he has got planning permission to redevelop an area does not give him the right to demolish existing houses.  I would go so far as to say that, once they had got planning permission, some people acted in ignorance and knocked down houses. These are very important points.</P>
    <P>If a house is too old or too big and a developer wants to demolish it and build flats, he is refused planning application.  He then lets the house stand there and the vandals or the elements destroy it eventually.  In the end the local authority decide to knock it down and get rid of it because it is only the shell of a building. The point I am trying to make is that there is a connection between the Planning Act and the 1969 Housing Act.  If a house has been allowed deliberately to fall into disrepair the local authority should apply the powers they are given under the Act to carry out repairs to the house and send the bill to the owner.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can think of any way to stop vandals wrecking existing buildings in Dublin, including local authority flats and dwellings, we will be able to save dozens of houses and flats per year.  Perhaps he could find some way of having families moved into vacant houses immediately so that they will not be left empty for some weeks.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the House for agreeing to the continuation of the 1969 Act and I should like so far as possible to reply to some of the points made.  Deputy Fitzpatrick inquired how the Act had operated and how many times it had been used. I should like to put on record some of the information I have available to me with regard to the occasions on which applications were made to local authorities under this Act.  In the <Col N="1202" /> period from 15th July, 1969, to 31st March, 1971, 312 applications were received by local authorities.  Out of that number, 66 were granted without conditions, 195 were granted with conditions, and 51 were refused.</P>

      <P>These are the figures for all the local authorities but, as I said the Act has been used primarily in the Dublin area.  It was mostly in the Dublin Corporation area that the need for the Act originally existed and where there was the problem of habitable houses being demolished.</P>
      <P>I have some figures for Dublin city and I can give them to the Deputy. There were 367 applications received by the corporation from 15th July, 1969, to 31st March, 1972.  Out of that number, 256 were granted and 112 were refused.  A further 86 applications. I understand, are awaiting determination at the moment.  As a matter of further interest, up to 20th November of this year 134 appeals were received in my Department against decisions of the various housing authorities but primarily of the Dublin Corporation.  Of these eight were not received within the statutory period, 18 were withdrawn, 54 were determined and 44 are under consideration at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that exact information.  I just have the number I determined.  Deputy O'Leary and the last speaker seemed to ignore the fact that the local authorities can grant permission for demolition and that they have the power to put in conditions. If the Deputy noticed houses being demolished which in his opinion were habitable, they may have been, there may have been conditions attached to the permission which those persons got to demolish those houses. The conditions could be of such a nature as to ensure that there was not <Col N="1203" /> an overall loss in the housing stock.  A developer could be required to pay a sum of money or to provide alternative accommodation.  There are various ways in which this can be dealt with and still allow the dwelling to be demolished where he wants to develop. A condition can be made to ensure that there is not an overall drop in the total number of houses.</P>
      <P>On the question of an owner allowing his house to fall into disrepair, it is clearly laid down in the Act that where a housing authority are of the opinion that a person has deliberately allowed a house to fall into disrepair in order to evade the control that exists under the Act such a local authority may serve re-instatement requiring him, regardless of the condition of the house, to carry out such works as may be necessary so as to make the house fit for human habitation.  That was covered adequately in the Act.</P>
      <P>I would like to put on record that the Dublin city manager has expressed satisfaction at the nature and efficacy of the legal powers contained in the Act.  He being the one who has to deal primarily with this problem, that is strong evidence that the Act is a satisfactory weapon to the local authorities to deal with the problem.  Of course, he did make a plea for a further two years' extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of appeals was raised also but some of the discussion was rather irrelevant.  Under the 1963 Act the Minister can determine the outcome of appeals.  That is a right that I would be very pleased to shed as quickly as possible.  It has never been easy for me to have to perform this function which, under the law, I am obliged to perform.  As I have indicated on a number of occasions both inside the House and outside it, I am in the process of drawing up a new Bill to replace a previous appeals Bill which my predecessor introduced.  I indicated that I was proposing a system of dealing with appeals that will be much stronger than that in the Bill proposed by my predecessor and which would be totally different from what is in operation at present under the 1963 Act.  I do not think it fair to ask me to go any further on that because <Col N="1204" /> we would then be going into detail on a Bill that has not yet been introduced.  However, some Opposition spokesmen chose to dwell on the particular difficulty which arises from the 1963 Act and obviously there were moves to make some political capital out of it.  Because of that, perhaps I would be forgiven for making some reference to it here.  As I indicated by way of interjection, the Bill as I intend it to be, is with the draftsmen at present so that they can put into legal form my own and the Government's intentions in this matter.  The Bill will be brought before the Dáil as soon as it is practicable to do so and that should not be very long.  I am anxious to have it published and introduced as soon as possible.  We may have to wait to have it debated but I am anxious to have the provisions published.</P>
    <P>Some speakers tried to draw an analogy between the appeals provisions of the 1963 Act and the appeals provisions under the Bill we are discussing. I would like to point out that there is a distinct difference between the type of appeals that are dealt with under both of these provisions.  Under the 1963 Act the appeals must be determined with reference to every aspect of the planning and development of a planning district but the 1969 Act raises issues that are positive and which are not of amenity or other abstract nature such as are contained in appeals dealt with under the 1963 Act. The 1969 Act deals with rather limited matters such as the state of repair of a house and the adequacy of a supply of houses in an area.  I do not agree that those criteria give scope for the abuses that Deputy Fitzpatrick alleged take place in his few words here.  However, I would not rule out completely the idea of delegating appeals under the 1969 Act to some form of tribunal which may be set up under the Planning Bill which I propose to introduce here so that there would be some new form of appeals system.  It is worth pointing out that there is a difference between the types of appeals dealt with under both Acts.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily: As I have pointed out, under the 1963 Act one would be dealing with such an aspect as interference with the amenity of an area while under the 1969 Act the issues are positive and direct, for instance, the condition of a house or whether there is a lack of housing to meet the needs in a particular area. These are the types of matters which normally have been dealt with by the Minister on appeal.</P>

      <P>There are a number of appeals made to the Minister under various Acts.  I would not agree that the Minister should divest himself completely of all the powers and authority vested in him down through the years by way of various Acts passed in this Parliament.  If he were to do so he would become an ineffective and useless figure and I do not think he could then call himself properly the head of this Department.  I do not think Deputy Fitzpatrick is serious in suggesting that this be done in such a wide-sweeping way.</P>

      <P>A point raised by Deputy Clinton was that the local authorities should be bound by the controls under the Acts.  We must give credit to local authorities for behaving in a mature and rational manner.  Regarding the criticism that Deputy <Col N="1206" /> Clinton made in regard to the Minister being the judge and jury in dealing with appeals, I would like to ask him what would be the position if a local council were to sit in judgment on what they proposed.  The position would be so farcical as not to warrant further attention by me.  Therefore, the Deputy's suggestion was rather ridiculous.  Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to section 11 of the 1969 Act being excluded in this order.  That is a technicality because in section 13 (3) of that Act it is provided that section 11 shall not be temporary.  That is the only permanent provision in the 1969 Act.  I wish to deal now with what was said by Deputy FitzGerald during his very brief intervention.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald made wide-sweeping statements which are not borne out by the facts.  I propose to put some of the facts on the record to point out to him where he is wrong and where, on this occasion, he has not studied his figures properly. However, I will say at the outset that he is only repeating something I have been saying publicly on a number of occasions during the past year and that is that there is a special urgency in regard to the provision of accommodation for small families in the Dublin area in particular.  I have striven to try to meet that demand and have had several discussions initiated between the Dublin Corporation and officials of my Department in an effort to find a solution to this problem.  I have mentioned in the past that I hope to provide small dwellings, even of a temporary nature, to meet the very urgent needs of people in this situation and who, if the present system of allocation of dwellings continues, can be left on the housing list for many years.  Work has been done in that direction, the extent of which I am not yet in a position to illustrate and I hope that much more work can be done to meet this need.  Much preparatory work has been done in sifting the various proposals, in seeking <Col N="1207" /> suitable sites and dwellings and in seeking manufacturers or contractors who can provide the dwellings.  The Dublin Corporation authorities have been very helpful in this work.</P>
      <P>I will admit that we have not made the progress in this particular aspect of housing that I would like to have seen made up to this time.  Quite a lot has been done and the results will bear fruit in the not too distant future.  Even to go further, within the past week I have, by way of a circular to the various local authorities, instructed them to provide at least 10 per cent of their housing output as special dwellings suitable for small families who otherwise would not have the prospect of being rehoused.  There is an expression of my intent in this matter and I will continue to work on that and try to meet the very great and urgent need of those who find themselves with small families or no families at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald made sweeping statements about there not being any improvement in the overall housing position.  He went so far as to say that local authority housing had not shown any real improvement at all.  I could not agree less with him in this particular matter because over the last decade we have witnessed a constant rise in the output of new houses, virtually without interruption.  We had a cement strike in one year which affected the figures slightly.  The continuous rise in housing output has been greater in the last ten years than in any previous ten-year period in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>In the early 1960s following the economic depression of the 1950s, to which Deputy FitzGerald's own party largely contributed, fewer than 6,000 houses per year were being built.  I should like him to contrast that with the position in 1971-72 when we had just under 16,000 dwellings completed. Between 1st April, 1960, and 31st March, 1972, 127,000 new houses were built and about 110,000 houses were reconstructed with the aid of grants and 85,000 houses were improved by the addition of water and/or sewerage with the aid of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period between April, 1960, and March, 1972, almost £500 million <Col N="1208" /> was spent on building, reconstructing and improving houses.  A further £122 million has been spent on subsidising them.  Of this total of almost £622 million spent the Government and local authorities between them have provided £386 million.  The effect of programmes and expenditure of this sort has been, first of all, to reduce overcrowding.  The Deputy says there has not been any improvement in the overall housing position.  I want to contradict that statement.  If you go back to 1946 at that time 24.9 per cent of the population was living at a density of two or more persons per room.  In 1966 this figure had fallen to 16.8 per cent and it is still declining. The room occupancy rate was 1.01 persons per room in 1946.  By 1966 the figure had fallen to .89.  If anybody wants to know what the position was in Dublin I can tell them there was an improvement similar to the national figures I have quoted.</P>
    <P>The standard of the houses has improved greatly.  A substantially higher percentage of houses now have piped water and sewerage.  The proportion of new houses in the stock is also substantially higher than it was in 1946.  In other words, the quality of the housing stock as a whole is higher than it has ever been.  When referring to those figures, Deputy FitzGerald omitted to state the amount of money that is being spent on reconstructing houses where you bring about a substantial improvement in the housing stock by way of maintaining it and improving it.  The Government have invested quite substantial sums and housing is a No. 1 priority with this Government.  The record in housing is there in the statistics.  It is a record of very great success and it is something that this Government can be very proud of.</P>
    <P>The progress in this field is continuing. In the current financial year some £105 million alone will be spent on building, reconstructing and improving houses out of a total building programme of just under £275 million.  A further £19 million will be spent in subsidising them.  Expenditure on house-building is more than seven times what it was in 1960-61.  The subsidies <Col N="1209" /> the State are providing are about three times greater than the 1960-61 level.</P>
    <P>The number of dwellings to be completed this year will be an all time record.  We had a record last year in nearly reaching 16,000 and I am happy to tell the House that last year's record figure will be well exceeded in the present year and may reach as high a figure as 18,000.  That is as accurate an estimate as I can make at this time.  It shows that the policies that this Government are operating in the housing field are bearing results by way of more homes and dwellings which are so badly needed by the community.  The demand from the community for new homes is accelerating at a tremendous pace.</P>
    <P>All I can say in relation to the figures I have quoted and our attitude to housing is that we are determined to press ahead so far as available resources allow with this expanding housing programme.  As the House knows, the White Paper on Housing in the Seventies, which was published in 1969, laid down objectives in the Government's policy for housing and set targets for the mid-1970s of between 15,000 and 17,000 houses.  Here we are in 1972 and we have exceeded the upper limit in the targets set for 1975, so I think we can be very proud of what we have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick reminds me of the point that was also made by Deputy FitzGerald.  He tried to imply that, although there was an obvious increase in housing, it was all achieved by the private sector.  He forgets, of course, that the State policy, as operated through the various aids and grants it uses to promote development in the private sector, which can benefit a house purchaser by up to as much as £1,000, has contributed to the substantial increase in the building of private homes.  At the same time, because there has been a tremendous increase in the number of private homes constructed in recent years, one <Col N="1210" /> should not read that figure and then say that the increase is only in private housing.  This certainly is not the position. An increase in housing has come about in the private sector but also to a very substantial degree in the local authority sector where the record of new houses being constructed, new dwellings being erected and completed each year has shown a remarkable improvement.</P>
      <P>In 1961 1,463 local authority houses were completed; in 1965, 2,307; in 1971, 3,875 and last year 5,106 were completed.  That is some record of achievement in local authority housing and it is utterly dishonest of Opposition spokesmen to try to create the impression that the increase in housing is all taking place in the private sector.  It certainly is not.  It is taking place in every sector in the housing industry.  There has been a tremendous increase in housing.</P>

These houses have been erected fairly quickly and are good value all around, and the tenants benefit substantially from this.</P>
      <P>I thank the House for the brief discussion on the 1969 Act.  I trust that the House will accept this extension of it.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( )  Before appointing a rate collector under this section a county <Col N="1211" /> manager shall set up a board consisting of at least three persons not below the rank of county secretary, none of whom shall be an official of the county in which the appointment is to be made, to recommend a suitable candidate and the county manager shall appoint the person so recommended.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When this Bill was introduced it was welcomed in principle by the Fine Gael Party because it seeks to remove from the political arena, on the face of it at any rate, the appointment of rate collectors.  The appointment of rate collectors has been treated in a rather unique manner over the years.  On the coming into operation of the County Management Act, 1940, it was the one post that was reserved to county councils for appointment by them.  Rate collectors serving county councils continued to be appointed by a vote of the county councils.  That was not the case in regard to urban rate collectors or rate collectors serving corporations.  The appointment of practically every other officer was made an executive function and taken from the county councils and handed to the county managers.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to make the appointment of a rate collector under a county council an executive function, but it simply stops there.  On the Second Reading of the Bill I did my best to persuade the Minister to hand the appointment over to the Local Appointments Commission under the 1926 Act.  I made it perfectly clear that provision could be made to retain the local nature of the appointment.  A local residence qualification could be prescribed.  There is ample machinery in the Act of 1926 for prescribing a local residence qualification.  I adopted that attitude on the Second Reading of the Bill because I wanted to make sure that the appointment of a rate collector would be removed from the political arena, and be seen to be removed from it.</P>
    <P>I know that many county managers pay no attention, good, bad or indifferent, to representations whether they come from Ministers, Deputies or anybody else, but there have been cases in the past in which county managers <Col N="1212" /> have yielded to political pressure in the making of appointments.  I regret to say that I know instances of where that was done in the past.  It was for that reason I wanted to hand over this important and well-remunerated appointment to the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>I had another reason for doing that. There are a number of ways of appointing officers to local authorities.  The Local Appointments Commission have operated well since 1926.  There was the system of appointing rate collectors which has now been abolished&mdash;that is, by majority decisions of the council. There is also the system of appointing officers under Article 26 of the Local Government (Officers) Regulations, 1943.  That article envisages an advertisement being published, applications being received and a person being appointed from among those who duly applied in accordance with the terms of the advertisement.  It foresees a competitive examination.  For some reason or other a rate collector&mdash;whether he was to be appointed by the county manager to serve an urban authority or a corporation or to be appointed by the county council&mdash;was to be appointed in some different way.  The manner in which a rate collector for an urban authority is appointed at the present time, and the manner in which he will be appointed if we pass this Bill without amendment, is gloriously vague.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (g) of Article 26 says:</P>
    <P>If the local authority in relation to a vacant office by order (or, where the office is that of rate collector to a county council, by resolution) decide that having regard to the nature of the duties of that office, the knowledge and experience necessary for the efficient performance of those duties, and the qualifications for that office the person to be appointed to that office cannot be satisfactorily selected by competitive examination and that such person is to be selected by some other specified procedure, such person may be selected by such other procedure.</P>
    <P>The thinking in the Department of Local Government is that he should be appointed in some other way.  It <Col N="1213" /> is admitted by the Minister that his case for altering the present system is based on the knowledge that in the past the appointment of rate collectors has been the subject of political pressure, that it was carried out on a political basis.</P>
    <P>I told the Minister on the last occasion that there was one occasion in County Cavan when five rate collectors were appointed on the casting vote of the Fianna Fáil chairman of the county council in some cases and by a majority of one in other cases, all on the same day.  We should get away from that system of appointing rate collectors and we should be seen to get away from it.</P>
    <P>In the Bill as it stands, I put it to the Minister, and I should be glad to hear him on this, that there is no procedure prescribed, that it is open to the manager to do it by competitive examination, to set up a board of some sort, though I am not clear whether there is any obligation on him to do so.  It is open to the manager simply to make the appointment himself.</P>
    <P>Members of county councils have been open to heavy canvassing in the past.  It has been acknowledged and admitted that the position of rate collector was a reward for political services rendered.  I think it is only right to say, however, that notwithstanding the system of making appointments, by and large the men appointed discharged their duties and in very few cases did they succumb to the temptation to misappropriate funds.  That has been a striking feature of the system we are now abolishing.  Perhaps it is due to the fact that the political parties making appointments in public would not appoint a man whom they could not stand over.  Undoubtedly, however, those men were appointed for political reasons and it is a credit both to the political parties and to the men appointed that the number of such appointees who broke faith, who misappropriated funds, were very few and far between.  However, we want to get away from the political aspect of this. That is what this Bill is about.  As I have said, the Minister knows that members of county councils were subject to heavy canvassing by candidates <Col N="1214" /> who had to canvass at least 20 members, maybe 25 and perhaps even as high as 40.</P>

Seeing that this has been tainted with political pressure in the past, the people will not believe it will be above politics.  How could they?

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I will read it again to get it into the proper context.  During the debate on the Second Stage on 22nd November, 1972, the following occurred:</P>
      <P>Dr. O'Donovan: I asked the Minister for an assurance that under no circumstances would he interfere with this system.</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: I have no intention of interfering in appointments made by way of the executive function by managers.  I can give that assurance wholeheartedly to the Deputy as Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>Dr. O'Donovan: That is all I want.</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: That is not to say that as a Deputy I will not continue to make the ordinary representations which every Deputy is asked to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context in which that is stated it can mean only one thing, that if the Minister is asked to make representations about the appointment of a rate <Col N="1215" /> collector he will continue to do so.  To whom will a Minister make the representations? He will make them to a county manager who, if he is to make a good job of his county, will have to rely on the good offices of the Minister for Local Government to sanction this and to sanction that, to allocate a grant for this and a grant for that, to speed up this and to speed up that.  That is an undesirable state of affairs.  We are getting out of the frying pan into the fire.</P>
    <P>That is why I am sorry the Minister has not accepted my suggestion that this should be handed over to the Local Appointments Commission.  I know there was fear among local officials that that in some way or other might prejudice them locally.  I do not agree with that.  Even where the Local Appointments Commission come into operation the manager still has power, with the approval of the Minister for Local Government, to promote within the service.</P>
    <P>I failed in my effort on the last occasion to get the Minister to accept the Local Appointments Commission. As I see it, we are making a vague enactment, deciding that this is to be an executive function without prescribing anything else.  We are consolidating the accepted practice in the past that this was an appointment in some way different to all other appointments. In some literature on the subject, it has been accepted in the Department of Local Government that this is a job which may not be filled properly by a competitive examination or interview.  I should like to know how it is to be filled and I suggest that the Minister accepts this amendment, which is:</P>
    <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( )  Before appointing a rate collector under this section a county manager shall set up a Board consisting of at least three persons not below the rank of county secretary, none of whom shall be an official of the county in which the appointment is to be made, to recommend a suitable candidate and the county manager <Col N="1216" /> shall appoint the person so recommended.</P>
    <P>I put that amendment down in the hope that the Minister would accept it. I believe if it is accepted it will go a long way to putting this important job, which carries a salary of up to £2,000 a year, perhaps more in some counties, above the pressure of politics, and, in the context which we now know, above ministerial pressure.  I believe this would improve the Bill and that managers would be glad to be rid of the task of carrying out these appointments on their own.  I believe they would be pressurised by every county councillor in the county, by Deputies <i>simpliciter</i> and by Deputies who also happened to be Ministers.  That is a task I am sure no county manager wants.  He wants a good rate collector who will carry out the job well and he does not mind how he gets him, but he does not want his time taken up by this sort of pressure and representations. I should be glad if the Minister would avail of this opportunity, if he does not intend to accept this amendment, to tell us how the appointment should be made and under what regulation, circular or instruction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make a Second Reading speech on this, in view of the short time left for business. What Deputy Fitzpatrick has said makes a lot of sense.  I do not know whether the Minister was a member of a county council or not but if he was he would know that, while Deputy Fitzpatrick has simplified the matter very much and said that all the appointments were political, in fact all the appointments were not political.  Maybe we are unique in Meath but we did appoint a number of people where we had half the Fianna Fáil Party, half the Fine Gael Party and half of our party voting one way and the other half voting the other way.  This happened on a number of occasions.  Granted they were usually football stars or somebody like that, but these people were appointed.  On occasion we did divide politically, and we make no apology for doing that, provided the candidate is up to the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> As I said on the Second Reading, we are glad that the authority to appoint rate collectors is being taken from the elected members of the county councils.  However, I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that it does seem a little odd that we should take this power from the county councillors and give it to the county manager who must, of necessity, be subject to pressure not only from those same county councillors but also from TDs who are not county councillors and from TDs who are Ministers.  If we do that we are making a bad situation worse. I would like to see these men being appointed purely on merit.</P>
    <P>It has been said that, with a few exceptions, the rate collectors appointed under the old system turn out to be very good at their job.  We are all glad of that.  They are not so good at compiling a register of electors. Most of them seem to have a very short memory when they come to add to or subtract from the register of electors.  That is only by the way.  Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this question of giving the county manager the right to appoint a rate collector himself. That is, in effect, what he is doing. Perhaps I have had more contact than most Deputies with county council staff throughout the country and for that reason I know that promotions made are usually very fair, but in this case the county manager is not being asked to promote people from the staff but to select somebody from outside the local government service completely, somebody who will be able to earn, in less time than it takes a Member of this House, more than a Member of this House gets.  It amuses me to find some rate collectors standing for this House.  I do not know why they do so, because most of them earn more outside the House than they could inside and they have a lot more free time.</P>
    <P>If the county manager is given this right he will be under pressure from all sides, and the Minister should spare him this embarrassment.  The history of rate collectors being appointed by the county councillors dates back to the time when Fianna Fáil controlled <Col N="1218" /> nearly every county in Ireland, and it was all right then.  The winds of change have changed things quite a lot, and possibly the Minister will say: &ldquo;If that is so, surely the weight should be on the county manager from the other side.&rdquo;  I do not know, but I think the Minister would be very well advised to have another look at this.  I am not saying he should do exactly as we suggest in the amendment, but he should consider if there is some way in which he could take the power of appointment completely away from local officials.</P>
    <P>One other matter is the appointment of somebody from a particular county. The danger of giving this power to the Local Appointments Commission is that it would be thrown open to the whole country and there would be a certain amount of resentment if an outsider went into the area and started to collect rates.  That would create a rather awkward situation I do not know the solution to it, but I suggest that the one the Minister is putting up here is not the ideal one.</P>

      <P>I put this point to the Minister on the Second Stage of the Bill and I got an assurance from him, by way of interjection, that a county manager would be entitled to have rates collected through the office.  In Cork, which is the largest council in the country, we have a very efficient rate collection system through the office.  As members of the local authority there, we have taken a decision that where a vacancy arises the collection will be done through the office.</P>
      <P>Managers will not be anxious to operate this Bill because of the pressure that will be brought to bear on them. I want to ask the Minister whether in any other county where a manager decides to opt for the office collection, he is entitled to do it.  I would like to get that reassurance from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he is.  I told the Deputy that on the last occasion, but if he was not too clear about it I would like to reassure him.  If a vacancy occurs in the office of rate collector the manager then has the opportunity to review the whole position and he can <Col N="1219" /> decide to adopt the office method of collection if he so wishes.  I stated on the Second Stage that I did not want to lay down a specific instruction that rate collecting should be done by way of office collection or that it should be done by way of the ordinary rate collector method which is employed generally in county council areas.  I am leaving it to the discretion of the local authority.</P>
      <P>When a vacancy arises the manager will have discretion to continue with the previous system or to decide to have the collection carried out in future through the office system and probably appoint somebody from within his own staff to do the collection.  In a number of local authority areas, persons of the rank of staff officer and such grades are, in fact, collecting the warrants from more than one area.  In a number of cases several districts are collected by the one officer working from an office in the local authority area, so there is no difficulty whatsoever in that regard.</P>
      <P>In regard to this amendment put down by Deputy Fitzpatrick, I should like to assure him that I accept the spirit in which he has put down the amendment.  It is laudable.  His motives in putting down the amendment are beyond dispute and I do not intend disputing them with him.  What we are both seeking to do is to create a system which would be impartial in the appointment of rate collectors.  We both agree on that.  The difficulty I have in regard to the amendment he has put down is, among other things, that in practice it would create a number of difficulties.  I will mention some of these.  Also, it would introduce a third method of making appointments to local authorities.  We have the county manager exercising his executive functions, which is one way.  We have the Local Appointments Commission, another way.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, in his amendment, is proposing a third way. I do not agree that a separate system should be set up for the appointment of rate collectors.  I do not see the necessity for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather surprised that it took <Col N="1220" /> a debate on this subject to bring out all the criticism about managers being subject to pressures and that they were persons who would give way to pressures of the kind the Deputy mentioned.  Those of us who work with local authorities, whether we are members of local authorities or not&mdash; I happen to have been a member for two or three years&mdash;know well the calibre of the men operating as county or city managers throughout the country. They are men of integrity and have been performing a very valuable service to the community.  I have never heard their integrity questioned on any occasion before this Bill was introduced.  One cannot believe the statements which have been made here.  There has been no evidence at all that managers are the type of persons who give in to pressures. Whatever purpose Deputy Fitzpatrick had in continuing to make that point I do not know but it goes against all the evidence in the field of local authority administration.</P>
    <P>I accept that what we are all seeking is an impartial system.  That is what I am seeking.  The argument was used that Fianna Fáil, at one time had control of all the local authorities but did not now have that control and therefore, were taking the power of appointing rate collectors away from the councils.  That argument is a lot of rubbish.  First of all, Fianna Fáil never had control of all the councils.</P>

      <P>If the position is as the Deputies say it is now, whatever great significance there is in that, remember the local elections were held in 1967.  It is not last week that they were held.  If this had been the purpose and the reasoning behind the Bill we would have introduced it long ago.  We do not think like that.  That is not the reason why the Bill was introduced. This is just another false argument that I thought it well to refute.  I do not accept it.  It is a slight to my own integrity to question the motives I had in bringing forward the Bill.  I explained my motives on the previous Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> The system proposed in this amendment does present difficulties and it is no harm to put them on record.  On Second Stage I referred to the desirability of having a person collecting rates who has some local knowledge. The Deputies who spoke accepted that it is desirable that rate collectors should have local knowledge.  If you are looking for someone with local knowledge there must be some form of local competition to appoint him. If the amendment were accepted there would not be even a local official on the interview board.  You would be obliged to have three strangers to the area and the future employer would not be represented on the interview board.  That would be a rather extraordinary situation.  I do not accept that this would be the ideal method to replace the existing system of appointing rate collectors.  It is obvious that a senior, sensible, member of the local authority staff should sit on the interview board.  I do not think that in their hearts the Deputies opposite would object to that.  That is the system that has been in operation in regard to the appointment boards that managers have established in exercising their executive functions in regard to the filling of other vacancies, which I listed on Second Stage, and which has never been queried.  The integrity of that system or of the managers or of the personnel of the interview boards has never been questioned. There is no information in the Department that would indicate that there have ever been complaints about that method of appointment.</P>
    <P>The amendment says &ldquo;the county manager shall appoint the person so recommended&rdquo;.  That is an extraordinary recommendation and is a complete change from the existing practice.  It would place obvious difficulties in the way of a manager if he were obliged to accept the person nominated by the board.</P>

      <P>The Local Appointments Commission have a completely <Col N="1222" /> different machinery.  They deal with a large number of applications.  They have a backlog of vacancies to fill. I am not too keen on adding the appointment of rate collectors to that backlog.  It is difficult enough to get quick decisions from the Local Appointments Commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not finished. If you want to set up this elaborate type of machinery, you have the Local Appointments Commission which, as I explained, have only been used for the more senior posts in the local authorities.  If you want to include rate collectors, why not all the other 20 or 30 different offices that become vacant from time to time and process them through the Local Appointments Commission?  I do not think the local councillors or the community believe that there is a need for all this precaution that Deputy Fitzpatrick is seeking.</P>
      <P>Once a board make a recommendation after having interviewed or examined applicants, under the existing system and under the system that I am proposing, the manager still has to get satisfactory evidence as to the health of the person being recommended and also has to make discreet inquiries as to character in order to ensure that he is not appointing as a rate collector a person who has a criminal record or some blot on his character which would be an obstacle to his appointment to a position of such responsibility which involves handling funds.  Under the amendment proposed by Deputy Fitzpatrick the manager would not have the opportunity of doing that unless the three people were asked to undertake this work.  There might be 27 applicants for one vacancy.  It is ludicrous to imagine that they should have to go through all that procedure for one appointment.  I am surprised at its being recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> The manager, being chief executive of the local authority, should have the final responsibility in the appointment of whoever the local board recommend to him.  I have explained that he must check on health and character.  Subject to this the manager is in practice, obliged to appoint the person recommended.  That is what has been happening and there are no complaints that managers are not accepting the names recommended by the interview boards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  I recognise the need for greater clarification of the type of interview board and the regulations that govern them.  I propose introducing new regulations because up to now the law has been somewhat loose but I believe necessarily so in view of the existing system of appointment of rate collectors, the system we are abolishing under this Bill.  To give an idea of the looseness and vagueness of the present system I would like to quote from article 26 of the Local Government (Officers) Regulations, 1943, which formally enjoins that appointment be made by competitive examination but paragraph (g) of that article goes on to say:</P>
      <P>If the local authority in relation to a vacant office by order (or, where the office is that of rate collector to a county council, by resolution) decide that having regard to the nature of the duties of that office, the knowledge and experience necessary for the efficient performance of those duties, and the qualifications for that office the person to be appointed to that office cannot be satisfactorily selected by competitive examination and that such person is to be selected by some other specified procedure, such person may be selected by such other procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there is a need to tighten this up and I propose to make new regulations which are at present being prepared.  The regulations I propose will unambiguously require that except in case of internal promotion all <Col N="1224" /> appointments must be made by open competition.  To give effect to this detailed rules will be laid down as to the type of competition and the manner of carrying it out for the various grades of office.</P>
    <P>In the case of rate collectors there will be a requirement that the competition take the form of a competitive interview supplemented in appropriate cases by qualifying written tests.  Detailed rules will be laid down regarding the composition and procedure of interview boards to ensure impartiality. That is going as far as I can go in trying to meet what Deputy Fitzpatrick and I are seeking, a completely impartial system of appointment.  Once we tidy up the regulations governing the method of interview a local officer with two outsiders that the Deputy mentioned can sit on the interview board.  They make their recommendation, the manager checks out the medical and character references of the person they propose and the manager then proceeds to appoint that person. I think that is a watertight system.  One cannot find perfection in anything in this life.  We can only strive to do this as well as we can.  I am fully satisfied that this method will prove to be successful.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that if all my thinking is wrong in this and if all the views I hold now are wrong and it is found to be open to the terrible pressures the Deputy has been referring to, it is still open to the Minister for Local Government of the time to transfer the appointments to the Local Appointments Commission if he sees that that is necessary.  I do not think it is necessary.  I do not think we should do it at this time.  It is an option that still remains if this system does not work.  I have no reason to doubt that this system will not work and I recommend it to the House.  I am sorry I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am glad my amendment has established that the Bill as it stands, without any regulations, would leave the appointment to be made in a manner that is much too vague for an important <Col N="1225" /> appointment like this.  I had read article 26 of the Local Government (Officers) Regulations, 1943, which the Minister read, into the record of the House earlier.  It is clear from that, that the position of rate collector was an appointment apart, to be made in a way that nobody could decide.  That was one of the reasons why I put down the amendment.  We had a case in Cavan some years ago where out of a number of applicants one refused to sit for the elementary examination that was prescribed.  Yet he was the man that was appointed.  We had something similar in Donegal recently but I think it is fair to say that the Minister did not appoint the gentleman who refused to sit for the examination.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to my fear that some county managers might be subject to pressure.  I repeat that I believe the vast majority of county managers are above pressure but I repeat, and everybody knows, that in the past some county managers have given into pressure coming from a certain quarter.  This debate established one thing&mdash;that the Minister for Local Government still reserves to himself the right to write to a county manager and say: &ldquo;So-and-so is well qualified for the job.  I would be glad if you would appoint him.&rdquo;  That is all right coming from a Member of the House who does not happen to be the boss of the county manager in question.</P>

It was put down to establish our thinking in principle. I am glad to say that while the Minister has not accepted the amendment as I have spelt it out he has said now, I think for the first time, that he will bring in regulations.  There is not a word in the Bill about regulations but the Minister has now said he will bring in regulations to spell out for the county managers how rate collectors are to be appointed.  I do not wish to obstruct the passing of this Bill but I think the Minister should move a short amendment to the Bill in the Seanad saying that the appointment shall be made in accordance with regulations to be drawn up by the Minister for Local Government. I do not think that would be a bit hard.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have been doing a bit of research and while I find mention of a board I cannot see any provision in any of the regulations for the establishment of a board or making a board obligatory. We now have it from the Minister that he is going to draw up regulations and that under these regulations the manager will be required to set up a board and that probably two of the people will be from outside <Col N="1227" /> the county.  I concede that there is merit in having one from the county who would have local knowledge.  I would not quarrel with that.  We now have it from the Minister that he is going to establish such a board and that he is going to prescribe an interview and also a minimum educational qualification.  That is an improvement. I think it should be written into the Bill.  In view of the fact that I did my utmost on Second Stage to have this handed over to the Local Appointments Commission with certain safeguards to preserve local knowledge and local residence and in view of the fact that the Minister is yielding on this or to use another phrase, is giving an assurance that he proposes to draft regulations which will prescribe an interview board, I do not propose to press the amendment.</P>

      <Col N="1228" /> In subsection (1), page 2, line 18, to delete &ldquo;paragraph 1&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;paragraphs 1, 2 and 2A&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to remind the Minister that this is designed to include in the pay-related benefit scheme agricultural workers, both male and female. The Minister mentioned on Second Stage that there was some difficulty in regard to the assessment in his Department of this category of workers and he said it would be necessary to instal some kind of computer equipment in order to deal with them.  I cannot see the problem here; I think it is not a big problem to include them in this Bill particularly when it is right to say that male agricultural workers are decreasing year after year in numbers.  There is also the problem that where they are decreasing in numbers, they are likely to look for other employment and the difficulty for them will be one of getting employment.  In relation to female agricultural workers, the Minister will readily agree that the number would not be great and particularly for those people who are losing employment, it would be some consolation, once they qualified for unemployment benefit, that the amount they would receive would be near enough to that which they had when in employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and I think there is a very good reason for it, which has not been mentioned by Deputy Creed&mdash;the psychological effect on agricultural workers of this legislation passing through the House.  For years, as long as I have been here, the position has been that there is one type of legislation passed for workers and another type for agricultural workers, as if they were some different breed and not the same as other types of workers.  The Minister may say that they are paid so badly that possibly the minimum rate would be enough to cover them and that this is the reason the legislation is so framed. I do not know what he meant by his story about the necessity for a computer. It just does not seem to me to be the answer and I suggest to him that the sooner the Government decide that agricultural workers are a very important sector of the working <Col N="1229" /> community, the sooner we will be able to get these workers into their proper place in the social life of the country.</P>
      <P>Again I cannot understand why agricultural workers in particular are being discriminated against.  It is not, I suppose, possible to deal with this matter on this amendment, but I have a hazy idea that one of the reasons why the Minister felt it would be more convenient to leave them out is that female agricultural workers have not got the same qualifications for benefit as any other type of worker.  The Minister may find a little bit of a complication in having to highlight this if he includes agricultural workers as if they were what they are, workers who are doing a darned good job and who are entitled to consideration.  For that reason Deputy Creed is quite correct in pinpointing this matter.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister is not averse, being a rural man himself, to treating agricultural workers as they should be, but I would appeal to him to have another look at this because I believe that, whether inadvertently or not, he is being unfair to those workers who work for hire in agriculture.  They are getting scarcer and scarcer.  I listened the other night to a radio programme in which a gentleman was explaining the drop in agricultural employment in the EEC. He did not, like Deputy Blaney on another matter recently, comment that the same thing was going to happen here but he literally gloated over the fact that in this country agricultural workers would be a dying race, that there would be a very much smaller number of them in the years to come, having entered the EEC.  If for no other reason than to give them a status they are entitled to, would the Minister accept the amendment or reconsider the whole thing and introduce an amendment to include them?</P>

      <P>I cannot at this stage accept the amendment, and certainly not for one of the reasons given by Deputy Tully, that because they are lower paid workers, I feel they would not be included.  I would like them <Col N="1230" /> to have the full effect of this and I hope they will have it as soon as it is possible to do it.  In 1971, there were some 38,000, a considerable number of workers, and as I said on Second Reading, the purpose of the Bill is to give persons who will become incapable of work or who are unemployed benefits related more closely to what they were receiving before they became unemployed and my desire would be to cover every person who is eligible to be covered. I had some difficulty in getting a means of collecting the pay-related contributions, but we finally got a means of getting the Bill off the ground and started when the collectors of revenue agreed to take up the contributions.  We could not get agreement at this stage on extending it to male and female agricultural workers.</P>

The Minister mentioned that this legislation will not become law until April, 1974, and that he hoped to include agricultural workers as soon as possible after that date.  I have a horror of governments putting people on the long finger.  I am pleased that this Bill has been introduced but I do not accept that the obstacles to including these people in the pay-related scheme are insurmountable.  The Minister has taken a step but he should go further and include agricultural workers.  As Deputy Tully pointed out, for too long they have received poor treatment and I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment. It is very difficult for agricultural workers to find alternative employment when they lose their jobs. They do not fit easily into other types of employment and the Minister should be generous enough to include them in this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps one of the reasons the Minister has not included agricultural workers is that this industry has been losing jobs very rapidly.  We should be honest about that fact.  The rate of loss in agriculture for many years exceeded 12,000 <Col N="1232" /> per year, although it has decreased somewhat.  If one drains water out of a barrel eventually there is very little left and the trickle gets smaller. Although the rate of loss in agriculture may have declined somewhat, there is still a considerable loss.  In the EEC, the number of people employed in agriculture has dropped to one-quarter of what it was previously.</P>
      <P>If agricultural workers are forced to leave the land, they would draw a higher rate of benefit if their rate of wages is high.  In addition, there is the disgraceful situation created by the Government with regard to female agricultural workers.  There is no reason why a girl who is employed in agriculture cannot draw unemployment benefit until she has ten years' stamps.  That is why the Minister thinks there are complications.  He has told us he is putting in a proviso which will allow him to alter this when the time is right.  Unfortunately the time is never right for these things, and we have an example of that in various Acts passed by this House. On each occasion I pointed out the agricultural worker was treated like an outcast.  He was not regarded as a second-class citizen but as a fifth-or sixth-class citizen.  Deputies who studied this Bill thought it would be impossible for the Government to put up any argument to exclude agricultural workers but, to and behold, the Minister comes here and attempts to justify excluding them.  The Government should realise that everyone can see what they are doing, everyone knows this is wrong.  It would be wrong to suggest that it will not cost money to include those workers but there is no point in introducing this measure unless it is intended to cover those who are unemployed.</P>
      <P>The point made that it is impossible to find out rates of wages is nonsense. The Minister knows that it is easy to find out the rate of wages of agricultural workers or of any other workers. The Department of Finance find it out very quickly.  The Minister is doing his best with a very bad case but he should give in.</P>

      <P>I have little to add to what I have already said.  I have <Col N="1233" /> stated that the only reason for the exclusion of agricultural workers is the difficulty with regard to collecting particulars regarding income.  The 1971 figure indicates that there are 38,000 agricultural workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still a considerable number.  I would point out that, if we amended some of the conditions regarding the duration of the period of drawing benefit, that would be more likely to have effect on the costing than would including more people.  I stated that 1974 would be the date on which we could collect pay-related contributions but I hope the measure will come into effect before that date.  I mentioned on Committee Stage that we will not wait until the date of collection of contributions but we have arranged that the Exchequer will come to the rescue to enable us to get the scheme in operation before then.</P>
      <P>I want to assure those Deputies who put down the amendment that I have as much sympathy with the category of workers mentioned as they have and that we have deliberately taken power in section 10 to include these people as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be more specific about the difficulties he faces with regard to collection. There are approximately 50,000 workers involved in the different categories. There are full-time male agricultural workers and full-time female agricultural workers.  There are full-time women workers in domestic employment. These total, according to the Minister, some 50,000.  Is the principal reason why it is not possible to collect contributions in the case of these employees the fact that the employers are not registered with the Revenue Commissioners? If one carefully reads the Minister's speech on the Second Stage one sees the point I am making.  He said the principal reason for the exclusion of these workers was because it would not be possible to collect pay-related contributions from them under the present system.  Are the employers registered?  The Minister should tell the <Col N="1234" /> House whether or not they are.  Are the actual earnings known from information available to the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners may have advised the Minister that it is not possible to work out pay-related benefits for such workers on a system of 1½ per cent deduction from pay. If the Minister tells us that, fair enough.  There is nothing, of course, to stop the Minister including such workers under the insurance stamp system by compelling the employers to pay something additional.  Would not 38,000 male employees represent 20,000 employers?  Would not the 15,000 domestic employees and female agricultural workers represent some 12,500 employers?  How many of these 20,000 farmers are registered with the Revenue Commissioners for PAYE? How many of the 12,500 employers of female workers are registered?  If they are not registered we will have to devise some other system in order to include them.</P>
      <P>The facts should be clearly stated. It should not be a case of the Minister saying: &ldquo;We are very sorry, but we cannot include these because the income tax system does not permit us to include them&rdquo;.  If the system is not sophisticated enough to include such workers, that should be stated publicly.  If it is not stated the impression will be created that there is, in fact, a form of direct discrimination. This is evident in their exclusion actually because it should be possible to use the insurance stamp even though this may entail an undesirable double system of collection.  The Minister might consider that point. The group is a relatively small group in the 800,000 odd insured workers. These male agricultural workers and women workers in agricultural and domestic employment are frequently those in greatest need of supplementary benefits and, because of that, we really should try to include them.  I await the Minister's reaction.</P>

      <P>I accept that many of them are not.  On 5th December last the Minister for Finance answered a question on this point.  At column 951 of volume 264 of the Official Report, in reply to a question by Deputy Tully, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Some employers engage in more than one trading activity and they are not obliged to keep statistics of employees by reference to particular categories of employment.  It is not possible therefore to state the number of employers registered for PAYE purposes who employ agricultural workers nor, of course, the number of such workers paying tax under PAYE.</P>
      <P>Employers, including employers of agricultural workers, are normally required to remit tax deducted from the remuneration of employees in any income tax month within nine days from the end of that month.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: Would the Minister not be able to give the number of employers who are registered as agricultural employers only?  He said he cannot do it for the people who have two sources of income but surely he could do it for those engaged in agriculture only?</P>
      <P>Mr. Colley: The difficulty is that they are not registered in that way.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: They are not identified?</P>
      <P>Mr. Colley: That is what I understand. Because some are engaged in more than one trading activity and they are not separately segregated it is not possible to give the number to the Deputy.  I will look into the question of whether it is possible to ascertain the number of those solely engaged in agriculture and who are so identifiable.  Is this what the Deputy wants?</P>
      <P>This was in reference to being able to identify agricultural workers and this is the problem I have come up against in the matter of collecting contributions. The Minister gave an indication there that there is a movement on foot to clarify the situation and, as soon as the situation is clarified, I shall, with pleasure, include them in the pay-related scheme.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider including these two categories on Report Stage, even as an interim measure?  Presumably this Bill will be looked at again between now and April, 1974.  We could then say: &ldquo;You are in, and you are under the social insurance stamp category through a contribution from yourself and your employer, and by regulation.&rdquo;  The Minister could subsequently remove them from collection under that form and bring them in under the normal PAYE form.</P>
      <P>There will be a serious reaction from such workers who are excluded. They feel they have been excluded because their employers have not registered themselves under PAYE. Many agricultural workers, and particularly those with large families may not be liable to PAYE but, nevertheless, they should all be registered as employees with a zero contribution for PAYE.  I see no reason why, in framing social legislation, we should always take it out on the women agricultural workers, simply because the system of collection of contributions in agriculture is extremely difficult and diffuse.  I wonder what the Minister's reaction is to that, and what is Deputy Creed's reaction?  I do not think that either of us is disposed towards withdrawing the amendment at the moment.</P>

If it is possible to bring them in before we start collecting, I will do that.  As I said already, a Minister can easily see how much pressure he will be under here to have this category added in.  It is most necessary to have them in.  I can assure the House that there is nothing naïve in my leaving them out at this time, and it is not for the purpose of saving money or for saving the people who will have to pay contributions.  It is for the sole reason I have given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> I hope to get the problem of the abolition of the insurability limit of £1,600 solved and to extend social insurance to all categories.

      <P>If they are in now and, if between now and February, 1974, the Revenue Commissioners discover that it is quite impossible to collect those contributions they can be taken out.  If the Minister for Finance, in ensuring that the Revenue Commissioners broaden the scope of PAYE to have all farmers registered, even though many of the employees might not be paying income tax, they can then be left in and if, on the other hand, it is quite impossible, they can easily be taken out.  The collection point will not occur until February or March of 1974. It is most likely that if they are in the insurance classes they will not be concerned until March or April of 1974. We would prefer to have them in and if, perforce, they have to be taken out, I do not think the Opposition will be unduly difficult in their approach to this matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 3, lines 9 and 10, to delete &ldquo;thirteenth&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;fourth&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment primarily to ensure that the Minister will elaborate on and justify the reasons he has advanced so far for the 14-day waiting period in the introduction of the payment of benefit under the Bill.  It is important to point out that very many workers suffer from short term disability, or short term unemployment and, as such, will not qualify for wage-related benefits because of the lengthy waiting period in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that in Britain there is a comparable waiting period. It should be known quite extensively that very many workers will not qualify fully if they have short term unemployment or a short term sickness. At the moment about 30,000 people on average are in receipt of unemployment benefit throughout the year.  I would estimate that about two out of every three or them would qualify for wage-related benefit, unemployment benefit, or roughly the figure given by the Minister on 21st November of 21,000.  There are also from 54,000 or 55,000 persons in receipt of disability benefit and, of those, only about 14,000 would actually benefit under this Bill.  The extent to which workers will benefit from the pay-related benefits is strictly limited by the two weeks waiting period and by the number of persons who have to be earning more than £14 a week in order to qualify for pay-related benefit.</P>
      <P>Traditionally the Labour Party have objected to the three-day waiting period.  I used the word &ldquo;fourth&rdquo; in my amendment to bring it in line with the current social welfare provisions and not in any way to justify the three-day waiting period.  I wanted to have a general <i>pari passu</i> approach to existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to elaborate on the reasons for the two weeks waiting period and to let us know <Col N="1239" /> whether he has any intention of extending the scope of the Bill or of reducing the waiting period.  It is important to bear in mind that the average male adult industrial worker in Ireland is earning about £30 per week, but he must be out of work for over two weeks before qualifying for pay-related benefit.  Anybody in that category whose income would be reduced to, say, even £15 for one week, would find himself in a catastrophic situation and he would have to wait until the third week before receiving pay-related benefit.  Therefore, in justice, the Minister should examine this aspect of the Bill.  Most men in industrial employment would have to meet such fixed commitments as rent, expenditure on food <i>et cetera,</i> so that a two weeks waiting period for benefit would be quite an imposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that there will always be those who are ready to go on sick leave after two or three days and hope to qualify for 60 or 70 per cent of their earnings.  I do not think that practice is widespread, but should the odd individual indulge in such practice, he would be discovered very quickly.  The waiting period should be reduced substantially and brought into line with the existing waiting period.  I must say that, if I were earning £30 per week in a factory, I would not wish to have to live on £10 or £12 even for one week. I ask the Minister to consider the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the purpose of the amendment but, needless to say, there are a number of factors that must be taken into consideration&mdash;for instance, the costings involved.  Administratively, it is convenient to have a fortnight's waiting period because the reckonable earnings have to be taken into account for the purpose of assessing pay-related benefits.  Apart from that, a short duration illness of 12 days is not regarded as a period in which a claimant would be inconvenienced unduly since he would continue to receive flat rate benefits during that <Col N="1240" /> time, as happens at present.  The 12 days mentioned include the present three days waiting period so that in fact the waiting period for pay-related benefits will be nine days.  The other point is that this provision is in conformity with what is regarded as acceptable in the UK; and, while it might not be in conformity with the position in some of the EEC countries, comparisons cannot be made with those countries in many respects because, for instance, they do not have redundancy payments on the same scale as we have.  Any conditions they have are related entirely to their own set of circumstances.</P>
      <P>I thought that the 12 days waiting period was generous, particularly when the payments will continue over a 24½ week period.  I think the House will agree that the aim of the Bill is to help most those who experience long periods of unemployment or incapacity for work.  Of course it applies also to maternity allowances.  To shorten the waiting period would upset considerably the calculations and, of course, would have an effect on the pay-related contributions.  I do not think that the 12 days period is unduly harsh and at this stage I would not consider accepting Deputy Desmond's amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Subject to the provisions of the Acts, the widow of an insured person who had reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year shall be entitled to pay-related benefit in respect of any period during which she is entitled to a widow's (contributory) pension.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that this is one section of our community who should be included in this pay-related scheme.  It is not difficult to realise the plight of a widow who <Col N="1241" /> has to support herself and, perhaps, young children.  Deputy Desmond emphasised the effect on a person who finds his income reduced because of unemployment or illness, but when a woman loses her husband she is in an almost impossible situation in trying to support her family.</P>
    <P>During the week before last we spent some time here talking of violence but the inadequacy of payments to widows is in itself a type of institutional violence in respect of which we have done very little.  It costs a lot of money today to rear children and to ensure that they are looked after properly.  Therefore, if we can include widows in this Bill we will be doing a good day's work.  I think most Deputies will agree that there is greater poverty among widows than among any other section of our community and it is not difficult to realise the problems that can arise where there is such poverty.  In some cases widows and their families have not enough to eat or at least they are on the breadline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept an extension of the scheme at this stage to the widows' pension.  As I have said before, I would hope that the scheme which is now getting its first innings would be extended eventually to all pensions.  At another stage I may have been more hopeful in saying that I would like to have it extended from the beginning to old age, invalidity and blind pensions.  We all have a particular sympathy for widows but we must remember, too, that a woman whose husband is a permanent invalid is in as bad, if not worse, position than is a widow, because such a woman has an invalid husband on her hands who must be maintained and cared for.  I would like to extend the scheme to invalidity pensions, to old age contributory pensions and widows' pensions eventually.  Like every other social welfare scheme ever brought in, the clamour is to have it extended to all.  I do not think it would be very practicable to extend it to widows at this stage and leave others out.  It would not take in the most necessitous widows&mdash;but it would deal with a section of contributory <Col N="1242" /> widows but not with the non-contributory widows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that the Minister has a problem in relation to women with invalid husbands, but surely the whole purpose behind this should be that the least well off section of the community would get priority.  Surely the Minister will agree that the people mentioned in this amendment are the worst off section of social welfare recipients.  This is the purpose which motivated me in seeking to have this subsection included. I am convinced, without any shadow of doubt, that widows with young children are the worst off section in our society today.  We are doing very little for those people.  If we included this subsection in the Bill it would be a way in which we could help those unfortunate people who suddenly find themselves widows in charge of and having to provide for a young family.  As representatives in Parliament we should tackle the worst off section of our society first.  I believe widows are the worst off section and that we could do something for them in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Replying on an earlier amendment moved by Deputy Desmond, the Minister said that this Bill was designed to cater for those on long term unemployment.  What longer term can a family be without earnings than when the father of a young family dies.  If the benefits of this Bill were extended to widows it would remove one source of worry from them.  As Deputy Creed said, there are many young widows rearing families on small pensions at the moment.  The children have to go out to work at an early age and very often the widows have also to go out to work to support their families.  If this subsection were included this would help widows to carry the tremendous responsibility they have to bear alone.  The Minister should consider this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Creed and Deputy Barry.  It is important to note that Deputy Creed's amendment relates to <Col N="1243" /> the contributory insurance system and it is directly related to the concept of wage-related benefits and insurance-related benefits within the system itself.  It is quite possible to have the extension proposed by Deputy Creed.</P>
      <P>There are in the country 53,000 widows in receipt of contributory pensions.  The question of non-contributory pensions is outside the scope of this Bill.  As I say, 53,000 widows are in receipt of contributory pensions. In the future they will be in receipt of what one might call the flat rate widows' pension which, at a flat rate of £10.10p per week for a widow and three children, is an extremely small sum.  It is important to stress that many of these widows have a large number of children to care for.  In fact, the 53,000 widows in receipt of contributory pensions look after 18,000 children.</P>
      <P>The wide scope of Deputy Creed's amendment is worthy of support.  It has a bearing also on another aspect. I should like to refer the Minister to the position of widows who are entitled to a contributory widows' pension. As the Minister is well aware, when they take up employment and subsequently become unemployed, under the current system they are entitled to only 50 per cent of unemployment benefit.  One might ask in respect of a widow who takes up employment and subsequently becomes unemployed what proportion of wage-related benefit she will get.  Will she get 50 per cent of wage-related benefit as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support Deputy Creed's amendment and I urge the Minister to consider this extension.  He has said that it will take between £7 million and £8 million to run this scheme.  I do not know what it would cost to introduce the payment of such benefits to widows, but I think the Minister could give some indication of this and the extent to which contributions would be required.  As far as I am concerned, as an insured worker, I would be quite prepared to pay another .8 per cent, or whatever <Col N="1244" /> it might be, if it was necessary to provide this wage-related benefit to those people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this Bill, as can be seen from the records of the House I said:</P>
      <P>It is my intention as soon as this new scheme has got off the ground and is operating smoothly to utilise the experience gained and the basic machinery established under it to introduce at the earliest feasible date complementary schemes of pay-related contributory old age, retirement, invalidity and widows' pensions.  I should sound a warning, however, that even with the best will in the world these proposed developments cannot be brought about overnight and any such changes must in the ultimate be considered in relation to general financial and economic circumstances and developments in other services.</P>
      <P>In saying that I want to point out that it does not preclude my increasing the basic rates which those people are receiving at any time in the ordinary way.  As I said already, a good case can be made for other sections for extra benefits.  I gave one instance of the woman with an invalid husband who is in a considerably worse position than the widow.</P>
      <P>These are the people I would like to assist.  This scheme is very welcome because it opens the way to a number of general improvements which it would be otherwise impossible to undertake. In reply to Deputy Desmond, widows will gain under the Bill in that, if they are employed and become unemployed or incapacitated, they will get the full supplementary amount, that is, if their previous reckonable income exceeds £14 they will get the full supplement and to that extent it is of benefit to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 23, to delete &ldquo;exceeds £14 but&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to have removed from the Bill the rather arbitrary striking of a figure of £14 for the commencement of payment of wage-related benefits.  We would prefer to see the figure out, and to see the Minister given power, by regulation if necessary, to have a zero-rate up to £X and then apply the wage-related benefit thereafter.</P>
      <P>My reason for this is that at present the average earnings of an industrial worker in manufacturing industries is £30 per week for a male adult and £15 per week for a female industrial worker.  With future wage agreements and national wage agreements coming, and bearing in mind that this Bill will not come into effect until the middle of 1974, this £14 in many respects will be out-dated.  It would be better if we had a lower commencement, at zero-point, and then more appropriately start the wage-related benefit at a point to be decided at a future date by the Minister and with reference to changes in wage rates and earnings as our economy develops.  That is why I take this approach.  There is a sense of grievance among workers earning less than £14 a week because they feel they are getting flat-rate benefit and that they are being discriminated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see the logic of some of the Minister's arguments.  I prefer not to use the global term used by the Minister in relation to average industrial earnings of £23.  We all seem to refer to this figure of £23.  I would prefer to take the average earnings of male and female workers.  They are in two <Col N="1246" /> separate categories.  They would not be separate if there was equal pay. Until such time as women no longer earn 50 per cent of what men earn, we will have to look at the actual averaging out of benefits in a different manner.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this amendment.  It would be tidy, administratively. It would probably assist the Bill's future evolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem to spend my time resisting amendments.  This is one amendment which I must resist, because the whole principle of this Bill would be undermined if I were to accept it.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to give to the person, the recipient of benefit, supplementary benefits in addition to his flat-rate benefits, which will bring him up close to his normal pay.  The £14 is taken as a floor, because the flat rate at the moment is approximately 40 per cent of the £14.  What is aimed at in this Bill is to give 40 per cent of the amount over £14 up to a ceiling to be specified.  If Deputy Desmond's amendment were to be accepted we would have certain people getting more and others getting less than what the flat rate is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could fix a zero-rate.  This would be more equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be a lot of juggling around.  The system we are adopting is actually more equitable. I can see the purpose in Deputy Desmond's amendment.  It seeks to improve the position with regard to the ceiling, but we have tried using different figures to see what would emerge as the most equitable arrangement. This is the arrangement we found to be most satisfactory.  We aim to apply 40 per cent supplementary rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Deputy Desmond's case a married man in receipt of £14 per week would be getting £14.90.  That refers to a man without any dependent children.  If we go down to the lower grades such a man would be getting less than the flat rate at the moment.  I appeal to the <Col N="1247" /> Deputy to allow the floor of £14 to stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <P>I accept that decision. I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (a), page 3, line 40, to delete &ldquo;two years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My reason for putting down these amendments is obvious: I wanted to try to get some logical order into the system.  The Parliamentary Secretary puts out his hand in astonishment.  If he thinks that what is in the Bill is logical he is welcome to it.  He has promised to help me on this discussion and I am glad to see him at it already.  It is very good of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anyone wants to delay the House unduly today.  I am simply attempting to provide a logical system so that there will be one week's notice for each year of service.  For <Col N="1249" /> example, I do not think it appropriate, with all respect to the Parliamentary Secretary who is now leaving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that a person with 14 or 15 weeks' service should be given the same period of notice as a person with one and a half or two years' service.  We have a period in the Bill of from two years to five years.  To my way of thinking, there is no connection whatever between two years and four and three-quarters years.  This Bill is no improvement on one which was passed in Northern Ireland many years ago and we know how conservative that Government up there were. Nobody could suggest that they were unduly liberally minded but they passed a Bill years and years ago far more favourable than the one we are now dealing with.  That being the case, I do not see why we should not improve on this.  I will wait to hear what Deputy Barry has to say on his series of amendments which are also an improvement on what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan and I are approaching the same problem from opposite ends.  He is trying to relate the period of notice to the years of service.  Anyone who has been two years in a job can be said to be a permanent employee and that for that reason he is entitled to more than one week's notice.  In a later amendment I am endeavouring to increase the period of notice.  After five years in a job a person is fully trained and after five years it may not be so easy for him to get alternative employment elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill seems to be to give a person laid off as much time as possible to find alternative employment and I suggest that the Minister should appreciate that a person who is two years in a job should be regarded as a permanent employee.  Such a person has no intention of leaving that job and if he is forced to do so he should be given as much time as possible to find another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision arrived at in the Bill was considered to <Col N="1250" /> be reasonable considering present circumstances in which weekly workers, irrespective of the period of their employment, are entitled to a week's notice.  The Bill is intended to help those with long service.  Indeed it leans towards that category very much.  The period of notice provided for goes up as high as eight weeks in the case of a person with 15 or more years' service. We must have regard to all sides in employment.</P>
      <P>I would point out that these are minimum periods.  There is nothing to stop a firm contracting with employees to have longer periods of notice.  This is the minimum employers are compelled to give.  I cannot accept the amendments, particularly in regard to two years.  If both sides in employment wish to extent the periods of notice, they can do so.  I do not think the Bill is ungenerous in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is not, he should decide that this Bill as drafted is quite illogical.  It is illogical that a man with one year's service should get the same notice as a man who has up to five years' service.  If the Minister does not do so, he is closing his mind to it.  He has said the minimum can be exceeded.  Many employers probably already are operating something like this and, therefore, the Minister's argument in this respect is worthless. He should remember that when a minimum is provided for in a Bill of this sort it becomes the maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might take into account the redundancy payments legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is at the back of my mind all the time but we in this House should not pass a mixum-gatherum piece of legislation of this kind.  Much more progressive legislation than this was enacted in Northern Ireland years and years ago and, as I have said, that Parliament was not noted for its generosity or liberality. <Col N="1251" /> Deputies Barry and Belton in their amendments met the Minister to a certain extent.  I have also met him and in one amendment I met him more than they did.  They have put in a period of two weeks' notice at the beginning, whereas I put in only one week.  I stayed with the Minister up to that point.</P>
      <P>In subsequent amendments I set about laying out a logical system.  The Bill as it stands is illogical at certain points.  It would be fair enough to give only a week's notice to a man with only a few weeks' service but to apply this to a person with longer service is completely unfair.  What is the logic of dividing this into periods of up to two years, up to five years, up to ten years or more and then to 15 years or more? There is a logic in five, ten, 15 but that is the only point at which the provisions of the Bill become logical. Lumping together two to five years is the worst drafting I have ever seen in a Bill.  I can see no reason why the amendment I put down should not be accepted.  The Minister has produced no argument whatsoever.  He is just saying he will not accept it, Mr. Noman. I have listened to the Minister again and again in the House and I do not remember his ever accepting an amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great deal of logic in what Deputy O'Donovan has said in regard to this lumping together.  As I said earlier, he approached it from a different angle to Deputy Belton and I, but what we both had at the back of our minds was the same thing&mdash;that a man with five years' service is entitled to more than two weeks' notice in his job.  This man is a permanent employee and he will find it exceedingly difficult in two weeks to get the kind of work he is accustomed to. <Col N="1252" /> The Minister should cater for these people.  Deputy Belton and I have tried to cater for the middle income group.  We have accepted what the Minister provided in regard to the first series, and it is only when we come to the people who are in the middle terms of employment that we have tried to extend the amount of notice to be given.  When these people are in a firm for four years they consider themselves in a permanent job which they will be in for the rest of their lives.  It would be difficult for them to look for other jobs and they need as much time as possible to do it.</P>

      <P>I have the feeling that, if I tried to improve on it, the Deputies opposite should seek further improvements.  Nothing is static.  We can see from experience that it will be quite easy to improve it as time goes on.  This introduces a completely new dimension into our industrial relations in that it writes into our legislation minimum periods of notice.  It may not be over-generous, but minimum periods must be conformed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>All he is doing is talking.  We all know this is rubbish that is talked: if you increase wages you price yourself out of the market. Now if we arrange that the people should get notice, not stop work, we are pricing ourselves out of the market.  This is merely the conventional pub talk.  I am quite prepared to give way to what Deputy Barry and Deputy Belton have put down, but there ought to be some change in this two-to five-year business here. If the Minister would even go so far as to change that on Report Stage&mdash; that is, if he would bring in an amendment here tomorrow&mdash;I would have no objection.  Certainly that two to five years is too long a stretch, and there is also too long a stretch between 13 weeks and two years.  In regard to the other periods of longer notice, all I did was make a logical approach to the matter: one week for each year's service, and the Minister does not think that is logical.  By the way, in how many Bills that go through this House about financial matters of this sort is the Minister's approach acceptable?  If I made the kind of approach in one of the Finance Acts as he has made in this Bill the Revenue Commissioners would very quickly tell me what they thought of me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will accept that the majority of employers will be glad to accede to anything that is equitable and just. If they have to let somebody go they will want to give him the maximum amount of notice; they would give him six months if they knew about it.  However, it is for the minority we are trying to cater.  We are trying to protect the people who are working for the minority of firms who would do as little as possible for their employees.  For that reason, the Minister perhaps will accept Deputy O'Donovan's suggestion and bring in an amendment on Report Stage that will allow some extension in the middle periods of the notice to be given.</P>

      <P>I appreciate this. It does not alter the fact, however, that the person who has five years' service or close on it should get longer than two weeks' notice.  As Deputy Barry has pointed out, a fortnight's notice is not enough for a person to get alternative employment.  We all know what the circumstances are in this country at the moment.  We know that people are unemployed.  The Minister likes to pretend that everything in the garden is rosy, that we only have to look after exports and that we will be all right.  Our exports are doing marvellously but employment is doing very badly.</P>

If I wanted to, I could develop that thesis.  I have not compared it with what the North was like two years ago.  Then the Minister says he does not like my form.  What have I said to the Minister so far that is in any way out of order? Nothing&mdash;except that what he has in the Bill is not logical.  Neither is it logical. It is in no way logical.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true. The Minister pointed out on Second Reading that he is also concerned about the one man working in one shop or one industry.  This is the man who must be protected as well as the large number of trade union workers working for large firms.  These people, particularly those in the distributive trades, find it extremely difficult to get alternative employment if they are laid off.  There is a great deal of competition in the distributive trades. Small shops are closing at a fast rate. There may be one or two employees who have been five years in one job and who find it difficult to get alternative employment.  A man who has been four and a half years in a job would need more than the two weeks that this Bill will give him to obtain alternative employment.</P>

If Deputy Wyse had as much experience of legislation and how long it takes to gestate as I have, he would know how long it would take for a promise of that kind to work.  I would not even take a promise from the Minister that he would consider it in the Seanad.  I would disagree with him and would press the amendment.  The fact is, all we want from the Minister is something that would put some kind of coherence into the Bill.  Deputy Wyse has not dealt with the point at all.  He said, let us give it a trial, in fact, although it is bad.  That is not <Col N="1258" /> the way we should legislate.  We should legislate certainly for some period of time.  There is no use in pushing a Bill through the House and saying let us legislate for one year.  I will not buy that.  I will not have it because it is not the proper way to legislate.  If we are going to legislate we should legislate for a reasonable period.  I hope the Minister will promise us something out of all this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this section because, as I said on Second Reading, I believe that the weight of this section is all wrong.  At present the ordinary common law determines what the relationship is to be between the employee and the employer and that is what we are trying to improve here.  The Minister remarked a while ago that he did not like my approach. I did not like what the Minister said in his reply on Second Reading when he talked about a worker being caught with his hand in the till.  I have a piece of information for the Minister. For his information, if an employee of Imperial Chemical Industries, a company which employs a quarter of a million people, is caught with his hand in the till, nothing happens to him until he is convicted in court. This West Donegal stuff of catching a worker with his hand in the till does not carry any conviction with me.</P>
      <P>Apart from that there is the word &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo;.  I believe this is too indefinite a word.  Misconduct can mean anything from using a four-letter word to giving the employer a puck in the jaw.</P>

      <P>I always like to be helpful.  What would be the consequence of leaving this section out of the Bill?  I believe the whole thing would fall back on the common law and that the relationship would become what it is already.  I do not quite understand why this should have been brought in.  I think I know what was in the Minister's mind but there would be no harm at all in taking this section out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand what this section means.  It is probably a legalistic thing in other legislation but what misconduct by the employer is I do not know or why it would be necessary for an employee to be able to terminate his employment because of misconduct by the employer.  I do not understand what is meant by that.</P>

      <P>I am quite serious about this section.  I do not think we could delete this section.  Remember the employee under this Bill is entitled to give notice as well as the employer.  If an employer began abusing an employee for some of the many reasons that none of us has any difficulty in visualising, does the Deputy not think he could walk out the door and tell him what he thought about him; or would he have to hang around for a week and undergo it every day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though it is covered in common law, although I am not a lawyer, I would submit that, if we were not to put in the section, employees or employers could plead that the terms of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act applied in cases where the common law at present operates.  That is quite <Col N="1263" /> possible and remember that there is an appeal to the tribunal.  If an employee feels that he has been wrongfully dismissed, that the terms of his contract were not observed in regard to minimum notice, he can appeal to the tribunal and, if he is not satisfied with the decision of the tribunal, he can still bring a case in common law to the High Court, so I think the safeguards are fairly reasonable.  I think the Deputy is opposing the section merely for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, I do not behave like that.  At least on this occasion, the Minister has produced some bit of logic other than this business about catching a fellow with his hand in the till about which he was so vocal on Second Reading.  To that degree, we have got him down to firm land.  I must say that his reply has some merit and, I withdraw my opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Within one month from the commencement of employment an employer shall furnish to each employee the particulars specified in this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is one of the amendments I am very keen to have the Minister accept because I feel strongly about it.  The section sets out in subsection (1):</P>
      <P>An employee may, for the purposes of ascertaining or confirming any term of his employment (including the date of commencement of that employment), require his employer to furnish him with a written statement containing all or any of the following particulars in relation to the following matters...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is well-intentioned but it is not going to operate at all because generally speaking employees are quite happy in their jobs.  They know all these things without their being written <Col N="1264" /> in until a dispute arises and then they want them and it is embarrassing to go or if an employee goes to his employer and asks for these conditions of his employment in writing, the employer will tend to become suspicious and to wonder why he is looking for these things in writing and if he has anything else up his sleeve.  It would be much simpler if the Minister would agree to &ldquo;Within one month from the commencement of his employment an employer shall furnish to each employee the particulars specified.&rdquo;  If it became the right of an employee to have in writing the various things specified, it would avoid a lot of embarrassment later on, while conforming with the section of the Bill, and give an employee a written confirmation of the amount of notice he should get, his holidays and other conditions.  It would be simple to administer because a standard form could be prepared in the Department and circulated to employers to be given to employees within a month of joining the firm and it would make for good industrial relations if an employee could have in writing as of right the particulars specified.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to make clear something that is implicit in the Bill, namely, that a dispute arising under section 9 would not be referred to the tribunal but would be dealt with under normal legal process. Under section 10, failure by an employer to furnish a statement requested under the provisions of section 9 is an offence which can be <Col N="1267" /> prosecuted by the Minister.  It is envisaged that these provisions will be administered in the same way as the Holidays Act is administered, namely, the Department of Labour will investigate complaints and a prosecution will be initiated only if an employer persists in refusing to comply with the Act.  This is an improvement on the original wording.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;( ) Prior to making an order under subsection (1) of this section, the Minister shall consult with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is quite clear.  Of course, it is realised that it is pious hope that one Minister would consult with another.  This amendment means, in effect, that the Minister shall tell the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  If they express a view with which he does not accede, the view of the ICTU will not carry any weight.  It has no legal significance except to oblige the Minister to tell the ICTU about some matter.  In other words, he is giving them an opportunity to express their point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one sacrosanct rule in this country that if there is consultation it shall be with the two sides of employment.  I cannot agree to this unilateral approach because employers would be equally concerned if changes were made by the Minister by way of order.  Section 15 states that wherever an order is proposed to be made under sections 3, 4, or 9, a draft of the proposed order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Any changes made would be of concern to both employers and workers, and to <Col N="1268" /> consult with only one side would create an imbalance.  Free collective bargaining is regarded as a system where the two parties are always equally consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a point regarding the wording used&mdash;that a draft of the proposed order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is obvious the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will hear about any such matter at that stage but there is a difference in that if the Minister consulted with them before making the order they would know about it before the matter became public knowledge.  Recently I asked a question if there had ever been an occasion where an order was rejected by both Houses of the Oireachtas but the person I asked did not know of any such case.  I would make the point that the employers are not represented by one single body whereas the ICTU represent the trade unions.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is much weight in the Minister's remark that he must consult both sides with regard to industrial relations.  I realise that the ICTU will get an opportunity when a draft order is placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas to make public any objection they might have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain at the outset, lest the possibility of my intervening might startle some Deputies, that it is not my intention to talk about farm structures or land policy in general.  I am quite happy to leave those subjects to the many Deputies who are much more familiar with them, the many Deputies who have so much practical experience of the policies and administrative procedures of the Department of Lands.  I shall confine my contribution to dealing with two small but to my mind, very important sections of the Minister's Department, the forestry and wild life service and the game development and management section.  Recently there have been suggestions in different quarters that some of the activities of the Department are not any more as important or as relevant as they have been in the past.  Whether or not this is true, I have no doubt that the two sections about which I am speaking represent areas of activity which are becoming increasingly important and relevant and which are capable of being expanded and developed even to the point at which they could constitute an important department by themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My purpose in intervening in this debate is to urge the Minister to elevate these two sections of his Department to a much higher financial and administrative <Col N="1271" /> level and to give them a new scope and status.  I believe they merit it.  Indeed, I will go so far as to say that, if the Minister were given the opportunity of undertaking a really comprehensive programme of development in regard to game and wild life generally, with his imagination and enthusiasm, that could prove for him one of the most personally satisfying and nationally beneficial things achieved by him in his public career.</P>
    <P>These particular activities of the Department of Lands must, of course, be viewed against the background of the overall situation which obtains in regard to conservation and environment control.  It is now, I think, generally accepted that, in thinking about and planning for the future, we must concern ourselves with the question of economic expansion in terms of the destruction of our natural environment. Of course we must have economic expansion; it is only through it that we can provide our people with the standards of living they seek and to which they are entitled.  One of the main problems of our time is reconciling material progress with preservation of our national environment as we have known it.</P>
    <P>We have a national environment and conservation programme and some very fine reports have been published on the situation and on the problems and possibilities involved.  I understand that, after considerable discussion and debate, it was finally decided that the making and the implementation of policy in this area would be primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government.  I believe, too, that the principal instruments on which the Minister for Local Government would rely to promote conservation and protect our environment would be the local authorities.  In theory this is quite sound because it is the Department of Local Government and the local councils which have under their control and are responsible for the main elements in the environmental situation, the infra-structure of the physical services, the control of planning and so on.  In practice, on the other hand, that can have serious disadvantages.  We all know our local authorities have such <Col N="1272" /> a variety of commitments and are subject to so many social pressures that conservation and the control of the environment may not receive in their scale of priorities the place they urgently need.  I have had some personal experience that this is the case.  However, this is one of those problems for Government administration arrangements which are, I fear, too complicated for me to go into on an occasion like this except, perhaps, to draw attention to the danger that we may very well drift into a situation of paying lip service to the conservation ideal without making enough practical effort to achieve it.</P>
    <P>That is really what my intervention in this debate is all about.  I want to urge positive action on one front at least, that is, with regard to game and wild life.  A natural environment conservation programme must involve all the distinct and separate compartments of the natural environment, terrestial, marine and fresh water habitats, wild life, scenic values, amenities and historic buildings.  As the Nature and Amenity Conservation and Development Committee in its excellent report to the Minister for Local Government on the Protection of the National Heritage points out:</P>
    <P>Concern for the whole ecosystem ensures that individual species of plants and animals (including birds) are fully protected.</P>
    <P>The Department of Lands are the natural agent to assume responsibility for wild life and a large proportion of the habitats.  I believe that within the context of the National Conservation Programme they can make a very significant contribution in these areas. They certainly have the potential to do so.  I have personally come into contact with representatives of the Forestry and Wild Life Service and the Game Development Programme.  I have no hesitation in saying that these are first class people.  They know their stuff; they are dedicated and enthusiastic.</P>
    <P>The very figures which are before us in this Estimate reveal how limited is the scope of their activities in regard to game management.  The Minister admitted in his opening statement that <Col N="1273" /> the increased provision this year of £13,000 was, in the main, merely to meet increased costs.  There is, therefore, no element of expansion under that heading.  Furthermore, the contribution under subhead H to the conservation programme is, in fact, reduced by one-third.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of those figures to which I should like to draw attention. The first is the fact that, as they stand, in quantitative terms they are quite inadequate for what needs to be done.  Perhaps more important than their inadequacy is the fact that they are more or less static.  In activities of this sort, activities of a promotional nature, a static provision from year to year is entirely unsatisfactory.  If you want to get results, if you want to keep up the activities and the enthusiasm of the people concerned, you must have positive, visible expansion from year to year.</P>
    <P>Incidently, I might just mention as an aside at this point, that I am a little puzzled by the bookkeeping in respect of subhead H.  This subhead provides a substantial allocation for the establishment of a field study centre in Donegal.  One naturally welcomes the establishment of such a centre, but if it is to be run under the auspices of the Department of Education, why not put it into the Estimates of that Department and let us see under these subheadings exactly what is being voted for the purposes for which they are designed?</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister for a completely new appraisal of the activities undertaken under these two subheads and for the establishment of a long-term, comprehensive, expanding programme for game and wild life.  I suggest to him&mdash;and he probably knows as well as I do&mdash;that the situation in this regard at present is parlous in the extreme.  Pheasants have never been as scarce as they were this year.  Grouse and partridge are practically extinct.  I am told that hares seem to be steadily increasing in numbers.  Deer, for instance, are urgently in need of protection. We undoubtedly need new legislation in that regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister and his Department undertaking the sort <Col N="1274" /> of programme I am outlining as their contribution to the national conservation effort.  There is no reason why any inter-departmental overlaping need arise because of this.  If, as apparently has been decided, the general conservation policy is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government and his Department, a game and wild life programme can quite clearly be seen as the contribution by the Department of Lands to the overall national programme.</P>
    <P>The first thing I suggest that is necessary is to rescue these two activities from the marginal position they now occupy, and from being dependent on what is provided under two subheads which are likely to be the first to be scrutinised for possible economies when the annual Department of Finance cut-back-the-Estimates effort takes place.  I should like to see the Minister for Lands seeking, and getting, a Government decision in favour of an expanding programme, adequately financed, and with an annually increasing sum committed for at least a period of five years.</P>
    <P>I believe our wild life can be successfully protected and, where necessary, re-established.  I am informed that it has been successfully done over large areas of the United States and they, perhaps, encounter greater problems in this regard than we do. I believe the Department of Land are particularly suited for this task.  They have under their control our State forests and many of the other important habitats.  One of the internationally recognised difficulties in this field is the obscurity of title in regard to certain important areas and the difficulty of establishing the ownership of important habitats.  Here the Department of Lands are ideally equipped to cope with the situation. They have the machinery, the expertise and experience of dealing with precisely this sort of problem.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister's Department will have to co-operate with sections of other Departments and institutions, particularly, for instance, with the Office of Public Works, and there may well be institutional problems <Col N="1275" /> to be overcome.  Government administration in activities of this sort, which impinge on a wide variety of activities by other Government Departments and sections of the community, can give rise to what I would call empire maintenance problems. Now, I do not mean empire building. Very often I do not think empire building is a bad thing in the sense that it means that somebody is trying to get something done.  What I mean by empire maintenance is when Departments and other institutions hang on to powers and functions, not because they want to achieve anything with them, but simply because they have always had them.</P>
    <P>Widespread public support for such a programme would be vitally necessary. People would have to understand what the Minister was seeking to achieve and what benefits would accrue to the nation.  In particular, farming organisations would have to be involved fully.  The ordinary farmer, whose support would be essential, would have to see clearly that his vocation would be much more satisfying and rewarding if it was carried on in a countryside where game and wild life are maintained in appropriate numbers and where a natural balance is preserved. This would be true particularly of the West of Ireland where in many areas farming is not and cannot be as intensive as in other areas.  Also, it would be a great opportunity for involvement for young people at school in playing their part.  This could add a very important and significant new dimension to their educational development.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to say to the Minister that I am not at all in agreement with the traditional association in official thinking between game development and tourism.  I believe that the first objective of a game and wild life development programme should be to make our country a much more pleasant place for us to live and work in and if, as a fringe benefit, tourists find it attractive because of plenty of game and wild life, I would regard that simply as a bonus.  I do not think, at this point in time with the state of <Col N="1276" /> our stocks, that shooting parties from outside the country should be aided by Bord Fáilte.  If they wish to come here we should welcome them, but in the present state of affairs with regard to stocks, such parties should not be given either official assistance or encouragement. As the National Heritage report points out, Ireland has a remarkable inheritance of natural resources.  Unlike those of many other countries, our natural resources are still reasonably intact; but time is running out and, unless a programme of the sort I am advocating and suggesting strongly to the Minister is adopted, the situation in ten years' time could well have deteriorated beyond recall.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister would consider himself called upon in this area of his jurisdiction to act now and to make his personal contribution in this way to the enrichment of our countryside and, indeed, to the everyday lives of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin on that aspect of the Estimate on which the last speaker finished, that is, the question of the conservation of wildlife.  Much is being done in this regard at present but much more could be done.  Somehow or other when I hear people talk of preserving wildlife I cannot help thinking that in some cases their only aim is to preserve it until such time as the birds are big enough or numerous enough to be shot thereby reducing the stocks to the level of a few years previously. It is a tragedy that many people who are genuinely interested in the preservation of wildlife think there is nothing wrong with that attitude.  If something could be done to change such an outlook, it would be of much help in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could do much more regarding bird sanctuaries.  Recently one such sanctuary was established at the mouth of the Boyne.  For many years in this House I had been appealing to the Minister and to his predecessors for the establishment of a bird sanctuary in that area.  It is interesting to note that when it was established some courteous official of the Department sent me a notification <Col N="1277" /> to the effect that this was being done but he did not extend an invitation to me to be present for the official opening although he mentioned that the Minister would be present on a certain Sunday at 6 p.m. for the purpose of opening the sanctuary.  As it happened I had an appointment to attend a State dinner at Iveagh House on the same evening so that I was unable to be present anyway.</P>
    <P>This game sanctuary should result in much good in the area but it would have been of much greater benefit if it had been made much larger than it is.  The Minister should know that having a sanctuary on the estuary of a river with very little cover except what seabirds use is not the ideal situation.  There is a sizeable portion of woodland and scrub above the town of Drogheda which is used by birds but which is being shot to pieces by sportsmen&mdash;sportsmen spelled with a small &ldquo;s&rdquo;.  It was a great pity that this portion was not included.  Either somebody boobed or there was some reason for leaving it out.  Now that wetlands are disappearing from many parts of the country as a result of arterial drainage, a greater effort should be made to provide game sanctuaries.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of the Forestry Division, the Minister has done much for tourism in introducing nature trails. I am sure that natives as well as tourists would agree that the idea was a well worthwhile one and that the expenditure involved was well spent.  There are some marvellous views from the various vantage points as well as from the different parts of the trail which would never have been revealed to the public if the trails had not been made. It is possible to see birds and animals now which otherwise people would not have known existed.  There are picnic areas on a number of the trails but I would suggest that many more be provided. They do not cost very much but are a wonderful amenity to the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been most courteous both inside and outside this House.  Therefore, if I am critical of the Forestry Division or of the Land Commission, what I am criticising is a set up that has been handed down <Col N="1278" /> not only to the Minister but to various other Ministers and which is impossible to shake.  Like the Minister, most of the Department's officials are courteous men who will be as polite as possible under the circumstances.  That being said, I can never understand why, in a country in which employment in rural areas is a social amenity, it should have been decided by the Department some few years ago to change completely the system of employment with the result that the number of people employed by the Forestry Division is decreasing year by year.  It was a great mistake to have introduced a system whereby the Forestry Division now employ contractors to do work which was done formerly by direct labour employed by the Department.</P>
    <P>There are very few examples that we can take from across the Border but, if we would take one, it would be to note that in the North a contractor would not be allowed inside a forest. Up to a few years ago, when it was found necessary to thin a forest or to cut timber, employees of the Forestry Division carried out the work and they did so in such a way as not to interfere with standing trees.  No branches were broken but the position now is that the contractors fell timber in the way that is most convenient for them. Their purpose is to make money as quickly as possible, but the result of this is that much damage is being done. Up to three years ago it was unheard of that planting would begin on ground that had not been cleared properly, but nowadays contractors leave branches of trees on the ground and people planting replacement trees are expected to plant them through those loose branches.</P>
    <P>This is wrong.  It may be labour saving and it may be saving the Department money but in a couple of years' time when those trees grow up&mdash;they have a certain amount of shelter when they are starting&mdash;if somebody drops a match or a cigarette anywhere near the area the lot will go up in flames because there is a pile of rotting dry timber lying on the ground.  This sort of thing is partly responsible for the damage done to <Col N="1279" /> the forests of this country through fire.</P>
    <P>Something has gone wrong with the maintenance of people in employment and also in recruitment.  I refer particularly to the fact that if people are employed in any job, and particularly in a State job, it is ridiculous that after ten or 15 years somebody can decide that money is scarce because a national wage increase has been granted and that money can be saved by knocking off a few unfortunate labourers who are paid the lowest rate in the land. Somebody will decide to save money on them and nobody above the rank of forester will be interfered with.  I am not suggesting that the Department should start a purge in their offices but surely even they must admit that it is ridiculous when a man who is dependent on under £20 a week to maintain his family is laid off because his colleagues have got a wage increase and apparently there is not enough money to go around.</P>
    <P>In addition, a system has been built in over the past 12 months to which I object very much.  If the Minister listens to me, he will agree that there is justice in my comments. In any job that I know of that a man has been employed in over a number of years, if he is doing the job properly&mdash;he must be or he would not be retained in that job&mdash;he has a right to precedence in that job over somebody who started much later than he did.  It is ridiculous when we see men with ten and 15 years' service being laid off.  Why is this happening? It is because the forestry personnel say: &ldquo;He is a single man and there are married men who have to be retained.&rdquo;  I am a married man and have reared a family so I know the difficulties a married man has in rearing his family and looking after them but I do not think it is right that any employer&mdash;I believe no employer should be allowed to do it&mdash; should knock off somebody who has been in the job for a good many years simply because somebody with more family commitments than he comes in after him.</P>
    <P>The State are wrong and they are <Col N="1280" /> setting a bad example by introducing that system.  They are doing it at the present time.  Perhaps if Deputy Blaney were here he might be able to tell us the reason why this happens in Donegal more so than anywhere else.  I am not saying the Minister knows anything about it as he could not be expected to know the ins and outs in relation to the employees of the Forestry Division.  It is wrong that men who have been employed for so long should be laid off.  Nobody says they are bad workers.  Somebody just says that the work is getting scarce which means that money is getting scarce.</P>
    <P>A 25,000 acre plantable reserve has been maintained for many years by the Department.  Sometimes they have difficulty in getting up to it and sometimes they have more than the requisite 25,000 acres.  It does not matter one way or the other because none of us, either in Government employment or anywhere else, would be prepared to accept a situation that when we have been working for years in a job we should be dumped out because somebody sitting inside, who never saw us felt that somebody would have to be let go and, therefore, because the particular man was not married and had not a family he should be let go.  I want to record my objection to that.  I have already done so on another front in this House.  If a person has been in a job for a number of years he must be suitable.  If somebody has to be let go, the person with the longest service should be retained.  If the person is not suitable say so, and let us have done with it but, for goodness sake, do not let us use this excuse to dump the man out. I am sorry I have to raise this issue here but I do not seem to be getting very far with it elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the amount of bonus payments which those people get.  The Forestry Division, having a number of excellent administrators, should be able to deal with small matters which come up in a relatively short time.  I would not burden the House or the Minister with those complaints if it were possible within a reasonable time to get a reasonable answer but when I find <Col N="1281" /> Government officials using a device for the purpose of creating a situation that it is impossible to get an ordinary decision which a private employer would give across the table within a couple of hours discussion, when I find the State using the set-up which they can use for the purpose of deferring these things, then I feel the place to raise it is in the national Parliament with the Minister who is responsible listening to it.</P>
    <P>A bonus system was introduced some years ago.  While it had the effect of earning more money for the men concerned, it also increased the work output and had a rather peculiar effect.  It had the effect that the people who were not prepared to work very hard were squeezed out not by the Department but by the people working with them because it was a group bonus scheme and in this way the Department proved themselves very clever.  They pushed out a number of people who otherwise would have remained a long time in employment. The bonus depended on an adjustment being made each time there was a wage adjustment in the bonus scheme. Innocently, we felt that the State would make that adjustment.  We did not bother to check until recently when we were horrified to find that every time an adjustment was made, with one exception, it was made against the workers in the employment of the State.  The result is that there is quite a sizeable variation and now when the matter has come to light they say: &ldquo;Now we will give you a couple of pence to make it up&rdquo;. If those men had been paid over the years, they would have collected quite a substantial amount of money so I think the State will have to step up to their responsibilities and make up for the short payment which they gave to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>There is the question of differential rates for various people which, should be purely a matter for trade union negotiation.  If we have month after month to try to get a decision on those things and seem to be getting nowhere with the matter, there does not seem to be anything else to do except try to interest the Minister concerned so <Col N="1282" /> that he will say to his senior officers: &ldquo;Look, get this thing cleared because if it is not there will be a bigger row&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the question of protective clothing.  It was agreed nearly 12 months ago that protective clothing would be issued but it has not been issued yet.  When we ask we are told that it is ordered through the Post Office and that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs supply protective clothing to all the State Departments.  When I put down a question in the House the Minister got a reply to give to me which said that it was because the trade unions concerned had not given the list of foresters to which the clothing was to be distributed.  I should like to point out that the list of foresters are those employed in every forest in the country. Every forestry worker in the country is entitled to protective clothing and there is no point in giving it to him next April or May.  He wants it now when the weather is bad.  It is ridiculous to say that the State could not get supplies of protective clothing between last March or April and the middle of December.</P>
    <P>We also have a situation which would not be found anywhere else but with which the State do not find anything wrong.  A pension scheme and a gratuity were introduced recently.  In normal circumstances if a man is drawing a wage, it does not matter what he is doing his pension and gratuity is based on whatever wage he has over a period.</P>
    <P>There are people employed by the State who are also on what they call fire picket over periods of 15, 20 or 30 years.  When they come to retire they are told that the State only takes basic pay into account.  The same happens with regard to service pay.  The State does not want to take this into account when making up pensions or gratuities. These are petty points.  It should not be necessary to raise them here but they must be brought to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he has offered additional incentives to people for private planting.  If one looks at the debates about the Department of Lands since I came into this House, it <Col N="1283" /> will be noticed that on every possible occasion I suggested that additional incentives should be given to people for such planting.  I also stated that the farmer who has land which is not suitable for normal agriculture or grazing, and who does not plant it with trees, is a fool.  He would receive many bonuses, apart from the fact that such planting would give him much-needed shelter for his land.  Most such farms need additional shelter.  In many such cases if a farmer uses the right kind of timber he could drain his land much better than by digging expensive drains.  When the timber matured he could sell it at a good profit.</P>
    <P>I have told the story before about the situation in Austria.  It has been a long-standing practice there for a farmer to plant an acre of timber when a girl is born into the family. By the time the girl is 21 years old she has a fine dowry.  Irish farmers could do something like that.  The value of 21 years of timber-growing would be considerable.  I am sure that no one would be inclined to refuse such a dowry.  Such a scheme might even increase the marriage rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking a step in the right direction when he gives additional grants for planting and for scrub clearance.  Grants have been given for scrub clearance under the land reclamation schemes.  The Department of Lands are the right Department to deal with this problem. The encouragement given for the growing of more hardwoods is to be praised.  I do not know whether the planting of poplar is to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister should examine the problem of getting smaller portions of land which could be taken over and planted.  Some years ago we talked about the idea of taking over cutaway bogs.  While this was considered an excellent idea, someone suggested that in view of what had happened at Glenamoy it was felt that the land would be put to better use.  I do not believe that land can be put to better use than growing timber. Every effort should be made to encourage such planting.  There are small portions of land which are of <Col N="1284" /> no use to farmers.  In such a case a farmer may not want to engage in private planting.  Can anything be done by the Department to have the land used for State planting?</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas about which there has been much discussion. I understood that an agreement had been reached in respect of one of them.  I refer to a piece of land in the mountains below Dundalk.  There is a considerable amount of State forest there.  There is also some common land.  I understood that although there was tremendous difficulty in trying to trace the original owners, the Act which I describe here as the &ldquo;Blowick Act&rdquo;, has eased the problem in regard to the purchase of such land.  I thought that this Act was to be used for the purpose of acquiring this land.  This land is still being used for grazing sheep and the number of people using it is getting smaller and smaller.  Has the Minister any information about that land in the Cooley Mountains?  Are there many such areas in the country which could be taken over and planted?</P>
    <P>I am interested in this problem for two reasons.  I believe that the planting of timber should be encouraged in every possible way.  I also believe that the employment given in rural areas in the forests should be encouraged. I know of areas which have no employment other than that provided by the Forestry Division.  It is a pity that the number of people so employed seems to have dropped.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission work under very difficult conditions.  Anyone who is a Deputy, a Senator, a parish priest or a county councillor, has to deal with people who believe that if pressure is exerted in the right direction they will be given a farm of land.  I believe that political influence should not be used.  It is wrong that politicians particularly should attempt to influence people with regard to the allocation of land.  Having said that, I must add that from time to time most peculiar circumstances arise and people like Deputy Bruton, Deputy Hilliard and myself, who hold the same views on this matter, find it extremely difficult to tell somebody <Col N="1285" /> that no political influence is being used, when such people can point out to us land which has been given to someone who could not possibly qualify for it unless he had been helped in some way by a politician who had the authority to give such help.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands, to my own knowledge, has never been involved in anything like this.  I have never heard anybody mention Deputy Seán Flanagan's name as being a person responsible for wrangling farms of land for his friends.  The same cannot be said of some of his predecessors. When one finds a farm of land being divided and the best of it being given to somebody who is a nephew, a brother or a cousin of a Minister it is difficult to tell someone who feels entitled to a farm in that area that there is no political influence being used.  Such a person would tell me that I did not know what I was talking about.  The fact is that I probably do not know the circumstances in such cases.  This has caused much annoyance to Land Commission officials.  I have my own quarrels with them.  I can be fairly tough if I find somebody is trying to make a fool of me.  A person may be doing something which he feels is all right, but when I start to check back it may appear to me as if I am getting the &ldquo;run around&rdquo;.  I may get a letter from a man who tells me that 12 or 20 of his neighbours and himself would like a farm which is to be sold in a particular area to be taken over, and that they would like to be considered for a part of it, and if I sent that information to the Land Commission and if the Land Commission simply wrote back to me and stated: &ldquo;I am in receipt of your letter, we will have the matter investigated and we will let you know whether we are taking over the farm&rdquo;, I would be satisfied.  But if within a couple of days I get back 20 printed letters in 20 envelopes, each addressed to me and saying: &ldquo;With reference to your recommendation in regard to so-and-so, I wish to inform you his application will be considered in conjunction with all the applicants&rdquo;, either somebody is terribly obtuse in the Land Commission or they think I am a damn fool.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> This is the sort of thing I do not like.  I do not write to the Minister because I know he has far more important things to do than to deal with day-to-day matters.  My letter is addressed to the Land Commission because I know ultimately it will find its way to whoever is responsible for these matters.  The least I would ask from a State official is that a letter to a Member of this House would be typed stating that the letter had been received and that the matter is being considered.  That is all I want.  Later, I would expect an acknowledgment telling me that the farm is to be divided or that it is not, and that the man I recommended either would get a farm or that he would not.  It does not happen that way, not because the Minister tells the official to do it in a certain way.  A bad old system has grown up in the Land Commission which has been handed down from one group of civil servants to the other.  I do not think this is the way their business should be done.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I appear to be critical of civil servants.  I have to meet them and to talk to them on the telephone and I find them most courteous, but they are hidebound by a system which should be changed and I think the man to make that change is Deputy Flanagan, the Minister for Lands.  From his experience as a Deputy he knows this sort of thing just does not wash.  I do not want favours.  I do not want the Land Commission to do for me what they are not doing for anybody else but I should like the courtesy of an intelligent reply, something I do not get.</P>
    <P>We have plenty of trouble on the question of employment, which has dropped.  Various systems have been adopted.  Long ago a good strong ditch would do and two men were supposed to build two sections of it in a day.  If they did not, somebody else came along the following day and did it.  Now there is a different system.  It might be all right because the cost is added to the price of the land and the person getting the farm would be quite happy to do a better job on the fence later on.  What I am coming to is that the men doing the job, they are State employees, should <Col N="1287" /> be paid a decent rate, and if the man in charge, who has to go to a great deal of trouble to see there is good output, has to travel 25, 30 or 35 miles&mdash;I know of a case where a man had to travel 44 miles&mdash;it is unreasonable to give him a travel allowance of only £1.25 per week.  He has to pay for his petrol, his tax and his insurance.  A miserable increase of 50 pence a week was offered.  The Land Commission in this matter should realise they are in 1972&mdash;1973 is only a few weeks away&mdash;and bring things up to date.  If civil servants in offices are allowed car hire for the type of work they do there is no reason why another type of worker in State employment should not get the same type of allowance.  He is entitled to it and I would ask the Minister to look into it and have this anomaly straightened out.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the division of land among what are known as local deserving applicants.  Some years ago the Minister for Lands said he proposed in future to divide all land among local people except that earmarked for migrants.  This has been done up to a point.  However, we had one or two incidents which I regret very much.  I refer to the Smith farm at Decoy, Darlow Cross.  It was not taken over because the owner of the farm did not leave it.  Eventually when he left, some of it was divided locally and the remainder was earmarked for migrants.</P>
    <P>With some of my colleagues from the country.  I took a deputation to the Department.  We did not go to the Minister because we would be wasting his time since all he could do would be to give us the facts.  From the records, it appeared there was a possibility that local people would get the remainder of the land and the farm building.  The possibility was so obvious that we spent half of the discussion time talking about how those people would take over the farm buildings. Those people left with the impression that the Land Commission were not considering bringing in a migrant.  Within a week, however, a migrant came in and he ran into a good deal of trouble.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> Now, there are no people as neighbourly or courteous as the Meath people.  No matter where you come from you are welcome.  If they had not that attitude there might not be so much migration into the county.  Indeed, I have heard people from the Minister's county say: &ldquo;If you come to Mayo you would not get the reception we get from you&rdquo;.  This man came in and was given the house and the farm buildings which a week earlier were under discussion as possibly being allocated to local people.  Those people rightly felt they had been made fools of, and one can imagine what we felt, having taken them up here. The Minister had made a statement that this kind of thing would not happen and the local people felt that somebody was breaking faith with them. That migrant revealed that he had been waiting four years for that farm.  We should like to find out where the original untruth came from.  Worse than that, the man had built himself a house during the last four years.  I asked numerous questions about this to try to get to the bottom of it.  I produced for the Minister an authentic list of the people living in the area, and God knows if they were not entitled to additions to their little holdings I do not know who was.  Many of them were as badly off as those living on the seaboard in Mayo or Galway.  This kind of thing causes a certain amount of ill-feeling between the Land Commission and local people, particularly when it concerns the last farm to be divided in the locality.  If the Land Commission know that they will have to do something which will be unpopular, they should say so.</P>
    <P>The organisation known as the Land League seems to be in pretty bad odour with the Land Commission. Some people apparently accuse them of committing illegal acts from time to time.  I will not, in this issue or in any other issue, back up people who break the law.  I am prepared to give full backing as long as we stay within the law.  If somebody wants to break the law they can count me out.  I believe that most of those people but not all of them&mdash;certainly the people who lead the organisation and whom I know&mdash;are law-abiding <Col N="1289" /> citizens.  The fact that they meet often and are very insistent on what they claim to be their rights should not be held against them.  The Land Commission would be far better if they attempted to reach agreement at local level, because these are people who live around farms, in the main, and who know exactly what the situation is.  Rather than have a row over a farm every effort should be made to reach agreement at local level, so that eventually when the farm is divided everybody is happy that the best that could possibly be done has been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister has from time to time pointed out that there was a one-mile limit for people who had small farms, that only those inside that area would be entitled to land if there was any available for them and that landless men or cottage tenants would have to be within a half mile.  We have discussed this here and I have put down numerous notices of motion here in this regard.  I thought there was a ray of light, because the last time we discussed it the Minister said there was no reason to stick strictly to the mile or the half mile.  Some of his officials still do not seem to have got the message.  If somebody who lives 100 yards outside the mile from a farm is considered ineligible, I cannot understand why it is considered all right to go 100 miles or 200 miles to find somebody to whom the land can be given.  This attitude is wrong and is resented very much.  I would suggest that when a farm is being divided the officials should operate in a circle around the area and keep going out in ever-widening circles until everybody whom they consider is entitled to land has got it, and when the amount of land is finished that is it.</P>
    <P>The cost of the land is now a big problem and, with things the way they are, we are wondering whether we will soon reach a stage at which it will not be possible for anybody even to take land.  I want to tell one story which some people have been repeating again and again.  Land Commission farms are not presents.  They are not given for nothing and the annuity which must be paid on a farm is very high.  The <Col N="1290" /> only person who gets a present is the man, usually from the west, who has a couple of acres and a house, and who, because he had his own land vested, which he gave up in order to break up the rundale system, is given a fullsized farm of 40 to 45 acres in County Meath.  The farm is vested in him within a matter of months; he sells it and goes away.  It is the same as winning the Sweep, and we have had far too many of those people over the years.  However, the normal man who comes to live on his farm must pay for what he is getting.  While the migrants who came there, the men who worked on the land or people who swapped farms, got their land at half the annuity &mdash;and Fianna Fáil made enough capital out of halving the annuities in the early forties; it is one of the things we heard at elections year after year when I was a gosoon&mdash;they did not make so much noise about it when they increased the annuity to the full amount for the local people under the 1965 Land Act.  One man coming from the West, the South or the North of Ireland pays £12 an acre for a farm, but his neighbour who comes from beside the farm and who, perhaps, has worked on it all his life, has to pay £24 an acre.  If that is cherishing all the children of the nation equally I do not know what is meant by the phrase.</P>
    <P>Now that most, if not all, of the land is being given to local men, another look will have to be taken at this problem.  It is not right that people should be asked to pay the amounts per acre they are being asked to pay at present.  If the land costs £20-£25 per acre and rates have to be paid on top of that, the man that goes into the farm would want to have a fair amount of money or backing before he would be able to make a living on it at all. Either the period of repayment will have to be lengthened or the amount of the annuity to be paid will have to be reduced.  It is very difficult for men to live on what they have left after making this sort of payment.</P>
    <P>Another question I would like to ask the Minister is, why does the Land Commission hold land so long?  I have had questions down here over the years and the usual answer I got was <Col N="1291" /> that they were waiting for another farm to come up in the area; they were waiting to buy more of a farm, for instance, the Kohlln estate in County Meath which they bought in three parts.  The Land Commission have always insisted that they are losing money on the land.  Why do they not divide it within a reasonable time.  Deputy Ó Moráin, when he was Minister a few years ago, solemnly assured the House that no land would be kept longer than two years.  There is land now in the possession of the Land Commission for ten years, some of it for six, some of it for eight years and so on.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to find out why this is being done, because it does not make sense.  People who were originally expecting to get holdings, and possibly will get holdings, may be gone past their best, as they say themselves, by the time the land is given to them.  If the land is acquired for division, do not have people fighting over who gets the grazing of it, who is entitled to take portion of it each year, old spites growing up and, in addition, certain gentlemen with political aspirations arriving in the area and sitting down in the hearth with a stick or in the dust at the side of the road dividing the land for them, every time they feel there is an election coming along.  If land is taken over it should be divided and that should be the end of it.</P>
    <P>There is another matter on which I have had numerous rows with Ministers for Lands in this House, and that is the provision of the 1965 Land Act which limited the amount of land that could be bought by a foreigner to five acres.  It is the famous section 47, and I was hoping Deputy Haughey would stay in the House until I had reminded him that at a by-election conference in Galway he announced this section was being introduced into the Bill after a Labour Party proposal that a foreigner be confined to ten acres under the same circumstances had been beaten by the Government on a vote.  Then a by-election came along, and by-elections are wonderful things to cure all sorts of ills, and I think the Deputy who was returned <Col N="1292" /> as a result of that by-election is in the House at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not a pity?  The Deputy might have persuaded him to keep his promise, because he guaranteed that this Land Act would have this famous section 47 in it which stipulated that no foreigner would be allowed to buy more than five acres of land and without the permission of the Land Commission.  I had an idea that that meant what it said.  I thought that a foreigner would be allowed to buy up to five acres if the Land Commission allowed him to do so and that if they did not allow him he would not be allowed to buy any land at all.  That was not the interpretation put upon it by the Land Commission. Their interpretation was that he could buy five acres without reference to them but if he wanted to buy more they would have to agree. As a result of numerous questions in the House, we were told that all they are allowed to buy is march, bog, mountain or land that was not of much use or that the person concerned was going to start an industry. I asked a question to find out how much land in a number of counties had been bought.  I was surprised to find that since the 1965 Land Act literally thousands of acres of the best land had passed into the hands of foreigners, apparently with the permission of the Land Commission.  I should like to know why the Land Commission allows this.  If it had stopped at that when the matter was brought to public notice I would not have minded.  Unfortunately, it has not.  We still have the situation that foreigners are buying land all over the place, big farms.  There are no mountains that I know of in Kildare and Meath.  Yet these people are buying big farms there and in parts of County Dublin and other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that as and from 1st January next there will be a new <Col N="1293" /> situation.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party and some of the people from Fine Gael insisted that there would be no extra right given to foreigners in regard to the purchase of land on our entry into the EEC. Recent discussion in the House drew the attention of Deputies to the fact that there will be no restriction and that after 1st January it will not be possible to say to a man that he cannot buy land in Ireland because he is a German or a Dutchman.  You can stop him if he is not a farmer but if he can prove that he has been in farming there will be very little means of stopping him from buying land here.  This will not be a very great change because, as the Minister may not be aware, the purchase of land by foreigners has been continuous.</P>
    <P>Government speakers talk about the diminishing amount of land available for distribution and the fact that there is less land coming on the market.  This makes me smile when I think of all the land being snapped up by foreigners and by speculators who should never be allowed to buy land, people who, having bought it, do nothing with it for a year or two and then resell it at an enhanced price.</P>
    <P>I am not asking the Minister or the Land Commission to work miracles; I realise that they have to work within certain regulations but I would suggest that when a farm is acquired it should be divided within a reasonable time and in no case should it be held over for a period of years.  Deserving applicants, no matter who they are or who they vote for or whether they vote at all are entitled to consideration in the distribution of that land.  An effort should be made to reach agreement.  At least an explanation should be given of what is happening to the local persons interested in land who in the main are a branch of the local Land League.  They are not bad fellows.  They are not the terrible people that some people try to make them out to be.  I find them very decent.  A great many of them support Fianna Fáil.  Why, I do not know. These people should be listened to. They have a point of view.  They know their subject.  They should be encouraged. <Col N="1294" /> It is the wrong way to treat them to make semi-outlaws of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred to wild life and mentioned in particular deer &mdash;the four legged variety.  I should like to wish him well in his effort to spread the deer throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Haughey will be successful because I understand the herd in the Phoenix Park is due for another slaughtering and it would be a great idea, instead of slaughtering deer, to bring them to other places. There is some fear about deer damaging plantations but it would be a good idea to bring superflous deer from the Phoenix Park to other suitable places.</P>
      <P>My experience of the Department of Lands and particularly of the Minister is that they have been most courteous.  While I have been severely critical of the system, which is wrong and which needs changing, the Minister himself said some time ago that there was no place for the Department of Lands and that it should be incorporated with another Department. I would put it the other way round&mdash; if we had some other Department incorporated with the Department of Lands under the present Minister we might eventually be able to make a good job of both of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with two major areas in regard to the implementation of the EEC policy which is embodied in two Community directives&mdash;72/159 EEC of 17th April, 1972 and 72/160 EEC of 17th April, 1972.  The Minister has given very little information about the proposed implementation of these directives.  I am sure he is as aware as I am that these directives must be implemented by April of next year and that their implementation implies very extensive action by the Government here in drawing up the detailed regulations. If these directives are not implemented we run the risk of not getting substantial sums of money that we are entitled to.  If the Government wish to get this money for the country, they must get these directives approved and have them in operation by April of next year.  If they are to be approved by the EEC and put into action in this country by April of next year the Government here will have to move very fast indeed.  There is not the slightest evidence that they are moving.  Naturally enough any scheme to implement these directives, before being submitted, will have to be discussed with the farming organisations. It may involve legislation in this House, repeal or amendment of Land Acts and when it is submitted to Brussels, we may find that it is not quite satisfactory and has to be sent back for further consideration. The whole process has to be gone through again when the redraft is being submitted and all this has to be done before April, 1973.</P>
      <P>I can quote to illustrate my point from the directive on the Encouragement to Cease Farming and Allocation of Agricultural Land for the use of the Improvement of Agricultural Structures.  This directive went through on 17th April, 1972, and it says in Article 17:</P>
      <P>Member States shall bring into force the measures necessary to conform with the provisions of this Directive within a period of one year from the date of its notification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At no time has any Minister suggested that we would not be coming in under this provision.  In relation to a number <Col N="1296" /> of questions which I put to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries which applied to his ministry as well as Lands, he and his Parliamentary Secretary said that the directive would be coming into operation here in April of the coming year, that is, three or four months from now.</P>
    <P>Articles 8 and 9&mdash;it is no harm to read them on to the record&mdash;set out what the Government have to do before April, 1973, within the next three months, in respect of these directives. Article 8 says&mdash;this has to be done between now and April if we are to get the money which the Government want &mdash;sets out:</P>
    <P>Members States shall forward to the Commission:</P>
    <P>the drafts of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions which they plan to adopt in pursuance of this directive;</P>
    <P>provisions enabling this directive to be implemented which precede its date of entry into force.</P>
    <P>Part II of that Article sets out:</P>
    <P>When submitting the drafts of laws, regulations or administrative provisions already in force which are provided for in paragraph 1 Member States shall explain the connection existing at regional level between on the one hand the measure in question and on the other hand the economic situation and the characteristics of the agricultural structure.</P>
    <P>Part III sets out:</P>
    <P>The Commission shall examine the drafts forwarded in accordance with the first indented paragraph 1 to determine whether, on the basis of their compliance with this directive and taking account of its objectives and the necessary connection between the various measures, the conditions for financial participation by the Community in the common measure referred to in Article 6 have been met. Within two months of receiving the drafts the Commission shall deliver an Opinion on this subject after consultation with the Standing Committee on Agricultural Structures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> This is to come into effect in April. After the submission of these drafts, which has to take place long before it comes into effect, the Commission will have two months in which to decide their opinion and come back on it.  In other words, subtracting two months, we would have to have our proposals in at least by February if we are to give the Commission two months to come back to us on this issue and we probably would have to have them in by January.</P>
    <P>Part IV of Article 8 sets out:</P>
    <P>Member States shall inform the Commission of the legislative or administrative provisions referred to in paragraph 3 as soon as they are adopted.</P>
    <P>That is all right: it is after the event.</P>
    <P>Article 9, which is not as long, states:</P>
    <P>1.  With regard to the provisions of which it is informed in accordance with the second indent of the first paragraph of Article 8 and paragraph 4, the Commission shall examine whether, on the basis of their compliance with this Directive and taking into account its objectives and the necessary connection between the various measures, the conditions for financial participation by the Community in the common measures referred to in Article 6 have been met.  Within two months of receiving the communication, the Commission representative, after consulting the EAGGF Committee on the financial aspects, shall submit a draft Decision on this subject to the Standing Committee on Agricultural Structures.</P>
    <P>2.  The Committee shall issue its opinion within a time limit to be fixed by the Chairman according to the urgency of the matters under examination.  It shall decide by a majority of twelve votes, the votes of Member States being weighted as laid down in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty.  The Chairman shall not vote.</P>
    <P>All this has to happen after we submit our proposal and before April of next year because it speaks later on in Article 17, as I said, of Member States <Col N="1298" /> bringing into force the measures necessary to conform with the provisions of the directives within a period of one year from the date of its notification.  All this has to be done in the next four months.  We have heard nothing whatever&mdash;I withdraw that statement; it is not quite true.  At least at this stage the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, should have spelled out in detail to this House and the farming organisations the precise nature of the proposals which they propose to submit in order to benefit from these directives.  They have not done so, and as a result there is no opportunity for farming organisations and other bodies to discuss the proposals, as to whether or not the Government's interpretation of the directive is correct and whether or not they could adopt a different interpretation because there is a very wide area of discretion left to the Government in regard to this interpretation. To my knowledge, there has been no consultation, even in general let alone on the basis of a precise proposal with the farming organisations in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Irish Agricultural Advisers Organisation sought a meeting with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and presumably the Department of Lands, on this matter and to the best of my knowledge, have not received any satisfaction as yet.  The legislation has been circulated only in the past month to the county committees of agriculture and yet they are supposed to be in a position to bring this into effect next April.  Before they can do so, the Government have to bring in their detailed proposals implementing the directive.  The directive which has been circulated is phrased in very general terms, leaving very wide areas of discretion to the Government. Even the general directive has only recently been submitted&mdash;in the last month&mdash;to the county committees.</P>
    <P>My party and the Minister's party went out in the EEC campaign and told the farmers that there was money to be got for improving agricultural structures.  That was some months ago <Col N="1299" /> and the decision was taken on 10th May.  To my knowledge, the Government have done little or nothing since about getting that money and I am illustrating a very concrete example of where action should and could have been taken to get it.  We could have our proposals in and could be at a very advanced stage in preparing them; we could have them in operation by next April, if the Minister for Lands is doing his job.  Quite clearly he is not and quite clearly the promises which his party and my party made in regard to getting money from the EEC next year are not going to be realised to the extent they should be because of the inactivity of the Government.  This, to my mind, is a very serious question indeed and I do not honestly understand the lethargy of the Minister and the Department in regard to it.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer in some greater detail to the particular contents of these directives and to some of the difficulties which I foresee in their interpretation.  It is very late in the day for people to be pointing out defects in relation to these because they are supposed to be coming into effect next April, but it is better late than never, and it may well be that some of the points I will raise will be obviously wrong but the point is that I would not be making them if the Government had spelled out the specific provisions under these directives which would have ruled out any such misunderstandings.</P>
    <P>In relation to Directive 72/160&mdash; Encouragement to Cease Farming and the Allocation of Agricultural Land and the Use and the Improvement of Agricultural Structures, it says in Article 10, subsection (2)&mdash;this is in relation to the EEC's financing of these proposals&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Guidance Section of the EAGGF.</P>
    <P>which is the European Agricultural Guidance Fund</P>
    <P>shall refund 25% of the eligible expenditure to Member States.</P>
    <P>This is expenditure on schemes to provide with pensions farmers who will <Col N="1300" /> give up their lands in order to have it given to other farmers with development plans.  These are older farmers who voluntarily opt to retire and can be given a pension which will be partly funded by the European Fund.  It continues:</P>
    <P>However, in agricultural regions in which unfavourable conditions exist and in which measures of encouragement to cease farming are not yet being applied on the date when this Directive takes effect, the Guidance Section of the EAGGF shall refund at 65% of the eligible expenditure.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) says:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the preceding paragraph, agricultural regions in which unfavourable conditions exist shall mean regions which conform simultaneously with the two following criteria:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the percentage of the active agricultural population engaged in agriculture must be higher than the Community average;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the gross domestic product at factor cost per inhabitant must be lower than the Community average.</P>
    <P>The Council shall draw up the list of the regions on a proposal from the Commission and in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>This sets out the procedure whereby it may be decided whether or not for these particular proposals which we will be introducing we will be getting 65 per cent aid in relation to particular areas or just 25 per cent.  I think the Minister has on occasion stated that he was confident that the bulk of Ireland would, under the criteria outlined there, qualify for the 65 per cent aid because the percentage of the active agricultural population was higher than the Community average and the gross domestic product was lower than the Community average.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this must be decided not by us but by the Council of Ministers on a proposal from the Commission. I would like to know what is the present position with regard to this <Col N="1301" /> matter.  Have the Council of Ministers a proposal before them in relation to Ireland in regard to this matter and, if they have not, when is such a proposal likely to be put before them?  If we are to bring this into operation in the near future we will need to know when doing so how much funding we are going to get from Brussels because this will, to some degree, determine the extent and scale of the operation.  If we are only going to get 25 per cent for large areas we will possibly not spend as much whereas if we are to get 65 per cent we will probably be a little bit more flaithiúlach. If the Minister is proceeding with this matter he should get a decision as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to articles 2 and 3 which I frankly do not understand. They are extremely complicated. They set out those people who will qualify for the pension I am talking about and which will be replacing the scheme we already have here which has not been a success.  The reason why I think the Community scheme will be a success, while ours has not been, is that in relation to the Community proposal the farmer who retires will not only get the pension which will be subsidised by the State but in addition will get the sale price of the holding or the letting value of the holding and when the letting period is over it will, presumably revert to his family.  The proposal we have had here is much more limited in so far as he sells the holding to the Land Commission and the pension he gets comes out of the sale price and there is nothing in addition.  Under the EEC proposal he can sell it or lease it to any development farmer in the area.  My reading of this is that there would be quite a large number of development farmers in any given area and, therefore, he would have quite a wide choice.  There would be a certain amount of competition and he would get quite a good price.  The EEC proposal will be much more attractive than the one we have at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This was referred to in the Scully Report.  We have a very big problem in this regard.  Much of the land in the country is held by people who are single, without successors and over 55.  They have no incentive to be very active farmers or to be investing in or trying to improve their land.  They have no incentive either to get rid of it so they just sit on the land.  They are unhappy and other people locally cannot get it.  This would offer the opportunity of releasing a substantial amount of land.</P>
      <P>Coming back to this directive, I think it is the case in practically every country on the Continent that farmers are covered by social security whereas our farmers are not.  It states at paragraph 3 of article 2:</P>
      <P>Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that the social security benefits which recipients of the indemnity or of the premium provided for in paragraph 1 would have received had they not left farming, are not reduced, and that the contributions made by those persons to social security funds are not unduly increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the directive may have been framed with a view to Continental practice where in addition to whatever people might get in pension they will qualify for social security as well.  We do not have social security covering farmers except for the noncontributory old age pension but this proposal applies to people from 55 on and it is only at 70 that people come into the old age pension category and this specifically excludes people over 65.  The European proposal is framed with a view to there being social security in addition to whatever is given. We do not have it.  Does this mean that the attractiveness of the scheme here will be to some extent diminished and, if so, what does the Minister propose to do?  Does he propose to extend <Col N="1303" /> social security to farmers?  I do not know whether that would be good or not or whether it would be welcomed by them.  I am not sure they would be too keen to pay the contribution. However, I should like to have the Minister's comments on whether there is a difficulty here and, if so, how he proposes to tackle it.</P>
    <P>We should examine our consciences carefully with regard to the failure of our existing scheme.  In France they have a scheme somewhat similar to that adopted here, namely, the granting of a pension to farmers who wish to retire.  The scheme in operation in France benefits 75,000 persons yearly and secures the release of more than one million hectares annually; when one considers one hectare is equivalent to 2½ acres one can realise the area of land involved.  In this way a vast amount of land is being transferred from older people, who may not be making optimum use of it, to younger people.  We should ask ourselves why the scheme has been such a success in France when our scheme has not been so successful.</P>
    <P>I would recommend Deputies to read the OECD documents which give comparisons for various countries in the way they approach this problem.  In passing, I should like to point out that the OECD documents are not circulated to Deputies; they should be circulated at least to Deputies who are spokesmen for the particular area mentioned in each report. With regard to the OECD document on lands, Deputy L'Estrange, Deputy Tully and myself who have a specific interest in this matter should have been supplied with that document.</P>
    <P>The other directive is more complicated and more wide-ranging.  It sets out to establish a scheme somewhat similar to the small farms incentive bonus scheme in that farmers who plan to carry out developments during six years will get cheap credit from a fund partly financed by the EEC and they will get priority with regard to any land that is released under the directive to which I referred. The Minister has stated that this new system of development plans <Col N="1304" /> will simply copperfasten the existing system of land allocation and he stated that the progressive farmer will have the evidence of his development plan put before the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the implementation of these directives will not require a much more fundamental rethinking of the Land Commission allocation policy.  If the 45-acre maximum will have to go, will it not be the case that in future land allocation will be made only to farmers who have development plans as envisaged in the directive?  The Irish Farmers' Association stated in their policy documents that they considered land should be given to farmers who are prepared to enter into a development plan for the enlarged farm during a period of six or eight years, rather than giving a small amount of land to the maximum number of people.  Land should be given to farmers who are prepared to set out exactly how they will use it and who will pin themselves down to participating in a development plan scheme.</P>
    <P>These development plans possibly will be the only way whereby money can be given to farmers for improvement of their lands.  There is a possibility that farm buildings grants and other aids to farmers will be reviewed by the Commission and may have to cease.  Such aids may be available only to farmers who participate in these plans and they may be given in the form of credit rather than by way of grants.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that there will be a tremendous increase in the number of people who will be involved in these plans and a mass of information will be available from the results of the records of the participants.  This kind of information is not available to the Land Commission at the moment. When they allocate land the inspector merely counts the number of cattle and poultry and he makes an assessment from a simple observation as to whether the farmer has the capacity to utilise to the full any additional land.  As a result of the development plans there will be a greater amount of information available and account will also be taken of the farmer's plans <Col N="1305" /> which will have involved him in undertaking loan commitments and his projections for development of the farm for five or six years ahead.  Perhaps the Land Commission policy should be changed so that land would be given to those people who are prepared to commit themselves to the kind of development plan that is envisaged here.</P>
    <P>I do not think the 45 acre maximum is realistic.  In fact, I do not think the criterion for deciding if a farmer should get more land should be the acres he has but should be in terms of the plan he is prepared to put forward for utilisation of the land.  It would be ridiculous to say that the Land Commission should give land to big farmers but a farmer who has heavy liabilities should be considered and undue regard should not be given to the number of acres he owns.</P>
    <P>When the French equivalent of the Land Commission allocate land, the average holding created is about 90 acres or 38.1 hectares.  In France there is a greater proportion of small farms than exist here and France is a country that is functioning within the EEC. We should examine the 45-acre maximum that applies here and consider whether it should be changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is fair.  They have criticisms to make of part-time farming.  These directives are, of course, drawn up in a Continental context which may not apply here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says this particular <Col N="1306" /> directive will have a very great effect on future land allocation policy and on the operation of the Land Commission. There are several questions which arise on its applicability. Article 2 states:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this directive holdings shall be considered suitable for development</P>
    <P>1 in which the farmer:</P>
    <P>(a)  practises farming as his main occupation,</P>
    <P>(b)  has adequate vocational ability,</P>
    <P>(c)  undertakes to keep accounts as defined in Article 11 from the start of the development plan,</P>
    <P>(d)  draws up a plan for the development of the enterprise which fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 4:</P>
    <P>What has the Minister in mind from the point of view of determining whether or not a farmer has an adequate education and ability?  If interpreted rigidly, this could mean a farmer would have to have at least a year in an agricultural college, or something like that.  Clearly that is just not on because most farmers would not have the opportunity of a year in an agricultural college.  This, therefore, would have to be interpreted fairly generously.  On the other hand, there has to be some sort of objective criterion.  If it is to have any meaning at all, one just cannot stipulate &ldquo;every farmer&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision for the exceptional situation.  How will all this be implemented?  Part II states that the farmer must practise farming as his main occupation.  It is fairly easy to determine whether or not farming is a man's permanent occupation on the Continent because income tax records are available and one can, therefore, determine whether a man is earning more from farming than he is from some other occupation.  Here, we do not have income tax and until such time as something is done about the rates I do not see any case for introducing this, but it is important to determine whether or not it will be easy to implement this and decide whether or not farming is a man's main occupation.  The Minister should look into the criteria available here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a provision here whereby member states may vary the amount of the financial subventions and they may also refrain from complying in certain regions with all or some of the measures.  This is supposed to come into effect next April but the Government are doing nothing about implementing it next April and getting whatever money would be available for us.  It is very important that the Government should spell out to which regions this will apply.  Will <Col N="1308" /> it apply to the whole country and will the same terms apply all over the country?  This information will have to be made available if farmers are to enter into these plans.  Farmers must plan ahead and they will want to know the terms upon which this scheme will be available to them next April.  The Government so far have given no information about it. That is an omission that must be made good.</P>
    <P>Under Article 13 there are certain aids which can be introduced within the framework of irrigation and land reallocation programmes.  The Government will be able to claim some money for these programmes as an initial step towards development.  Why is drainage not included?  Why is this confined to irrigation?  Irrigation is getting water on to the land; drainage is getting water out of the land.  We do not need irrigation, but we certainly need drainage.  The Minister should seek an amendment to this directive so that money will be available for drainage, drainage which might be carried out in the context of some land reallocation programme.</P>
    <P>I am a little worried as to what farmers will be eligible.  If there is a very rigid interpretation of the directive it is possible that these development proposals might apply only to big farmers.  That would be a bad thing.  It is very important that the directive should be interpreted to include small farmers.  I am particularly worried by something Deputy Tully&mdash;&mdash;</P>
