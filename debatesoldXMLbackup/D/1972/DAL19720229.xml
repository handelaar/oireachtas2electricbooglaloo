      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, having regard to the large number of existing and future draft rules, regulations and directives of the European Communities, he will agree to the establishment of an all-party permanent committee of the Dáil to study the existing body of the Communities' legislation and future draft amendments and addenda, so that the Dáil may make comments and proposals thereon as the need may arise and thereby continue its prime function as a legislative body; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of procedures to facilitate the examination by the Oireachtas of Community legislation and, in particular, proposals for new legislation, is receiving attention. It is my intention at the appropriate time to seek the views of the other political parties on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that this is a very urgent matter, that there is a vast number of rules and regulations and a vast amount of legislation, actual or intended, building up in Brussels, and that it is highly desirable that this House, as one of the legislative arms of the State&mdash;the Seanad is the other&mdash;should be aware in advance of all that is even contemplated? This is essential if our function as legislators is to continue in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the considerable evidence of continuing brutality towards and ill-treatment of detainees and internees in Northern Ireland, the Government will as a matter of urgency make a further complaint to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe for transmission to the European Commission of Human Rights in respect of such incidents of ill-treatment as have come to notice since the original complaint.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Government proposes to bring to the notice of the International Court of Justice or other international body the illegality of the imprisonment of persons aboard the <i>Maidstone</i> at Belfast in purported exercise of the provisions of the Special Powers Acts in Northern Ireland having regard to the fact that the ship in question is beyond the limits of the area of Northern Ireland as defined by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920; and if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>On the 23rd February, the Government forwarded to the Secretary of the European Commission of Human Rights an application supplementary to that lodged on the 15th December, 1971, concerning further continuing breaches by the British Government of Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Material in relation to the Derry deaths was included.  The matter remains <i>sub judice</i> and it would therefore be inappropriate for me to give further details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in the Council of Europe Press release relating to our original application, we submit that the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act, Northern Ireland, 1922, and the connecting Statutory rules, regulations and orders are in themselves a failure by the British Government to comply with the obligation in Article 1 of the European <Col N="511" /> Convention on Human Rights and it is not now proposed to raise the matter at another forum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be disrespectful to the Taoiseach but I am sure he will agree with me that his answer is too clever by half.  Question No. 3 does not refer to the European Commission of Human Rights.  What it is concerned with is the legislative jurisdiction of the Stormont Parliament and the British Parliament.  The 1920 Act defines the Six Counties of Northern Ireland as being parliamentary counties and the point at issue in Question No. 3 is that the <i>Maidstone</i> is outside the parliamentary counties and parliamentary boroughs of Northern Ireland and, accordingly, the Special Powers Act does not run there. Would the Taoiseach be good enough to deal with that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 3 also deals with the imprisonment of persons on board the <i>Maidstone</i> and I want to assure the Deputy that these persons are within the ambit of the case we have submitted to the Commission. With regard to the second point the Deputy raised, it can be contended that by omission of reference to the territorial seas in the 1920 Act that they do not form part of the territory of Northern Ireland.  However, I am told that the contrary contention can also be made, and it is not for me to judge between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that it is not the function of the Taoiseach to judge, but would he not consider the importance of referring the matter to the International Court of Justice?  There is further support for this contention in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which was a treaty between Britain and all Ireland, and the section that was given the right to opt out of the Irish State was only that section within the six north-eastern parliamentary counties and boroughs within the high-water mark of Northern Ireland.  This now puts the <i>Maidstone</i> in the territorial waters of this State. This is a matter of constitutional, international law and it must be determined as a matter of extreme urgency in the International Court of Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to argue that by way of question and answer across the floor of the House.  However, I want to assure the Deputy that the imprisonment and treatment of persons on board the <i>Maidstone</i> are matters which will be considered in the course of our application to the Commission of Human Rights.  The other matter is perhaps separate to it but it is not my present intention to raise it as a matter of international law or interpretation of international law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i> asked the Taoiseach if he will arrange that prosecutions in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court will be conducted by solicitors; how many additional solicitors in the Chief State Solicitor's Office will be necessary to discharge the work in place of barristers; and if he will recruit the necessary additional solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Prosecutions are dealt with by the Attorney General in the exercise of his functions under Article 30 of the Constitution.  The arrangements for nominating counsel to conduct prosecutions or having them done by a solicitor is a matter for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I take it the Taoiseach is aware of the Courts of Justice Act which was recently passed and which conferred a right of audience on solicitors in all courts in the land?  Would the Taoiseach think that the practice of practically excluding solicitors from prosecutions in the Metropolitan District Court is contrary to the spirit of the Act?  Is the Taoiseach aware that in the last year for which figures are available, junior barristers were paid a sum of more than £17,000 for <Col N="513" /> appearing in the district court?  Is the Taoiseach aware that some people who bring these prosecutions believe they would be much more efficiently conducted by full-time solicitors in the Chief State Solicitor's Office who are trained and engaged in this kind of work, rather than by giving them at the last moment to very inexperienced barristers?  This is the practice that prevails at the moment.  Finally, is the Taoiseach aware that many Garda officers who are responsible for bringing these prosecutions are dissatisfied with the way the prosecutions are conducted in court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place I am not aware that Garda officers are dissatisfied with the manner in which prosecutions are brought now.  If the Deputy contends that, let him produce some proof of it and the matter will be investigated.  The recent Courts of Justice Act conferred no higher right as regards prosecutions in the District and Circuit Courts on solicitors than they already had.  With regard to the suggestion that fees amounting to £17,000 were paid to barristers, I do not know if that is the case.  I have not looked at the figure recently.  Perhaps it is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not contend in any way that cases could be better <Col N="514" /> brought and more effectively brought by solicitors than by barristers.  Again I want to say that it is a matter entirely for the Attorney General whom to employ in the prosecution of these District Court cases, or any cases for that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> My reference to the Courts of Justice Act was meant to suggest to the Taoiseach that that Act conferred a right of audience on solicitors in every court up to the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This would suggest to me that the idea was that solicitors should be encouraged to practice in all these courts and that this practice of instructing barristers in every-fiddling case in the District Court seems to be entirely contrary to the spirit of that Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will specify precisely the additional health benefits obtained by a person who is adequately insured for free hospital services under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme in respect of the annual sum of £7 which such person is now required to contribute towards the national health schemes; and in particular to what extent this such contribution affects person's voluntary health scheme position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the introduction on 1st October last of the scheme of health contributions for persons with limited eligibility for health services the charge of up to 50p per day for in-patient hospital care and the charges for outpatient specialist services were dropped.  From the same date provisions applicable to persons in this group were introduced which made available free drugs and medicines for patients with certain specified long-term conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a comparison between the benefits available under the Health Acts to a person in the limited eligibility category and those to which he would be entitled under the Voluntary Health Insurance Board schemes, the main point of difference is that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board's coverage is of necessity limited since the board must have regard to actuarial limits.  Thus the board imposes limits on the duration and cost of hospital care for which it will accept liability; maternity care is excluded except in certain abnormal circumstances and medical conditions which were present before entering insurance <Col N="520" /> and likely to occur again are not covered.  Similarly there are restrictions in regard to payment for medicines used outside hospital.</P>
    <P>The dropping of the charges for hospital treatment for persons with limited eligibility will mean that persons in this category who voluntarily insure themselves will not need coverage to the same extent as heretofore. The Voluntary Health Insurance Board will be glad to advise persons in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What it boils down to is this, that persons could reduce the number of units they had in order to get free hospitalisation in cases other than maternity, if they were within the voluntary health insurance scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing a subscriber did not vary the amount of his subscription and, in other words, retained the same number of units in future as in the past, can such a person get additional benefits from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board?  Could the person be in hospital for a longer period than formerly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>Ireland has ratified the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954.  The purpose of that Convention is to reduce the risk of pollution of the sea by oil discharged from ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three other Conventions dealing with different aspects of pollution of the sea by oil.  The International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969, enables a coastal State to intervene and take measures to protect its coastal and other related interests whenever a casualty, which threatened oil pollution, occurs.  The <Col N="527" /> other Conventions concerned are the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, and the International Convention of the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971.  These latter Conventions are concerned with the determination of liability for oil pollution damage and the provision of adequate compensation in such cases. The preparation of the necessary legislation to enable this country to ratify these three Conventions is in hands.</P>
    <P>In addition to the aforementioned Conventions on pollution of the sea by oil, a Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft was recently opened for signature at Oslo.  As indicated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his reply today to a Parliamentary Question on that particular Convention, the question of ratifying it is being examined in my Department and the other Departments concerned.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the Board of Works informed Cavan County Council in 1969 that the design for a scheme for the drainage of the Erne was completed at that stage?

      <P>This matter is under a complete review.  It is true that the part of the Erne that is entirely within the Twenty-six Counties was undertaken. Under the present method of assessment draining this land would be most expensive&mdash;at that time it was £168.7 per acre&mdash;and more than would be normally acceptable, but in view of the fact that it would benefit the Counties of Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan it is possible that the Government would look at it in a special light.

      <P>This question was examined some years ago and it was considered by the Board of Works and the Government at that time that this would be better utilised by the municipal authorities.  We have two parks in Dublin at present, St. Stephen's Green and the Phoenix Park and it was felt that the local authority would be the most suitable body to deal with it. Although it has nothing to do with me I have often thought that if the Archbishop were to negotiate with the Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral it might be possible to make a deal which would enable him to release Merrion Square.  That has nothing to do with me.</P>

I am aware that scheme was only finalised about six months ago but surely the Minister's officials should have been aware that the scheme was in progress and should have been making arrangements?

      <P>With the restoration of the planting programme to 25,000 acres, a further 500 acres was added to the programme in Donegal and an additional 200 acres in Tipperary. The lack of plantable reserve did not permit of any increase in the programme in Waterford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>County Donegal was declared brucellosis free in June, 1968, and Counties Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan were declared brucellosis free in March, 1970.  Check testing continues in these counties to ensure that the position remains satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Eradication measures were introduced in Counties Louth, Mayo, Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath, Meath and north-west Offaly during 1970-71. The first round of testing is nearing completion in County Meath and the second round will soon finish in County Mayo.  In the other four counties and in north-west Offaly, the second round of testing has been in progress since January.</P>
      <P>Brucellosis eradication has not yet been extended to the remainder of Offaly or to Laois.</P>
      <P>A series of milk ring tests on individual deliveries to creameries and other collecting centres was initiated last year in the counties, including most of Offaly, or where the eradication scheme is not yet operating.  Two rounds of tests were completed and approximately 70 per cent of the 61,000 herds concerned passed the two tests.  It is intended to continue with this programme and each herd which passes two consecutive tests will be furnished with a certificate.  Special sales confined to animals from these herds are being organised by the marts.</P>
      <P>The heifer vaccination scheme is operated in 11 counties of the east and south where eradication measures mav not commence for some time.  The scheme commenced in March, 1969, and by the end of 1971 more than 326,000 heifers had been vaccinated with the killed 45/20 vaccine, free of charge to the owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of 1971, there were 99 applicants for the voluntary brucellosis scheme under which herd owners <Col N="541" /> outside the eradication area are given headage grants for the removal of reactors from their herds.  The Brucellosis (Certified) Herds Scheme has met with little response.  So far only seven herds have qualified for registration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary state when he expects to introduce the long promised compensation for those producers in high intensive milk production in the clearance areas who, as a result of the brucellosis eradication scheme, have suffered exceptional loss; secondly, would he state whether he considers 99 applicants under the voluntary eradication scheme in the non-clearance areas to be a successful rate of application?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries how much of the £2,550,000 voted under subhead E.2 of the Estimate for his Department for 1971-72 has been spent; and if he will use any surplus to assist the meat factories in their immediate and severe difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As against the estimated expenditure of £2,550,000 mentioned, there was an estimated appropriation-in-aid of £1,500,000 in respect of receipts from the UK Government.  The actual expenditure to the end of February has been approximately £1,500,000 but the appropriation-in-aid is not now expected to be more than approximately £650,000.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to what I said on 23rd February in reply to a question by Deputy Clinton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the Minister promised there would be an announcement in relation to the second part of the question this week?  Can he tell us when this announcement will be made and, further, can he tell me exactly how much money is to spare under subhead E.2?  I do not understand the various terms which the Parliamentary Secretary used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the second part of the question first, it is not expected that there will be any surplus under subhead E.2.  I do not agree that the Minister said there would be an announcement this week because he is giving this matter his urgent attention and consultations are still going on. What the Minister said in reply to a parliamentary question was that this announcement would be made as quickly as possible.  That is the position still.</P>

    <P>NOTE: Imports of the products to which quantitative controls apply are permitted under licence to such extent and at such time as adequate home produced supplies are not available and, in the case of tomatoes, for a relatively small annual quantity as provided for under the Free Trade Area Agreement.  That Agreement also provides for certain duty concessions on specified quantities of apples and ryegrass seed imported from the UK.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Second Part of Question:</i>
    </P>
    <P>The arrangements for reducing our duties on fruits and vegetables in the context of EEC are set out in paragraph 166 of the Appendix to the White Paper on the Accession of Ireland to the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The special arrangements for the application of a compensatory amounts system to apples and tomatoes are set out in paragraph 167 of that Appendix.  The compensatory amounts, which will apply wherever they are higher than our customs duties, will be phased out by means of five equal annual reductions, commencing on 1st January, 1974; they will operate only in the periods from end of August to end of the following May for apples and from June to November for tomatoes.</P>
    <P>Reduction of the duty on ryegrass seed will be phased in accordance with the timetable referred to at (c) in paragraph 124 of the Appendix, i.e., five equal reductions, which will take place on 1st July in 1973, on 1st January in 1974, 1975 and 1976; and on 1st July in 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce when An Coimisiún Dumpála received complaints about the dumping of fertilisers into this country; and when he expects there will be a report and recommendations from An Coimisiún.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since their establishment An Coimisiún Dumpála have received and considered nine complaints about the dumping of fertiliser.  In all but one case An Coimisiún have reported to me and in accordance with their recommendations anti-dumping duties have been imposed and are still in force on calcium ammonium nitrate imported from Portugal and urea imported from Portugal, Romania and Poland.  Provisional duties on imports of urea from Holland, Belgium and West Germany imposed while investigations were in progress were terminated on the recommendation of An Coimisiún.</P>
      <P>The complaint at present being examined by An Coimisiún relates to a rather limited area where the imports are required specifically for manufacturing processes in this country. While this complaint has been the subject of enquiries by the commission since 5th November, 1971, I understand that the matter is one which raises particularly complex issues.  The commission expect, however, to make a report to me in the matter in the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the amount of urea fertiliser imported into this country over the past two years and the reason for such importation in view of the adverse effect on Irish fertiliser factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Central Statistics Office that imports of urea in the year 1970 amounted to 393,343 cwts. valued at £517,929.  Provisional figures for 1971 indicate that 610,184 cwts of urea valued £854,863 were imported in that year.</P>
      <P>As regards the reason for these imports, I understand that urea is a cheap form of nitrogenous fertiliser and that there is an increasing demand for it by the farming community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

There are discussions going on with representatives of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, my own Department, the importers, the compounders and the trade unions in this regard.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on the last occasion I had just given a brief summary of the general trend in education through the various levels of formal education here.  I want to develop that point in somewhat greater detail this afternoon.  Before doing so, I think I should start by making some general observations in case anything I would <Col N="560" /> omit or anything I would say would appear to give either a special priority to what I am saying or, in fact, appear to overlook what I might not mention.  It has to be remembered that above all else education is fundamentally concerned with the development of the human personality so that if today or on any other occasion I make special references to technological education, or any other aspect of it, I hope it will be clearly understood that one can never overlook or forget the most fundamental aim of education in every sphere.</P>
      <P>It is, in fact, a principle of education that it must concern itself, in whatever area it is dealing with, with the development of man's capacity to think and to make rational and informed judgments in whatever area he happens to be involved.  It is important to say this at this time when, perhaps, we have clearly spelled out in every area of our education, and of our education programme, this most fundamental priority.  There may have been signs at other times that education was as much concerned, particularly at some levels, with learning by rota, with developing the powers of retention and memory sometimes to the detriment of the development of the intellectual capacity.  These signs have now been obliterated.</P>
      <P>It is becoming more and more evident that at no time can you say that you have achieved the ultimate, that there is no more to be done either in the programme itself or in the development of the philosophy, and anyone who is in any contact with education at any level now will recognise that it is the hope and the determination of all concerned to develop this most important aspect, the capacity of the subject in education to think and to make these rational and informed judgments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I come back to the general observations I was making on the last day I would like to say that education is obviously a continuous process almost from the moment of the first observations of the young child to the end of man's life.  It does not end with the formal schooling period.  It is particularly important to note this in view of the importance of the concept of <Col N="561" /> continuous education which is being promoted very much at this time and which can only lead to a greater awareness in the community, at every level, of the function everyone must play in the community and the opportunity he has to make community life happier and more meaningful.</P>
    <P>I referred the last day to the five areas of education broadly so defined. There may be other areas as well and that is why I do not want to be taken as making a final definition or limiting by anything I may say the possibility of qualifications on these distinctions I intend to make here.  I mentioned the pre-school aspect and I spoke of post-primary, higher institutional and continuous education.  I want broadly to summarise the special emphasis in each of these areas having regard to the fundamental priority and principle of education in every area.</P>
    <P>If there is a special emphasis in the primary education section over that of any other it is, as has already been mentioned in this debate, that it is particularly child-centred.  It must at that time concentrate on developing the inquiring capacity of the child and the child's mind, and of helping him to understand the environment in which he lives and, in fact, developing his personality in relation to that environment and the place he will eventually fill in society.</P>
    <P>As one passes from that into the post-primary sector a slight change of emphasis occurs.  I want to mention in particular the fact that some years ago the primary certificate of education, as we knew it then, was abolished thereby clearly indicating that the emphasis on learning by rota at that level in primary schools was being changed.  Henceforth the pupil's achievement and record in the primary sector is noted by the teacher and communicated to the parents each year in the report. Equally important as that notification is the notification at the end of the period of primary education of the child's progress and aptitudes to the management and staff of the school he will enter in the post-primary sector.  This flow of information is very important.  So is the flow of information between the different sectors.  As the child moves <Col N="562" /> from one school to another the emphasis changes slightly but the system of communication as between schools operates definitely to the advantage of the child.</P>
    <P>In the post-primary sector the obvious significance is the acceptance of the principle of equal opportunity for all children in so far as that can be brought about within the resources of the State.  This involves equality in the range of subjects and facilities for study plus the same range in pass and honours courses.  The curriculum will have to be geared in such fashion as to enable the child to find his or her appropriate place for the purpose of realising to the fullest extent his or her particular capacity.  It goes without saying that pupils attending schools which are limited in courses of study are clearly at a disadvantage by comparison with those students attending schools in which the curriculum covers a wider range of subjects and, if the object is equal opportunity for all, then the child must be fully protected and, despite whatever reluctance there may be to introduce change, where a school is unable to provide children with that prospect of equal opportunity certain steps will have to be taken.  I shall come back to this later.</P>
    <P>Before one can provide full guidance within the school system and apply that guidance in the most effective way one must have the widest possible curriculum and the best possible standards.  When we come to university education, the institutes of technology and other third level institutions a new dimension comes into consideration.  Into the picture at this level the economic and social circumstances of the community enter.  If there is, for instance, a scarcity of graduates in some areas and a surplus in other areas that would be a matter of concern for the community.  For that reason it must also be a matter of concern for the Government, the Minister and the Department of Education and for the actual institutions themselves. I have referred to this on some occasions in the last year.  I have referred to the desirability of universities having regard to their responsibilities to the community.  There is a <Col N="563" /> desirable development in that the demand for third-level education is growing all the time.  We must remember, however, that this cannot be provided merely in accordance with the accommodation or the scope of studies existing in a particular institution at a particular time.  These will have to be reviewed continuously from the point of view of the outlets available for graduates, the needs of the community and the economic and social needs of the country.  Here, again, guidance in all its aspects must play a very important part.</P>
    <P>A new development is that of continuous and continuing adult education. It is recognised now that people must always be enabled to make the proper choice to accommodate themselves to changing conditions and to the potential they have to achieve something meaningful not just for themselves but for society as a whole. There is, as I said, an increase in adult education.</P>
    <P>There are common strands in our educational policy and programme. Some may argue that these common strands have not as yet been knit into a strong, unbreakable rope, but it is clear that very definite progress is being made in knitting these strands together and in strengthening them.  In the last ten years and, particularly, in the last five years there has been a marked increase in the development of educational facilities for every level.</P>
    <P>There is a new social awareness by the people that they have the capacity to achieve much more for themselves and for the community.  However, people sometimes forget, when making demands, be they for more school transport, better facilities, retention of small schools, or something else, that we, like every other country, have to work within limited resources.  Our earning capacity is limited and our pupil population is high in relation to our earning capacity and so we have to work within very limited resources indeed.  When I speak of equal opportunity for all, I am speaking of the ladder which we must climb.  We have not reached the top of it yet.  We have shown the direction in which we are <Col N="564" /> going.  In some areas in the primary sector there are obvious social disadvantages in the environment in which the children spend their pre-school years.  Young people must not be penalised for this.  This is a matter which must be of concern to us.  The children must be compensated in the first instance for the disadvantages of their environment.  This applies particularly in certain highly-populated areas, in places like Dublin.</P>
    <P>In recent times there has been special concern about a class that was not necessarily recognised as underprivileged ten years ago.  I speak of the slow-learners.  We all remember the slow-learners of our schooldays.  They were not looked upon as needing special attention.  Perhaps they were chastised for their failure to keep up with the standards prevailing in their classes.  Sometimes a boy or a girl did not return to school with a home exercise done as tidily or as effectively as the children coming from a home environment where there was concern for their education and an awareness of the benefits accruing from it.  The problems of such children may not have been fully recognised.  I do not blame anybody for this, but just mention the fact.  That is certainly not a characteristic in our primary education today.  The traditional home exercises have been greatly modified, so that no child has an advantage over another in its performance and in the results which he produces to the teacher the following morning.  Home exercises will always be an appropriate part of the educational system.</P>
    <P>Special attention has been paid to the pupil-teacher ratio in the classes for slow-learners.  We have seen impatience in the course of this debate about the pupil-teacher ratio in schools around Dublin.  There is clear evidence of the determination of the Minister and of the Department to improve the situation.  It is fairly evident that a programme of recruitment of new teachers and of the retraining of teachers who are not fully qualified is a constant characteristic of the Department's programme in order to provide as many qualified teachers as possible. We cannot cut down the number of <Col N="565" /> children, so far as possible we must increase the number of teachers.  This cannot be achieved overnight.  In the meantime the problems of slow-learners and such special cases are receiving particular consideration. Many teachers in the Dublin area will recognise that special consideration has been given to the pupil-teacher ratio problem as it affects such children. Special aids have been provided for such pupils.  I hope that Deputies will recognise what is being done as a first priority and will not be so unreasonable in their demands.  Extra teachers are needed to alleviate problems but few problems are of this pressing order.</P>
    <P>I referred previously to the child-centred curriculum.  I do not need to repeat what I have already said about education in the post-primary sector. We are concerned about the provision of the broadest possible range of studies in post-primary schools and the full development of the child and his capacity to go on to further education.</P>
    <P>Sometimes in dealing with primary and post-primary education, one comes across the inevitability of the rationalisation of the schools structure in a particular area.  In the primary sector in some cases this has meant the closing of some small schools and the opening of a bigger school in a rural area or the extension of a school, with better facilities.  I recall the emotional reaction of many parents in an area immediately adjoining a school that was to be closed.  This was a primary school.  I recall particularly their fears that the closing of the school was another step in the deprivation of rural Ireland.  Statements were made by representatives of this House at meetings. Sometimes such people had not given much thought to the educational criteria concerned but were more concerned about the electoral advantages which might accrue to themselves if they took a determined stand against the attitude of the Department of Education which, the people felt, had deprived them of their rights.</P>
    <P>That can happen in politics and may be one of the hazards which the Minister for Education has to face.  It was presented to the people as if it was the <Col N="566" /> job of the Minister to deprive and of others to protect their rights.  It is now clear that no areas claim that their community has been in any way deprived by the rationalisation of the primary school programme and by the provision of better units of education with better facilities for study.  In particular, it is recognised that the important thing is not whether the children go to a particular school in a particular area, or that the area still has a school, or that a particular part of a parish still retains its own identity, because it has its own school and its own creamery.  No, far from it.  The parents have now recognised that to talk in terms of retaining the integrity and identification of a part of a parish, or a parish, to the detriment of the educational opportunities of the children was certainly a totally confusing and misinformed approach to the whole question.</P>
    <P>I think the same can fairly be translated to the post-primary sector as well. I am quite satisfied, and I think every Deputy must be, that there are no areas now where this rationalisation programme may be undertaken because, for instance, the free transport scheme was brought in, free transport to what one might call the integrated school or the new centre pupils from an area where schools have been closed, but, over and above that, it is fairly evident that the old schools in these areas have as much as possible, and probably more than ever, played a significant part in community activity, and still do.  They may not be used as places of formal schooling now but more and more they are being used as community centres.  I have been very anxious to see an extension of this general trend and the Department have been very ready to make these old schools available to the community organisations for appropriate community activities, so that any question of the community being disadvantaged by the closing of the formal school as such is more than compensated for by increased educational opportunity for the child and the provision of community facilities in these schools.</P>
    <P>If that is true in the primary sector, it is even more true in the post-primary <Col N="567" /> sector, and I think we are going to meet a fair bit of this, not just next year but in the course of the next ten years, recognising, as we must, the limits of our resources and the right of every child, wherever he happens to be, to have the same type of education, the same range of studies, the same range of standards in pass and honours so that his capacity and potential will be fully realised.  We must recognise that some units as they exist at present are not in themselves viable units of education.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the teachers, the managers and the principals of these schools have not done a trojan job within the limitations of the situation in which they find themselves and I am certainly not suggesting that the communities in which these schools operate do not appreciate what has been done, and I go quite a long way to recognise that the community in which these schools operate are reluctant, and probably very reluctant, to see any change, particularly if that change involved the closure of any of these schools, for probably reasons of traditional loyalty, of traditional respect for the teachers in the school whom they know so well and for the feeling of identification they have with the school and the school with them.  For all these good and valid reasons, they have this fear and this feeling but, once again, if the proper consultations can be had and if everybody can open up his mind particularly to considering the most important thing, the right of the pupil, which is what the whole question of education is about, to giving the best possible scope for education, we would look at this in a more rational and probably less emotional way.</P>
    <P>I would hope that in the further development of this debate&mdash;the debate in that area and not merely the physical debate here, the debate over the next ten years&mdash;we would look at that aspect of it and we would not fool the people of the small towns or big villages by saying: &ldquo;We will keep that school for you&mdash;have no fear; you will get the full range of subjects up to leaving certificate.  Maybe there <Col N="568" /> are only 100 of you there, but you are still going to get them.&rdquo;  There is no point in fooling people on that basis because you cannot give these things to them on the same basis as that on which you can give them to the pupils attending a viable unit of education, and I would hope that Deputies would recognise that, as, indeed, I had to recognise it in my constituency and I would not try to seek the short term popularity for the sake of the long term right of the children.</P>
    <P>Obviously, this must be done after the fullest consultation, but be it said, after all that, that somebody is charged with the duty of making a decision and that somebody in the final analysis is the Minister.  The Minister when he makes a decision that is acceptable entirely to the local community, in the light of their attitude at the particular time, he is a fine fellow, but if he makes a decision which seems to differ from their immediate wishes, he is not such a fine felow.  I want to say also that the actual saving in money as a result of this rationalisation scheme is very small.  If anything, it may involve in many cases a net loss to the Exchequer and the Department because when you start to provide bus services over a new area and start providing an extension of facilities in the new schools, you find that it is not being done just for the sake of cutting or clipping the allocation of financial resources to this sector of education.</P>
    <P>Another clear characteristic of the modern educational development is the involvement of the community in total education.  Here, again, I know there is impatience and criticism because it is not being achieved overnight. It is well that there should be criticism and possibly it is well that these views should be expressed, particularly in relation to parents' rights and matters of that sort, but probably you might be moving from a time when community involvement in the whole educational process was very limited.  The formal involvement, apart from the informal which is always there, the informal consultation particularly as between teachers and school managers, is certainly a <Col N="569" /> new development and obviously is not something which is going to be achieved overnight and certainly not without some inhibitions and even opposition from various sources.</P>
    <P>Instances of this are particularly the development of the parent-teacher associations.  This, as everybody will recognise, is greatly encouraged by the Minister and the Department and the provision in this Estimate to which the Minister referred for teacher centres will even further facilitate that very desirable development.  Over and above that, there is in the new proposals for community schools a provision for parents on the management boards.  I do not want to go into further detail on that at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is part of the total principle &mdash; there are those who say that in Tallaght particularly, it should operate despite what the Minister has said about the difficulties of implementing it immediately &mdash; and the principle is and must be totally accepted.  The practical difficulties in implementing it in places where there is no existing school structure covering the total number of pupils, or, indeed, the parents of pupils attending the new unit, must be obvious to everyone who considers the matter and it is a very important aspect of the whole programme and particularly the programme for new schools, for comprehensive schools and, indeed, the new technical colleges which are very much a part of the new development in education, but I will come back to them later.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware of the general satisfaction there is with the management boards of these technical colleges and of the manner in which these boards pay particular attention, as, indeed, they are charged to do and as they are so effectively doing, to the social and economic environment of the particular area.  Here is a clear example of how the community can direct and advise the educational programme in a school.  This is one of the most significant developments and we should not have any doubts about it. In the rather heated atmosphere sometimes generated when this subject is discussed here I hope it will not be implied <Col N="570" /> that this is being done reluctantly, in the teeth of the opposition of the Minister or of the Government. That is not so and anyone who considers the matter will appreciate that this is a desirable development.</P>
    <P>Hand-in-hand with that goes the integration of the school in the community and this has been one of the most satisfactory developments.  The school is no longer a place that closes down at 4 o'clock or closes for the summer and Christmas holidays.  Nowadays its facilities, halls and playing fields are made available to responsible community organisations; it is only fair to say that they must be made available only to responsible organisations. I should like to repeat what I said with regard to recreational facilities. I have been more than encouraged by the reaction of the Sports Council, the National Youth Council and I have got from the various managers and principals with whom we have consulted with regard to their readiness to involve themselves in community activities. This is reflected in the way the community involves itself in the school programme.  For the school to be meaningful it must be an essential unit for the community and, in turn, the community can derive benefit and advantage from having a close association with the school.  This is an area in which we will see more significant developments.</P>
    <P>There is an important matter to which I should like to refer and I hope my remarks will not be interpreted as criticism.  It is becoming evident that anyone who involves himself in education, either as a teacher, a parent, as a member of a vocational committee, or a representative of the Department of Education, must be fully and adequately informed on educational criteria.  A person who has not the opportunity or capacity fully and adequately to inform himself in order to make a meaningful contribution to the development of education would do a great service to all if he channelled his talents in another direction. This is the wish of all involved in education and this fact must be stated.</P>
    <P>I am not making any comment on <Col N="571" /> what has happened up to the present or on the contributions that have been made.  However, the provision of schools by any organisation, committee, or by the Department is not the end of the story.  The provision of schools and buildings is but a steppingstone towards the development of the educational programme.  There must be an understanding of the child's place in education, of the teacher's place in communication with the child, of the parent's and the community's place in the school and <i>vice versa</i>.  The developments in education in this and other countries, having regard to our probable association with the EEC countries, are matters about which any person involved in education must inform himself.  It is a fundamental and moral obligation on that person to do so to the best of his capacity.  If he has not that opportunity he is hardly in a position to make reasoned and objective judgments on the educational programme and he may not be adding to the status and standing of the school in the community. Parents and pupils will be influenced by the attitudes of people concerned with education.  If some people make &ldquo;off-the-cuff&rdquo; remarks or ill-informed criticisms which may be printed in the local papers the attitude of the parent may be: &ldquo;That is not the kind of school that will give my child the education I want.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have said on many occasions at the opening of schools that it is the obligation of all concerned with education to ensure that they are well informed.  One must recognise the experience and commitment that can be given by many people in the various educational and advisory committees and I say this having regard to the great contributions that have been made.  I know we cannot all be fundamental philosophers in this area, much less experts in pedagogic training, but within the limits of our contribution we must be informed.</P>
    <P>The late President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, has been quoted to such an extent that what he has said may be regarded now as &ldquo;old hat&rdquo;.  However, some of his remarks <Col N="572" /> regarding education have hardly been noted before.  One of his remarks was: &ldquo;We must educate people today for a future in which the choices to be faced cannot be anticipated by even the wisest now among us.&rdquo;  It must be recognised that the future of those being educated may involve conditions that we cannot anticipate. Accordingly, we must give special attention to developing the pupil's capacity to make decisions for himself in the changing environment he will meet in his adult life, even in his future educational life.</P>
    <P>Even when the pupil leaves school to take up study at university he is not making the final decision.  He is never making the once-for-all decision that some people regard as being the business of guidance.  Some people consider that it is the job of those involved in guidance to tell the child: &ldquo;This is your job; here you will be happy and will stay for the rest of your life.&rdquo;  Experience has shown that in other, more developed societies, as society improves both socially and economically, and having regard to man's quest for change and his determination to fulfil himself, these factors impel him to make new choices quite frequently regarding his place and role in life.  Old jobs disappear with the rate of technological change and new jobs emerge.  Training organisations such as AnCO and continuous education may be of assistance but the most significant contribution must be made by the person himself.  For that reason, the decision should be made on prudent and rational grounds. This process must start at an early stage, particularly in post-primary education, in order to inform the child about the options open to him at any time.  He should be told that he may have inclinations in a certain direction and, if so, he should consult with his parents and with his teachers. He should probably give special attention to studies in Continental languages, not forgetting the necessity to take account of commercial subjects or whatever it might be.  I am thinking about such a notional situation here that I may not be making very helpful comments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> We must inform the child that life will not be so easy that, when he makes one decision, he has made his last decision, but that he will be making decisions regularly.  I am sure many of us have had to make decisions about changing jobs.  We have had to weigh up the situation: &ldquo;Do we change or do we stay?&rdquo;  If we want to have a happy and contented and, above all, a fruitful involvement in society for the product of education we must give special attention to the guidance programme.  I am glad to say that, in this sphere, very significant progress is being made and particularly in the post-primary sector. There is great scope for further progress in many other sectors and I will deal with that later at greater length.</P>
    <P>Within the post-primary sector in the Department of Education there are at present 17 full-time psychologists who are operating throughout the country on a regional basis.  I know that number is only a beginning and the people who are most conscious of this are the 17 themselves.  These psychologists operate in very close consultation and liaison with the teachers, and especially with the teachers who have been given special training in this area during the summer courses.  Last summer for two weeks in Bolton Street&mdash;and I was present at the opening of this course&mdash;over 100 principals of primary schools attended a course in pupil guidance.  Subsequently 120 other teachers attended a similar course and this was the third year they did so.</P>
    <P>Initially the question arose as to whether particular teachers should be trained to be particular specialists in this area and whether their sole function in the school would be the giving of advice and guidance to the pupils, and advice and assistance to the other teachers.  When this matter was considered with the teachers' organisation, and when an objective assessment was made, it was decided that this would not be the best way to approach it and that it would be much better to involve the greatest possible number of teachers in this development.</P>
    <P>The first condition one would require for a fruitful development in this <Col N="574" /> area would be the full-time and ready co-operation of the total teaching staff. If one more or less imposed a <i>deus ex machina</i> on a teaching staff and said: &ldquo;Here is your expert.  He will advise you in every direction.  He was one of you before but now he belongs to a rather different species&rdquo;, the question of human reaction would come into play.  The teachers would say: &ldquo;That may be his view of how that young boy or girl is shaping up but I know better.  I am with that pupil every day. I see the pupil's involvement with other pupils and his reaction to the subjects he is learning.  I am the expert.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, it was decided wisely that the teachers, who are the experts, should be given the opportunity of availing of these courses of study.  I am glad to say that this decision has been fully justified by the success of the programme.  Within each major unit &mdash; and it is our hope to extend this as much as possible to all school units at post-primary level&mdash;the teacher who is especially concerned with guidance, among his other teaching duties, plays a very important part in the staff/pupil relationship in the school in advising both staff and pupils with regard to potential and with regard to the problems of the pupil.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most significant developments that has emerged and, obviously, further progress will have to be made in that area.  Last term, from September until December, courses in remedial education for post-primary teachers were held in Dublin for all who could avail of them.  This is an area in which all of us are impatient for further development and I can only say that our impatience will not be a permanent condition.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that there are two Mayo representatives in the House because I had a very encouraging experience in Castlebar last year. Careers exhibitions have become very much a characteristic of the scene throughout the country with the involvement of trade unions, chambers of commerce, local authorities, <i>et cetera,</i> in the whole question and the whole programme of careers opportunities, they have become a very significant <Col N="575" /> part of the development in this whole area.  These careers exhibitions have been organised very widely. One of the most successful I attended last year was held in Castlebar.  They involve a very meaningful contact between the community at work and the child at school.  They also involve &mdash; and this is very important &mdash; a clear indication and proof to the child at school of the concern which the community at work have for him, for his present condition and for his future.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has had the opportunity of visiting any of these careers exhibitions will have seen that they have bridged the gap, if gap there be now, between the formal school and the community, the gap we are all anxious to see finally and ultimately bridged.  This is one aspect only of guidance.  In fact, it is a very limited and special aspect of it&mdash;the actual choice of career.  It shows that we can integrate the guidance programme with the environment in a particular area and the job opportunities that exist. Teachers, and particularly teachers who have special responsibility for guidance, were consulted about the planning of these exhibitions and also about the advice made available to the industrialists concerned and the pupils who consulted with the experts in attendance at these exhibitions.</P>
    <P>These careers exhibitions serve to remind the leaders in the community that they have a responsibility to the children at school in that community, a responsibility which until a comparatively recent time, was not accepted.  In part this may have been due to what I might call the specialised disciplines of study which were particularly a characteristic of our university institutions.  To train a doctor of medicine to be a doctor <i>simpliciter</i> is hardly a fulfilment of the fundamental purpose of education.  The same could apply to an engineer, to a veterinary surgeon or to a dentist.</P>
    <P>It has to be stated that there might have been times when people who had a standing in a community by virtue of their professional responsibilities and status might not have been playing a fully effective part in a community &mdash;<Col N="576" /> and I do not blame them individually for this.  People would look up to them because of the education that they understood them to have while not recognising that that education might not have been as educational as it might have been.  It may have been limited by specialisation. For that reason, before I became involved in the Department of Education, I made special reference to this very urgent need for professional people to recognise that they have an obligation to avail themselves of the programme of continuous or continuing education; that education is not ended for them on the day they graduate or proceed to post-graduate studies; that if they want to be meaningful and to have a full part to play in the community and to be fully developed personalities, which is the essential function of education, they, too, will have to continue their education and will have to give back to the community what the community has given to them.</P>
    <P>Here I am glad to say that the trend has changed and is continuously changing. Nowhere is that more evident than in the careers exhibitions being provided and developed throughout the country in recent times.  I would hope that this development would continue and that our institutions of higher education would take account of the fact that to develop the full person one does not just limit his course of study to a particular area but that one must always have regard to the need to develop the full man.  The institutions of higher education could also play a bigger part in the whole programme of pupil guidance than they have been able to do up to the present time.  It is very clear that the flame has been set alight in the post-primary sector.  It is not so clear that the flame has caught on at third level.  This may be because of limited resources or because of pressure of time or accommodation.  It may be due to the traditional attitudes of some university professors who are concerned with special aspects of the classics or certain aspects of medicine. Whatever the reason, there is an urgent need for the institutions of higher education to involve themselves more fully <Col N="577" /> in this whole area, particularly if one accepts the premise I started with, that they above all other sectors in education have a responsibility to the community and to have regard to the community needs.  Then one immediately recognises that they should be the leaders rather than the followers in this regard.</P>
    <P>I made this point when addressing a newly formed society of technological teachers recently in Kevin Street.  I did suggest to them that I thought a council or committee representative of the various institutions and universities in this area would be well worthwhile considering so that they could in the first instance advise pupils as to the appropriate directions in which they might pursue their studies and thereby fulfil the obligations to which I have referred of their place in the community and, as in the post-primary sector, they could watch the developments of the undergraduates and &mdash; this is often a very important matter as I am sure most people with university experience would recognise &mdash; if necessary, help at an early stage in their course of studies to channel them into a new area.</P>
    <P>Too many graduates or undergraduates in Arts tend to think that the end of the line for them is as teachers.  The teaching profession demands a personality, a character and a discipline that may not be demanded in other areas.  It demands also an ability to project oneself, to command attention and respect without appearing to be trying.  There are many very gifted people who do not have any, much less all, of these characteristics.</P>
    <P>How many people have been directed into teaching because of their intellectual capacity and academic curiosity and capacity as scholars but who had very little of the essential makeup of the teacher who can project and communicate.  How many of them have been unfulfilled as a result and would have been better fulfilled in other areas?  That is one illustration that comes to mind immediately from the association which I have had with so many undergraduates and graduates who found themselves so misplaced. This illustrates quite clearly the need for development in this area <Col N="578" /> on the part of the institutions of higher education.</P>
    <P>One of the questions posed in the course of this debate &mdash; Deputy FitzGerald made reference to it &mdash; was what the consequences of our becoming a member of the European Community would be in education and what planning we should be undertaking in that area.  I hope I do not in any way misinterpret him but I think Deputy FitzGerald said that it does not necessarily have the consequences that so many people think it would have. He probably expressed it much better than that but I think it is a fair enough statement as to what the consequences may be.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the structure of education or, in fact, the various types of education provided, for instance, at post-primary level, roughly so called, throughout Europe, one sees immediately that the first thing that will not be required of us will be to conform to a pattern of education in any other country, much less in Europe.  I might just illustrate this.  Take, for instance, France, where there is a centralised system of education operating through something equivalent to the Department of Education here.  In Germany, on the other hand, there are 11 individual Länder operating almost independently one of the other, each in its own area, with a certain co-ordination. In Switzerland there is almost total independence and autonomy in the educational programme in the various cantons &mdash; 29 of them &mdash; throughout the country.  So that, in the first instance, there is no uniform system in operation out there any more than here, or each of us has its own system.  There is no European system operating throughout the whole of Europe. Therefore, we will not be required to conform to uniformity.  That does not exist.  There are certain priorities which are applied and it can be stated that these priorities are not in any way inconsistent with our priorities at this time in this country.  It is worth quoting again, although I am sure it is familiar to many in the House, that the objectives of the Council of Europe as stated in educational matters are:</P>
    <P>To help to create conditions in <Col N="579" /> which the right educational opportunities are available to young Europeans whatever their background or level of academic accomplishment and to facilitate their adjustment to changing political and social conditions.</P>
    <P>That sums up very precisely all that I have been endeavouring to say in the last half hour, that the same principles and objectives are there, to give the maximum opportunity to all subjects of education and to facilitate their adjustment to changing political and social conditions.</P>
    <P>I suppose there will evolve in time, as the European countries come closer to each other, a certain harmonisation of the complex educational processes which have developed rather differently in each European country and probably there will be also a concentration on those factors which make for unity rather than on those which encourage the reverse.  It must be remembered that there is no question of us needing to tailor our educational programme or philosophy to do anything other than meet the needs here at home but that is not to say that the position here will not be influenced by our association with other countries. I sincerely hope it will be; there is a great need that it should be.  We have been sheltered from too many positive influences in Europe and saturated with too many AngloAmerican influences at a certain level. I hope that one other benefit resulting from our EEC membership will be an opening of the door to the influences of the cultural awareness of Europe.</P>
    <P>At the same time, our European association holds some precise priorities for us and one in particular is the study and use of languages.  If we suffer from any disadvantage compared with the existing Six in the EEC and the other applicant countries, with the exception of our great neighbour &mdash; we have an advantage over them &mdash; it is that we have not the experience of what one might describe as being conversant with the way of life in other countries.  Particularly, we have not had the experience of being reasonably <Col N="580" /> fluent in the languages of these other countries.  I do not want to stress what I may have said before beyond stating that students in France, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Denmark or Switzerland, countries many of which are noted for linguistic ability, by the time they reach the end of their post-primary education&mdash;to identify it by relating it to our own position&mdash;have acquired fluency in at least two languages which may or may not include their own and many will have acquired fluency in even more.</P>
    <P>This gives them an obvious advantage over us at this stage.  We have the advantage over our monoglot neighbours, many of whom still seem to cling to the notion &mdash; this is changing possibly in recent times&mdash;that beyond Hyde Park all is desert and if you do not speak my language you are deprived and I am not.  Generally, in view of the fact that we have a second idiom here already, a second language, we should encourage students, particularly at school and also at home and at play to express themselves in these languages.  Anybody will recognise that the first problem is to overcome the almost natural embarrassment of listening to oneself expressing oneself in an idiom which is not natural to one's environment and experience.  Some of us, unfortunately, have known that embarrassment in relation to our own language, Irish.  We found it difficult to respond at some stages when the teacher may have said: &ldquo;Why do you not talk Irish outside school?&rdquo;  We found it a little strange and sometimes almost inconsistent with incipient manhood&mdash; this would be at an early stage&mdash;to speak any language other than the one in which we could effectively express ourselves.  This is simply a psychological block which can be overcome.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that it is readily being overcome every day here in regard to the Irish language and I am particularly pleased to note that students of post-primary schools especially and also primary schools are now expressing themselves more freely in their own language than we had the opportunity to do in our day. This is due to the fact that they are <Col N="581" /> being encouraged to express themselves in a natural way about matters which they regard as priorities in their lives, anything from pop songs to football games, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>Irish is not the medium of expression of purely Irish views but if it is a meaningful and colourful language, as, indeed, it is, not only can it be but it must be used to express one's experience throughout the whole spectrum of one's life.  Therefore, I am glad to hear it more frequently spoken in pubs, in playing fields and particularly by children going to and coming from school.  That is very important for the Irish language but it is also important as being a great base of development for the further study and use of other languages.  Let nobody tell you that the use and study of one language cuts across the use and study of other languages.  Far from it.  I think the European experience has been, and the experience of all linguists has been, that fluency in two languages leads to fluency in three or four or more.</P>
    <P>Once the initial psychological embarrassment, if that is what it is, of breaking out of one's vernacular has been overcome the difficulty of launching into others assumes less significance. For that reason, all of us will be glad to note that the development of language laboratories in our post-primary schools has been a very significant aspect of that sector recently.  So has the development and provision of teaching aids with refresher courses for teachers in French, Italian, German or whatever the language may be.  What is important is that each of them is being treated in the same way.  The Irish language, too, is being regarded as a modern language but a language having a great past.  A language is a medium of day-to-day expression and if ever it ceases to become that, it becomes simply a medium of literary expression&mdash;such as happened, for example, to the Latin language many years ago.</P>
    <P>I think we can rest assured that the practical fluency which is being encouraged in all languages and, particularly, in our own, will be of immense benefit to pupils not only as pupils but as potential Europeans, as people who will have to consult with <Col N="582" /> and communicate with continental businessmen who, while they may speak to us socially in English, switch to their own language when they talk of business.  We cannot afford to be at a disadvantage in that respect. While it may be possible to provide interpreters for delegations from the Dáil, for instance, the average businessman may not be able to afford such a luxury.  Therefore, it will be of vital consequence that a skilled and fluent team of linguists in the various Continental languages will be available in this country so as to ensure that we can exploit fully the opportunities that exist in Europe, particularly in regard to marketing.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of this matter is that, if one wishes to know people, one must be able to converse with them in their mother tongue. Also, in order to get to know people well, one must be able to read their literature as it was written in their own language.  In that way we can indicate our real concern at becoming Europeans. Has it ever occurred to us that some of the great scholars in Irish literature have been German?  May be we, too, could return the compliment and prove that we have the same awareness of their great culture as, indeed, we did have so many centuries ago.  A last point I wish to make in this connection is that the significant fact emerges that at the post-primary level we have a higher percentage rate than the average West European participation rate.  There may be some countries with a higher rate and others with a lower rate.  This is a very important development which probably reflects development during the past four or five years in particular.</P>

      <P>I am confining the rate to post-primary level but in respect of the higher institute level I am afraid we are very much lower than the average rate of participation of the European countries.  This may be due to our delay in extending the maximum benefits of education to all. It is important to recognise that, if we are to utilise fully the best talents that <Col N="583" /> will be available to us from our universities and other institutions of higher study, we will have to be selective in directing people into the appropriate courses and also we will have to increase the drive in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald asked how far we were in touch with the position in regard to equivalent degrees and diplomas in Common Market conditions. It might be no harm to mention here the basic provisions of the Treaty of Rome in this connection.  It is laid down under Article 57 that in order to facilitate the engagement in and exercise of non-wage earning activities, the Council on a proposal of the Commission and after the Assembly have been consulted, shall act by issuing directions regarding mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other qualifications.  I suppose it may be said that the aim of this mutual recognition is twofold: first, to abolish obstacles to freedom of movement and, secondly, to ensure that only the competent people move in any event.  I understand that so far the Commission have prepared draft directions in about 30 cases, that the Assembly have been consulted in many of them, but that up to now none has been adopted by the Council of Ministers. However, that is not to say they will not be adopted.  The draft directives apply, for instance, to several branches of the medical profession, to doctors, dentists, midwifes, nurses, pharmacists and others.  They apply also in respect of accountants, architects and engineers. The implications of these directives are significant.  In the first place, they provide a basis for the practice beyond national frontiers of the professions concerned and, secondly, they regulate at least to some extent the level of internal qualification.  For instance, in the case of medical doctors there is a specification of a minimum length of course of six years of university education and a minimum period of 5,500 hours of theoretical and practical instruction.  In respect of specialists in obstetrics and gynaecology there is a further four years of full time training.  Of course, practically <Col N="584" /> all of these directives would have implications for our institutes of higher education and, while they have not been adopted yet, it will be a matter of considerable consequence for us that we be consulted before any further developments are made in this direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that it would have been desirable to have kept the professional interests in touch with these proposals as they evolved during the past three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it would have been desirable, but it is no harm to remind the House that we are not all that far behind in this area as might sometimes be suggested.  While the proposals have been evolving and some have been there for a considerable time there are no signs that the directives will be adopted in the near future.  Up to now there was little we could have done in the question of recognition of qualifications in so far as the directives apply.  I appreciate what Deputy FitzGerald has said in this connection but I do not believe in regretting the past while the future holds opportunities for us.</P>
      <P>I might say that these proposals are not new concepts in any event.  They are fairly long term in their implications and they have been fairly slow in being implemented.  There have been conventions and agreements, particularly in the context of the Council of Europe, dating back to the 1950s.  We have kept close association in this respect and so too have the professional bodies.  There is a convention, for instance, on the equivalence of diplomas leading to admission to universities.  This was ratified by Ireland in March of 1954.  There was another convention on the equivalence of periods of university studies, which we ratified in September of 1957, and we entered into an agreement on the academic recognition of university qualifications in April, 1964.  Therefore, while the adoption of these draft directives may have significant consequences for us, no one need fear that we have been out of touch totally with the emergence of this pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> Speaking of pattern emergence, one of the main issues in the debate on education during the past couple of years has been the departure from traditional structures and the adoption of new ones to meet new needs and future needs.  Up to the comparatively recent past we had here a protected economy, a protected society and, indeed, generally we were anything but fully developed in our resources.  Many of us remember being told at school that Ireland was a country of very few natural resources.  We accepted that fundamental dogma and I cannot recall anyone questioning it seriously; but that has been changed now and we wonder how we could have accepted it so readily.  Consequent on the economic condition of the country during those years and the lack of job opportunity at home the position was that the outlet for most pupils from post-primary education in particular, for those who could afford it, was towards such professions as the Civil Service, the banks, the Army and towards national teaching for those who had the necessary qualifications.</P>
    <P>In general these fields were regarded as being the most secure, most desirable and most available areas of employment and also those of further promotion to any student leaving school.  It is little surprise that the emphasis on post-primary education, particularly in the secondary schools, was on the preparation of students to reach a satisfactory examination standard so that they could either get a scholarship to university or qualify for entrance to the Civil Service, the banks or the various other professions. There were some schools that catered for the more fortunate children for whom it was not necessary to have the same emphasis on examination papers because children attending those schools could probably afford to go to university at a time when entrance to those institutes was not determined by a pupil's capacity but rather by the parents themselves.  However, that has changed.  Where parents' resources were limited the schools did see themselves as having an obligation to compensate for that lack of resources and to ensure that the student got the best <Col N="586" /> possible opportunity and reached the best possible examination standard. This is particularly true of the teaching orders of brothers and nuns.  I do not think anyone can deny the value of their contribution.  Were it not for them many of us in this House would not be here or anywhere else for that matter.  Their contribution has been in the true spirit of their Christian dedication to education and to the pupils committed to their care.  They made their contribution having regard to the outlets that were there at that time.  They often made it by supplementing the pupils resources with their own personal resources.  I am sure all of us have a clear recollection of Christian Brothers or nuns making the announcement at school that the fees were due for payment, say, the following week and that those to whom the payment of fees presented difficulties should go and talk to them. That resulted in members of the religious orders applying part of their salary, or whatever might have been available to them because of burses, to the benefit of many pupils.  This morning on the radio I happened to hear a distinguished stage and literary personality make just the same comment, that he would not have reached whatever standard he did reach without the assistance and dedication of a teaching order.</P>
    <P>The pattern of education has been changing and will change further.  Our economy is open.  The opportunities are expanding and will continue to expand even more.  As this happens the structure of education must accommodate itself to the change.  For that reason I am confident that these orders, who have always effectively, readily and unselfishly devoted themselves to the pupils committed to them, will be fully involved in the new pattern of education.  This will probably mean the breaking of old moulds and the fashioning of new ones.  It will mean particularly an involvement with other sectors or other areas of education. Generally, these orders concerned themselves with what we would loosely call academic studies, because they were conditioned to that by the type of society that has existed up to now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> Now we are facing a situation where their readiness to involve themselves in a new pattern is a matter of great significance.  None of us show our lack of awareness of human nature and how people react to change so much as when we express our impatience or frustration at the fact that the change is not being effected quickly enough. The direction of change can be pointed, but one must always rely on the goodwill, support and understanding of those involved in order to fully effect the change.  Therefore, we should not label the areas of education and say one sector, say, vocational education, is entitled to a certain thing and another sector is entitled to something else.  I myself was involved in the vocational sector as a part-time teacher. They, too, developed according to the structural demands that were placed before them.  It is changing for them as well.  It is in the merger of all these sectors that new hope arises.  This means that within our limited resources we must consider such things as community schools and comprehensive schools to ensure that the first priority, that is, the fulfilment of the students having regard to the new environment, will be given adequate attention.</P>
    <P>If that is so, this will involve changes in what I would call peripheral matters. If I have any comment to make on the general debate that is taking place on the community schools, I think I must honestly say it is on the way it has been sidetracked by matters which, while they are important, are not essential matters in this whole debate.  The essential matter is the curriculum available to the student.  What are not essential are the fears that are sometimes developed, the notion that a community school will represent three separate interests.  If it is going to represent three separate interests it is doomed before it starts.  If it is to be a community school it will be a community school in management and in every other sense.  If our plans for the future are related to the definitions and structures of the past, whether it be those of the vocational schools, the teaching orders and whatever else, then we shall never achieve success in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The last day Deputy Desmond made an indication of his own personal position, that he is <Col N="589" /> in favour of denominational education, which view he fairly stated might not be accepted by all members of his party.  However, I do not want, on this very important matter, to start anything in the future of a heated discussion, to ascribe to people views they do not hold.  I recognise the objectivity of all who have made contributions on this.</P>
      <P>I have merely said that I think our views and the manner in which we express them might have been conditioned to some extent by the structure of education as it has existed. Let us start thinking of the structures as they should exist in the future.  If one were to think in terms of the past one would say that where traditionally a religious order or society had the sole management of a particular school &mdash; and they had, be they nuns, brothers or anyone else &mdash; now under the new proposals of management they are accepting not sole management &mdash; far from it &mdash; but a sixth representation on the management board.  If we talk in terms of their involvement on that basis we will make them seem as if they are just minority interests in a new development.  There must not be a feeling of minority interests or majority interests.  There must be a feeling of involvement on a representative level. These people who always had the sole and exclusive management of their own schools are making a very significant concession in the interests of their pupils and in the interests of their whole commitment to education in involving themselves in a totally new structure, not one based on the past but one certainly planned for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to community schools I hope we can now think in terms of their application to the future and how they conform with the future pattern, certainly not in terms of how they represent past interests or past structures. I would like to make one other statement &mdash; I am making broad observations here &mdash; in connection with what has become one of the sidetracks of this debate, and that is denominational question.  It was said by a particular churchman that these schools are Catholic schools and will be Catholic <Col N="590" /> schools suitable for Catholic children. If he, as a bishop, expresses a view that these schools are in fact suitable for schools for the education of children in the Roman Catholic Church this is a matter for him and is something which must be taken into account.  He is entitled to express that view.  The Minister was asked in the House if in view of the fact that the former Archbishop of Dublin said that did the Minister accept that it was so.  I think that there was a bit of confusion of thought here.  It is a bonus in my view if bishops express their satisfaction with it as being suitable for the training and education of children of a particular denomination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not what was said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was asked if he agreed with the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin when he stated that these were Catholic schools.  It is not the function of a Minister to agree or disagree with a Roman Catholic bishop.  We are not the people who know totally the proper content of the whole programme of Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland or Presbyterian education.  It was a confusion in terms but if it can be achieved that the school will meet the requirements and wishes of the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland or the Presbyterian Church then that is a bonus.  That bonus has been achieved very recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's reasoning is an effort to get out of the whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond was not here when I said that we launched ourselves into a programme in the interests of the children, not into a problem, and that the heat was generated by getting on the wrong tracks and by raising wrong issues.  I was glad that the Church of Ireland recently stated that they were very pleased to note the proposals which have now emerged in regard to Tallaght and Blanchardstown. I hope that other Church representatives will have the same view.  That again is a significant bonus.  May I now <Col N="591" /> remind Deputy Desmond that he was the one who stated that an education correspondent in a particular newspaper said some time back that there would be a confrontation because he was thinking, like so many others were thinking, in the structures of the past, and that you would have to have these structures and representations bang against each other.  Now that they have all agreed to merge in a structure for the future and have clearly indicated their intent to do so, it can be acknowledged that the Minister and the Department have achieved a very significant feat, particularly as this involves the future interests of the children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it has gone much further than many would have expected from the questions that were asked here in the last six months. Can I leave it at that?  Let the Minister explain precisely what the position is. I hope what I have said will be of some consequence.  I do not want to make any further point except to say that if there is one other area where significant developments have occurred it is in our concern for the technological developments within the community schools, the technical schools and the technical colleges which, as I indicated earlier, played a very significant role in the whole development of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The projected development of the Limerick Institute of Higher Education will operate at a total cost in excess of £10 million.  I have not got time to go into the details of its programme or any other programmes involved in that area; I just want to say that it is very evident in view of the imbalance, to which I referred on the last occasion, between the academic and what one might loosely call the technological side, that this imbalance has to be <Col N="592" /> corrected.  Might I specifically come back, having said that, to what I said in the past and might I particularly quote a very eminent authority in this particular area who stated:</P>
    <P>The school should always have as its aim that the young man leaves it as a harmonious personality not as a specialist.  The development of general ability for independent thinking and judgment should always be placed foremost not the acquisition of special knowledge.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies will not be surprised to hear that that was the view of no less a person than the prominent physicist, Albert Einstein.  If that was his view about the function of education then I think for all of us, no matter what we achieve in any technological area, it must always be our main concern as well.  One can say with Edmund Burke that education is the cheapest defence of a nation.  If that is so I hope all of us will ensure that that defence will be adequately provided and adequately supported as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak as an educationalist but as a parent and as a representative for east Mayo I want to deal with some problems which have existed in my constituency over the past few years.  I must compliment the Church for the standard of education they have given this country over the years.  I must also compliment all the teachers, vocational, secondary and primary, in my constituency who are doing such a good job against tremendous odds.  It would be a pity if the Church authorities, the nuns, the brothers and the diocesan colleges, had to pull out of education.  All down through the years these people have made a very valuable contribution and I am sure that practically every Member of this House received his education from these people.  They were certainly dedicated people.  They still are dedicated. Recently I dropped into a house in Swinford at 7 o'clock.  The boys were coming home from secondary school.  I asked them why they were so late and they told me the principal invited them back to do their lessons and spent three hours with them.  That is what I call dedication.  It would be impossible for <Col N="593" /> the layman to do this even though he might be just as dedicated and just as good an educationalist.  Now it would be a tragedy if that kind of dedication were to disappear.  I believe parents will turn down lock, stock and barrel any system of education in which the Church authorities are pushed aside. This just will not be allowed to happen.</P>
      <P>We have problems in my constituency with regard to extensions to schools.  There is a vocational school in Ballina and in the last year the number of pupils there has increased by over 50 per cent.  The accommodation is quite inadequate to cater for them.  There are convent schools which require extra teachers but, for some reason or other, the Department will not sanction their employment.  That has actually happened in the convent school beside me.</P>
      <P>In Ballycastle there is a school which has given invaluable service from an educational point of view.  I understand the Department proposes to close down this school.  Recently I was invited to a meeting, as were all the other public representatives in the area, to discuss this proposal.  A letter in connection with the matter reads:</P>
      <P>The Department of Education has recently put forward the proposal that the leaving certificate course no longer be offered at Ballycastle Secondary School.  As you can imagine, this is a policy that has grave implications for the future of the school in Ballycastle and for the small school in Ireland in general. A public meeting has been called for Sunday next, the 6th February, at 8 p.m., in the Parish Hall, Ballycastle, to voice the support of the community to oppose this decision. We would be greatly honoured by your presence at this meeting, and thus extend this invitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enclosed are copies of three letters, which may be of interest to you.  The first is the Department's notification concerning this matter: the second is a letter sent to the parents of the community by the principal and school staff expressing their reasons for opposing this suggestion: <Col N="594" /> the third is a public letter from the Ballycastle Development Committee on the same subject.</P>
    <P>On 20th January there was a letter from the Stella Maris Secondary School issued to the parents.</P>
    <P>We have just received a letter from the Department of Education, which we think we should bring to your notice.</P>
    <P>In this letter, the Department has suggested that after our present fourth year class have done their leaving certificate, the leaving certificate course should no longer be offered at this school.  The Department offers the following reasons for its suggestion that we no longer enrol pupils after intermediate certificate. &ldquo;There is no possibility,&rdquo; says the Department, &ldquo;of providing a broadly based curriculum in a school where there are comparatively few pupils for leaving certificate courses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Department have suggested that the children should go to Lacken Cross vocational school.  I have here a letter from the Ballycastle Development Committee which reads:</P>
    <P>A decision was taken at the meeting of the local Development body to voice the reaction of the local community to the Department's decision to withdraw grants from leaving certificate pupils at our local secondary school.  The first reaction must be one of shock and dismay as to why a Department official sees fit to issue such an arbitrary order to a progressive flourishing school which we regard as one of the major keystones of our parish.  We accept that it is in pupil interest to have a broadly based curriculum and we affirm that such is available in Ballycastle.  We do not accept that the better educational facilities are available in large complexes where by virtue of numbers the pupil is submerged to an anonymity which hinders the total education of the individual &mdash; the type of education which everybody proclaims today is the right of the child.</P>
    <P>We are convinced that the school <Col N="595" /> at Ballycastle exemplifies all that is best in education today &mdash; a small pupil/teacher ratio, an excellent and enthusiastic staff, a wide choice of subjects, a very wide range of extra curricular activities and involvement by pupils to an extent which helps so much in the formative years.  Anybody who visits the school cannot fail to be impressed by its atmosphere and parents of the locality are justly proud of their children's involvement in the school.</P>
    <P>This school is run by the Sisters of Mercy, who for many years have maintained their convent at Ballycastle. The people feel it is a sorry day for the town's future if the nuns are compelled by high-handed officialdom to leave the area.  Were we convinced that there were sound and just reasons for its arbitrary orders then we would accept them gracefully, but as it appears to us we cannot accept this blow which cuts right across the social fabric of our community.</P>
    <P>We also find it difficult to understand why a decision of this kind can be simply dictated to a developing and successful school without at first having consultation with the principal and teachers.</P>
    <P>We pledge our full support to any action being taken to stem the brutal attempt of the Department to wield the death blow to yet another western town.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, in view of the change in forms of transport, <i>et cetera</i>, since the Land Commission decided to confine allocations of land to landless men living within half a mile of an estate and to uneconomic holders living within one mile of an estate being divided, all suitable applicants living within five miles of an estate being divided should, where possible, be allocated land on that estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> This motion is almost similar to a motion debated here 12 months ago and to other motions debated on numerous occasions in this House.  The Minister is a very reasonable man and, as I said before in this House, he ensures that no one can point the finger at him and say he did not give a farm unless the applicant was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I hope now he will have the good sense to put into operation what is suggested in this motion.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for people who live in the cities and the towns of this country to understand the attitude of country people to land holdings.  It is more difficult still to understand people who come from country districts and who, because they are living a few years in the cities and towns, try to pretend that they do not understand the attitude of the people in the country in regard to land holdings.  The fact is that Irish men and women have always attempted to find some security.  The security may be a good job, but in many cases in country areas security is represented by a little bit of land. The person with land has something on which he can fall back in hard times.  The person who has even a small holding of land need never go hungry if the land is worked properly.</P>
    <P>Many years ago the Land Commission decided to confine allocations of land to what they called suitable applicants among the landless class living half a mile from the estate and to uneconomic holders one mile from the estate.  Of course, if you lived 100 miles away or 200 miles away you qualified; but if you were living one mile and 100 yards away, you did not qualify. The reason the Land Commission adopted this policy was simply to have an arrangement which would save them and their officials a lot of trouble. If the system which I suggest is adopted the inspectors and the people allocating land will have a lot of trouble.  They will have to be able to say that they have checked up on all eligible applicants, perhaps 40 or 50 cases, and found only a certain number, perhaps six or eight, entitled to the allocated land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> When my idea was introduced first I found a number of people, particularly Land Commission officials, who seemed to have a peculiar idea that I was suggesting that a man who was five miles away should have the same right as the man living beside the estate.  That is not so.  If the Land Commission inspectors can find sufficient eligible applicants near the estate the matter is settled.  I want the inspectors to move out in ever-widening circles until they find sufficient qualified people.  There is nothing unreasonable in that.  With modern transport five miles is not a long distance. &ldquo;Eligible applicant&rdquo; is a description which the Land Commission have created and used on many occasions. It is difficult to understand exactly what is meant by these words.  I was shocked to hear a predecessor of the present Minister saying that a dairy farmer was not a farmer.  The reason he thought that the man was not a farmer was because he had worked in a factory but was advised by the doctor to get an outdoor job because his health was not good.  This man had had some experience of agriculture.  He began tilling the garden attached to his cottage.  He then took land on the conacre system and eventually built up a herd of 20 cows and supplied milk to a creamery.  He was able to live on what he was making.  When two or three farms were divided he was not considered eligible for land by a Land Commission inspector because he was only employed in a dairy.  The fact that he had to grow root crops to feed the cows did not seem to affect the decision.  I do not know whether the Minister or the officials made the decision, but this man was very badly treated.</P>
    <P>Due to pressure put on me and on my colleagues by those who are interested in getting some land I decided to put down a motion which has eventually reached its place on the Order Paper.  A man who is employed on agriculture, whether he is working on the land or not, has a knowledge of agriculture which others have not.  The Land Commission are doing a disservice to themselves and to the country when they pass over such people when <Col N="598" /> land is being allocated and when they treat them as if they were second-class citizens and not entitled to be considered for land allocation.</P>
    <P>I come from County Meath where much land has been divided.  I have seen farms divided and people being moved from council cottages and given what was then considered to be a fullsized farm.  Many such people made a very good job of farming.  They reared families who amassed a certain amount of wealth.  These people used the knowledge they had obtained while working for others to better themselves when they got the opportunity.  This was Fianna Fáil policy originally, but it has been changed.  The reason given for the change was that certain people got land and did not use it properly. I agree that that is so.  Certain individuals got land and did not use it properly, but the Land Commission have a way of dealing with them.  A man who gets an addition to his holding and is not using it properly can be dealt with.  Until the land is vested the Land Commission can recover it.  This has been done in many cases.  This is not so, of course, in the case of people from an outside area, who give up portion of their holdings.  They are usually migrants.  These people usually have vested holdings which they hand up.  They arrange swaps.  One man told me that he got 250 acres on which the rate was 6p an acre.  We know what kind of land that was.  Another man got 45 acres.  All these people who swap land are vested early on.  Some of them sell the land which they get from the Land Commission and move off after a short time.  I am not arguing against the landless man or the very small farmer because some of them dispose of the land at the first opportunity. I am not criticising the people. I have been accused of being antimigrant here on a number of occasions. The only objection I have to migration is this.  I am thinking of people who are living in an area and have reared their families there and whose families are in employment, either good or bad. It is wrong to bring people in from outside and give them land which these local people feel they could use themselves. Any of the migrants who have <Col N="599" /> come to County Meath must admit that they have been treated very well by the locals, including myself.  As far as we are concerned, when they do come, they are there.  It is a fact of life and we leave them there.  In fact, more is done or offered to be done for them than for people who have been living there all their lives and, therefore, there is no question of there being any bias against them when they are there, but I think the Minister was perfectly correct when he said here six months ago that the time had come to stop migration from the west and to try to fix the land which was being divided amongst local people.</P>
    <P>Migration does something else. When a number of outsiders from another parish, another county or from a couple of hundred miles away are brought into an area, with big families, they do in my opinion upset the balance there because the area into which they come may have a limited amount of employment.  The Land Commission used to be accused of teling people who were coming to an area that, of course, there was a town at hand and plenty of employment, but when one finds a family of six, eight or ten boys and girls, just leaving school or shortly after, coming into an area, it soon ends up that either they have to emigrate or the local youngsters in jobs have to emigrate because there is not enough employment for both sets of people, and until we reach a stage even in the east of Ireland where it will be possible to give full employment this sort of thing will continue, so that in two ways an area is being injured by the influx of outsiders.</P>
    <P>I grant that when people come from outside, they often bring in people with new ideas, and, indeed, they have brought in, particularly to County Meath, a number of very fine Gaelic footballers and we have had the satisfaction of using some of them to beat Mayo on one or two occasions and Galway, too, and they become more Meath than the Meath people themselves. This, perhaps, goes on the credit side but the facts of life are that if a man has been living beside a farm <Col N="600" /> all his life and is engaged in a rural industry or is an agricultural worker, a road worker or a forestry worker and that farm comes up for division, in many cases as a result of the pressure which this man and his friends have put on the Land Commission, requesting that it be inspected and divided, it is terribly unfair that he should be passed over on the ground that he is a landless man who lives maybe 100 yards outside the half-mile the Land Commission lay down or if he has a small holding, lives slightly &mdash; maybe 100 yards &mdash; over the mile.  It seems so ridiculous, particularly as the Land Commission &mdash; and this is something I would like to have clarified &mdash; have on more than one occasion claimed that the distance from the farm must be by road, and the former Minister for Lands, Deputy Ó Móráin, stated here that the half-mile from the farm and the mile from the farm, in his opinion, was to the nearest portion of the farm.  I know of a particular farm in respect of which a man was ruled out by the Land Commission less than two years ago on the grounds that he was over half a mile when, in fact, he was only, as people say in the country, one field, a matter of 150 yards by the fields when, in fact, by road he could be over half a mile.  This is the sort of device which is adopted for the purpose of preventing a small man from getting a share of land being divided in his area.</P>
    <P>At the present time, in view of the price that has to be given for land &mdash; and there is talk about going into the EEC where we believe the average price of agricultural land is in the region of £2,500 per acre; I wonder what the fellows complaining of high prices for housing sites will say to that &mdash; and with the price of land going up, it is not everyone who can even accept a full farm because the annuity of over £20 per acre for a farm of 40 acres or slightly over makes it extremely difficult for some of the people concerned to be able to work land; but there is not a parish in Ireland where a farm is being divided where it is not possible to get a number of men who want to get either an addition to a holding or an accommodation <Col N="601" /> plot which they can use for the growing of vegetables for their families and, in the main, to keep a cow and a few calves.  It really is a bit aggravating for that type of man to find that if he is living near a farm, and as some of them even with small holdings have to find a job for the purpose of rearing their families, the Land Commission do not take the same point of view as the Minister.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister say some two years ago, and he repeated it several times since, that the part-time farmer is coming.  The man who has a job and is able to work his land as well is the man who, as they say in the country is snug; the most secure man in the place is the man who works his day and works his farm as well, subsidising the farm out of his earnings and he usually is a very good farmer.  I would see the situation completely changed if a man who was working got land or had land and was setting it, not using it at all. The man who uses his land and uses it to the full, even if he has a job, is entitled to consideration and I see so many of these people.</P>
    <P>I helped to take a deputation to the Minister six months ago or so, and the Minister, I am sure, remembers that numerous suggestions were made to him by a group of local people as to how, when a farm was being divided, the people who had been taken in and the people they represented could be fixed up, as a number of them were.  Some of them swapped little farms they had and moved into the main estate themselves and the other people then availed themselves of this, but one particular person who everybody, including the Land Commission officials, felt was the best of the lot, a fellow who had been working his day, rearing a fairly sizeable family, had, in fact, been taking land and who, in addition, had some stock and was a progressive young man&mdash;everybody was prepared to agree that he was one person who should get land but for some peculiar reason, because he was slightly over the half-mile from the estate, he did not get it but everybody else did.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> If the Minister was not as fairminded about this as I know he is, I would be forced to think that this man did not get land because he happens to be a well-known supporter of mine while the people who did get the transfers were not &mdash; they were supporters of the Minister's party.  As I said, I know that the Minister does not do that kind of thing and I would never accuse him of being involved, but it is one of the coincidences which make life harder for people like me because it is very difficult to go back to this man and say, &ldquo;Well, you are just unlucky&rdquo;, to which he replies &ldquo;It is a peculiar form of being unlucky because those slightly further away were able to get it and I did not&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I regret that this is so and there must be some reason for it.  I discussed the matter with numerous officials of the Land Commission all of whom were prepared to say that this man was an excellent man and one they would like to help.</P>
    <P>Considerable pressure has been put on the Land Commission in the last few years by an organisation known as the National Land League.  In the main they have been fighting for the people who live near estates.  I should like to repeat here what I have said on numerous occasions.  I agree entirely with their aims and I will give them full support so long as they remain within the law; as soon as they go outside the law they will not get support from me.</P>
    <P>In the main they have been lawabiding and they have used the peaceful protest for the purpose of establishing what I am asking for in this resolution.  However, there are offshoots of that organisation, people who have been members and who have moved to a little land league of their own, usually with an eye to assisting themselves and their friends to get something, and sometimes just &ldquo;for the devilment of it&rdquo;, as they say in the country.  The inevitable result is that somebody is left carrying the can.  On more than one occasion we have seen people being taken in by some of the bright boys who were full of advice but who made sure that they were far away when the trouble started. <Col N="603" /> These people did not finish up behind bars in Mountjoy.  I suppose every organisation has its wild men and these people create trouble.</P>
    <P>I have made this appeal to the Minister in the hope that we will get a certain amount of publicity about this so that those people who come to me, to Deputy Kavanagh and to other Deputies about this matter, will be aware that their point of view can be and has been aired in the House.  One of the greatest tragedies at the moment is that certain people have the idea that authority to talk about matters is no longer with this House and that other people outside can, and that they do things which will achieve results we cannot obtain.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have a Minister listening to Opposition Deputies &mdash; and I hope to some of his own backbenchers later on &mdash; dealing with the problem of the landless man and the small farmer is evidence that this House is important and that this is the place to discuss such topics.  While I have great respect for my friends in the Press Gallery, occasionally some of the extreme &ldquo;left-wing&rdquo; elements like the <i>Irish Independent</i> may be inclined to publish their views of what we have said in a way which possibly might give the wrong impression.  The Labour Party believe in political democracy and believe that matters such as this can be cleared up on the floor of this House.  That is why this motion is being debated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands is a very reasonable man, and I am not saying this for the purpose of trying to get around him.  He knows I disagree violently with his party and much of what they stand for, but all of us must be prepared to see the good and bad points in each other's policy.  The pronouncements of the Minister on the problem we are now debating leads me to believe that, more than anyone else, he can go a long way towards solving it.</P>
    <P>On one occasion I asked an employee of the Land Commission &mdash; he is no longer an employee of the Department &mdash; for information about why this regulation regarding the half-mile or <Col N="604" /> mile was introduced.  I have my own ideas about this, and I have enunciated them in the House.  I was told that the reason for the introduction of this regulation was that the person who got land which was more than one mile from his home would find it extremely difficult to work the farm.  It was considered by the Department that it would take him such a long time to travel to and from the farm with a horse and cart or a pony and cart that he would waste too much time and the extra land would be a burden on the man.  I was catty enough to point out that the horse or pony of the landless man would travel just as quickly as that of the man who had some land and, therefore, I could not see any point in the regulation regarding the half-mile.  It cannot be suggested that in the midlands or in the east of the country, and in many parts of the west and south, the farmer is using a horse or pony to travel round his farm and to carry out work.  Things are so mechanised that a half-mile is insignificant and, in fact, the farmer frequently goes four or five miles in order to till land.  The proof of this is the number of people who take conacre and who travel a considerable distance in order to work the land.</P>
    <P>A matter that is causing a considerable amount of trouble &mdash; I cannot understand why the Land Commission have ignored it &mdash; is the case of the man who has been taking land around the various estates.  When the Land Commission take over an estate they take away the pool of land being used by the people.  When this happens the man has to go further and, in addition, the price of the land is increased.  I know of one unfortunate man to whom this happened on three occasions.  The third time he thought he was being clever; he succeeded in renting some stabling from the estate which was about to be taken over and he put in 40 cows and took some of the farm.  Not only did the Land Commission not give him any of the estate but they put the cows out on the road and divided the farm among other people who were not as good at working it.  The man concerned started as a farm labourer and finished up the same way because he could not <Col N="605" /> get any place to put the cows and was obliged to sell them.</P>
    <P>We hear about the pool of land getting smaller.  We know that the ordinary farmer, the man who got 25 acres some years ago, looks with envy at the man who got 40 acres, who in turn, is looking with envy at any farm that comes up.  He is of the opinion that the size of the farm should be increased.  I realise it is essential that we cut our cloth according to measure but if land which is not being used is taken over by the Land Commission and divided, whether given locally or to migrants, those who did not get land and who know that there is no hope of further land being available, realise that their chances of having a decent farm are gone.  The result is that a certain bitterness builds up and this is what we should avoid. This is why we should be able to talk about and to dictate policies about these matters in this House.</P>
    <P>I may be accused of trying to cast a slur on the Land Commission officials because I have stated most definitely, and I am not withdrawing the statement, that the idea of the half-mile and the one-mile was cooked up many years ago by senior officials who felt this was the way of lessening the workload on the people under them.</P>
    <P>Most of the Land Commission inspectors and the officials we meet on deputations are reasonable men who are prepared to talk and to agree with a point of view, but they usually end up by saying: &ldquo;You know, of course, that it is not our decision&rdquo;.  Of course, we know it is not their decision but somebody must carry the can and eventually it must come back, as I am sure it does, on to the shoulders of the Minister.</P>
    <P>If we have reached the stage at which Land Commission officials are prepared to agree that the amount of land available in an area is coming to an end, then I am sure they will also be prepared to agree that it is very unfair to rule out completely people who believe they are entitled to a holding on the grounds that they are not eligible for one reason or another; usually it is a quibble.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> Another complaint I have about the Land Commission inspectors is &mdash; maybe they do it out of politeness &mdash; that they go around and interview many people within the stipulated area.  How they manage it I do not know, but everyone they talk to is left with the impression that he will get land.  This is one way of preventing a row being kicked up before the land is divided.  When the land is divided there is bitterness, not only between the people concerned and the Land Commission, but the people concerned and those who have got the land.  This is not a good thing and for that reason I would appeal again to the Minister to tell his officials to go around and talk to everyone within a reasonable distance and divide the land amongst them.</P>
    <P>From time to time we get complaints from people who feel they should get land because they had been employed on an estate.  The Minister must take a firm stand on this.  I am not asking him to interfere politically but, as the political head of the Department, he is entitled to point out what the policy is.  If ten or 15 men were employed on an estate which is being divided and if six, or eight or 12 months before the employer who sold the lands to the Land Commission decided to let most of them go because he is going to sell the farm, then, if they are living within a few miles of the estate, it is most unfair for the Land Commission inspector to tell them: &ldquo;Of course, you were gone before the Land Commission took over.  Of course, you have no land and you are over a half a mile away and, therefore, you are out.  You are not entitled to anything.&rdquo;  The Land Commission must look at this in a reasonable way and give these men the compensation they would have got if the employer had not decided to save on their wages; he did not intend to work the farm properly as he intended to get rid of it.</P>
    <P>There is also the point about the man who is retained.  I find a peculiar attitude on the part of the Land Commission. Perhaps it is not peculiar to them, but it is peculiar to somebody like me who knows conditions in the <Col N="607" /> country.  I refer to the man who is employed on an estate, looking after it for the Land Commission until it is divided; or he may be retained in employment, part-time or full-time by his previous employer.  It is rather unfair that he should be told that he still has a job and he is not entitled to a part no matter in what other way he is eligible.</P>
    <P>There are numerous instances in which men like that are dismissed within a short period for something which has nothing at all to do with the Land Commission.  They lose their jobs and they get no compensation of any kind. On one occasion I know the Land Commission were very generous to such a person.  When the matter was raised with them they helped him out as best they could.  They were then confined to a very tight schedule.  If the man had been dismissed with the rest of the men on the farm when it was taken over he would now be a farmer in his own rights with 40 acres of land and a good house.  As it turned out, he had to borrow money and build a little house for himself.  He is living in it now and driving in and out to Dublin where he is employed as a builder's labourer but his heart is in agriculture.</P>
    <P>If this country is to survive we must keep on the land those who are interested in the land.  I do not care how strict the Land Commission are in ensuring that the people who get land keep it and work it properly or else hand it back.  The people who know how to work the land, who have lived in the area all their lives, who know the market, who know the type of land they are working, who know the crops and who know the correct time to put in crops and take them out, which is very important, should get the first consideration.</P>
    <P>Another group who are being badly dealt with, in my opinion, are farmers' sons.  If a farmer has four or five sons he may be living on a farm which is big enough to rear that family but, when his time comes, only one of them can remain on it.  It is very cold comfort to the others to tell them that, since their father's farm is over a certain size, they are not entitled to get <Col N="608" /> an addition or a farm for themselves. These people usually finish up as builders' labourers or they emigrate to England, Australia or Canada.  They leave their district and each one who leaves is a loss.  They know the land and they know how to work it.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that if we are interested in seeing agriculture prosper &mdash; we are told so often that agriculture is our primary industry &mdash; we must devise a system of land division and land settlement which will be acceptable to all concerned.  I still think it is not a crime to make money.  It is not a crime to be successful.  It is not a crime for a young farmer to be able to build a house, have a farm, work it and rear a family.  If he makes money, good luck to him.  The Land Commission should do their share by extending the limit from half a mile for a landless man and from a mile for an uneconomic holder to five miles, I would suggest, although I am not tied to that figure.  When the inspectors are dividing a farm they should go from the centre out and choose those who will make good farmers and allocate land to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to second the motion in the name of Deputy Tully. At the moment there are only three ways for farmers and uneconomic holders to get access to extra land.  The first is by purchasing land on the open market.  The second is by getting a grant of land from the Land Commission and the third way is by taking conacre, that is, by renting land on the 11-months system.  The purchase of land on the open market has become far too expensive for landless men or small farmers.  The small progressive farmer has possibly put his money, or any money available to him through loans or grants, into his farm already. He has probably got loans for machinery, <i>et cetera</i>; he is probably up to his neck in debt.  He is prepared to work his farm to the limit of his ability in order to become more viable and to take advantage of the bigger market by attempting to purchase land in competition with large farmers and also certain industrialists who find it useful to have a farm to go to for the weekpetitio <Col N="609" /> end, a tax rebate system, if you like, a way of investing money and having a nice second occupation or pastime.  The small farmer is in competition with this type of individual for the purchase of land and it is almost impossible for the small progressive farmer, the uneconomic holder or, indeed, the landless man to acquire land by this method.</P>
      <P>The second method is that the small farmer, uneconomic holder or landless man seeks from the Land Commission portion of an estate that the Land Commission has acquired.  This is where the problem arises of the half-mile and mile rule.  Deputy Tully has already given very adequately an account of the problems that face the man who is trying to enlarge his holding and who is outside these limits. Last year, on the Estimate, the Minister suggested as a reason for this rule that the speed at which a cow walks has not increased.  It was a jocose remark.  It is amazing that this factor has anything to do with the fact that the rule has not been changed.  Other forms of transport have changed.  The tractor is used extensively to get from one farm to another or from one point to another.  The number of fragmented farms is growing.  In the west of Ireland, in the case of almost 30 per cent of all fragmented farms there is a distance of a mile or more between the two largest portions of the farm. Farmers have overcome the problems of working two separate portions of land and have amply demonstrated to the Minister that farming can be carried on where there is a mile or a half-mile between the two main portions of the land.  When farms, the two main portions of which are a half-mile or more apart, are taken into account, the proportion of fragmented farms is over 50 per cent.  Therefore, the reason given for not extending the limit where there is a half-mile or a mile between the two main portions of the land is not valid and is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third method by which a farmer can increase his area of land is by the conacre system, which is a very popular method along the east coast and in counties like Meath and Wexford.  It is not adopted to any great extent in the West of Ireland.  It is the small farmers who use this method.  The big disadvantage <Col N="610" /> of this system is the old problem of inflation.  Grazing on conacre in Wicklow at the present time is averaging about £21 per statute acre while tillage is working out at an average of about £30 a statute acre and this figure is rising annually.  There is no longterm tenancy when land is taken in conacre.  On the expiration of the eleven months, the land is offered again and the farmer who had it in conacre the previous year has no more claim to it than anybody else and must compete for it at auction with others who want to go into the business of farming.  There may be a big increase in the price he pays, if, in fact, he gets the land at all.  On the other hand, the land may be sold for some other purpose.  In Wicklow, for instance, it may be used for building purposes. This is always a possibility in regard to land which is near the city of Dublin.  The price of land is rising. A man who lets land in conacre may continue to do so only until such time as he is ready to use it for some other purpose.  This is the obvious reason for the high cost of conacre land in a place like Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty in regard to conacre is that persons who have only a short tenancy will not be as careful in their use of the land as owners of land would be.  If there is uncertainty as to what will happen the land in the following year the tenant may not fertilise it.  The land does not get as much care and attention as it would in the case of a long tenancy or if the land were divided.</P>
    <P>The three methods whereby a small farmer in Wicklow can increase the size of his holding are not feasible at the present time.  That is why I second the motion in the name of Deputy Tully.  If the guarantee the Minister gave us last year is to be implemented, if the policy of migration must cease and other methods must be found to make small farms in the west more viable, then a whole new structure must be devised by the Land Commission for the breaking up of estates which they have at their disposal.</P>
    <P>At the present time one out of every six farmers is a part-time farmer. Almost 68 per cent of these part-time farmers operate farms of 30 acres or <Col N="611" /> less.  Of these, two-thirds earn a gross £400 or less per annum.  Farm structures must be changed so that this income level will be improved.</P>
    <P>In order that the 30-acre farms can be enlarged, we have suggested in the motion that the mile and half-mile limits must be abolished.  As Deputy Tully has said, the circumference must be increased.  We have suggested a limit of five miles.  As Deputy Tully has said, we do not intend this to be a hard and fast limit.  However, we do suggest that there should be a fairly sizable increase in the mile limit and that five miles is reasonable.  The fact that a farm may be fragmented does not represent a great problem having regard to the radical change in means of transport.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission has at the present time 55,800 acres of arable land.  At least this was the situation on 31st March last year.  We got this information in reply to a question by Deputy Corish last November.  The pool of land held by the Land Commission is showing only a slight decrease compared with five or six years ago.  The Land Commission should accelerate the rate of division of estates.  If they were to expand the limit of one mile for eligibility of applicants land division could be accelerated greatly.</P>
    <P>In last year's debate we expressed our fears that there would be pressure on the Minister to sell land to foreigners if&mdash;and I say &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash;we join EEC and that there would be greater competition for the land available to small farmers.  The Minister assured us this was not so and that the right of establishment written into the Rome Treaty which says that a citizen of any member State shall be free to move to any other member State to take up employment, develop business or acquire property there would not apply to the land of Ireland if we joined.  He went into great detail to assure us that this situation would not occur if we join EEC.  While we accepted the word of the Minister we found while we were in Strasbourg <Col N="612" /> that this belief was not borne out in conversations with members of the present EEC countries.  We talked to many parliamentarians there and it was their belief that the idea of the Community would be that once we were in the present rules would apply to us and that the only reason why land was not at present being bought by nationals of one EEC country in other EEC countries was that the price of land was rather similar all over.  A person in Germany would find land as dear, or perhaps dearer, in Holland or France so that if land became available in Germany he would prefer to buy it rather than go to any other country.  They believed that the rules as at present applying in the Common Market would allow them, if they wished, to buy land in Ireland.  The Minister will have to assure us again that this cannot be so.  I was satisfied originally with his assurance on that point but, having heard these gentlemen in Strasbourg, I am again a little worried.  I hope those who expect to expand their uneconomic holdings or increase their acreage will not have to compete for land with the present EEC countries should we become a member.</P>
    <P>The Land Commision and county committees of agriculture will have to develop a liaison so that a proper structure can be achieved for the development of the land at present available or likely to become available to the Land Commission so that division of estates can be accomplished with perhaps more co-operation and consultation than in the past.  Members of county committees of agriculture know their country and can best tell the Minister who the deserving people are.  I should like the Land Commission to develop better liaison with these committees because if the Land Commission policy is swinging away from migration the committees are the best people to consult. Should the Minister accept the Labour Party proposals these people would be the best to advise the Minister and the Land Commission as to who are the deserving landless men who should receive land.</P>
    <P>We have been told that in past years <Col N="613" /> the average number leaving agriculture is in the region of 10,000 annually.  I can only estimate that this means that between 1,500 and 2,000 farm gates close every year.  This must mean more opportunities for amalgamation of farms; and this has been the solution suggested for the problems of smaller farmers not only in the west but in counties like my own.  Should this be so, the land being vacated, obviously because people are not making a living on it whether in the west or east, the Land Commission should be trying to produce some structural reform to expand small farms.  Whether we are in or out of Europe it is accepted that the very small farmer faces a very bleak time.  On the Estimate of the Department of Lands we welcomed the move by the Land Commission to have co-operative farms started as pilot schemes so that the smaller man could use this method to increase his productivity. This is one way in which the smaller farmers can compete with larger units.  Farm partnerships or cooperatives must figure in the future if the small farm is to survive in Ireland. If this motion is adopted by the Minister, as I hope it will be, the future of the small man in farming would be assured.  It would give hope to the man who takes conacre, who now works a small farm near, but not near enough to an estate and who hopes for some change and who, perhaps, is watching this debate and having heard us raise this point before, he is perhaps hoping that something will be done for him to change the old rule which in the past has prevented him from increasing his acreage.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept some of the suggestions we have made so that there can be a change in the policy of the Land Commission.  An example of the type of problem I have in mind was the case of a farmer in my constituency who had a holding of about 48 acres.  He came to me recently because he understands that an estate within two and a half miles of his land is to be divided soon.  He had taken conacre on a farm within half a mile of that estate and it was his opinion that this gave him some right, at least, to part of the lands that are to be divided. <Col N="614" /> When his conacre lease expired he found that part of that farm had been sold already&mdash;it was sold to an engineer&mdash;and he now finds himself two and a half miles from the estate which means that under the present system his chances of being allotted a portion of the land have virtually disappeared, so that not only has he lost the conacre he had leased but he has lost also any right that he might have had to a portion of the estate.  It is people like him that we are trying to help in putting down this motion, people who are prepared to work hard and to devote their talents to the best possible utilisation of their land.</P>
    <P>The tabling of this motion was not merely a move by Deputies from the eastern part of the country to prevent migration from the west.  The Minister has told us already that this method of solving the problems of the western farmers is to be discontinued in the future.  I accept the Minister's word for that.  That very knowledgable man, Mr. John J. Scully, the western regional officer of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, has suggested that the problem of the small farmer of the west must be solved in the west.  Therefore, the present structures will have to be changed and in this motion we are suggesting a structure which should be adopted by the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>While many of the points made by the two Labour Deputies are admirable and ones with which I could agree, I must say at the outset that I differ from them on the substance of this motion.  I suppose the difference between Deputy Tully's thinking on this matter and my own thinking on it stems from the different types of constituencies that we represent.  Deputy Tully represents the constituency of County Meath which, as I understand it, is comprised mainly of big farmers.  The Deputy uses the term &ldquo;estate&rdquo; and this conveys that the type of holdings that come up for division are mostly very big ones, holdings which in our county long ago, we would have referred to as &ldquo;landlord holdings&rdquo;.  We do not have any of these holdings now for division. <Col N="615" /> Many of them that we had were divided long ago and the vast majority of our farmers have only small holdings. There are very few of these small farmers who are not entitled to be considered for more land.  I admit that some of them are unmarried but they are all good farmers in so far as the utilisation of their land is concerned. No doubt this constituency is typical of any other in the west and in so far as the Land Commission are concerned I would say that their main duty is to the West of Ireland.  The fundamental principle of the Land Commission has been to increase the lot of the small farmer and, generally, to ensure that farmers have viable holdings.  From west Cork to Donegal there are areas that are known as congested areas and in relation to congested areas I would like to point out that a rather peculiar position exists in my own county and that is that Clare, as opposed to all the other counties in the west, has three areas&mdash; Ennis rural area, Corofin rural area and Limerick rural area&mdash;which are deemed to be non-congested areas while the rest of the county is regarded as being a congested area.  This is a big disadvantage because there may be poor land in any of these areas. Although there is very good quality top limestone land in east Clare the area is deemed to be a congested area.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the benefits for those living in a congested area are much greater than for those in another area.  In respect of a non-congested area there is no half annuity and it has been the practice that the rent for those people who are migrated from a non-congested area is higher than for those from congested areas.  I mentioned this matter before but nothing has been done to remedy it. I have heard some antiquated reason for the situation to the effect that some landlords would not wish to convey the impression in their clubs in London that they were living in a very poor area.  I hope the matter will be taken up seriously in the near future. It is resulting in grave injustice to the people living in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the proposed five-mile <Col N="616" /> radius for the allotment of land such a change would present a problem in the West of Ireland that it might not present in, say, Deputy Tully's area. In fairness to Deputy Tully, he pointed out that he recommended this limit where land was still available; in other words, where there were no people within a mile radius to whom land would be given, the radius should be extended to a five-mile radius.  The position in the west is that if the radius were to be reduced to even half a mile every man within that area would have to be considered.  I would not agree with extending the mile limit. My main reason for this is that there would be a much greater volume of work for the Land Commission in relation to surveys and therefore the entire operation would, as a result, be slower and more cumbersome.  The main criticism of the Land Commission that I hear&mdash;and I hear much praise of them, too&mdash;is that they operate very slowly.  I suggest these delays are caused by the extensive surveys that have to be carried out. When land is to be divided practically every person within a mile of it has to be interviewed.  Surely if the radius were to be extended to five miles the work of the Land Commission would be increased greatly and, consequently, slowed down even more.  According to my calculations, if you take pi r² as the radius of a circle, their work, within a five-mile radius as opposed to a one-mile radius, will be multiplied 25 times.  Therefore, I could readily see a situation arising where no land would be divided at all and there would be complete dissatisfaction.  One of the main criticisms of the Land Commission is their slowness in allocating land having acquired it.  The only quick way to acquire land is either on the open market or on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Fewer and fewer places are being offered on a voluntary basis and very few places are being purchased on the open market by the Land Commission. The reason is very simple, that nobody wants land bonds.  By acquiring land with land bonds the Land Commission are doing an injustice to the people who own the land.  They may say that at 9¾ per cent land bonds are attractive <Col N="617" /> at the moment, but look at the unfortunate people who accepted land bonds nine or ten years ago.  If the Land Commission are to make any impression in the west of Ireland in regard to building up holdings, easing congestion, doing away with fragmented holdings, they must get money to purchase land.  I am an auctioneer and I deal quite a lot in land.  I know from experience that when you introduce the Land Commission as the potential customer people run a mile from you. The question of land bonds must be examined at some time.  I would appeal to the Minister to try to prevail on the Minister for Finance or to bring some pressure to bear somewhere to get a reasonable allocation of money for the Land Commission to enable them to perform the function for which they were set up.</P>
    <P>Another problem in relation to increasing the radius is that of working the land.  Having listened to the two Deputies from Labour making their case on this, I am struck by the difference between the east and the west of Ireland in relation to the working of land.  They have mentioned such things as conacre for tillage and grazing land. There is virtually no tillage in the west of Ireland except in parts of east Galway.  Dairy farming is the main occupation, and there is no need to emphasise the importance of dairy farming to the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Micheál Ó Moráin says a dairy farmer is not a farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not Micheál Ó Moráin.  I appreciate the function of dairy farmers in the economy.  They are the people who provide a substantial part of the wealth of this nation by breeding and rearing cattle, which is our main export.  When somebody says it is easy to work a fragmented holding when part of it is five miles away, that a pony or a jennet does not move any faster or slower now than five or ten years ago, this does not apply at all.  I am glad to say that most of our dairy farmers are up and coming people.  They are efficient. Most of them have a motor car and a trailer.  However, this does not make it easier to work a dairy farm when <Col N="618" /> part of it is five miles away, for the simple reason that they have built up their herds of cows to the greatest extent possible and most of them have milking machines.  As we all know, you cannot move the milking machine around in the manner that would be required for fragmented holdings. This would be completely unworkable in the west.</P>
      <P>Another factor that should be considered is the work of the unfortunate officials in the Land Commission who have to answer correspondence.  Considering the amount of correspondence that goes there from TDs, Senators and other politicians from the West of Ireland when even a small holding is about to be divided or acquired, and the amount of work that is involved in respect of holdings within a mile radius, you can imagine what fantastic correspondence there would be if the radius was five miles.  I cannot see how enough civil servants could be found even to acknowledge the letters, to the extent to which they are acknowledged&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;to the extent to which they are acknowledged&rdquo;, in the phraseology which conveys nothing. The main function of the Land Commission relates to the West of Ireland and I cannot see that that function could be carried out properly there if this motion by Deputy Tully were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh referred to the purchase of land under EEC conditions and wondered if small farmers would have to compete against the big cheque books of Germany or the other EEC countries.  As I understand it, France, which is one of the strongest agricultural countries within the EEC, exercises restrictions with regard to the purchase of land and has been successful in exercising these restrictions. Therefore I see no reason why we should not impose restrictions and even persist with the one which does not permit an alien to purchase a holding of more than five acres without the sanction of the Land Commission.  I am sure when people become fully aware <Col N="619" /> of the restrictions on the purchase of land within the EEC, the fears they have in this connection will be dispelled from their minds.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy Tully on the point he raised in regard to the small farmer who has taken a job and who, in the main, is not considered by the Land Commission when land is being allocated.  I know many very good small farmers who have taken a job to supplement their small farm earnings.  Most of these people put their savings into improving their land and I know that if they were given an allocation of land they would give up their employment and would be fulltime farmers.  Their roots are very firmly implanted in the land and it is very wrong that the Land Commission, when allotting land, should exclude these very hard-working young men who having got a small holding are prepared to take a job and work the land during their free time.  It is a grave injustice to exclude them from any consideration.  I agree with Deputy Tully on this very valid point. I wonder if this extending of the mile radius to a five-mile radius is general Labour Party policy.  If it is I am afraid it will not be any more acceptable in the West of Ireland at the next election than it was at the last election when there was no Labour representative returned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is worthy of serious consideration.  It states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, in view of the change in forms of transport, etc. since the Land Commission decided to confine allocations of land to landless men living within half a mile of an estate and to uneconomic holders living within one mile of an estate being divided, all suitable applicants living within five miles of an estate being divided should, where possible, be alocated land on that estate.</P>

      <P>I suppose there is very little difference between the Land Commission and the Minister for Lands.  He makes the policy and they carry it out.  It is the duty of the Minister for Lands and of the Land Commission to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  I admit that the people in the West of Ireland have their problems.  At one time they were driven from the good land of Ireland, and I suppose it was to hell or to Connaught with them.  At the same time I am more in favour of the Minister's plan, which has been agreed on and supported by all parties, that the Government should try to provide in the West of Ireland work in factories, forestry, drainage and tourism to supplement their income and to help them to remain on their own farms.  That is not to say that they are the only people who should be considered by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year on this Estimate the Minister stated that out of 137 people who had got land in Meath 130 were still there.  They are quite welcome.  The majority of them are excellent farmers.  Unfortunately they did not get enough land in the past and many of them had to emigrate to England and leave their wives and families to manage their farms.  As Deputy Tully <Col N="621" /> said, today with tractors and modern machines distance makes very little difference.  I agree with Deputy Tully and Deputy Barrettt that acceptance of this motion would make extra work for the local inspectors, because instead of interviewing people inside the mile they would have to go a three, four or five mile radius.  Deputy Tully stated that if there are sufficient applicants inside the mile there is no necessity to go two, three, four or five miles. As regards the purchase of land it would make a great difference.</P>
    <P>Deputations from County Westmeath have gone to the Minister as many as six times and we are told that there is not enough congestion inside the mile radius there.  This is completely wrong.  The aim and object of the Minister for Lands and the Department of Lands should be to get the maximum amount of land into the hands of the Land Commission before we enter the EEC.  The Minister for Lands can safeguard farmers' rights under legislation, providing it does not differentiate against foreigners, to protect the small farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>In one particular case in County Westmeath the owner of a large acreage of land is quite willing to give it to the Land Commission but the Commissioners tell us that there are not enough applicants inside the mile radius.  In a case like this they should have authority to go as far as five miles and to take into consideration the number of congests over that area.  If they did that in this particular case it would provide economic holdings for up to perhaps 40 people.  Deputy Kavanagh said that 10,000 people are leaving the land of Ireland every year.  Many of those are young and ambitious people and people who will not accept low living standards and limited opportunities.  At the same time they are the people who have most to contribute towards building up a healthy rural community.  We can ill afford to lose those people.  Those of us who have been associated with athletic clubs, hurling clubs and football clubs in rural Ireland in the past have seen those young men emigrate.</P>

      <P>I was speaking earlier about the position of Ballycastle School, County Mayo, and I read a letter to the Department from the Ballycastle Development Committee and from the sisters there in relation to the position into which the Department have put the people of Ballycastle. I would at this time ask the Minister to reconsider this position. According to departmental regulations a decision has been taken whereby certain schools must be closed.  Have we <Col N="623" /> any faith in our own country?  Am I convinced that from now on the west of Ireland will die?  On the contrary, I am convinced, as an elected Deputy from the west of Ireland, that the population of that area will increase tremendously in the next ten years.  I am firmly convinced of this despite what people tell me.  When we enter the EEC I can see every square inch of land in the west developed and producing something which will be an asset to our economy.  I cannot understand why the Minister and his Department should now cut off a senior cycle from a school in a small town in north Mayo. I can assure the Minister that, if he goes ahead with this proposal, the reaction to his party in that particular area will be 100 per cent against him. All the public representatives there were at the meeting.  I appeal to him now to reconsider his decision.  Surely he could give them at least another five years and, if something does not happen, then remove the senior cycle.  The people are seriously concerned about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where primary schools are concerned, there is a tendency to amalgamate sechools in several parts of the county.  Some amalgamations have been very successful and there have been no protests.  However, I want to draw the Minister's attention to one particular school.  Deputy Flanagan, the Minister for Lands, and I attended a meeting which was called for the purpose of keeping Creevagh school open.  There were 35 children on the roll and that school was kept open; today I saw an advertisement for an assistant teacher there.  There is another school on the other side of Crossmolina with an average of 42 pupils on the roll.  An effort was made to close this school.  The elected representatives, the parents and the children had a meeting and the Minister and his Department decided the school would stay open.  Right beside me the school in Derrough was amalgamated with Clogheen.  Strong representations were made to the Minister by everybody concerned to keep that school open.  There were 45 children on the roll.  The Minister and his Department saw fit to close it.  I demand an explanation <Col N="624" /> as to why a school with 33 or 35 pupils on the roll is kept open while a school with 45 pupils on the roll is closed.  At the moment considerable development is taking place in Claremorris.  This school was only 2½ miles from Claremorris and in the next three to five years I could see as many as 60 or 70 children attending that school.  Why were two schools kept open?  Why was this particular school closed?  I demand an explanation. If there is a change of Government in my time I will see to it that this position is rectified.  I have hope in the west.  I have hope in my area and I do not like to see schools like this being closed.  This appears to me to be victimisation.</P>
    <P>There are several national schools in my constituency which have no running water and only dry toilets.  The Church of Ireland school in Ballina is in that position.  Will the Minister be honest with the people and tell them straight if the money is not there to provide these amenities?</P>
    <P>There are school which need extensions. The school in Balla needs an extra classroom to accommodate the children from Prizon.  The question is: why the Department insisted on amalgamation in this case when they did not have enough accommodation? There was sufficient accommodation for the Balla children but not enough accommodation for the other children. Surely schools should be kept open until the accommodation problem has been solved.  Keeping the schools open would not have cost anything extra.</P>
    <P>Transport is supposed to be provided. Now I have here a letter signed by the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary. It reads:</P>
    <P>You made representations to me on behalf of Mr. Patrick Dunleavy, Mr. Patrick Smyth and Mr. James Kilkenny, Derrough, Kilkelly, with a view to the provision of free transport for their children to Kilkelly National School.</P>
    <P>The matter has been investigated, and no child was found to be eligible for free transport under the conditions of the free transport scheme.</P>
    <P>In order to warrant the setting up <Col N="625" /> of a transport service to a national school the number of eligible children in any locality must be sufficient to sustain a minimum daily average of 10 eligible children being conveyed, each term.  Eligible children are chillren between 4-10 years of age who have a distance of at least two miles to travel to their nearest suitable national school, and children older than that who have a distance of at least three miles to travel to such a school.</P>
    <P>The investigation also revealed that none of these families reside in the former Shammer school district and that the older children of the Kilkenny and Dunleavy families did not attend Shammer prior to it's closure in 1965.</P>
    <P>All the Kilkenny children for generations past have attended Shammer national school.  Two Kilkenny children were on the roll.  Why was that particular school closed?  I know the Minister does not really know the position. These things are happening and I draw them now to his attention.  I hope he will deal with them.  There is quite serious trouble so far as transport is concerned.  I have the greatest respect for Department regulations. People must abide by regulations. Sometimes regulations, in so far as they affect my county, appear to be dishonest. In a townland in County Mayo there are four or five families living within a radius of 100 yards.  The children of one family get free school transport.  There should be elasticity in the regulations so that all the children in that townland get free transport.</P>
    <P>In County Mayo there are several schools which are doing a wonderful job.  In so far as vocational education is concerned I must compliment the teachers.  I am not an educationalist but I feel that the members of the commission concerned with education some years ago made a great mistake. Extensions should have been built to the secondary schools in order to provide vocational education.  If that had been done we would have saved millions of pounds.  In Ballyhaunis and Kiltimagh the children in the vocational school are denied access to the <Col N="626" /> senior cycle.  I am not blaming the present Minister for this.</P>
    <P>We should not have two sets of teachers' organisations.  We should not have vocational and secondary education.  The people planning the education of this country should have looked at the economics of the situation. If they had done so, we would not have teachers' strikes.  There may be another strike soon.  What will the children who are hoping to sit for their leaving certificate do if they feel that their papers will not be corrected? The vocational, primary and secondary teachers in my area are first-class people.  They are all doing a good job.</P>
    <P>I live in a small town with a population of less than 2,000 people.  We have three first-class schools&mdash;the vocational school, the convent school and the secondary school.  Are the Department right in having three schools here?  This should be examined.  A man earning £5,000 a year should not be entitled to free education for his child.  He should be paying £15 or £20 a term for him.  His child might have more respect for him if he did so.  I feel in all sincerity that if this money was collected and made available for the extension of our universities it would be better.  I have a son working day and night to get to university.  The leaving certificate has been upgraded so much that it is probably equivalent to a BA or something like that.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to a problem in connection with vocational education in County Mayo.  I have a letter from a boy attending the regional technical college. It reads:</P>
    <P>My problem is concerned with the distribution of grants tenable at the new Regional Technical Colleges by the Mayo Vocational Education Committee.  I feel that I am being discriminated against by the existence of a clause which says that I must have passes in two applied science subjects in my Leaving Certificate, a clause which effectively eliminates me and every other secondary school pupil in the county from the grant. The fact that rate payers' money is being used should entitle every <Col N="627" /> student to the grant and not the chosen few, the vocational students.</P>
    <P>I am doing a course in business studies in the Regional Technical College, Athlone, and have passes in more subjects in the Leaving Certificate than are required either by this college itself or by the Department's scheme for the grant having got passes in Geography, Latin, Mathematics, Physics, Irish (higher paper) and honours in Economics and English.</P>
    <P>The fact that I am the eldest of a family of four, my father is dead, so my mother has to look after our farm, puts extra strain on our family which would certainly be alleviated by my securing a grant.</P>
    <P>Finally I think that if a vocational student with a bare pass in his Leaving Certificate secures a grant while a secondary school student does not, the student with the grant may not be capable of going through with his higher education, but instead drop out, thereby lowering the prestige of Mayo schools, both secondary and vocational, and students who may have been capable of getting their qualifications and thereby increase in some way the wealth of Mayo have been left unaided.</P>
    <P>Trusting that you will look into the matter, and that something can be done about this situation.</P>
    <P>I have letters from two students about this.  The letter I have quoted is from a boy whose mother has only ten acres of land.  His father was killed in a road accident.  It is hard to think that he cannot get a grant to one of these schools.  He has asked me to raise this matter and I have done so in order to bring to the notice of the Minister the position that has arisen in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>We had a vacancy for a headmaster in the vocational school in Kiltimagh recently I do not know whether the Minister's Department is involved in this or not but a few of his inspectors certainly would be.  The appointment was made and the man appointed was a man from outside the county.  After getting the appointment, this man <Col N="628" /> dropped out.  We have sufficient people within our county capable of taking up such an appointment and I greatly resent the suggestion that we have not got people in our county who are qualified for such posts.  This is also resented by the vocational teachers organisation in County Mayo and I hope this kind of thing will never happen again.</P>

      <P>The fact that the Minister's Estimate amounts to almost £83½ million speaks well for the part which education plays in our whole set of values in this country.  At the same time, we must not be complacent because we spend £83½ million on such an important subject as education and it has been asked here whether in spending such an amount of money on education we have a real philosophy of education.  Do we know where we are going and are we doing it by <i>ad hoc</i> means, a sort of start and jump policy, which we have never really matched up to that of other countries of comparable size and wealth?</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the speeches of Opposition spokesmen on education to any person outside this country must give a very strange picture of what happens in Irish schools.  I believe that we have a policy and a philosophy of education and, while I do not want to make this a party issue, I feel that the Fianna Fáil Party, from its foundation, and the Fianna Fáil Government have always given education a very top priority, and rightly so.  We have produced some very great Ministers for Education and, while it is invidious to mention names, I take the risk of mentioning two, the late Seán Moylan and the late Donagh O'Malley.  One could apply the story of Moses to this as a parallel, in the fact that Moses led his people to the sight of the Promised Land and then died, Joshua being left with the leadership, to achieve the goal which both of them had always held and believed in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers for Education in Fianna Fáil Governments share the same ideals of education as the men I have mentioned and as did the founders of the party.  It has always been the policy of the party to press forward at the <Col N="629" /> highest possible rate towards achieving the best possible system of education. The present Minister is just as able and as adequate to the task as were his predecessors.  He has had perhaps a much rougher time in the last year because of the fact that he put forward proposals for the establishment of community schools and other changes in the educational system.  For these he was maligned, threatened, picketed and all the rest.  Yet in respect of the action of a man who one felt had something good and honest about him, be it said with shame of some of the Labour Party and Fine Gael spokesmen on education that they have introduced a sectarian note, the Fine Gael spokesman on education having the audacity to say that they would not accept the Minister's plans unless they guaranteed religious freedom for both Catholics and Protestants.  Speaking here as a Member of the Fianna Fáil Party, I want to say that never in the history of our party can anyone suggest there was any bigotry or sectarian outlook on our party and we reject the claim of Fine Gael to being the champions of religious freedom.</P>
    <P>Since the inception of this party we have been made up of men and women of different creeds and we take pride in the fact that we represent a wide spectrum of society.  We have all classes and creeds in our party and there is no need for any man to stand up here, as the Fine Gael spokesman did, and put himself forward as the champion of religious freedom.  This will be rejected by both Protestants and Catholics as a mere vote-catching stunt and an insult to the intelligence of the Protestants, Catholics, Jews and any other persuasions we have in the country.  We are not going to get a healthy educational system if we are to have it debated with a view to catching votes. We have to be honest with ourselves and seek to get the best possible system. If today the youth are so cynical and so sceptical about Parliament and the Establishment, there is nothing that makes them more sceptical and cynical than claims such as the Fine Gael claim that they will stand as the guardians of religious freedom.  They know that in this country there is <Col N="630" /> no need for that.  We may do a lot of things here, but in this part of the country we have succeeded in showing that we appreciate that each man has a right to adore God in his own way and never at any time have we tried to legislate, nor would we do so, against a man's beliefs.</P>
    <P>We have made strides, especially in the last five years, in the educational field; but the fact is that we cannot stand still and become complacent.  It is not the intention of the Government, or of this party anyway, that we should ever become complacent, because all the time the system is changing and the whole structure of life is changing. Twenty or 25 years ago when people were leaving school, they went into a job eventually if they could get one, and then stopped learning.  Today because of the more affluent society we have, when the vast majority of people leave the primary school, they take post-primary education and many but not enough go on to university.  In the last 30 years society has changed much for the better in this country and in much of Europe but we are still in this period of change and, therefore, our educational establishments must be geared towards change for the better so that we can offer further educational facilities to young people who wish to pursue their education and who have the ability to do so.</P>
    <P>It was inevitable that some hard words should have been said about our educational system.  It might be said that this House has failed in its approach to educational policy when we hear Deputy Desmond say that any Minister for Education, whether in the Six Counties or in Britain, is better than our Minister.  He referred to Mrs. Margaret Thatcher&mdash;I assume she is the British Minister for Education&mdash;and Captain Long, the Northern Minister for Education; according to the Deputy both are much more progressive than our Minister.</P>
    <P>For some time past Deputy Desmond has been pursuing the line that Fianna Fáil are bigots, that we must be watched or otherwise we will perpetrate terrible things on the minority.  I challenge Deputy Desmond on this <Col N="631" /> point but, of course, he is well aware that his statements are not true.  It suits his purpose to make such statements in this House and outside it.  This gives valuable ammunition to people outside this country; they can refer to such statements and say they were made in our Parliament.  These statements, although they are untrue, do considerable damage to this country at a time when we are making every effort to perfect the educational system here. We do not mind honest criticism but we are entitled to expect that the criticism would be based on truth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien made an amazing speech.  In volume 259, at column 247 of the Official Report, he stated:</P>
    <P>In some of our schools we are turning out little IRA.  That is a problem at which we have, I think, to look.  Some of the people concerned in these movements are teachers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has accused teachers of teaching the children to become members of an illegal organisation.  At column 246 of the same volume, the Deputy stated:</P>
    <P>Specifically let me put this question&mdash;I put it in no light spirit&mdash; were the seeds of Aldershot sown in some Irish classroom?</P>
    <P>I presume he is referring to the terrible happening at the British Army barracks last week when seven people were brutally killed in an explosion. Deputy FitzGerald, the Fine Gael spokesman on education, said: &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;.  I am not sure if Deputy FitzGerald meant that he believed Deputy Cruise-O'Brien or whether he approved of it.  One can imagine the use that will be made of such statements by the British propaganda service.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members in this House were educated in Irish schools and that they know the kind of schools we have here.  I was educated in a poor part of the city but it had one advantage in that it was a mixed area with people of different religions.  However, there was no bigotry; the Protestant children were as poor as we were, and our time was occupied in trying <Col N="632" /> to live.  This is my background and I resent all the more this statement from Deputy Cruise-O'Brien who has been given many advantages by the society he attacks.  I would ask him to come out and name the schools who are training boys to become members of an illegal organisation.  At column 247 of the same volume he stated:</P>
    <P>I should be just as concerned if I knew my children at a young impressionable age were being taught Irish history from a Sinn Féin or IRA point of view.  If I knew they were being indoctrinated in this fashion I should be literally just as concerned as I would be if I knew they were in contact with people who were pushing drugs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien said that he does not want any witch-hunt although he has attacked the Irish teachers by saying they are training young people to become members of an illegal organisation.</P>
    <P>He also quoted Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin who was a good hand at witch-hunts, but he does the Senator proud when he attacks the Irish teachers.  It is strange that nobody in this House has taken up the challenge on behalf of the teachers, although it may come later.  The Minister is a teacher and I hope that in his reply he will have something to say about this slander.  The Deputy did not say if the teachers were Catholic or Protestant, lay teachers or clerics, He said he did not want to generalise but this is what he did.  To suggest that anyone would teach young people to place bombs in Aldershot or any place else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Unlike Deputy Cruise-O'Brien I did not go to secondary school or university but I do not begrudge him the chance he had. I received my education in primary and vocational schools.  I know the teachers were dedicated people who worked hard to ensure that their pupils became good citizens.  This is the thanks that they get for their efforts.</P>
      <P>Out of the great contributions from Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy Desmond and Deputy Cruise-O'Brien we may learn a little about all the trouble that was created regarding the Minister's proposals some time ago.  People are seeing through the haze of sectarian propaganda and I am glad that the Minister has succeeded in getting across the message of truth.  Having said that, I wish to offer some criticism of the Minister and his Department.</P>

      <P>The English boy is taught that, if he goes to Eton or Harrow, he will become an officer and a gentleman, and he must go out then and subdue the lesser breeds.  I do not intend to criticise the English educational system.  Strangely enough I think parts of their educational system are excellent.  I do not think we should have a tirade from Deputy Cruise-O'Brien on the education in our schools, or a speech from Deputy Desmond lauding the British Tory Minister for Education and Captain Long in the North.  I do not know whether these people are competent.  I presume they must have some competence to have achieved their posts.  I object to the suggestion that they are far ahead of our Department.</P>
      <P>My criticism is that the Minister should review the possibility of establishing an open university.  Most other countries in the world are doing this. This would be of tremendous help to the expansion of education and a tremendous amount of money could be saved.  The idea of an open university has been examined but I would urge the Minister to have it examined further.  It has great possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have done very little about adult <Col N="635" /> education.  I want to say a very unpopular thing now because it is very unpopular today to praise a religious order.  The extra mural courses in University College, Dublin, were started by the Jesuits.  Were it not for the Jesuits, thousands of men and women in this city who had only primary certificate education would never have been admitted through the doors of Earlsfort Terrace.  Twenty years ago or more that great Jesuit, Father E.J. Coyne, pioneered classes in adult education.  They are still going ahead. It may be suggested that the subjects being taught were more academic than practical.  Adult education must be more than doing a course on the value of antiques.  We must go on perfecting ourselves in the educational sphere.</P>
    <P>We are also very much behind in the education of handicapped people.  We could do a great deal more for people who are physically and mentally handicapped.  I appreciate what is being done, but I do not think enough is being done.  We are inclined to drag our feet and say we must make sure we have enough classes to cater for the boys and girls who are taking post-primary education.  This is a big consideration. We must have a system under which each person, irrespective of his age or background, will have the opportunity of acquiring new knowledge and perfecting himself and becoming a better citizen.</P>
    <P>I heard criticism here to the effect that parents are not involved enough in the education of their children.  This is complete poppycock.  When we consider the sacrifices they are prepared to make to send their children to post-primary schools and to university, we realise what they are prepared to do. The home and the school are the two great training places for our youth. With a good family background and a good educational system there is no reason why we should not be as well educated as the Europeans.</P>
    <P>I often think that we should gear our educational system towards the West German system.  The Germans were beaten to their knees at the end of the Second World War but, by their hard work, they have resurrected themselves <Col N="636" /> financially and economically and educationally.  Today Germany is one of the leading countries in Europe, despite the fact that it is still partitioned. The Germans have done such a good job that thousands are trying to come across from East Berlin into the West because of the superior way of life there.  I know the cynics can only say that they would not be so superior if the Americans had not poured money into Germany.  This is quite true. American generosity has helped.  The spirit of the German people provided the Free University of Berlin and their other famous universities.  Their educational system was geared towards helping their citizens to build up their country from the ruins of 1945 to the affluent society of today.</P>
    <P>I imagine that the Germans stress what we call vocational education. They do not suffer, as we do in some respects, from a touch of snobbishness. A boy going into a white collar job is looked upon as being superior to the boy working with his hands in some trade.  This is a fault of the Irish, perhaps because of an inferiority complex. There are parents who think that their boy should be a doctor and they force him into that profession.  If he could take an aptitude test earlier on, the boy could show where his potential lay, whether in the professions, or as a motor mechanic, or a carpenter, or a bricklayer, and the parents would accept that.  This is the choice we should be able to give to our young people.  This is the choice the young Germans have.</P>
    <P>I was at an exhibition in the magnificent town hall in Copenhagan one September at which all the professions and trades were represented.  A boy or girl could go in there and be given full information on the prospects in any profession or trade.  I served on the Dublin Vocational Education Committee for many years and I know there are aptitude tests but I think they are on a very limited scale.  They must be widened.</P>
    <P>We have the two colleges of technology in Kevin Street and in Bolton Street of which we can be justly proud.  The people have put money into these two colleges.  They are paying <Col N="637" /> excellent dividends, not financial dividends perhaps.  From Bolton Street we have got some of the leading architects in the city.  I would hope that whenever the merger between Dublin University and University College, Dublin, comes about, a place will be found for these two colleges in the new university of Dublin.  They should not be left out on their own.  They should become part of the new university.</P>
    <P>Physical education is at last being given its rightful place.  However, a teacher told me recently that he went to purchase equipment and could not obtain it.  It is not yet realised that physical education is just as important as academic education.  The Minister, when replying to the debate, might tell the House what plans he has for the promotion of physical education in schools and for providing properly equipped gymnasia in schools.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have another look at some technical and vocational schools.  In my constituency there is one which was built at the turn of the century as a school of navigation. This school has become decrepit. The roof leaks.  There is ground damp. The teachers and pupils perform wonderful work despite these drawbacks. For at least ten years I have been asking Ministers for Education to have the school rebuilt.  I refer to Ringsend School in the Port of Dublin.  I make a special plea for this school, not because it is in my constituency, but because it is one of the oldest schools in existence and requires complete overhaul or should be demolished and rebuilt.  The same may apply in the case of other schools.  I would ask the Minister to make the decision this year to have this school rebuilt.</P>
    <P>I would hope that when we are discussing the Estimate for Education next year we will be doing so in a calmer atmosphere than we have at the moment and that we will not have Deputies like Deputy Desmond, who joins us now, or Deputy Cruise-O'Brien&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In his introductory statement the Minister has given an account of his stewardship and has made predictions as to what will happen in the future. I do not want to praise the Minister while he is in the House but, last year, when things were rough, he showed that he was as dedicated as his predecessors were to the task of providing a good system of education.</P>
      <P>There have been very good contributions from some Members of the House designed to help in producing a proper system of education.  Unless our system of education is such that it suits our beliefs and aspirations, it will fail. We do not want a system which will produce boys and girls who are copies of those in a nearby island.  We want a system which will produce good men and women who will play their part in a European society.  The basis is laid in the home.  The rest is the responsibility of our teachers.  I should like once more to voice my appreciation of the work being done by the teachers, regardless of the slanders made on them in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall speak as briefly and as sensibly as I can on this very important Estimate.  I had no intention of intervening in the debate but, having regard to the discussion that has taken place, I feel it my duty to voice my opinion on the subject of education.</P>
      <P>When we discuss education we must parse and analyse what we mean by education.  To some, education means studying Euclid, to others it means Shakespeare, to others it means studying the writings of some numbskull that were completely illogical and remote from reality and which should never have been introduced into any school curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My idea of education is that it should inculcate commonsense, a sense of reality.  The curriculum should be so designed as to produce a student <Col N="639" /> who can think for himself and who can come to a decision.  The whole system of education should be designed so as to produce the best in every student and to direct him into the vocation for which he is most suited.  Every educational opportunity should be provided to prepare students for their place in society.</P>
    <P>We all know persons who were in the national school up to the day that they were confirmed and who then went out into the world and were a great deal better than those who may have had every possible university degree but who could not make up their minds as to what day of the week it was.  I know young boys and girls who, on leaving school, had the commonsense to know what the world is all about and how they should live their lives.</P>
    <P>I do not know who it was who got the far-fetched idea that the small primary school is a thing of the past and that the village schoolmaster, of whom Goldsmith wrote, was a thing of the past.  The day has gone of the wonder &ldquo;How one small head could carry all he knew&rdquo;.  Now we have to believe what some nitwit or numbskull may have written.  My translation of the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; is &ldquo;reality&rdquo;, ability to face facts and to make a decision and not to run away from reality and to hide behind some quotation from something written 50 or 100 years ago.  Our young people should be so educated that they can make independent judgments and not have to rely on others to tell them what is right and what is wrong.</P>
    <P>Here we come back to the primary school, the small unit where boys and girls are mixed, perhaps, 50 or 60 or even 100 in some dilapidated shacks of schools 100 years old or more without any facilities except playgrounds of rough cobblestones.  Because of the lack of the money that should have been put into these schools we now have the bright idea of herding all the children into one big building.  They will get the morning bus at 8 a.m., be carted to school and be carted back at 6 p.m. They will go home and do their exercises, go to bed and begin again <Col N="640" /> the next day.  That is not education or a proper foundation for life.  We are overlooking the education and example of parents at home.  That seems to be going and to me that is the tragedy of the nation at present.</P>
    <P>In my day we went home and did our exercises.  We asked fathers or mothers the answers to our problems and the family got together around the kitchen table by the light of an oil lamp because there was no electricity then.  Each one helped the other.  I had two elder brothers and when they moved on a class their books passed down the line.  Now, every other year pounds and pounds are spent on books. The book which cost £5 last year goes into the wastepaper basket this year and you pay £5 for another book.  We must object to this if we are to bring education back to what it should be.</P>
    <P>Leaving primary schools, we go on to the secondary schools.  Let me be recorded as saying that my primary education by the Christian Brothers in Limerick cost one penny a week.  I paid one penny every Sunday morning when we had class from 10 to 11 a.m. I and my two brothers were educated for 3d a week because of the sacrifices then made by the Irish Christian Brothers. They refused to be taken over; they kept their independence and taught us to be good Irishmen.  Whatever they say about the gun or bomb at the present time most of them gave us a true background of Irish history and the sufferings of previous generations in preserving and practising their religion. Even when they were out under hedges and bushes teaching they did it by sacrificing themselves.  Let nobody detract from or deny the work that the Christian Brothers and the nuns of Ireland have done in education.</P>
    <P>The takeover brigade is now moving in to take over the schools, colleges and grounds that were hard-earned. Every penny earned by these primary and secondary teachers, male and female, in the Orders went into the common purse for the development of the school or convent to which they were attached.  They lived frugally all those years.  I shall not stand by idly and see their property being practically <Col N="641" /> confiscated.  One convent is told: Have the inter-certificate examination and then you are finished.  Some other convent elsewhere will take over from you and they will do the leaving certificate.&rdquo; This is what we object to and this is where the crunch will come because these people have a right to their property which was not obtained by means of grants for secondary schools.  They earned money for the work they gave the State and they educated our children.  They educated me and many like me.  I am sure the Minister had this experience.  I do not know his age but we had to go through it in my time.  It is sad that people should come into this House and deny these people their rightful place in the building of the Republic which we now enjoy.  I should be lacking in my duty if I did not say this.</P>
    <P>We talk of free education which is a wonderful thing if it can be given but I do not know of anything free: somebody must pay.  It has been said here in the past ten years or so that we must have free education.  What is the entrance fee for matriculation this year?  I have a daughter doing this examination this year and I had to give her £7 for the entrance fee last week.  I did the matriculation and it cost nothing and I passed it, luckily, or by the grace of God.  Anybody with children going to school, particularly to secondary or post-primary schools&mdash; if we wish to be high-toned; they will always be secondary schools to me&mdash; knows that the cost of books has gone beyond the capacity of any working parent to provide.  I know of no reason why the old system of passing the books down the line, year after year, should not be carried on.  But that is over.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the necessity for the small school as near the home as possible. While students get certain educational development by means of the blackboard and chalk they get better education from their parents' example and in seeing how they live and make ends meet.  That is as important as Euclid or Shakespeare.  I am against carting children ten, 12 or 15 miles away each morning, having them out <Col N="642" /> all day, wet, as often as not, carting them back at night to do their exercises, then going to bed and repeating the same routine indefinitely.  That is not education.  We cannot build a nation on those lines.</P>
    <P>I happen to be a member of a vocational education committee which was once dissolved prior to my time.  Prior to that, 20 years ago or more, I was a member of a vocational education committee.  I can see a great future ahead of us in this field of education.</P>
    <P>In Limerick we have been hindered in our advance programmes for our boys and girls because of lack of money.  Schemes have to be set aside because of this lack.  At all levels of education, from primary up, there should be much more emphasis placed on career guidance so that young people will be channelled into whatever sphere to which their talents and particular leanings are best suited. Particular emphasis should be placed on the skills, whether they are the &ldquo;wet&rdquo; skills or the &ldquo;dry&rdquo; skills.  By &ldquo;wet&rdquo; skills I mean skills that are used out of doors&mdash;for example, masonry and bricklaying&mdash;while by &ldquo;dry&rdquo; skills I mean the indoor ones such as panel beating and so on.  Those with an academic bent will be all right if they obtain the necessary number of honours in their leaving certificate to qualify them for admission to the university, but what of those who may get their leaving certificate but who may get honours in one subject only? Such a person will probably have to take any old job.  For instance, he or she may have to work in a shop, which occupation rarely offers any prospects for advancement.  Apart from that fact that person will be of little benefit to the nation in the sense of productivity.</P>
    <P>There should be more stress laid on vocational and technical education than on secondary education.  It is from the vocational schools that we get people who are skilled and who will be productive in the manufacture of goods both for home consumption and for the export market.  Regarding those who graduate from the universities I would say, from my experience, that at least 50 per cent of them have <Col N="643" /> to emigrate.  Why should we spend taxpayers' money in qualifying people for the various professions when we know that they will have to leave the country and, consequently, will be of benefit to some other nation?  That is a false economic approach.  There is no dividend to be got from it.</P>
    <P>We, on the Vocational Committee in Limerick, got an ultimatum some months ago telling us that we were not to incur any more expense.  The position at present is that we cannot buy as much as a packet of envelopes. There is no money for the purchase of up-to-date machines for any of our classes such as the radio school, which is sponsored by the Marconi Electric Company.  However, all we can do is continue to do our best in spite of the decrepit old machines that the boys must use and which should have been scrapped years ago.</P>
    <P>It is not what one does that counts but how one does it.  Speaking for myself, I received a good secondary education and obtained honours in my leaving certificate, but much more important to me was what I learned from the everyday life in my own home. That is what has helped me in my own approach to life.  Most of what I learned at school has been forgotten.  I can remember standing up in class and having to repeat many times what Shakespeare wrote about Hamlet or some other old God-damn fool who lived in the mythical past.  I am a man of reality at all times.  I suppose it is that quality that gets me into so much trouble, but that is how I am made.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister and his Department that the whole approach to education will have to be examined.  We must have regard to what is to be the position of the finished article.  We must ask ourselves in what spheres are our boys and girls to take their places in this nation.  The channelling of talents into the various spheres is a task for the schools, primary, secondary and vocational. Of course, teaching is a vocation and not everyone has the patience to sit in a classroom with a large number of children.  When I was at school there were about a hundred others in <Col N="644" /> a room that was divided into two sections. If only half of them were anything like me, I do not know how the Christian Brothers tolerated us, but I got many a good wallop on the palms of the hands.  I am nothing the worse for that because such punishment trained me to have discipline in my life.</P>
    <P>Although I cannot support this argument, I would say that the crime being committed today in our towns and cities and throughout the country generally is a result of discontinuation of disciplinary measures in schools.  I am not advocating that children should be flogged, but they must be disciplined. There have been instances of teachers having been brought to court because they slapped some of their pupils.  The result of the withdrawal of such disciplinary measures is that our jails and reformatory schools are now not adequate to accommodate the number of people that are being committed to them for breaches of the law. Last week in Limerick we had a tragic case of four young boys being committed to a reformatory school where it was found that they could not be accommodated because the school was full to capacity.  Each of us must be subject to a certain amount of discipline regardless of whether we belong to a political party or anything else. From an early age children must be taught that they cannot do as they wish.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to a very important matter and that is the treatment of the unfortunate handicapped children.  I happen to be a member of a finance committee for the handicapped children of Limerick city and we find it necessary to go around the city collecting for this cause.  We must raise money in any way possible so as to keep a school going.  About five years ago we organised a crazy football game and from the proceeds of that we bought a minibus so that the handicapped children of the city could be collected and taken to the school which was provided for us by the Bishop of Limerick, Dr. Murphy, who, in his charity, sent two nuns from the Sisters of Charity to be trained in this particular type of education.  We must provide speech therapy classes and so <Col N="645" /> on to help these children to take their place in society.  This effort requires a great deal of money as well as much patience, and what we get from the Department would not run our school for three months of the year.</P>
    <P>These unfortunate people were the cupboard children of long ago.  They were put into a tea-chest in the corner of the kitchen and left there to jump and scream and do all the other things connected with their affliction.  When people came to the house the tea-chest was taken out of the kitchen and put into a room at the back.  Thank goodness this affliction has now come out into the open, but not enough.  We in the Western Health Board are making a survey of the needs for the development and education of all the handicapped children within our area.</P>
    <P>Some parents are still reluctant to declare that one of these children is in the house but they are gradually coming around to realise that these are human beings the same as everyone else and that their condition can be improved.  If the Minister visits any of these schools he will see what it means to be handicapped.  These children are happy in their own way, but they can be developed perhaps, not to a normal degree but to the extent that they can perform routine, repetitive work.  Sheltered workshops can be built, as we are doing in Limerick.  The Brothers of Charity are building a school there beside an industrial estate.  The children who are trained at the workshop attain a certain amount of independence.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I raised with the Minister last week was the question of the group certificate.  A boy cannot get into AnCO until he is 18 years of age.  Some boys are more advanced than others.  I know of a boy of 16 years of age who has secured a group certificate but AnCO will not take him until he is 18.  He has gone away to do some menial job behind a shop counter in Limerick, although he wants to devote his talents to skilled electrical work for which he has a flair.  I discussed this problem with one of the most skilled men in the business in the city of Limerick. <Col N="646" /> He was a German who came over here at the time of the Shannon scheme in 1927.  He told me he started to serve his time in Germany at 14 years of age and he was finished at 19, by which time he had a man's wage.  They start here at 18 and do not finish until they are 23.  He said he saw no reason why a boy of 16 who had the necessary qualifications, namely, the group certificate or the intermediate certificate, should not be allowed into the trade.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take another look at AnCO from whose work I see very little.  Boys who have gone through the system of career guidance and who are ready for training should be allowed pursue whatever course suits them.  The boy at 16 years of age is more amenable than at 18. I hope the Minister will review the position here.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister and his predecessor for what they have done for Limerick in relation to the school of higher education, and to pay a particular tribute to its director, Dr. Ned Walsh.  He is an Irishman married to an Irish girl, who came back to Ireland for less than half of what he was earning because he wanted to live here.  It looked at first as if he was being frustrated.  Things were not moving as fast as he wanted them to move.  However, as a result of agitation by the parents and the public representatives in Limerick, the school will be ready to open in September or sooner.  He has got around him a team of teachers who like himself, came back to this country to work for less than half what they could earn elsewhere. Credit is due to the men who have started the school of higher education in Limerick.  It is hoped that the school of physical education will be ready by September and that there will be 1,000 boys in that institution.</P>
    <P>All this has been achieved because of a dedicated man, Dr. Ned Walsh, and because we the citizens worked hard for it.  We even hired a special train from Limerick and paraded down to Talbot Street during Deputy Colley's term as Minister for Education to protest and to fight for what we got.  However, I want to see that no obstacles will <Col N="647" /> be placed in the way of the development of this institution in Limerick. It was very hard earned. I suppose people have no meas on anything they get for nothing; it is only what you get by hard work that you appreciate.  In Limerick we appreciate very much our school of higher education.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about and much ridicule has been made of the greatest educationalist in our generation, a man devoted to education. I had the privilege of being in a class under him. His ability was unlimited, above all his charity was abounding.  He devoted his time, his ability and his charity to education and to the development of education.  He has been maligned and slandered, not alone in this House but outside it.  I refer to the former Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. John Charles McQuaid.  He sat silently and listened to all types of remarks that he was this, that and the other thing.  He turned the other cheek and never replied.  This showed the bigness of the man and what he has done not alone for the archdiocese of Dublin but for Ireland generally.  He has set an example for everyone to follow.</P>
    <P>I am a realist and I talk commonsense. I speak from what I know.  I am educated every day in the week. I am prepared to learn.  I meet people and I learn from them.  Let us get out of our heads this vast building of students, regardless of what denomination they are.  You cannot get away from the small unit.  You will never have a nation if you do.  You will have numbers but you will not have boys who will be good leaders, who will make decisions.  We will finish up like Sweden with a high suicide rate because the boys and girls will not be taught to face difficulties and to surmount them.  If we have not got a nation such as that we might as well write &ldquo;paid&rdquo; to this nation of ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot complain that he has not had the views of Deputies.  Speeches have extended over a wide range of opinions in this debate.  I sat in this House most of last Thursday waiting to speak <Col N="648" /> and only two Deputies spoke.  I read in the paper last week where Deputy Cruise-O'Brien had referred to indoctrination in schools.  I heard Deputy Desmond take the same line of reasoning last Thursday morning but when the Parliamentary Secretary got up to speak he swept it aside as if it did not exist.  I want to say it has existed for a considerable period.  In my opinion we are not too far away from anarchy and it is entirely wrong that teachers should impress extremist views on young boys and girls.</P>
      <P>That is happening in many parts of the country.  The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary should take cognisance of this fact and make every effort to stop it as soon as they can. This may be happening more in the city of Dublin than in other places; it is certainly happening in some parts of rural Ireland.  Boys and girls should be allowed to form their own political opinions and their own outlook on life. Matters like that, particularly in the dangerous situation which exists at present should not be allowed to continue. It is disloyal of teachers to try to implant that type of thing in the heads of young children.</P>
      <P>There is an innuendo in the country that the religious orders have played their part in education and that other people should take over.  I am proud to state that the religious orders gave what was virtually free education for the last century.  They received their salaries and they ploughed the money back into education.  This country owes a debt of gratitude to them.  This is something which cannot be said too often.  It makes me almost sick when I hear the innuendo that they have had their day, that we are living in a different age and other people must take over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that the first thing the Communists did when they got control of a country was to sweep religious orders out of hospitals and schools.  They paid for that later on because they lost an efficient unit, a unit which was good for the youth and for the country as a whole.  Further than that, religious orders play an important part in that they give a cultural background to a <Col N="649" /> country.  At present the religious orders are probably taking a greater interest in the problem of the EEC than anybody else.  They are trying to get the best advice they can; they are having seminars and giving the children in their schools an opportunity of evaluating the situation and knowing exactly what is going on.</P>
    <P>I hope in whatever plans the Minister may have for community schools that he will allow the religious orders to play the vital part they played in the past for the benefit of the country as a whole.  The question of community schools is a very vexed one.  If the Department of Education try to lay down hard and fast rules they will want to think differently in regard to rural Ireland to what they think in regard to Dublin.  In the larger centres community schools are probably very desirable.  It is possible that in the larger towns in rural Ireland such a scheme is also possible.  If community schools mean the wholesale closing down of rural schools, the breaking up of parochial life, dragging people out of surroundings in which they were born and reared then the idea is a bad one.  It will do great harm in this country.  I would ask the Minister not to be intimidated by any plan conceived behind closed doors in his own Department.  He is a rural Deputy and he should know that the rural requirements are quite different to the requirements in larger centres.</P>
    <P>I have a statement on community schools by a committee of parents.  It says that in community schools there ought to be a place for handicapped children.  I can conceive of nothing worse in education.  Here, as indeed elsewhere, very little was done for the handicapped child until comparatively recently.  It is only recently that the national conscience has been aroused, and I should like now to pay my small tribute to the Department for the help and assistance they have given us in my county; we now have two schools and two institutions catering for handicapped children.  We still have not, however, broken the back of the problem.</P>
    <P>As I said, the parents have suggested that the community schools should also <Col N="650" /> cater for handicapped children.  I believe that would be a mistake.  The handicapped child is at a disadvantage almost from the day he is born.  I have seen children removed from schools in which their lives were a continual struggle because of their low IQ and put into special schools for the handicapped; the improvement in these children was almost unbelievable.  The camaraderie that exists between them is incredible.  The assistance they give each other is quite amazing.  The Minister would be very foolish to take the advice of those parents who argue that these children should be housed in a community school.  Handicap is a special problem and must be dealt with as a special problem.  When these children work together they are encouraged.  They become hopeful.  I know that from my own personal experience.</P>
    <P>I agree that there should be equal opportunities for all in education.  It has to be remembered, however, that we are turning out more educated people than we ever did before.  I am sure every Deputy has had the same experience as I have had of parents coming to me and telling me that a boy or girl has got his or her leaving certificate but cannot get a job anywhere. All the concentration seems to be on arts graduates.  There are other very excellent types of education which will be of incomparable value in our technological world today.  The tragedy is that a great number of arts graduates can find no employment.</P>
    <P>When I was in Calcutta last year I came across an organisation which grew up simply because there were thousands of graduates with no employment opportunities of any kind and they had to take all sorts of manual occupations; nothing concomitant with their standard of education was available. We may reach the same situation if we keep on turning out arts graduates. The only outlet for them will be emigration and that will represent a serious loss to the nation.</P>
    <P>Educational policy should put a greater emphasis on vocational education.  Vocational schools should be developed to maximum capacity. In the not too distant future, if we enter the EEC, there will be a much <Col N="651" /> bigger demand for vocationally trained and technologically trained personnel. Career guidance should be available at all stages.  If we spend millions educating people then we should ensure that we make full use of their qualifications at home instead of exporting them.</P>
    <P>School transport was introduced by the late Donogh O'Malley when he was Minister for Education.  Before the introduction of school transport the children had to walk to school.  The provision of this transport has made a marked difference in the health of the children because they no longer suffer from inclement weather conditions. Indeed, the incidence of tuberculosis in the past can be attributed to the wettings these children got on their way to and from school.  One is constantly being approached by people looking for transport for their children and invariably they are either over the three miles or over the age. I want the Minister to look at this from the point of view of the child. The child goes to school at four or five years of age and travels by bus to and from school every day.  At the age of ten he is chucked off the bus.  He has no road sense because he has never been on the road.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why these children should be put off the bus at the age of ten.  These buses are not overcrowded.  The buses that travel around my constituency are only halffull. There is another discrepancy about this school travel.  Very often there is a Gilbertian situation where a boy and a girl from the same home go to the same big town to school.  It could be a town like Enniscorthy where the girls' school is three miles from the home and the other school 50 or 100 yards under that distance.  I do not know who measures the distances.  It may be the Department or it may be CIE but whoever does the measuring is most conscientious.  It would be sensible if the children were transported to a central point in the town itself.  There are several schools in Enniscorthy.  One school is well over three miles from some of the houses while another school is 2¾ miles from them, with the result that half the children must walk <Col N="652" /> to school on the main road between Dublin and Wexford.  There is a cattle mart on the road which makes the children's position even more dangerous.  I do not know how some of the children have not been killed.  It would be helpful if the Minister would use his imagination and arrange some relaxation of the rules.  I am long enough in Dáil Éireann to know that the only person who can do anything is the Minister.  We all get letters saying &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister&rdquo;, or words to that effect, and we know well that the Minister has never seen such letters. Tonight I am asking the Minister for some leverage in this matter.  The Minister may be able to centralise the point from which the distance is to be measured.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of putting children off the bus at the age of ten. This does not make sense.  Children at that age have no road-sense but they are of great help to the younger children in the family who are using the bus.  In south Wexford recently a number of small schools were amalgamated. People were not aware of this amalgamation until it actually happened.  It went through unchallenged.  I never knew about it.  Whoever arranged the school transport knows nothing about conditions in rural Ireland.  All the children were allowed to avail of school transport irrespective of their age or the distance to the school because, it was inferred, they were good people and they did not resist the bureaucratic drive to close all these small schools. Some of the schools which were closed were comparatively new ones, built during the last few years.  Some of the schools had been reconstructed at considerable cost to the State.</P>
    <P>These are the points which I wish to put to the Minister.  I probably have had more rows with the Department in connection with handicapped children than any Deputy in Dáil Éireann. When the Department helped us they helped properly and we, in Wexford, are grateful for the assistance we got. We can probably claim to be one of the few counties dealing properly with handicapped children.  I hope that other counties will get the same co-operation as we have got from the Minister and the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start my speech where Deputy Coughlan left off.  I would like to endorse fully the compliments he paid to the former Archbishop of Dublin, Most Reverend Dr. McQuaid, for the wonderful way in which he contributed to the archdiocese of Dublin and other areas of the country in the field of education. For many years the people of Dublin city have regarded Dr. McQuaid as being one of their best leaders.  In the field of education he did wonderful work for the children of the city of Dublin.  This work was also projected into other fields, like health.  As a doctor I have been very much aware of the way in which Dr. McQuaid gave so much assistance in the setting up of hospitals and also the help he gave by sitting on the boards of different hospitals and assisting in the management of them.  The work which Dr. McQuaid did and the progress which he achieved in the archdiocese of Dublin over the past 20 years are a tribute to this great man.  May I take this opportunity of wishing him the best of health and activity in his years of retirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is also an opportunity for me to welcome the new Archbishop and to wish him the very best of success in the great task which is ahead of him.  His pastoral work will, on many occasions, bring him into the field of education.  One aspect of education which has been, perhaps, most neglected by successive Ministers and Governments is that in regard to handicapped children.  The Minister will accept my criticism when I say that very little has been done to help the handicapped child to realise his full potential in education.  Much could be done. One does not want to blame this inactivity or lethargy on lack of interest in the problem itself.  One realises that the handicapped group of children in our society never had, and never will have, much voice in education.  Some of the greatest faults of our educational system are shown by the defects which exist at present in the inadequate educational facilities for mentally and socially handicapped children. The percentage of mentally handicapped children in our society is increasing.  As medical science advances in its efficiency more babies are <Col N="654" /> born prematurely at the viable stage of 28 weeks in the gestation period. These babies are kept alive but the incidence of brain damage among them is far higher than it is among children who are born at full-term.  The number of handicapped children born into our society now is far greater than ever before.  Because of this, a realistic programme should be adopted by the Department of Education to provide the facilities necessary to each and every one of these children in order to give them a chance to realise their full potential and to obtain proper and adequate educational facilities suited to each particular handicap. Hand in hand with mental subnormality go the other diseases which from time to time come with very little warning to the notice of the medical profession.  We had the drastic instance of this happening with the thalidomide babies.  The Department should be in a position to see that in the years to come children with such handicaps will need special facilities at least equal to those of normal children.  A handicapped child needs perhaps better facilities than the normal child.</P>
    <P>The next greatest disease to come into our sector of the handicapped classes would be that of spina bifida. Over the past six years, with the assistance of surgery to cure this condition and to keep the child alive, and with the complications of hydrocephaly, we have a large number of children now suffering from both spina bifida and hydrocephaly and one of the features of this disease is that it is essentially physical.  There is no mental subnormality attached to it and in fact in many cases the opposite has been observed, the child in fact, being of a very high level of intelligence.  Many of them have well above the normal IQ, but the provision for getting these children to and from special schools and the relaxation of mind necessary for the harmony in the home in parents knowing that adequate education will be provided for their children who suffer from this affliction are not there and it is silly for us to say that we have any realistic programme of educating handicapped children.</P>
    <P>There are many sectors of education <Col N="655" /> in which a handicapped child could do extremely well.  I do not want to go into the different types of diseases which result in keeping a child away from the normal school centre.  There are many, but it is not for me to outline them to the Minister and it might not be appropriate on the Estimate to do so, but there is the field of languages which could be taught in the home with the many modern teaching methods available in the form of teaching aids and special tape recording systems. These could be made available free to many children who were tested and seen to be responsive to this type of education and who would not be in a position to travel to normal schools or even to a centre of special education.</P>
    <P>Again the field of mathematics is a field in which physical handicap does not require a child to be in the centre of education.  I have in mind two young constitutents of mine who, because of the peculiar and very rare disease from which they suffer, are unable to stay regularly at school; and if, as their parents have on a few occasions asked me, these language courses were made available they could at least continue some form of systematic and methodical education at home when they were laid up because the peculiar disease they have does not affect their mental capacity in any way.  It merely affects their school attendance and so unfortunately their academic progress is inhibited by lack of ability to attend school.  It is most unfortunate to see a child with a perfect IQ falling behind his class and behind his age group when this could be avoided.  There are not a vast number of these cases but there are certainly many cases that could be helped of children who could make normal progress or who could contribute very constructively to society and play a very active part and feel that they were playing a very active part in our society later on.</P>
    <P>This also gives rise to the consideration of the provision of such facilities as home tutor facilities on a similar basis as that on which home nurses are made available to the ill.  If home tutoring facilities were made available in cases where a child was unable to <Col N="656" /> travel at all or where it was injurious to him to do so, or where he suffers from cystic fibrosis, and gets recurring infections every time he goes out, but who has normal mental capacity, that child could develop normally in an academic fashion and I would like to see arrangements made whereby these facilities would exist, and not just for the rich.  I am sure that many Deputies have had private tuition in the home or tuition of some kind in such matters as music, and it is not all that expensive to provide.  It can be most productive and it is of course probably the most productive form of education we can get.  The handicapped child who cannot travel to either the special school or to the normal centre of learning should be considered for the provision of a home tutor type of education to which the child would be responsive and adaptable.</P>
    <P>With regard to handicapped children generally, one of the best types of education I have seen in practice work with these children is the Montessori type of teaching where children can be taken into play groups as soon as they are toilet trained.  Certain children can come into a group at the age of a little over two years and can communicate and learn the different ways of suggestive learning as available through the Montessori system.  I am personally disappointed that the Montessori system of teaching is not recognised by the Department.  I think it is an invaluable system of learning for infants and even for those of higher grades, but certainly for infants in a small group, it is excellent and unsurpassed by anything I have seen in education in this city.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of educating the normal child who may possibly have some form of impediment.  One of the commonest forms of impediment which one comes across in connection with the normal IQ child is a speech problem.  There are very few people in Leinster House who suffer from it, so it is probably difficult to convey a true picture to politicians because politicians are known for their verbosity and their ability to speak, but the child who has found difficulty in expressing himself and cannot give a full account of himself at oral examinations <Col N="657" /> should have a little more provision made for him in oral examinations than is there at present.  There are many children in school who live in fear and dread of the oral Irish examination.  They must pass Irish if they wish to go to university.  If a student has a serious speech defect which has been certified by a doctor and the school manager, account is taken of this by the Department.  However, a boy of 17 or 18 years who is doing his examination realises that the piece of paper he has is not worth much if he does not pass the oral Irish.  I should like to see some provision whereby he would not have to sit the oral Irish examination; if this were done he could concentrate with an easy mind on the other subjects and thereby give a good account of himself. Now such a student must concentrate to a considerable extent on the written part of the Irish examination in order to compensate for his difficulty with the oral section.</P>
    <P>Recently the Department of Health set up a school of speech therapists but even with the full number of graduates in the current year they will not be able to tackle the problem to a great extent.  Even if the problem is tackled quite substantially there will remain a fear in a certain group that the oral Irish testing will not be to their advantage.  I have had experience of a few cases of students who were doing their leaving certificate examination and in some instances their fear of oral Irish affected their studies.  Sometimes it can be a contributory factor in their terminating their studies at an early age.</P>
    <P>There are those with a physical handicap who cannot commit their knowledge to paper and it would be appropriate on this Estimate to discuss the possibility of abolishing the old type of essay examination and introducing a system of multi-question examination.  Some higher centres of learning here are considering this practice which is used widely in the United States.  My experience of this new type of examination is that it eliminates much of the stress and strain that is experienced in the older examination system.  We need not be <Col N="658" /> revolutionary or radical in changing the method of testing but I should like to see some system introduced such as the one I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There were many fellow-students of my own at school and university who did not acquit themselves as well as they could have because they were not essay writers.  The multi-choice question examination system would eliminate this factor and it would give an accurate picture of the knowledge acquired by the student.  Questions would be phased in such a way that an overall picture could be obtained of the knowledge of the pupil.  In addition, where the papers are corrected by computer one does away with the risk inherent in other examinations.  The human element is taken out of the marking of papers.  Most students hope their papers will not be examined in the late hours of the night by an examiner who is suffering from migraine, for example.  The human factor is eliminated in this multi-choice question examination.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education, through the school managers and teachers, are the first people who can elicit any sign of disability in a child. This can be overlooked at the regular school medical examinations because it can take some time to assess a child's ability to speak properly.  As with mental and physical development, speech development has many phases.  The classification of children into different categories can be detrimental to the child who has a minor speech defect; such a defect can cause him to be classified at an early stage as being a slow child or a child who has a subnormal intelligence.  The wrong type of handling in such a case can have catastrophic effects on the child's mental attitude to learning.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the shy child who does not speak in class because of a slight defect and if he is put at the back of the class he can vegetate there. In the same way the bright-eyed, vocal child can be brought to the front of the class and can be coaxed.  It is only fair to say that many children who suffer from speech defects, particularly those that are of an emotional origin, have a high degree of intelligence. <Col N="659" /> Many of them have a well-above normal intelligence.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of frustration is felt in the sections of the medical world which deal with problems like this.  There are many children who could be helped at an early age and whose education need not suffer in any way if the teachers were more aware of these problems.  A minor hearing defect can be picked up at a regular school examination but, in the case of a speech defect, unless it is caused by some physical abnormality like a tied tongue or a cleft palate, it will not be picked up immediately.  The teacher has a vitally important role to play in this matter.  One cannot over-emphasise it when speaking on the subject of handicapped children or on the subject of a child with perfectly normal intelligence who has a speech problem. The referral of a child of this kind to a psychologist, or to one of the special speech therapy centres in Dublin, is of the utmost importance.  Speech therapists and people who have any knowledge of this subject say that the earlier the defect is detected the greater the chance of effecting a quick cure and bringing the child back to a normal educational pattern.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual to see children deliberately pretending they do not know the answer to questions they are asked in class because they cannot pronounce certain words.  I believe the Department have not become fully aware of this.  I am not saying that I am the only one who is aware of it. Many Deputies have referred to it. The number of special classes provided in the suburban areas that I know of are very few.  Classes are provided in schools around the suburbs of my constituency and the progress made by the children and the benefits they derive by being transferred to a class of this kind are quite noticeable.  There does not appear to be any stigma attaching to the fact that they are in a class with a special system of teaching or a softhanded method of education.</P>
    <P>In the field of education we must be aware of the ability of the child and his ability to communicate his knowledge vocally or on paper.  We should have a <Col N="660" /> look at our system of examinations, the way they are presented to the child, the way the child is assessed, and the way we assess and classify a child when he is leaving school.  His total Irish education is assessed in a two-hour or three-hour examination.  His total mathematics knowledge is assessed in a two-hour or three-hour examination. I have always felt that this was at fault.</P>
    <P>Many friends who were at school with me did not do well in their examinations but did extremely well in life afterwards.  They proved themselves to be very capable and to have a very wide knowledge of their subject but, on the day appointed, they did not acquit themselves well.  The multi-choice system of examination could lessen the number of students who do not acquit themselves adequately from the point of view of the knowledge they have accumulated over the years.  Any Department or any group of officials who issue a certificate to a boy, and particularly a certificate which states that he has failed, have a great responsibility.</P>
    <P>A constituent of mine is having great difficulty at the moment.  He is an orphan.  He obtained two honours in his leaving certificate and passed in Irish.  He did an honours mathematics course which he failed.  Because he failed in maths, even though it was honours maths, anywhere he shows that sheet of paper with &ldquo;failed&rdquo; after &ldquo;mathematics&rdquo; he will be looked upon as a dumb-bell who cannot add.  This is the fault of the system of examination. Under the multi-choice system a child might be asked 1,000 questions and he marks off one answer in a series of possible answers, one of which is correct, and he could come out having answered 40 or 50 or 75 per cent of the questions correctly.  We must take into account the human ability to put thoughts on paper and the ability to write quickly and clearly.  Those factors would be eliminated from the assessment at the end of the child's time in secondary school, and in the university unless he is doing a specific course which necessitates a certain talent for being able to write long essays very quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned some very <Col N="661" /> important matters in his speech such as community schools, primary, secondary and university education, higher institutes of education and school transport but he did not refer at all to the part played by his Department in the physical education of children.  Anyone who has gone through school is aware of the importance of being strong and physically fit to endure the long hours of study which are necessary to obtain a degree and to pass an examination. I could hardly believe this was not referred to by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Many prominent speakers did not give proper attention to the National Council for Sport which was set up in the life of this Dáil.  It is no harm to mention that the National Council for Sport was set up following a suggestion by this party.  Soon after we called on the Taoiseach to concentrate more on sport, to allocate more money for the administration of sport and for the provision of sporting facilities, the National Council for Sport was set up. This is a stepping-stone towards the establishment of a Ministry for Sport. The voluntary members of the National Council for Sport deserve the greatest tribute this House can pay them for the wonderful work they have done.  They are an example to other Departments that if we get a group of people who have a common interest, the talent available in nonelected personnel is tremendous.  These people on the National Council for Sport show what a group of unpaid, voluntary workers can achieve in a very short time in stimulating interest in physical education and sport.  The Minister should refer to them when he is replying and should pay tribute to the extremely good service that they have given to the country.</P>
    <P>One anomaly that I find in regard to education is the fact that most of the centres of higher education in Dublin are on the south side of the city.  I do not agree that all the intellectuals in Dublin are on the south side.  There should be a balance in the provision of educational facilities in this city.  There are five centres of higher education south of the Liffey and only one north <Col N="662" /> of the Liffey.  Yet, there is a higher percentage of the population resident north of the Liffey and that population is rapidly expanding.  There is a higher percentage of children north of the Liffey and a higher percentage of adults.  The only centre of higher education on the north side is Bolton Street College.  On the south side there are the Rathmines School of Commerce, Kevin Street, University College, Dublin, Trinity College, Dublin and the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland. If one wants to mention the Apothecaries Hall as a centre of higher education, which technically it is although it does not function all that much, then, statistically, there are six centres of higher education on the south side.  I am not including the Albert College because it is destined to be transferred.</P>
    <P>The cost of travelling from my constituency across the city to Belfield, which may involve taking two or three buses, imposes an unfair burden on students living on the north side of the city.  Those travelling from the north side&mdash;they are very few&mdash;to Trinity College also experience difficulty in travelling.  This affects their educational progress because it involves having to be in buses for a considerable period and standing at bus queues, perhaps in the rain.  As one who travelled a good deal by bus to university I know that a great deal of time can be wasted in travelling by this means.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong case for building the next centre of higher education that is to be built on the north side.  In regard to the hospital services available there is a difference between the north side and the south side of the city.  In discussing local government it is possible to indicate the number of office blocks built on the south side as compared with the north side.  Public representatives on the north side of the city hear complaints from constituents who have to cross the Liffey in order to get to a centre of higher learning.  Those on the north side who work in the Civil Service have to go south of the Liffey in most cases. This involves extra expenditure in bus fares and lunches out.  This disadvantage is something we inherited. Most of the colleges I have mentioned <Col N="663" /> were in existence when the country gained its independence.  There is a strong case for building the new centre of higher education on the north side.</P>
    <P>In August last a garbled statement appeared in the newspapers to the effect that the centre of higher education scheduled to be built on the lands of the Albert College in Glasnevin would not go ahead.  On behalf of my constituents I would ask the Minister to indicate, when replying to the debate, why the centre of education in Glasnevin is being shelved, why progress has not been made in the building of this centre.  I do not have to go into any great detail in order to convince the Minister of the necessity for a centre of higher education in this area. If the Minister cares to travel that part of the city with me, or with any of his colleagues who represent the area, he will see the massive expansion that has taken place both in local authority and private dwellings and will realise the urgent need that exists for a centre of higher education.</P>
    <P>It was with regret that I heard that the Ling Physical Education College is being closed down and that the Department of Education are taking over the functions carried out by this college.  It is appropriate on this Estimate to pay tribute to the Ling College which produced so many extremely well qualified physical instructors.</P>
    <P>This is something which I notice is omitted from the Parliamentary Secretary's contribution.  He mentioned the National Council for Sport, the National Youth Council and the amount of work done and he mentioned other aspects of physical education but it was not until Deputy Clinton called for a statement on physical education that we had a statement from a member of the Government, a junior Minister who is responsible for physical education and for sport.  It was not until Deputy Clinton said that there was a responsibility on the Department to make a statement regarding the progress of the National Council for Sport, the ways in which the money had been allocated and the progress made, that the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Kennedy, adverted to this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> One of the omissions in his speech, which is possibly an oversight on his part, is the lack of reference to any system of providing physical recreational facilities for young females.  I have had many representations made to me by mothers in my constituency regarding recreational facilities for their daughters.  Traditionally, physical activity was always a male pursuit and, perhaps, the prerogative of that sex but in recent years females are keen to become involved in athletics and in football.  They have formed soccer teams in the city and are keen to play basketball and volley ball and take part in athletics.  If one observes, as I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister have observed, the massive gatherings at the Kennedy stadium each year when the community games take place and sees the hundreds of boys and girls participating in these games, one realises the importance of providing adequate recreational facilities for both boys and girls.  It is tremendously important that we observe at all stages in education the old motto <i>Mens sana in corpore sano,</i> a healthy mind in a healthy body.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is significant that when, in UCD, which traditionally had a Wednesday half-day for university sports and the holding of inter-university competitions, this was abolished, the incidence of psychiatric complaints among students increased fantastically. One is tempted to say that the general policy in education now is to produce academics rather than men, to produce people with rubber-stamp degrees to show they have passed through a certain recognised course provided by one of our higher institutions of education. Much criticism can be levelled at that system because the type of person coming out with degrees now is not always the type one would like to see emerging, not the kind of graduate the country would hope for.  Higher centres of learning, vocational and university, should be producing leaders of the community and leaders in industry, both men and women.  I venture to say the change of emphasis in the past decade to academic achievement from overall ability to make use of academic knowledge acquired in the universities <Col N="665" /> was a mistake.  I would rather see a graduate coming out with perhaps 10 per cent less academic knowledge and 90 per cent more leadership.  We have resorted to producing an assembly-type graduate and to over-emphasising the importance of storing information in the memory of the student.  To some extent, we are taking away the personality and natural talents of the student by this.</P>
    <P>The pendulum must swing back. Other countries have made similar mistakes and have seen what happened. Their countries are now without any form of leadership apart from trained administrators, people who have done a special course in artificial leadership. The fact that sport appears to be discouraged rather than encouraged in a university is a tragic mistake.  I can always remember a colleague of mine being told by a professor in front of an examiner from England: &ldquo;This man might make a great rugby player but it will be a long time before he passes this exam.&rdquo;  He passed the examination and made a great rugby player.  He became an international and I am glad to say that he is now a natural leader in his community.</P>
    <P>Stifling natural talents at any stage in a student's life is detrimental to society at large.  Any higher centre of education, and particularly the universities, when planning courses and accepting students should take fully into account the academic, economic, social and cultural needs of the society and the community to which the graduates will return.  In this regard I should like to mention specifically the field of medical education.  The Minister criticised me here once for advocating the training of doctors for export.  One of the points I was making at that time was that, while much money was being spent on the education of medical students, there were many people in several areas in the country who had hardly any medical facilities available to them because of a shortage of medical doctors.  The reason for this situation is because some of these areas are so isolated that a doctor would find it difficult to set up practice in them or he might consider the difficulties involved in the <Col N="666" /> education of his children in such areas. It was for that reason I suggested some time ago that the local authorities, or the Department of Health, or the Department of Education, or even all three combined, should devise a system under which those areas in which there is the greatest need for graduates should be assessed in relation to that need and that students wishing to pursue a course leading to a degree in medicine should be subsidised completely on the understanding that on qualifying they would agree to serve in their respective areas at an agreed remuneration.  In this way they would be giving of their knowledge and training to the people who helped them qualify.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am more familiar with the medical aspect of education than with any other.  For any child who wishes to go through university but whose parents may not be able to afford the cost involved it is a fair deal that, if his fees and accommodation are paid, he would return to an area in which there was a shortage of medical personnel.  The same could apply where there is difficulty in filling teaching posts.  Such a system would overcome the problems that are being experienced in areas along certain parts of the western seaboard, for example.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the re-introduction of night classes for students at UCD.  Many potential students were very upset when these classes were discontinued.</P>
    <P>Another matter that is causing much concern both to parents and students is that of the ever-increasing fees of the universities.  Perhaps a system could be introduced whereby the parents of a potential student could budget for about four or five years in advance of the student entering college in the knowledge that, all being well and the student reaching the standard necessary, a certain amount would be required for fees, books and so on.  The only unknown factor they would have to contend with would be rises in the cost of living.  However, this would not be possible if university fees should continue to increase to the extent to which they have been increasing <Col N="667" /> recently.  I would like to see, also, some system whereby expenses of students would be subsidised by the Department of Education, on a graded basis, as costs increased and that such would apply to books which, as we all know, are very expensive.  The fact that in this academic year students in UCD went on strike and caused the closure of the university for some considerable time must be the strongest indication yet that the increasing fees are totally unjust, badly timed and the result of general mismanagement by those at the top in the educational institutions and in the Department. Those of us who were approached by students to have the matter raised here did so but were allowed to raise it on only one occasion.  At the time those who should have been doing something about the matter seemed to be apathetic towards it.  Although the matter was resolved eventually, it would have been more opportune to have taken action in the early stages so that the fears of many intending students could have been allayed.</P>
    <P>A child may inherit some money that will enable him to pay his fees for, say, his first year at university but it is hard luck if he finds on obtaining his leaving certificate that the university fees are to be increased by 25 per cent.  The Department should make a statement in advance on any proposed increase in fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might not be rising on the Adjournment this evening if the Taoiseach had been more forthcoming in replying to a very direct question, No. 3, as it appears on today's Order Paper.  This does not concern the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms but is a matter concerning the sovereignty of this State, the sovereignty of Britain and the non-existence of any sovereignty in Northern Ireland: and the legislative and executive jurisdiction of Northern Ireland. <Col N="668" /> The Taoiseach endeavoured in his reply to behave in the same manner as he has generally behaved in handling all the affairs of this country.  Instead of honestly dealing with a direct question he tried to waffle his way out of it by pretending that the issue in Question No. 3, which is perfectly clear to him as a lawyer, was one which could be confused with the protests which have already been made to the European Commission of Human Rights.  Once again we see the Taoiseach and his Government are serving all the people of this country particularly badly in these difficult times.  He is particularly failing the suffering and much wronged people of Northern Ireland by failing to prosecute before every available international court and body with sufficient efficiency, expedition and conviction the many cases of serious breaches by Britain of fundamental international law, constitutional principles and human rights.</P>
      <P>The presence of the <i>Maidstone</i> and the prisoners upon it in Belfast Lough is a travesty of international constitutional law.  That our Government have failed so far to protest against this travesty of justice clearly indicates the critical extent to which we are letting our people down.  The presence of so many people on board the <i>Maidstone</i> against the law certainly creates the suspicion, or perhaps gives further ground for suspecting, that the international and legal obligations of Britain are considered to be secondary to British convenience.  Those who seek to direct the people of no property and the persecuted people of Ireland and elsewhere to obey the rule of law should themselves, first of all, show respect for the rule of law. Britain is knowingly in contempt of law and our Government are, by their silence, acquiescing in this contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises most serious consequences for this country.  To tolerate a breach of law is to help to make that breach legitimate.  By failing to protest to the International Court of Justice and to every other agency available to it, the Government are generally acquiescing in the breach by Britain of her clear obligations.  This absence of protest here, as in the past in other countries, gives historic title in derogation <Col N="669" /> of international law.  In the short time that is available I hope to make clear the serious extent to which Britain is in conflict with her international obligations and her bi-lateral agreements with this country.  But as a matter of principle, just to indicate the danger of this country tolerating the continuance of the presence of the <i>Maidstone</i> in Belfast Lough, I should like to refer to Professor D.P. O'Connell's treatise on &ldquo;International Law.&rdquo;  Professor O'Connell is the Professor of international law at Oxford, and he refers on page 421 of the second edition of his treatise to this fact:</P>
    <P>As the International Court of Justice said in the Anglo-Norwegian fisheries case, historic title justifies a situation which would otherwise be in conflict with international law. In essence the title is validated only by the creation of a specific custom which is an expression of universal or almost universal consent.  Absence of protest is the key to the legal reality of the title.</P>
    <P>Unless we protest forthwith there is the danger that what is occurring against the law in Belfast Lough may yet be accepted by our acquiescence and by usage as a valid practice. What is the origin of modern responsibility for the waters around our island?  What is the title deed which clearly expresses the jurisdiction of the Northern Ireland Parliament and Execuitve?  It is the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, a piece of legislation of the British Parliament, and it states most specifically that:</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland shall consist of the parliamentary counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone and the parliamentary boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry, and Southern Ireland shall consist of so much of Ireland as is not comprised within the said parliamentary counties and boroughs.</P>
    <P>Clearly the definition of territorial jurisdiction of Northern Ireland is the parliamentary counties and the parliamentary boroughs.  Belfast Lough, where the <i>Maidstone</i> is at present located, is outside the parliamentary <Col N="670" /> counties or the parliamentary boroughs, and the executive jurisdiction of Northern Ireland may extend only as far as the territory defined in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and may not extend one inch further.  The Ordnance Survey maps for 1920 indicate that the highwater mark is the boundary between the parliamentary counties and the parliamentary borough referred to and the remainder of the United Kingdom.  That is the situation as of 1920, that that is the limit, and therefore the Special Powers Act may not extend beyond that.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the same Act clearly defines the executive power of Northern Ireland as operative only within that section which also confines the parliamentary power.  The courts of Northern Ireland have themselves accepted the limit of their jurisdiction as confined to the parliamentary counties and boroughs.  I refer to the Treatise on the Constitution of Northern Ireland by their own parliamentary draftsman, Sir Arthur Quekett, and he refers at page 194 of part 3 to the case of Rex (Alexander) v. the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland in the course of which it is stated that the basis of the decision was that, having regard to the territorial limitations upon the powers of the Northern Ireland Parliament the duty of the Ministry to grant producers' licences was limited to granting them to those who produced their milk on premises in Northern Ireland as defined by the 1920 Act.  Therefore it could not extend one inch beyond that.  This was supported by a further decision in the Northern courts under section 8 of the same Act which defined Irish executive services.  I refer to the case of James v. Cowan which stated that &ldquo;Irish services&rdquo; made the executive power coterminus with that of the legislature.  The Constitution, the court said, was not to be mocked by substituting executive for legislative interference with freedom.</P>
    <P>That is the law of the courts of Northern Ireland.  That is the statutory definition of the territorial jurisdiction of Northern Ireland.  In the face of that Britain is clearly in breach of her own legislation and the rulings of her own court in permitting the operation of <Col N="671" /> the Special Powers Act beyond the parliamentary county boundaries of the counties and boroughs of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We can now come to the articles of agreement for the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland of 1921.  This is also very interesting in that it is quite clear from it that full Irish sovereignty extends over the whole island of Ireland unless a resolution is passed by both Houses of Parliament of Northern Ireland within a month of the coming into operation of the Act which confirms the Treaty in question.  We know that, unfortunately, the two Houses of Parliament in Northern Ireland did resolve not to participate in the Government of Ireland, as a consequence of which they retained whatever powers were given to them by the 1920 Act. But those powers are again under the Act of 1920 and the Treaty of 1921, and are thereby confined to the parliamentary counties and to the parliamentary boroughs all of which are above highwater mark.</P>
    <P>It is argued, and I suspect from what the Taoiseach said today in the course of his reply to me that he was supporting this argument, that there was an accidental omission from the Treaty of 1921 and that really it was intended to bring the coastal waters of the Six County area within the ambit of the jurisdiction of the Northern Ireland Parliament.  That is not sustainable, for a very clear reason.  If there was no mention of any part of the waters surrounding Northern Ireland in the 1921 Treaty then it might be valid to say: &ldquo;Yes, there has been a genuine omission.&rdquo; But there is a specific mention of the very place where the <i>Maidstone</i> is located, and that is contained in the annexe to the Treaty which says in relation to Belfast Lough that the harhour defences are to remain in charge of British care and maintenance parties.</P>
    <P>The 1938 Agreement between Ireland and Britain repealed that annexe but that is not all that it did.  It used language which again clearly indicated that there was a view in the minds of the British parties to that Treaty, and unfortunately accepted by the Irish signatories to the Agreement of 1938, who <Col N="672" /> were Mr. Eamon de Valera, Mr. Seán Lemass, Mr. Seán MacEntee and Mr. Séamus Ó Riain, that the United Kingdom Government could retain its control over Belfast Lough.  While the annexe was repealed it was provided that the Government of the United Kingdom would transfer to the Government of Éire the Admiralty property and rights at Berehaven and the harbour defences at Berehaven, Cobh, and Lough Swilly but it did not provide in the 1938 Treaty that the installations and waters of Belfast Lough would be transferred to the Éire Government.</P>
    <P>We are not disputing here whether or not the waters around Northern Ireland are part of the sovereign territory of the Republic of Ireland or part of the territorial waters of the United Kingdom.  We can clearly prove, as I have proved on other occasions in this House, that these waters are, in fact, part of our sovereign territory and that they are not part of the United Kingdom. We will leave that aside for the moment.  All that is necessary in order to prove the invalidity of the presence and operation of the <i>Maidstone</i> prison ship under the Northern Ireland Special Powers Act is that it is located outside Northern Ireland as defined by British legislation and by international agreement. Quite cleary by withholding in the 1938 Agreement all mention of Belfast Lough, Britain was either claiming that it was within the jurisdiction directly of the Westminister Parliament or certainly that it was by operation of law and by operation of the 1921 Treaty part and parcel of the territorial waters of this county.</P>
    <P>There can be no dispute, whatever base you take, about the reality of the contention that the place where the <i>Maidstone</i> floats does not form part of Northern Ireland.  Apart from the fact that the Ordnance Survey maps clearly indicate the limitations of the parliamentary counties and the parliamentary boroughs in Northern Ireland, there is a case in our own courts which has now been accepted as international law and is referred to by Professor O'Connell in the treatise to which I previously made reference, a case in which I had the privilege of being <Col N="673" /> professionally involved, that of Ralph Smyth and Berthram Fordham against against the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation and the County Council of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Our own Supreme Court, by a decision of the then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Conor Maguire, Mr. Justice Lavery, Mr. Justice Ó Dálaigh, now Chief Justice, and Justice Martin Maguire against the minority opinion of Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore, rejected the contention of the applicants of that time that Dún Laoghaire harbour was part and parcel of County Dublin.  The facts of that case were that a pleasure boat called the <i>Merry Golden Hind</i> was maliciously sunk in Dún Laoghaire harbour in 1951 while it was attached by mooring ropes to the dolphins on the East Pier.  It was argued that, because it was attached to the dolphins by mooring ropes and because it did not sink on the first attempt&mdash;it was partly submerged but did not sink entirely&mdash;because the ropes held fast on one end of the boat, it remained so much a part of the territory of County Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation that the local authority in question should be obliged to pay malicious injury compensation.</P>
    <P>Our Supreme Court by a four to one verdict, which as I have mentioned has had its decision confirmed subsequently in a number of jurisdictions, held that the ship in question was outside the jurisdiction of the parliamentary county of Dublin or Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation because it was beyond the lowwater mark or the highwater mark.  A boat which is floating is necessarily below the highwater mark or the lowwater mark if the tide happens to be out.  The <i>Maidstone</i>, considering that it is there from one end of the day to the other must at least twice a day be beyond lowwater mark.</P>

      <P>There was a Rossaveel case, to which Deputy Coogan, who has intimate knowledge of the West of Ireland, can testify.  It was a case in County Galway in which a similar application was rejected because the ship in question was beyond the <Col N="674" /> boundary of the parliamentary area.  It was stated in the case to which I make reference that there was no presumption of law that national waters belong to or form part of the adjoining county or any county.  Northern Ireland, under its own Constitution&mdash;which according to the threats of certain people, will be defended to the last drop of certain fanatics' blood&mdash;under the 1920 Act of the Westminster Parliament, is limited to the parliamentary counties of the Six Counties and of the county boroughs of Belfast and Derry.</P>
      <P>The Government have a very clear obligation to protest this matter.  It does not suffice to avail of the terribly important jurisdiction of the European Commission and Court of Human Rights which are concerned with the personal rights of individuals.  It is of critical importance to prevent the abuse by Britain of its own laws and of international laws.  This State must protest the illegality of the <i>Maidstone</i> ship in Belfast Lough being used at the moment <i>ultra vires</i> for the purported exercise of the obnoxious and indefensible Special Powers Act.  That is all we are asking the Taoiseach to do and he is doing a disservice to himself and to the country in confusing the issue. I would urge on him to proceed without further delay to the International Court of Justice which is the only Tribunal where we can protest to prevent a continuation of this or a repetition of it in future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan had two questions down today, one referring to the ill-treatment of detainees in the North of Ireland and the other referring to this specific matter.  I construed, wrongly as I see now, that his main concern in this connection was the detention and ill-treatment of people in prison in the North of Ireland, including those who were imprisoned in the <i>Maidstone.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say in relation to that that the application we have made to the European Commission and Court of Human Rights in regard to the breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by Britain remains <i>sub judice</i> and therefore it is impossible for me to go very far in discussing that matter without myself being in <Col N="675" /> breach of the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  I have no wish to run any risk of doing damage to our case and I am sure the House appreciates this and the need for my not discussing that in any great detail.</P>
    <P>I can say, however, that the investigation we conducted prior to submitting our application to the European Commission took account of the allegations concerning people held at every place of detention in the North, including the <i>Maidstone</i>.  In my opinion that sufficiently answers the substance of Deputy Ryan's remarks in this connection and it is as far as I would like to go in the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputies have raised this particular question of territorial waters and Deputy Ryan on at least one occasion raised it in the House in an Adjournment Debate, I think as far back as the 12th November, 1970.  I do not think there is much more that can be said about it than has already been said.  As Deputy Ryan has indicated in his reference to various cases and statutes and the 1921 Treaty, we claim that the territorial waters around the whole island of Ireland are ours and our claim to the territorial waters around Northern Ireland is based on the Government of Ireland Act of 1920.  This Act is so referred to in the 1921 Treaty that the Northern Ireland which withdrew from the Irish Free State is identical with the Northern Ireland defined in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and defined as consisting of named counties and boroughs. It is, I think, common case between us that in English law the counties do not include adjacent territorial waters and, therefore, according to our claim these territorial waters were retained by the Irish Free State. Now, even if Deputy Ryan did imply that there was an accidental omission in the Ireland Act of 1920 or in the Treaty of 1921, I did point out this afternoon that our contention can be met with a counter-contention and that it was not my intention to argue here which contention is right and the Deputy who accused me of &ldquo;being too clever by half&rdquo; may himself be &ldquo;too clever by half&rdquo; in raising this matter in the way he does.  He will <Col N="676" /> have to recognise that we have not in any way exercised sovereignty over the territorial waters of the Six Counties of North-Eastern Ireland for 50 years.  That is a fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has missed my point.  I am not arguing about territorial waters.  I am arguing about the limitations of the SixCounty jurisdiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know exactly what the Deputy is arguing.  By definition, the Six Counties are confined to six named counties and boroughs.  The case he quoted in Dún Laoghaire, which was supported by the Rossaveel case, is not relevant because, under English law, counties cannot have claims on adjacent waters. The contention the Deputy makes could be countered, and would be countered, in the International Court of Justice before which the Deputy suggests we ought to bring this matter.</P>
      <P>I believe what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in reply to a question on 17th November, 1970.  On that occasion, he said, at column 1431 of Volume 249, of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The territorial waters all along the coast are ours but the British regard the coastal waters of Northern Ireland as theirs.</P>

      <P>Let me finish what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said:</P>
      <P>This is intimately bound up with the partition of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister there and the Government policy in that connection is, as I said before, to achieve a situation in Northern Ireland and a situation between North and South which, in the first instance, will eliminate altogether the abuses of authority which have been and are being practised in the North, a situation <Col N="677" /> which will open the door to unity by agreement, in independence, and more than that, in harmonious relationships between Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>Everything I have said on behalf of the Government, every policy statement I have made has been designed to achieve the success of that policy. It was not with any sense of rancour, certainly it was with no feeling of pleasure, that we have brought the case before the European Court of Human Rights in regard to breaches in the North of a number of Articles of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> The important thing now is, and we are all agreed on this, that the British Government should no longer delay in bringing forward proposals for creating the situation we all desire.  We must concentrate our energies in the same direction.  May I repeat that Deputy Ryan, instead of accusing me of being &ldquo;too clever by half&rdquo; may himself be &ldquo;too clever by half&rdquo; in trying to push his contention?</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 1st March, 1972.</P>
