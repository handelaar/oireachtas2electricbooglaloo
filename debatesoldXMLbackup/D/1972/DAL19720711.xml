    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of Government policy studies he has initiated in the past three years; and the number of these which have been (a) completed and (b) published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The study and reappraisal of Government policy is a continuous process and it is not the normal practice to publish the results in a formal manner.  The outcome of such studies usually finds expression in Ministerial statements and speeches and in practical implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there is a necessity for such policy studies?  Is the Fourth Programme not the result of policy studies?  Would he not, prior to the publication of that, have such documents published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the document to which the Deputy refers is a document in itself and it is not necessary to have a prior document published about the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no document prepared before the final document? That is what I was thinking of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Draft documents, and they are discussed between Ministers, between civil servants and at Government meetings.  It is the final <Col N="1044" /> document that counts and that is the one that is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The drafts are not available for public discussion?</P>

      <P>Certainly not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any speeches which have been made by him outside the House and which reflect Government policy are placed in the Dáil Library for official use; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my practice to direct that copies of prepared scripts of my speeches should be presented to the Library but if any Deputy wishes to have the script of a particular speech made available in the Library, I shall be glad to comply with his or her wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that his speeches reflect Government policy and as such should be made available to the Dáil Library?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all of my speeches reflect Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is interesting. Should they not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has under consideration any plans for an official visit to Japan; if he will indicate the nature of the visit; whether the cost will be paid out of State or private funds; and if he intends to visit any other countries during this trip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority are launching industrial promotions in Japan and in a number of other countries later this year.  They have requested the participation of members of the Government in those promotions.  It has not yet been decided which members of the Government will be involved but, at the moment, it is not my intention to travel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will list the matters in respect of which the introduction of legislation is currently pending but which have been held up due to the pressure on Parliamentary time, distinguishing between (a) those items in respect of which this delay has been notified to the Dáil by way of Ministerial statement and (b) other items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has always been the problem of the expeditious passing of legislation due to pressure on Parliamentary time, but every effort has always been made, and continues to be made to expedite the passage of urgent legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In this House from time to time we are told that various matters cannot be dealt with because legislation is required and pressure of Parliamentary time prevents it being introduced.  Indeed one hears of legislation being held up for one, two, three and sometimes four years; in one instance I have been told of legislation waiting for even five or six years in a particular Government Department.  Surely this House is entitled to know what is the queue of legislation so that we may judge the extent to which we need to modify our procedures to cope with it.  Could I ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he would consider answering the question therefore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered the question.  I have already pointed out there is no lack of Parliamentary time in connection with legislation.  The Taoiseach, on the 14th June, for the information of Deputies, did set out a number of items which would be introduced before the recess.  A number of these measures have been introduced and the following remain to be introduced: Registration of Marriages Bill, Registration of Deaths, Births and Marriages Bill, Drugs Bill, Trade Union Amalgamation Bill, and the European Communities Bill.  With great respect to the Deputy, if he were given 24 hours a day it still would not be sufficient for him personally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has said, rather curiously, that there is no lack of Parliamentary time.  Could he state why the Ministers and Secretaries Bill to establish the Department of the Public Service, which was announced for April, 1971, has not yet reached us?  I have raised this matter privately and publicly on numerous occasions on the Order of Business and elsewhere and I have been told each time that through lack of Parliamentary time it has not been possible to meet it.  The entire reform of the Public Service has been held up for at least 18 months because of lack of Parliamentary time.  How then can the Parliamentary Secretary have the effrontery to make that statement here?</P>

      <P>If Deputy Garrett FitzGerald did not abuse the courtesy of this House by speaking five and six hours at a time and gave the other Deputies a little time to contribute, we might get through a lot of business.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the information available.  In order that the data for the different countries may be compared, official exchange rates were used to express the national income per head of population in each country in pounds sterling.  Care must, however, be exercised in drawing inferences from these figures in regard to the level of welfare in the different countries since it is known that conversion of currencies at the official exchange rates is not in all cases a true reflection of the comparative purchasing power of currencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of voluntary health insurance patients who were admitted to hospitals for less than four days during the year ended 31st March, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been possible for the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to provide this information at short notice.</P>
      <P>However, they have assessed the situation on a sampling basis which revealed that approximately 23 per cent of all claims, during the last financial year of the board which ended on 29th February, 1972 would appear to relate to hospital stays of under four days.  When applied to the total number of claims for the year, this would indicate a total of approximately, 9,000 claims for such short stays.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of such admissions was for active in-patient treatment and the balance related mainly to acute cases where, for example, a coronary attack or acute appendicitis was suspected but did not materialise.</P>
      <P>The board have indicated that there has been no increase, during the past ten years, in the percentage of short stay cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Voluntary Health Board are not able to provide those figures how can they make these claims?  The figures given are based only on sampling.  This question has been raised by me in the Dáil on several occasions and it is therefore wrong to say the board were given short notice.  The Minister should see that the board would look into this aspect so that <Col N="1050" /> they could consider providing outpatient benefits and thus lessen the number of patient days in hospitals.</P>

      <P>Private homes for incapacitated persons, that is for old people, <i>et cetera,</i> must also be registered by the appropriate health board and authorised officers of the board are empowered to inspect as considered desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of research institutes, including the Economic and Social Research Institute, are at present considering what research might best be followed in regard to the problem of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say, however, that the Government do not have to await the <Col N="1055" /> findings of any research to justify continuing improvements in the levels of social welfare benefits.  As I have intimated on many occasions it has been and continues to be my constant endeavour, in accordance with declared Government policy, to improve and extend the social welfare services as much and as rapidly as possible within the limits of available resources until the range and levels of benefits reach reasonable standards of general acceptance.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill recently passed is a further step in this direction. The rates of social welfare payments are constantly under survey in my Department and very substantial increases in them have taken place in real terms in recent years.  The only constraints at present on their further improvement are the limits of the national resources and the need to allocate additional resources becoming available as equitably as possible between the many classes of people who look to my Department for some or all of their income.</P>
    <P>The present daily rate of unemployment benefit for a single man is 83 pence, which will rise by 12 per cent to 93 pence on the 2nd October next. The daily rate represents one-sixth, rounded up to the next new penny, of the statutory weekly rate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of complaints or representations his <Col N="1058" /> Department have received in the past year concerning the regulations governing the payment of maternity grants as regards the stipulated period of confinement that is at present required to qualify for a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in the conditions for maternity grant which stipulates a period of confinement in order to qualify.  Maternity grant is payable in respect of a confinement provided the contribution conditions are satisfied on the insurance of either the husband or the wife.  If both the husband and wife satisfy the contribution conditions two grants are payable.  For the purpose of the grant confinement is defined in the Social Welfare Act, 1952, as labour resulting in the issue of a living child or labour after 28 weeks of pregnancy resulting in the issue of a child whether alive or dead.</P>
      <P>Statistics of the numbers of complaints or representations are not kept, but those received in relation to maternity grant are mainly concerned with the contribution conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons why the figures for redundancies show increase in 1971 <Col N="1060" /> vary from case to case, but they include the following factors:</P>
    <P>(a) the reduction from four years to two years in the qualifying period for statutory redundancy payments as from the 1st September, 1971,</P>
    <P>(b) the raising of the pay limit for compulsory social welfare insurance from £1,200 to £1,600 in May, 1971,</P>
    <P>(c) the general trade recession in many countries, and particularly in Britain, in the textile and other industries which affected our export markets and our general economic activity,</P>
    <P>(d) the failure of some firms to survive in conditions of growing competition and declining demand for certain products,</P>
    <P>(e) the fresh impetus to the reorganisation and rationalisation of industry in preparation for the EEC, and</P>
    <P>(f) the increasing numbers moving from agriculture to other employment.</P>
    <P>The success of the efforts made to find alternative employment for redundant workers varies considerably.  The rate of success in some cases is as high as 90 per cent, in large population centres where alternative employment is easier to come by.  In smaller towns and rural areas, however, where jobs are not so plentiful the placement rate is lower.</P>
    <P>Progress in placing redundant workers is also affected by the ages of those involved and by their willingness or otherwise to move to other areas for alternative work.</P>
    <P>Precise figures are not available of redundant workers throughout the country placed in alternative employment either on an industrial group or area basis but the overall picture is that a substantial number of them are re-employed before their entitlement to weekly redundancy payments expires.</P>
    <P>The House is already aware of the Government's vigorous industrial development and expension programme aimed at the creation of new jobs. They are also aware that additional funds were made available last October to stimulate employment on public projects and that the capital <Col N="1061" /> budget has been substantially increased this year.  In addition training facilities are being expanded so that redundant workers may have the opportunity of retraining for new jobs if suitable alternative work is not available for them immediately.  Further, as an encouragement to workers to avail themselves of retraining facilities, I arranged some time ago that they may now continue to draw their weekly redundancy payments as well as the AnCo training allowance while taking part in AnCo training courses. The National Manpower Service is also being expanded to help redundant workers and job-seekers generally to find suitable jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on average redundancies went up, from 1970 to 1971, by 100 per cent and that all the industries referred to here were in excess of 100 per cent and, therefore, the general reasons which he gave are not entirely relevant to these particular industries? Would he not consider it would have been helpful if he had given a specific reply in relation to the specific industries which were mentioned in the question?  Would he further consider the value of having a sample survey done on the number of redundant workers who subsequently find employment to see how effective the manpower services are in finding jobs for redundant workers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <P>Payments under the scheme include <Col N="1063" /> grants for transfers, interviews for jobs or training, lodging allowances and visits to home.</P>
    <P>The scheme originally applied to unemployed and redundant workers over 18 who were insurable under the Social Welfare Acts or whose earnings did not exceed £1,200 per annum.  The scheme was availed of to a very small extent in the first few years.  In October I widened the scope of the scheme to include all workers, including emigrants, without regard to age, insurability or level of earnings, who seek new employment through the National Manpower Service.</P>
    <P>Travelling expenses are also payable now under the scheme to persons undergoing approved training courses.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable increase in the number of applicants under the revised scheme, including 130 people who have moved to new areas.  I am satisfied that the scheme is making a significant contribution to the encouragement of geographical mobility of workers.</P>

      <P>Income tax statistics are not compiled in such a manner as to enable information in the exact form sought by the Deputy to be given.  However, it is estimated that for the year 1970-71, the latest year for which statistics are available, there was a total of 637,000 persons effectively liable to income tax, including 7,000 companies.  Of the estimated 630,000 individuals effectively liable to income tax, 585,000 were charged to tax under Schedule E which is the schedule under which wage and salary earners and pensioners are taxed and 45,000 paid tax under Schedule D which is the schedule under which the profits of trades and professions, rents and certain other incomes are charged to income tax.  Since the abolition of Schedules A and B with effect from 1969-70, there is no charge to income tax on farming profits or owner-occupied property.</P>
      <P>The net receipt of income tax in the year 1971-72 amounted to £148.5 million of which £99.1 million was charged under Schedule E and the balance of £49.4 million under other schedules.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Post Office figure is 4 per cent which is tax free on the first £70 of interest and it is equivalent to over 6.2 per cent gross on the first £1,750 of savings, or double this amount for a husband and wife who keep separate accounts.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together. The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I <Col N="1072" /> propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rest of the question, the annual planting programme has been restored to 25,000 acres from 1971-72 and this will benefit Counties Longford and Westmeath as well as other counties.  It is not expected, however, that this will result in increased employment at forests in these counties, but it is hoped that it will enable existing staffs to be maintained.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>LAND held by Forest and Wildlife Service at 31/3/72 (acres).</P>

      <P>The position in relation to <Col N="1073" /> Ballymun is that last year two classes for children whose parents wished them to receive instruction through Irish were provided in prefabricated classrooms in connection with one of the existing national schools.  This was a temporary arrangement pending the erection of a permanent school building. This permanent building is now being provided within a short distance of Ballymun.  It was erected specially for the children who were being housed in the prefabricated classrooms and for others whose parents might wish them to receive instruction through Irish. This in my Department's view was the proper arrangement as the question of space apart from anything else would have ruled out the full development of an all-Irish school on the site occupied by the prefabricated classrooms which was merely part of the site of another national school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that the amount of State expenditure proposed for 1972-73 on the cleaning, heating and painting of primary schools represents an expenditure of £1 per child which compares with £12 per child spent on such schools in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>For any comparison with the position in Northern Ireland to be valid it would have to take the whole situation in relation to voluntary and maintained schools into consideration and not one element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our national schools system here is based on local trusteeship which involves a local contribution towards the upkeep of schools.  That the local contribution helps to lessen the load on the general taxpayer does not take from the fact that it is the general public one way or another that is paying for the upkeep of schools.  The Department's grants towards the heating <Col N="1086" /> and cleaning of schools is by way of supplementing local aid.  The rates of grant were increased by 20 per cent in the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the recent criticism in relation to such finance being made available for the maintenance of national schools?  Is he further aware that the position at the moment is most unsatisfactory as far as national school managers are concerned and is he aware that the position in Northern Ireland is much better than it is here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Transport to special classes for mildly mentally handicapped children is provided by passes on existing primary, post-primary or public services.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The condition for assistance under the free books <Col N="1088" /> scheme for necessitous pupils is that the school principal be satisfied that there is genuine hardship in the pupil's home.  Possession of a medical card is of course a factor which the principal may take into consideration when assessing individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be surprised to hear that the principal of a school said medical cards have nothing whatever to do with this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I assure this good lady, when she quotes to me 10/68/RR/100/400 which, she says, the Minister has sent to all teachers telling them how the books should be distributed, that she is completely misinterpreting the circular?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither do I, but the good lady is the principal of a school and she should know something about it.  She has quoted this circular to me as the reason why necessitous children are not getting books, books to which I believe they are entitled.  She also says the Minister is not giving them enough money.  Since I have brought the matter to the Minister's notice, perhaps the Minister would give me some further information at his convenience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a family of nine children.  The breadwinner has been ill for a number of years and is in possession of a medical card.  Should not those children, then, be entitled to consideration for free books?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal teacher in a school has to make this decision which is based on such circumstances as children coming from a home where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment or prolonged illness of the parents or where there is a large family with inadequate means.  There are various other factors also but basically the matter is one for principal teachers to decide.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  It is concerned with the definition of proprietary <Col N="1118" /> director and proprietary employee contained in section 13, subsection (1) of the Bill.  Subsection (3) of that section is intended to provide that for the purposes of these definitions, ordinary share capital owned or controlled by the spouse or infant child of such a director or employee is to be regarded as owned or controlled by the director or employee concerned.  As it stands the subsection says:</P>
    <P>... by a person being a spouse or an infant child of a director or an employee.</P>
    <P>It should say: &ldquo;by a person being a spouse or an infant child of a director or of an employee&rdquo;.  This is what the amendment is designed to achieve.

      <P>The Deputy has been informed as to why the amendments were ruled out of order. The reason is that they contain a new matter of substance which did not come before the Committee.  The issue raised in amendments Nos. 3 to 7 deal, <i>inter alia,</i> with the exclusion of minors from the provisions relating to discretionary trusts.  The net point raised by the Deputy on Committee was whether a company could be of full age.  The question of minors did not figure in the arguments put forward by the Deputy.  I understand that on amendment No. 8 the Minister clarifies this particular point.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to argue in respect of amendments Nos. 6 and 7 but in so far as amendments Nos. 3 to 5 are concerned it seems to me that we discussed this matter in the debate.  By dealing with this question of minors, the amendments are designed to deal, in part, with the <Col N="1119" /> problem which was raised in the debate on section 32.  In fact, the whole debate there was on this question of the phrase &ldquo;full age&rdquo; towards the end of the section and the point was made that this raised the question that a company cannot be of full age, and that the way of dealing with that is to exclude minors from the operation of the section, which is what these three amendments aim to do.  If, as I understand it, the amendment is designed to remedy the defects which relate to section 32 in part, I do not see why they are ruled out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> In page 20, line 5, after &ldquo;number of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;individuals who are&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to clarify the meaning of subsection (6) of section 32 of the Bill.  The object of section 32 is to prevent the avoidance of estate duty through the medium of discretionary trusts.  To achieve this object a person who is in receipt of payments, as defined, from such a trust is deemed to have had an interest in possession in the trust property and this interest is deemed to cease on his death giving a claim for estate duty under section 2 (1) (b) of the Finance Act, 1894.  The interest ceasing is deemed to be an annuity equivalent to the average annual payments made to him in the five years preceding his death.</P>
    <P>A problem arises if the trust property includes a house, lands or chattels of which the deceased was in occupation or possession.  Section 32 (6) deals with this situation by providing (a)  that if the deceased was the only object of the trust in occupation or possession of the land including a house or chattels his occupation or possession is deemed to be income at the rate of 6 per cent per annum of the market value of the said lands or chattels or (b) if there were more than one object of the trust in occupation or possession the occupation or possession is deemed to be income at 6 per cent of such market value or 6 per cent divided by the number of objects in possession including the deceased if there is more than one object.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy FitzGerald argued that a company could be an object of a trust and that such company could, therefore, be in occupation of a house and he contended that it was meaningless to refer to a company as being of full age.  I am advised that this problem is not one that arises.  However, the amendment proposed now does clarify the matter and I hope makes it quite clear to Deputy FitzGerald and everybody else that a company is not included in this.  In fact, the whole intention is to exclude the company because by bringing in a company there can be large scale avoidance.  Therefore, since I hope this will clarify that aspect of the <Col N="1121" /> matter I am proposing that this amendment be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few things I want to say on this Stage.  I am not happy with the way we have handled this Bill.  I know we have had this problem before but it is my first experience of it.  The time we had from publication to Second Stage was too short and various people who could offer useful advice on this did not get an opportunity to study it in the time available which was very limited.  As a result, some amendments have come forward which the Chair has&mdash;in some instances I would agree, properly, although in other instances I might contest this&mdash;ruled out of order on the ground that they introduce new matter. It is certainly true that some of them introduce new matter.  I can see that on reflection.  They introduce new matter because the new matter did not come to light in the very short period available between the publication of the Bill and Committee Stage.  We have this very short period in which we have not time to study the Bill extensively&mdash; and these Bills are very complex&mdash;and see the defects in it and then that these Bills go through the House somewhat hurriedly with all the pressure from all the Deputies who are not interested in the Finance Bill&mdash;and that must be about 140 of them&mdash;who want to go on holidays.  Then, the Bill is rushed through.  It then goes to the Seanad which first, only has power to recommend a change which, I gather, falls if the Dáil does not accept it and secondly, with the Dáil not here the Minister will resist such recommendations and certainly will not be prepared to recall the Dáil for some technical points in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> The combined effect of all this is that Finance Bills are rushed through in a way that leaves them defective and the next Finance Bill or a later one must pick up the pieces.  We go on with this all the time.  This procedure is unsatisfactory and I urge on the Minister that in future adequate notice must be given.  Promises have been made in the past and have not been kept.  As far as I am concerned and if I occupy this post a year hence, as shadow Minister I shall be concerned to ensure that there is an adequate interval and I shall not agree to the Bill being taken until an adequate interval has elapsed for consultation with the various interests.</P>
    <P>That would not be necessary if the Seanad had a real opportunity to consider it but owing to the adjournment of the Dáil there is not such an opportunity.  I wish to put the Minister on notice of that now.  I think we are not doing our job here.  I have always taken the actual job of legislating in the House very seriously.  I know it is under-rated by the general public because much of the intricacies of Committee Stage debate are unreportable and virtually un-understandable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Unreportable in the sense that it is not to be expected that newspapers will give a very full report on matters as technical as this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And no blame to them either.  If they did, I do not think anybody would read them except people expertly involved.  The whole situation is unsatisfactory and I think we should consider it further. If we are going to legislate in this House we should do so properly and with due consideration.  I want to illustrate that point by referring to what seems to be the several defects in the Bill as it now stands.  I shall not dwell on these points but I want to draw them to the attention of the Minister and urge him to take early <Col N="1123" /> remedial action though I know there is a problem about that.</P>
      <P>In regard to section 13 there is the matter of relevant benefits.  We had a discussion on this before.  I want to urge on the Minister that what he has done has been inequitable to an extent that, perhaps, he has not fully appreciated. His point is that it is unfair that somebody should be put at an advantage because there happens to be an accident policy on his life and he benefits from this and may get one extra year's benefit.  May I ask the Minister how he would measure that benefit?  What price could you put on a benefit of this kind?  I suggest the price you put on it is the premium payable for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the advantage which he is trying to ensure that somebody does not get over other people is the advantage that would be bought by an insurance policy.  If a man went along and sought a policy individually with the words &ldquo;during the period of service&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;in the course of his duties&rdquo; how much more would he pay for it?  I made inquiries today and I can tell the Minister that if an individual went along and sought a policy of the wider kind, which would ensure that if he were on a visit to Brussels and went out to the pictures with his wife at night, leaving the group he was with, for a few hours relaxation, and if he were knocked down and injured, he would benefit&mdash; under the provisions the Minister is insisting on he would not benefit&mdash;the extra cost of such a premium to him would be nil.  The difference in risk involved is so small that it is virtually incalculable and in the case of an individual no extra charge is made for it.  If a company is insuring a person for, say, his annual salary of £3,000 a year and the company wants to get an accident premium covering a period of a year, so that if he were killed in an accident any time during that year when in the service of the company he would be covered, it would have to pay for that policy of £3,000, £2.7.  The narrowing down of that policy, so that it covered only a period when he is actually in the course of employment in the company, would <Col N="1124" /> reduce the premium to £1.8.  The difference between the two is £.9 in such a case.  The Minister, in order to ensure that somebody does not get the benefit of 18s worth of insurance, is forcing companies to underinsure their employees and to insure them in a manner which no reputable company uses.  All reputable companies now insure for the period of service because if a man slips on the street going into the office and has not actually reached the door they do not want to deprive him of benefit.  That is the effect of what the Minister is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have checked this out.  An employee, once he reaches the office and is inside, is insured; but on his way to work he is not insured under the scheme as the Minister is now insisting on it.  If he is away from home and goes off on his own from a group he is not insured. If he stays with the group he is insured. Why should the Minister wish to do something which simply involves something which is worth 18s for a £3,000 policy?  That is all that is involved and yet he is forcing all employers all the time to cut back on their accident benefit and make it such that the average employer would consider inadequate.  The Minister should re-consider that.  I see the difficulty of re-considering it now because the Ceann Comhairle felt it necessary to rule this out of order, but I think an inequity has been done and should be remedied as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 32 we have left a situation which is unsatisfactory.  I have difficulty in following this fully and the best thing I can do is to read out to the Minister the points that have been made to me on the section as now drafted.  This arises from amendment No. 7, ruled out of order, in which I proposed to delete the word &ldquo;subsection&rdquo; and insert the word &ldquo;section&rdquo;.  The effect of the Bill being left in its present from is unfortunate. This section has been introduced to nullify the decision of Kenny in Royal Trust Company <i>v.</i> Revenue Commissioners, a case in <Col N="1125" /> which a decision against the Revenue Commissioners was secured in a claim for estate duty.  The section repeals section 21 of the Finance Act, 1965, which dealt with discretionary trusts. Section 21 dealt only with cases where the trustees had discretion to pay or apply income or capital for the benefit of one or more of a class of several persons.  The new section applies where the trustees have discretion to pay or apply income or capital for the benefit of one person or of a class of persons.  Subsection 5 of section 32 applies where property is deemed to pass on the death of a person contingently entitled by reason of his failing to attain a particular age&mdash;thereby in effect repealing section 5 (3) of the Finance Act, 1894, and the decision of Chief Baron Palles in Attorney General <i>v.</i> Power (1906).  There is a proviso that the subsection shall not apply where property is held in trust for an infant contingently on his attaining full age.  This leaves subsection (2) of section 32 applying in such a case, so that if any income is applied for the benefit of the child pending his attaining the age of 21, and he dies under that age, there will be a claim for estate duty against the settled property. This appears to be unreasonable and would have been met by my amendment.  I would ask the Minister to look into that point and to see whether, if not now, in a subsequent Finance Bill a modification could be introduced.</P>
    <P>With those two illustrations I have shown how undesirable it is to rush this legislation through.  I would urge on the Minister in future to leave ample time for points to be made and discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On every Finance Bill for a number of years I have asked the Minister for Finance to do something about income tax for lower paid workers.  On a number of occasions the Minister has adjusted this very slightly.  For almost 20 years, while wages have trebled in volume, if not in value, income tax has remained basically the same.  The Minister or his successor must ask the people responsible for preparing the figures to make more effort to deal with this <Col N="1126" /> problem.  It is no answer to say that slight adjustments are being made.</P>
      <P>The Minister must get down to the fact that if somebody has to travel a certain distance to work he must use a vehicle.  Thank God, many people are doing that instead of staying at home and trying to live on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  There should be an allowance for transport.  It is very unfair to see those people having to pay out so much for income tax.</P>
      <P>The third point I want to make is the question of gross and net wages. I know an adjustment is being made with regard to superannuation but it is not sufficient.  Compare the gross wage of these people with the net wage.  They are taxed on the gross wage and you find that somebody who is being paid £25 a week finishes up with less than £15 a week after working not five days of eight hours but six days of nine, ten, and 11 hours. It is grossly unfair and the Minister must do something about it.  People do not want to work overtime because it is no use to them.  By the time the State and the local authority, for housing, have their share out of it there is very little left to the person who works the overtime.  The Minister should make some effort to see what the real problem is.  I appreciate that he has many other things to do but it seems that this is being overlooked, and in view of the tremendous increase in the amount of money being taken in in income tax over the last few years I would ask him to consider it.  When trade unions and trade union officials are attempting to negotiate a wage increase, the fact that out of every £ increase in wages the State now takes, in many cases, 35p must affect the thinking of those who are looking for wage increases.  There is no use telling people that they will get an increase of £3 per week when they know that the State will take over £1 of it in extra income tax.  I would ask the Minister to consider these matters because something must be done to try to remedy them.  It could have an effect on the whole wage structure if an effort were made to rationalise them.</P>

      <P>The first point I want to deal with is the general issue of the amount of time available to Deputies between the circulation of the Bill and the taking of the Bill in the House. I confess that I have not actually worked out what it was this year as compared with previous years, but I know that this year's Finance Bill, relative to any other Finance Bill of which I have any experience, is far less complex.  I hasten to add that, having said that, I am not saying it is not a complex Bill.  What I am saying is that in relation to Finance Bills in previous years it is far less complex.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to that factor, and having regard to the fact that many of the provisions of this Bill are in easement of the taxpayer on foot of the budget and otherwise, many sections of the Bill did not require as detailed discussion and examination as did most previous Finance Bills.  This should be taken into account in deciding whether or not adequate time was allowed.  That is the first point I wanted to make.</P>
      <P>The second is that I think Deputy FitzGerald is mistaken in thinking that, because Finance Bills come in here and regularly contain amendments and alterations to previous Finance Bills, this illustrates that previous legislation has gone through with some defect in it.  Normally what it means is that some loophole has been discovered by somebody whose job it is, and who is paid very well, to discover loopholes in Finance Bills, and that we are closing the loophole. If we spent a year on a Finance Bill we would not produce one that had no loopholes in it when the well-paid and well-qualified experts got to work on it.  This is a fact of life which we have got to recognise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that a mistake has never been made in the passing of a Finance Bill.  Of course there have <Col N="1128" /> been some but, if Deputy FitzGerald goes back over the record, I think he will find that the vast majority of the amendments to Finance Bills in successive years related to the closing of loopholes, not necessarily in previous legislation but rather, as I explained on another occasion, loopholes discovered in Britain, perhaps, and closed there, and people here taking up the running to operate them here.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances I do not think there is too much validity in Deputy FitzGerald's complaint about the timing.  However, primarily it was a matter for the Whips as to when the Bill would be taken and how much time would be given to it.  There was a certain scarcely veiled threat in what Deputy FitzGerald said about next year.  May I suggest to him that the first avenue he ought to explore in this regard is his own Whip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to deal with a number of the more detailed points which were raised.  There is a certain amount of validity in what Deputy Tully said about income tax.  I would not try to contest that.  He is as well aware as I am of the difficulties involved in any worthwhile relief from income tax.  There is the difficulty of the large amount of revenue involved. There is also difficulty of finding alternative sources of revenue.  If we did not find alternative sources of revenue nobody would be faster&mdash;and this is intended as a compliment&mdash;than Deputy Tully in pointing out to us in this <Col N="1129" /> House what we were cutting out and the damage that was being caused by cutting it out.  I am sure he realises that there are practical problems. Having said that I want to reiterate that we have gone some way along the road in this Finance Bill in giving relief.  The bulk of the income tax relief, although it applies all round, applies, in my opinion, to those who are most in need of it, that is, married couples with large families of young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but would the Minister accept this?  When the wages of a rural labourer were £6 a week his tax free allowance was £6.50. His wages are now £20 a week and surely a tax free allowance of £6.50 could not still be right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was to Deputy Tully that I gave some figures on a previous occasion which showed what had happened over the years, taking non-agricultural wages in relation to income tax liability, and the value of net income after payment of tax.  It has increased substantially over the years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the Deputy the figures.  In regard to section 13 and the point made by Deputy FitzGerald on the question of accident insurance, I do not want to go back over all the ground we went over on Committee Stage.  I should point out&mdash;and it is an example of what I was saying earlier &mdash;that because of the fact that a number of the sections in this Bill are in easement of the taxpayer there was not all that much discussion on them. It may not be obvious to the House that what we are doing here is in considerable easement of the taxpayer. Under the existing law the maximum lump sum payment is one and a half times final remuneration.  The proposal in this Bill is that the new maximum will be four times the final remuneration. If the employer provides accident insurance for one year's remuneration under the retirement benefit <Col N="1130" /> scheme&mdash;that is, under the scheme provided for in this Bill&mdash;a lump sum payment of three times the remuneration may be given, and that is twice what is available under the existing law.</P>
      <P>Under the generality of the schemes covering ordinary employees the lump sum payable is one year's remuneration and, therefore, the only schemes which would get the additional benefit sought by Deputy FitzGerald would be what are known as top hat schemes. I am not condemning them on those grounds but we must keep the matter in perspective.  That is what Deputy FitzGerald was really complaining about.  The case he has made is not sufficiently compelling, but it is certainly a matter on which I will be keeping an eye in relation to the kind of schemes being produced to the Revenue Commissioners.  If it appears that this is creating any substantial problem we will certainly have another look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy FitzGerald is misinformed in relation to the subject matter of what was his amendment No. 7 which was ruled out of order.  As I understand it he said in the circumstances of a minor in receipt of an income dying, this would be treated as a cessor and subject to duty.  I am advised that that is not so.  I do not wish to go into all the details but I want to make it clear that it is not a question of trying to legislate ourselves out of the decision in the Powers case to which he referred.</P>
      <P>In fact, since that case it has not been the practice to claim estate duty on the death under age of one of the children in the type of case envisaged here and, therefore, in the situation described by Deputy FitzGerald he assumed, on the advice available to him, that duty would be levied.  I want to tell him that that is not so; it would not be levied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>A further point to which I wish to refer is in relation to section 32.  It is a point raised by Deputy FitzGerald on Committee Stage and which I said I would have another look at although I told him at the time that I did not think it was necessary.  Deputy FitzGerald contended in relation to section 32 that, as section 21 of the Finance Act, 1965, under which discretionary trusts are dealt with at present, is being repealed by virtue of Part III of the Fourth Schedule to this Bill, it would not seem possible to avail of subsection (5) of section 21 for the purpose of calculating the value of benefits which a deceased person derived from the occupation or possession of land or chattels owned by a company established by the deceased, under section 20 (4) (b) (i) of the 1965 Finance Act.  Section 20 (4) (b) (i) provides that where the benefits enjoyed consist of or include the occupation or possession of lands or chattels the value of the occupation or possession shall be determined in the same manner as the value of similar benefits is determined under the provisions of subsection (5) of section 21 of this Act.</P>
      <P>The point here is that references to subsection (5) of section 21 of this Act must in future be read as if the words &ldquo;as re-enacted&rdquo;&mdash;that is, by section 22 of this Bill&mdash;were inserted after it since it is, in fact, being re-enacted by section 32.  However, as I indicated at the time, there is not any need to effect such an amendment because of the provisions of the Interpretation Act, 1937.  Section 20 (1) of the Interpretation Act, 1927, was specifically intended to cover this kind of eventuality and it provides as follows:</P>
      <P>Whenever any statute or portion of a statute is repealed and re-enacted with or without modification by an Act of the Oireachtas references in any other statute or in any statutory instrument to the statute or portion of the statute so repealed and re-enacted shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as references to the portion of such Act of the Oireachtas containing such re-enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, under that provision it is <Col N="1132" /> not necessary, as I say, to provide for the addition of the words that could be deemed to be interpolated, that is, &ldquo;as re-enacted&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm if I made it clear that there is no connection between section 20 of the 1965 Act, on the one hand, and section 21 of that Act, which is now section 32 of this Bill, except to the extent that the same method is adopted under section 20 as is adopted under subsection (5) of section 21 in valuing benefits which are derived from the occupation or possession of land or chattels of a deceased person from a company. However, section 20 deals with avoidance of estate duty through the medium of family companies, whereas section 21, now section 32 of this Bill, is concerned with avoidance through the medium of discretionary trusts.  That is the only connection between the two.</P>
    <P>The final matter to which I wish to refer is that, again in the course of previous discussion, it was suggested that we ought to provide under section 45, which deals with foreign adoptions, that these provisions would be made retrospective so as to give relief to cases in which duty has not yet been paid.  I am afraid I could not accept this proposition in principle.  If we were to confine relief to such cases we would create the anomaly that taxpayers who had met their obligations would be placed at a disadvantage as against those who delayed in settling claims for duty made against them. Consequently, if the section were to be made retrospective, the retrospection would certainly have to be adequate to cover all cases whether or not duty had been paid.  I think the House will accept this principle.  But, if one accepts this, the next problem is that one comes up against the question, where does one draw the line, and it is very difficult to suggest a retrospective date without running the risk of being accused of selecting the date to meet a particular case.  Therefore, whatever date would be chosen should be defendable on the basis of having been chosen on general grounds.  For instance, the relief given by section 39 of the Finance Act, 1960, to informally <Col N="1133" /> adopted children, was made retrospective to 1st January, 1953.  This was the date when the Adoption Act, 1952, came into operation.  It could, therefore, be argued, I suppose, that section 45 of this Bill should be made retrospective to that date, that is 19 years back.</P>
    <P>However, many cases have arisen since 1953 and all of them have been settled on the basis of existing law and they would all have to be reopened. There is the obvious difficulty that can be involved here and, perhaps, there are difficulties that are not as obvious.  It is not merely an administrative difficulty; it could affect the whole administration of estates which have now been wound up and you could find yourself dealing with persons at the tenth remove and making small adjustments as a result.</P>
    <P>However, even overlooking that difficulty, if we were to go further, to make section 45 retrospective in this way, there is not any valid reason why section 44, which deals with illegitimate children, should not also be given retrospective effect from the same date.  This would not meet the case of all illegitimate children who first acquired inheritance rights under the Legitimacy Act of 1921 and I suppose, by analogy with section 45, therefore, section 44 would have to commence as far back as 1931, which, I think, would be accepted as being unrealistic.</P>
    <P>However, that need not be the end of the matter.  If we were to do that, there are other relief sections in the Bill and a strong case might be made for making them retrospective if we make sections 44 and 45 retrospective. So, any date chosen would be arbitrary and would introduce a new set of inequities.</P>
    <P>For all of these reasons, all of the estate duty sections are designed to take effect on the passing of the Bill and I do not propose to alter that position.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) The Acts shall not apply to charges for services, the charges for which are, or may be, controlled, regulated or specified either under any enactment, or any instrument made thereunder, or in discharge of any statutory power, duty or function.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to exclude from the Bill any charge for services by any profession which is already controlled.  The idea behind the amendment should be obvious.  We find there is no necessity to apply the prices control provisions of this Bill to a profession or any other occupation which is already controlled.  I speak with special reference to the solicitors' profession.  The solicitors' profession has been subjected to costs control of a very stringent nature for nearly 100 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at present as many as six statutory committees dealing with solicitors' charges.  These committees are composed of members of the judiciary and members of the profession concerned.  The important thing about it is that the last word is not even left in the hands of these statutory committees.  In regard to what is called non-contentious work, the Minister has the right to bring before the House any recommendation made by the committees concerned and to put down a resolution annulling the order.  In fact, the Minister for Justice invoked this power on quite a few occasions.  He invoked it recently when one of the committees dealing with general costs brought in a scale of costs with which the Minister did not agree.  The Minister put down a resolution in the Seanad asking that House to annul <Col N="1135" /> that particular order.  It was annulled by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In regard to the contentious work carried out by the solicitors' profession the Minister has a stronger power at present.  He has the power to veto the recommendations or any scale of costs drawn up by the committee.  There is a number of scales of costs before the Minister for Justice for quite a while and he has not approved of them.  They cannot become law until he approves of them.  I am making that case to try to point out to the Minister and to the House that in so far as the solicitors' profession is concerned they are already adequately controlled.  It is fair to say that they are the only profession that are controlled at the moment and have been adequately controlled as far back as 1884.</P>
    <P>I do not always agree with following precedents from across the water.  I think we are notorious in this country for taking precedents from Acts of Parliament from the Westminster Parliament and even from the Northern Ireland Parliament.  There is price control legislation in the United Kingdom. I believe that it is controlled under a committee there and it is true to say that the Lord Chancellor has a very big part to play in the control of legal charges.  I understand that the Minister for Justice takes the view that the Lord Chancellor is a similar personage to the Minister for Justice here.  The Lord Chancellor in Great Britain is, in fact, head of the judiciary.  He is a judge and he has very considerable power in the fixing of costs.  In England, according to my information, professional charges were not brought within the price control legislation because they are already adequately controlled.  I further understand that the same position applies in Northern Ireland.  Solicitors' charges are regulated there in the same way as they are here by judicial committees subject to the right of Parliament, when it was there, to annul recommendations or orders made by the committee.</P>
    <P>Those are briefly the points I wish to make.  I should like to have the Minister's observations on them or his case against them.  We are introducing price control now on a very <Col N="1136" /> wide basis but the fact of the matter is that in the field with which I am dealing at present we have very adequate costs control.  It sometimes takes as long as seven years to reach agreement with the Department of Justice in regard to solicitors' charges. The amendment which I am putting forward is a reasonable one.  I would be glad to hear the Minister's views on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment.  I think the Deputy could anticipate this as there was a discussion on Second Stage on the possibility of excluding legal fees or controlling services under this heading. At that stage I endeavoured to give an outline of the reasons why I thought it was proper that legal charges should be included in the overall control of service charges that I proposed under the Prices (Amendment) Bill.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the various committees to which Deputy Fitzpatrick referred.  He pointed out that the system of control which had been operating in the 1880s in that profession was a satisfactory one.  I do not feel that this is so.  He indicated that quite recently the Minister for Justice had occasion to oppose an order and that the existing legislation gave sufficient power to the Minister for Justice to control charges in this regard.  I do not share this view with the Deputy.  I found myself reading a number of the contributions which had been made by various Senators and by the Minister for Justice in the Seanad on 23rd February this year when the general order of solicitor's remuneration was being discussed there.  Senator O'Higgins, leading for Deputy Fitzpatrick's party in the Seanad, said in relation to this that the solicitors' profession was as much entitled to fair play and fair remuneration as any other sector of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree totally with Senator O'Higgins in that regard.  In fact, section 2 of the Bill incorporates this amendment proposed by Deputy Fitzpatrick here, but the second amendment, <Col N="1137" /> No. 3, which we are also discussing, would mean the withdrawal of the very important part of section 2 (1) (b) of the Bill.  Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned that he did not like drawing comparisons with the situation in the UK, but went on to say that the situation there was so satisfactory that under the price control arrangements there it was not found necessary to take the powers I am proposing to take here, and that the Minister for Justice was comparing himself with the Lord Chancellor. He should be in a position to do this from the point of view of the effective control of legal remuneration, because the rules in England made by the County Court Rules Committee may be allowed or disallowed or may be altered by the Lord Chancellor.  The situation here is that the Minister for Justice may allow or disallow; to follow the format, he may only agree with or disagree with, but he cannot alter.  If he disagrees in one section he must come to this House or the Seanad to oppose the order.  This is what he found it necessary to do on a recent occasion when it was proposed under certain headings to increase the overall legal fees by 42 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any justification for my accepting this amendment for the withdrawal of the controls outlined by the Deputy.  The representatives of the Incorporated Law Society met in my Department for a discussion on this, and from reports to me arising from those discussions I feel there is not that great deal of pressure from the Incorporated Law Society to have themselves excluded from this Bill. They are most anxious that their voices should be heard by the committee operating on behalf of the Minister for Justice when the powers of control taken in this Bill are handed over to the Minister for Justice by the Government. They are asking for a similar type of access to the committee which the Minister will have advising him in this regard to that which would be available to people who want to make a case to the National Prices Commission under the existing regulations for price control in my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> I have no reason to believe that this type of facility will not be made available to them.  As I say, I have not been under pressure from the Incorporated Law Society to exclude the legal costs, as is proposed in this amendment. Therefore, what Senator O'Higgins asked for in the Seanad, to have the same type of fair play afforded to the legal profession as is afforded to any other of the professional services is, I think, the proper way to deal with it, and that is how I propose to deal with it under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This amendment standing in the name of Deputy Cooney and myself, while I am not in a position to give the exact date, was handed in, it seems to me, some months ago.  The Minister is quite correct when he says that since then there have been comings and goings between the Incorporated Law Society and the Minister's Department in an effort to get what he calls fair play for the profession.  However, my information is that when representatives of the law society call on the Minister for Industry and Commerce they are referred by him to the Minister for Justice, and when they go to the Department of Justice they are told by that Department that they should make their representations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce because he is piloting this piece of legislation through Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in those circumstances that I put down this amendment.  If I could get from the Minister here an undertaking that he would accede to the reasonable requests of the law society, then I would be in a position to withdraw this amendment.  I repeat that, in my opinion, the charges of the solicitors' profession are at the present time, and have been for a great many years back, subject to stringent control and to measurement by officers of the court.  Not alone are scales of cost provided but those scales are left to independent, quasi-judicial officers known as taxing masters, who tax any solicitor's bill referred to them, and every citizen in this country has the statutory right to have any bill of costs furnished to him taxed or measured by <Col N="1139" /> one of the taxing masters of the High Court before he pays it.</P>
    <P>That is a procedure that I can say no other profession I am aware of is subject to and it is for that reason that I say the present procedures for safeguarding the public against any attempt to charge exorbitant fees are quite adequate.  However, we go with the Minister to this extent: if he feels that as part of his overall price control proposals the solicitors' profession should be included they would not violently object to it provided reasonable provisions are put into this Bill to meet their requirements.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, if this Bill becomes law without this amendment, the charges of solicitors will be submitted to a national prices commission, which I think will consist of a couple of industrialists, a housewife and a couple of trade unionists.  I have no objection whatever to industrialists or to trade unionists or to housewives operating in their own spheres or in regard to matters which they are qualified technically to deal with.  We in the solicitors' profession suggested to the Ministers for Justice and Industry and Commerce that, instead of the six statutory committees which are in existence at the present time and which are composed of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, other members of the Judiciary and members of the Bar and solicitors' profession, there should be one central costs committee set up and that on such a body should be represented the Judiciary, the professions concerned, specialists such as chartered accountants, and the general public.</P>
    <P>If I could get an assurance from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he would proceed to set up such a central costs committee, then I could tell him that the wishes of the Incorporated Law Society would be met to a very large extent under this heading because the Incorporated Law Society have been campaigning or negotiating with successive Ministers for Justice during the last number of years to get such a central costs committee established which would <Col N="1140" /> deal with contentious or non-contentious work, and that on that committee would be represented the Judiciary, who are independent, the professions mainly concerned, chartered accountants and the general public.  Such a committee would be well qualified to deal with the charges.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister to say there is already machinery in the Bill to set up such a committee.  I should like him to tell me what those provisions are.  I should like him to go further and to tell me that he proposes to introduce an amendment spelling out in black and white that such a committee will be set up.  I believe the machinery we are creating now cannot work or take the initiative unless the Minister consents to it doing certain things.</P>
    <P>At the present time, if solicitors feel that charges should be revised upwards they can make proposals to one or other of those six statutory committees who can bring in a recommendation revising the costs.  In regard to non-contentious costs, the Minister can invite either House of the Oireachtas to annul the recommendation. In the other cases the recommendations cannot have effect without the Minister's consent.  If this legislation goes through unamended by my proposals, the position of solicitors will be worsened considerably because they will be handed over to a lay commission without any technical people.  Furthermore, they will never be able to get before that commission inadequate as it may be, unless the Minister agrees, and the experience of the Incorporated Law Society has not been all that happy with the Department of Justice in years gone by&mdash;I will not say how long gone by.</P>
    <P>I have been given the opportunity to say what I have said by the Minister's statement that he did not think he had been under all the pressure I suggested from the Incorporated Law Society to exclude the professions entirely from the Bill.  He has met the society&mdash;I have not been on any deputations&mdash;but I will challenge him to deny that the atmosphere in which he and the Minister for Justice were <Col N="1141" /> approached was on the basis of the two requests I have now made&mdash;that a central costs committee be set up and that the Bill be altered to give the solicitors' profession or any other profession concerned direct access to that body.  That was the basis on which the Council of the Incorporated Law Society approached the Minister. Perhaps the Minister will tell us if he agrees with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Fitzpatrick on this amendment and to correct what I gather to be the Minister's impression of the motive for the amendment.  It does not seek to exclude the legal profession from price control.  It seeks to exclude control over legal costs from the Executive and to leave it as at present in the Oireachtas.  This is the important distinction I should like to emphasise.  The legal profession's costs are already subject to control in the ultimate by both Houses of the Oireachtas and all this Bill is doing is continuing control but proposing to give the ultimate power to an arm of the Executive, possibly the Minister for Justice if a commission is set up by him.  The profession's grounds for objection to that is not a desire to have their charges brought out of the control of the Oireachtas.  The Incorporated Law Society have made it clear that they do not object to price control as such but to that control being vested in the Executive instead of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In support of that, I want to emphasise what I emphasised on Second Reading, that the reason for this is that the solicitors' profession considers itself, and rightly considers itself, to be part of the judicial arm of the State and traditionally and constitutionally the judicial arm is independent of the Executive and I think it should be independent in all its aspects, all facets of its operation.  If the Executive takes power to control the costs of part of the judicial arm, the Executive is interfering with and in breach of that principle of the separation of powers. This is an important point and one which the Minister has not yet answered.  I made the point as I thought clearly on Second Reading and I would <Col N="1142" /> like the Minister to consider it now in relation to this amendment, emphasising again, and I cannot emphasise it too often because the point apparently has been missed, that the solicitors' profession does not seek exemption from price control.  It merely asks that its costs be ultimately controlled by the Oireachtas as at present and not by the Executive as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this amendment would exclude legal costs from price control, in his reply to Deputy Fitzpatrick.  This is not the position. The amendment does not seek to exempt the legal profession from price control.  The legal profession's costs are already controlled and what it seeks to do&mdash;and I ask the Minister to bear with me if I am boring him with repetition but I want to make the point extremely clear&mdash;is to leave the control in the hands of the Oireachtas, either the Dáil or Seanad, and not give it to the Executive.  The theoretical basis for that distinction is the separation of powers which is a doctrine inherent in our constitutional democracy.  If the Minister takes power to interfere with an arm of the court, in effect he is giving the Executive power to interfere with the judicial function of the State and, in rather a significant aspect, the power of that particular part of the judicial function to remunerate itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the recent annulling of an order which sought an overall increase in legal fees of 42 per cent.  That increase was not sought. What was sought was an increase of that percentage in relation to Schedule 2 items, a very limited range of solicitor's items, such as writing a letter or perusing a document&mdash;but in the case of the vast range of costs with regard to litigation and conveyancing, no increase was sought.  The increase sought was in a very narrow field indeed and it was inaccurate for the Minister to say that the Minister for Justice had to annul an order granting an overall increase of 42 per cent.  That was not sought.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask the Minister to bear in mind when considering this amendment the point I am making, that what the law society and this amendment seek is to ensure that legal costs are <Col N="1143" /> controlled ultimately by the Oireachtas as good constitutional practice and not by the Minister as a member of the Executive.  We do not seek for the solicitors' profession exclusion from price control.  That already exists and the Minister has been informed by the law society that they welcome control and are quite agreeable to it, but they want the ultimate control to lie in the hands of this House or of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cooney and Deputy Fitzpatrick except that I am a businessman and not a solicitor.  How you can control any professional service is beyond me.  If I have to have one of my children cured by an expert doctor, a doctor who is good in his field, a specialist, I am not worried about the cost, and the same applies also to solicitors.  Am I now to be controlled to the extent that I must pay a good solicitor and a bad solicitor the same when I am willing to pay a good solicitor but not a bad solicitor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, this body is going to check a solicitor for overcharging.  The official concerned can walk into the solicitor's office and can check, as far as I can read it, a file relating to me, a businessman, in that office.  Nobody is entitled to touch my file in that office and if he touches my file, I take an action against him straight away for even looking at it, and if we are to have this, it means that the file of any businessman, any shopkeeper, any small or big man, in that office can be checked by the Minister and his Department eventually.  I do not think they are entitled to do that and if they ever touch one of mine, I will take an action the following morning.  They are interfering with matters relating to a person who has given no permission to a Department or whoever is assigned to check prices.  Whatever file is checked, there must be permission to look at it and if that permission is refused, I do not think they can go near it.  Above all, I feel that to control one solicitor against another, one barrister against another, one doctor against another, one accountant against another &mdash; for expert advice you pay a good man and are not willing <Col N="1144" /> to pay a bad man &mdash; means that you are putting them all in the one basket.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been provoked into commenting on the amendment. My view, which is purely a non-solicitor's view, is that what is sauce for the manufacturing gander must also be sauce for the professional goose, and much as I admire the special pleading, the very articulate pleading, of Deputy Cooney and the validity of a certain element in his argument, I do not think it is the overriding argument.  If one wanted to engage in the follow-through which Deputy Cooney suggested, technically there is nothing to stop the National Prices Commission setting up such a working party under its jurisdiction, involving the grey eminences of the legal world and the Department of Justice and mutually arriving at a scale of fees which would be acceptable in the public interest.  There is nothing to stop that happening, although the National Prices Commission, as such does not have formal Oireachtas standing.</P>
      <P>I think we could perhaps make very heavy weather of the situation and it is in the public interest, I think, that in relation to such fees and not only the fees of State-sponsored bodies who are responsible to the Oireachtas in the last analysis&mdash;and we intend to go even further in our amendments later by bringing such things as local authority charges and education charges generally within the scope of the Bill &mdash;that the section should remain as the Minister has proposed.  Much as I admire the professional expertise of Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Cooney in advancing their case, as a trade union official, or former trade union official, I recognise a piece of special pleading when I see it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>For the umpteenth time and for Deputy Desmond's edification, I repeat that we do not want exemption from price control.  The solicitors' profession is now controlled as to its prices and this Bill is not going to change that position.  The law society, as the Minister has indicated, has told him that it does not <Col N="1145" /> want that position changed.  It is agreeable to price control and welcomes it and recognises that it must be subject to price control.  All that the society and the profession are objecting to is that the control should be in the hands of the Executive ultimately and not in the hands of the Parliament.  That is the point we are making in relation to this amendment. We are not seeking exemption from the principle of control.  We accept that, but as a matter of constitutional practice, we request that the control ultimately lie with this House or the Seanad.  If that is special pleading, I am guilty.</P>

      <P>It is nothing but an endeavour to elude the price control which I propose in this Bill.  Deputy Cooney says that they are not trying to elude price control because the legal profession are sufficiently controlled at present.  I do not accept this.  There are a number of committees operating.  The Minister for Justice spent some time in the Seanad on 23rd February explaining the reasons why he was not happy about the position.  The Minister said that increases in property values&mdash;he was dealing with solicitors' fees-bringing in substantially increased remuneration since conveyancing costs are regulated on an <i>ad valorem</i> basis.</P>

That is all we ask.  Set up the central costs committee under this Bill, but let it in turn be subject to annulment by the House, or approval or amendment by either House.  That is all we ask.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I gather, not from the Minister's most recent contribution but from his penultimate one, that he concedes and that the Minister for Justice is of the opinion that in certain circumstances a committee or a commission other than the National Prices Commission would be required to deal with certain charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I understood the Minister to be quoting the letter with approval and that he was accepting the assurance of the Minister for Justice to the Incorporated Law Society.  Apparently it is common that in regard to certain charges of a professional or technical nature&mdash;I am speaking now only of solicitors' charges&mdash;the ordinary National Prices Commission would not be adequate to deal with such charges and that it is envisaged that technical committees will be set up by other Departments to deal with charges of this nature.  That is the case I am making, but something on those lines should be written into this legislation for the guidance of future Ministers. If this amendment is not accepted it should be written into this legislation that, where a Minister to whom the Minister for Industry and Commerce may refer a charge for the purpose of advising the Minister for Industry and Commerce on that charge, is of opinion that the matter at issue could be dealt with more properly by a special committee he shall set up such a committee and refer to them the charge for the services or the commodity in question.  That is all I am asking.  I do not think my request is unreasonable because the Minister's colleague admits that to refer this type of question to a committee consisting of two industrialists, two trade unionists and a housewife would not be adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made so capably by Deputy Cooney to the effect that we are not asking here that the solicitors' profession be excluded from price control but are asking that the profession, like the Judiciary, should not be subject to the control of the Executive, can be made validly.  For some reason or other the legal profession is never very popular with the Government. Perhaps this is because the legal profession stands between the Executive and the rights of the ordinary citizen. When we reach the stage that the legal profession, whether it be a single branch or a dual branch profession, loses its independence and becomes a <Col N="1152" /> glorified Civil Service, I would say that democracy in this country will have suffered a very severe blow.  By degrees that day is being reached.  An example of this chipping in on the profession was the handing over to the Civil Service of the workmen's compensation Act.  I would not be surprised if there were some plans to deal in a similar way with personal and motoring accidents.  The stage could be reached where the independence of the legal profession will be fritted away bit by bit.  Then there would be no one to stand between the Executive and the ordinary citizen. That would be a sorry day for the country.</P>
    <P>However, I am asking the Minister if he will accept the committee mentioned in the letter of July 2, if he will put something into the Bill that would guarantee the setting up of such committee and, further, whether he will write into the Bill that when such a committee is set up the legal profession will have the right to invoke that committee.  I am not asking for a committee that would be loaded in favour of the legal profession.  I want to be clear on that.  What I want is a committee with adequate qualifications, adequate knowledge and sufficient experience to assess and deal with charges on a basis that would be fair both to the profession and to the client.  That is not an unreasonable request. By reading the letter, I take it that the Minister is accepting the principle of a special committee.  If he writes that into the Bill, would he think it unreasonable that, having set up a committee that would be acceptable to him, the people affected by it should have the right of access to it?</P>

This would leave control in the hands of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the senior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court and the president of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  This is the group which would fix fees at the request of the Incorporated Law Society <Col N="1154" /> of Ireland.  I want to ensure that increases being sought by the legal profession will be examined by a group of people in a position to look at those proposed increases more critically and more objectively than would be the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the senior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court and the president of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland because I do not accept that the present situation should be maintained.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is not all that confidential.  The Minister has read part of the letter to suit his own case but he will not read the whole letter.  He knows that the Incorporated Law Society's proposal is not a proposal to take itself out of the Bill and retain the <i>status quo.</i> That is not the proposal.  That amendment was put down months ago and since then there have been discussions between the Minister and the society and between the Department of Justice and the society.  The Minister need not try to score neat debating points here.  He knows from experience that amendments are put down as a Parliamentary device to make a case for the amendment of a Bill not necessarily in the detailed terms of the Bill.  Ministers are invariably told:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" />&ldquo;If you do not like that amendment we will withdraw it if you undertake to introduce another amendment in terms acceptable to you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall withdraw this amendment if the Minister tells me that he will amend the Bill in the Seanad or elsewhere so as to provide that solicitors' costs will be measured by a committee of the type in the letter of 2nd June to his Department.  I shall withdraw the amendment if I get an assurance that solicitors' costs will be regulated by a committee of the kind mentioned in the letter of 2nd June from the Incorporated Law Society to his Department and quoted with approval by him and that the solicitors' profession will have access to that committee. That is all I ask and all the society ask.  I shall not sit down or allow this discussion to conclude with the Minister putting me or the Incorporated Law Society on the wrong foot or suggesting that we are asking for something for which we are not asking.  That is what the Minister is trying to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister says his colleague, the Minister for Justice, accepted the specialised committee; would he put that into the Bill?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce did not meet a deputation from the law society but I have no doubt that the substance of the discussion between the society's representatives and the officials of the Minister's Department were put clearly before the Minister, that a section should be written into the Bill giving the profession access to the specialised committee.  This is not an unreasonable request because already in existence we have a type of regulation of solicitors' fees and this has existed in one form or another since 1884. The Minister said that procedure is unsatisfactory.  If so, and if he is inviting an old-established profession to accept another type of regulation there should be dialogue between the Minister and the profession.  There should be discussion between the Department of Justice and the Department of Industry and Commerce on the one hand and the governing body of the solicitors' profession on the other, the Minister representing the general public and the society representing <Col N="1157" /> the profession.  As a result of that discussion a system which would be acceptable to both sides and also fair and just to the public should be worked out.  I do not believe that would be very difficult.  I do not believe the precise problem I am dealing with here is unique and peculiar to the solicitors' profession.  There may be other types of service that can only be fairly judged and assessed by a specialised committee.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, with the assistance he has behind him, to write into the Bill a provision so that when remuneration or charges for service of that type are to be regulated, they shall be regulated by a special committee to be set up by the appropriate Minister and that once it is set up all interested parties shall be entitled to call it into action.</P>
    <P>It is in regard to that request that the Minister appears to be reluctant to move.  He will give me an assurance that a specialised committee will be set up and he refers me to the word of the Minister for Justice for that but he is not prepared to say that that committee shall remain in existence and that it will be open to any person or body concerned to apply to that committee to fix the remuneration of the profession.  That is all that is being asked and it just will not do for the Minister to say that some other sort of a case is being made because it is not.  I am telling the Minister now, without qualification, that I will withdraw amendment No. 1 if the Minister accedes to the two requests in the letter from the Incorporated Law Society to his Department dated 2nd June, 1972.  Can anything be clearer than that?  I will withdraw this amendment and terminate this debate, as far as I am concerned, if the Minister accedes to the two points contained in that letter &mdash; a specialised committee with free access.</P>

      <P>It is, and I daresay the Incorporated Law Society would not thank him for going through with that amendment because that is not what they would be looking for anyway. There is no point in threatening me with that amendment in trying to extract a promise under those two headings.  I have clearly said, and it is more clear from the discussions that were held between the officials of my Department and the Incorporated Law Society than it is here this afternoon, that the Incorporated Law Society do not want to get out from under the umbrella of price control as was stated by Deputy Cooney. They were obviously fearful, and put this to the Minister for Justice, because they felt that the National Prices Commission, which at present advises me in relation to applications for price increases, was not the type of qualified body that they felt was appropriate to investigate their applications.  It appears that the Minister for Justice accepted this and indicated to them that he proposed to set up a central costs committee.  I went further and said that I could not imagine a central costs committee operating without that committee giving access to whatever section of the legal profession would be endeavouring to make a case at a particular time.  I said that it could not be operated properly without that type of arrangement.  Because of that and because of my experience and knowledge of the activities and actions of the National Prices Commission and prices advisory bodies since 1965 I know it is unnecessary to write in a provision in the Bill guaranteeing access from an affected party to the particular advisory body which will be dealing with an application for price increases, service charge increases and so on.  The operation of an advisory committee as such is, and should be to consult with all sides involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A provision for meetings or for direct access to that committee by affected parties is totally unnecessary. I am aware of the fact that amendments can be put in the three weeks or a month before the next stage of a Bill is taken and the amendments may appear to be, in the context of the situation then, out of date, but not <Col N="1159" /> alone would the amendment remove the power of control over the legal profession but would remove the power of control over a wide range of professional services.</P>

That is the type of committee I want.  Does the Minister see anything wrong with that?  The machinery at the moment could be there for years and, unless the Minister thought fit to agree that something should be investigated, it might never investigate anything.

My understanding of the situation is <Col N="1162" /> that the Minister for Justice, to whom this power will be handed over in relation to certain sectors of professional charges, has indicated that he will set up a central cost committee and, if the same format is followed the application will be submitted from the Incorporated Law Society, or whoever it is, to the Minister for Justice and he will refer it to the cost committee for their recommendations.  That will be the pattern.  I can see no reason why that application should not be investigated in the same way as the cost control within my Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> There is no doubt that the Committee Stage procedure in the House is very useful.  It is now clear, as I thought at the start, that under price control as operated by the National Prices Commission, ordinary citizens, or a group of citizens, have not access to the commission to have their complaint or request investigated except through <Col N="1163" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce. That is clear and established. I thought that was the case but the Minister seemed to tell me earlier on that it was not.</P>
      <P>I could suggest an amendment: &ldquo;There shall be established for the purposes of the solicitors' profession a central cost committee and the Minister for Justice shall refer to that committee any question relating to the charges of the profession.&rdquo;  That is all I am asking for and I do not think it is too much.  The Minister for Justice could act as judge and jury.  A request could go to him and he could say: &ldquo;That was fixed two years ago.  That is all right.  We are not going back there any more.&rdquo;  All we want is the right to set in motion the machinery of the National Prices Commission or a specialised sub-committee.</P>
      <P>I am now satisfied that I have pinpointed a shortcoming in the procedure which the Minister wants to impose on the profession.  At present they can refer the question of their charges to a committee, to one of six committees, with which I do not agree. At least they can get a decision from that committee.  They can get a decision for or against their proposal. In the new circumstances that will prevail when this Bill becomes an Act there will be no committee or no independent body to which the legal profession will have access without the consent of the Minister.  That is as clear as day and that is what I object to.  The Minister is scrapping one system of fee control and he is substituting for it a right of veto for himself because, if people do not get to this commission, it cannot make a recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right for the Minister to say that his experience in the past has been that this was invariably done.  I am telling him that the experience of the Incorporated Law Society was that it was difficult, impossible on occasions, under various Ministers for Justice, to get anything done.  There was stalling.  That is what I want to avoid.  It is not the Minister's Department that I am talking about.  I am talking about the Department of Justice <Col N="1164" /> and the experience of the Incorporated Law Society with that Department. Therefore, I want to conclude by at least getting this on the record: as the present system of cost control, which has lasted for nearly 100 years, is being abolished, I want the Minister to set up in lieu thereof a central cost committee on which the professions, the public and specialists like accountants will be represented and that the Incorporated Law Society, as the body representing the solicitors' profession, would have the right to call on that central cost committee to investigate any particular field of charges and to advise the Minister on it and that if the Minister were to reject that advice he would have to do it in public and in this House.  That is what I am asking and I do not think it is unreasonable.</P>

      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), after line 14, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) activities carried on by railway undertakings and road transport undertakings, and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from a recommendation which was made to me by the National Prices Commission. Originally they considered that power might be taken under this Bill to have included all the activities covered under section 5 (a) of the 1958 <Col N="1165" /> Act, which were included under that Act, Following discussions, I considered that it was inappropriate that the activities of the various Departments of State, local organisations, vocational educational committees, harbour authorities should come within the scope of the Prices Act as that could lead to unacceptable confusion as to the functions and responsibilities of various Ministers.  I was prepared to agree that the activities of railway undertakings and road transport undertakings should be included. There is also the question of air transport undertakings and water transport undertakings but, following considerable consideration, I came to the conclusion that, as we have no internal water transport service and as cross-channel shipping is at present the subject of ruthless competition, there was no great advantage to be gained by taking power under this Bill to control water transport.  The same argument applied in relation to air transport.  On the overall, then, I decided that I should move this amendment to include the control of activities carried on by railway undertakings and road transport undertakings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I want to say about this is that I want an absolute definition of the inclusions proposed by the Minister.  The Minister mentions &ldquo;activities carried on by railway undertakings and road transport undertakings&rdquo;.  I want to know the exact definition of the word &ldquo;activities&rdquo;. As far as road transport undertakings are concerned, does it include not only the activities of CIE, private operators providing bus services or mini-bus services and transport for persons in any other way but also the movement of goods and, in relation to railways, are goods included as well as persons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister used the expression <Col N="1166" />&ldquo;after discussion&rdquo;.  He decided, after discussion, that it would not be wise to have harbour charges, vocational educational committee charges, local authority charges, water transport charges, and so on, included.  In regard to water transport, he used the argument that we have not got, as they have on the Rhine and on the canals in Holland, a vast amount of water transport, mainly of goods.  There is a water transport service across the Irish Sea which, with the exception of the intervention of Dutch and other coasters, is a monopoly or a cartel of two or three groups.  I should like to know in relation to this situation what discussions the Minister had and with whom and the reasons why he changed his mind and excluded these activities from the operation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The other thing mentioned is air transport.  Everybody who uses planes knows that there are certain flights on which usually very good business is done and charges made on those flights are very heavy charges.  Those planes make very good profits.  In other instances there are services which have to be provided as long as we wish to remain a civilised nation.  They provide the sort of services it is necessary to provide and must run at a loss.  Any sane person would accept that as proper procedure for any State company to indulge in but there is the question of charges made for holiday trips to Spain and other places.</P>

While I accept your ruling and the fact that I must not discuss what is not in the amendment, if the Minister indicates to me matters he is going to exclude after discussion, I should like to know with whom he had discussions and also if he had thought of the various reasons why he should not exclude them.  I could introduce an amendment on Report Stage to cover what I have in mind but on this Stage I would like to say that the <Col N="1167" /> Minister should explain in greater detail why air transport and water transport are excluded.  I should like to know with whom he had discussions.</P>

      <P>As far as the discussions are concerned, they were with my colleagues, mainly the Minister for Transport and Power.  I have indicated that the items which are excluded were already excluded under the 1958 Act. Section 5 of that Act states:</P>
      <P>This Act does not apply to any of the following:</P>
      <P>(a) activities carried on by or on behalf of a Minister of State, a local authority, within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1941 (No. 23 of 1941), a vocational education committee, a railway, road, air or water transport undertaking or a harbour authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be departmental. To get back to the ones the Deputy particularly mentioned, the air and water rates, they would arise specically in discussions with the Minister for Transport and Power.  The international air fares and rates which are of a highly complex and technical nature are settled internationally between the airlines through the rate fixing machinery of the International Air Transport Association, about which we hear so much.  IATA agreements on air fares and rates are subject to Government approval but if IATA fail to reach agreement it would be a matter for the Governments concerned to negotiate one.  This procedure is embodied in many of our air transport bilateral agreements with other States which also provide that in the event of deadlock at government level the matter should be referred to international arbitration.  Domestic air fares must be dealt with within the context of international affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy spoke about sea transport between this country and the UK <Col N="1168" /> particularly.  I have often heard it said that the dearest bit of sea in the world to cross is the Irish Sea.  I gave consideration to the possibility of endeavouring to include water transport from that point of view but it is rather difficult. No matter what the Deputy may say about a cartel or a monopoly the fact remains that it is almost impossible to endeavour to control a price charge between one country and another where we have not overall control over it.  We could have a situation where we endeavour to control the price from Dublin to Liverpool, but we have no control over the price between Liverpool and Dublin for rather obvious reasons.  I am reluctant to take into this Bill some power which I find it impossible to implement.  That was my particular reason for not endeavouring to embrace water transport control and air control in this Bill.  The Deputy asks for a wider definition of railway and roads.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying here to be quite specific and to ensure that we are embracing all the charges.  I know that the phraseology &ldquo;charges for services rendered in connection with insurance&rdquo; might, in fact, be taken to refer to all that I want it to refer to but I feel that a better phraseology and a more definite instruction and direction in relation to this Bill would be if &ldquo;brokers, agents and direct charges paid as premiums were specified&rdquo;.  That is the reason for my amendment.  It is really an amendment of clarification of definition.  I believe it is necessary that this amendment <Col N="1169" /> should be inserted because you might get a situation where insurance companies could be asked to provide certain payments at the end of the period when the premiums are all paid and to give certain minimum profits. There might, at the same time, be other things and it would be far better to have the assurance that I now provide in this amendment inasmuch as it specifies those three items which it seems to me are the three things which are of importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy is endeavouring to get at here. I might be able to help him if I point out that specifically excluded in section 5 (h) of the 1958 Act are:</P>
      <P>charges for services rendered in connection with banking or insurance.</P>
      <P>That was the exclusion and that meant that everything was covered under the Bill except the items mentioned in that section.  The Minister had the power to control everything else except charges for services rendered in connection with insurance.  This takes out that exclusion which therefore makes it completely embracing in so far as everything to do with insurance, by reason of the statement &ldquo;charges for services rendered in connection with insurance&rdquo; is, in fact, more comprehensive because it withdraws the exclusion of the 1958 Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan, in his amendment, tried to consolidate the position, as I see it from his point of view.  He spells out &ldquo;charges in relation to brokers, agents and direct charges paid as premiums to insurance companies&rdquo;.  If I were to accept that amendment it could lead to great difficulty.  You could find some new type of person coming up calling himself a collector.  He might be able to get some new name for himself and he would be excluded by reason of the fact that it is spelt out in the Bill:</P>
      <P>charges for services rendered in connection with insurance in relation to...</P>
      <P>A person might be able to escape in relation to something else which is not specified because of the basic comprehensiveness of section 2 (1) (d).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), after line 26 to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) activities carried on by or on behalf of a Minister for State, a local authority, within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1941 (No. 23 of 1941), a vocational education committee or a harbour authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is our submission that the activities of the bodies mentioned in the amendment involve a major element of cost and that it is, therefore, entirely appropriate that the charges levied by a local authority, the vocational education committee or harbour authority should come under the Act and, where necessary, be subject to investigation by the National Prices Commission.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party feel that what is sauce for the private goose in this legislation is also sauce for the public gander.  We do not regard price control as being appropriate only to the private sector.  We think it should also extend to the charges of State sponsored bodies, to Government Departments and to local authorities, and that the proposed increases should be submitted not only to the appropriate Department but also to the National Prices Commission.  I know the National Prices Commission have taken certain initiatives in that area, but we believe that this amendment proposed by us should not be disregarded by the Minister.  We suggest these charges should be the subject of the closest scrutiny even where they may require ministerial or Departmental sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bodies I have mentioned are not exposed to the full rigour of commercial competition and restraints. They do not have to face the consequences of bankruptcy or commercial failure, and very frequently they are in a monopoly situation.  Therefore, it <Col N="1171" /> is entirely appropriate that they should be brought within the scope of the Act, thus ensuring proper financial accountability within such undertakings in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and the House generally must appreciate the type of job this Labour Party amendment would be endeavouring to hand over to the National Prices Commission. One of the activities of a local authority is to strike an increased rate annually.  Such increases have a rather serious effect on the public pocket, and in March of each year the National Prices Commission would be asked to examine the question of the justification for the increase in the rate of 40p, 50p, or 60p in the £ for every local authority in the country. This comes within the control of the Minister for Local Government, and the Government itself has its own responsibility and endeavours to tackle that problem in its own way.</P>
      <P>The Deputy says that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. I have already moved an amendment here involving the taking over of control of road and rail transport. This will mean looking more closely at applications from CIE for increased charges for both freight and passenger services.  There is a greater awareness at the level of the Department of Industry and Commerce of the overall effect of general increases, and one of the things we have had too much of in various sectors down through the years is the duplication of services.  I have taken railway and road out of the old section 5 (a) and have decided to maintain the other exclusions that were first introduced in 1958.  The amendment to which Deputy Desmond has subscribed seeks to include the rest of the items that were excluded with the exception of air and water transport undertakings. He asked that I should embrace it in this legislation.  It does not make sense to me and I cannot see my way to accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When dealing with the first amendment, I pointed out that individual Ministers such as the Ministers for <Col N="1172" /> Local Government, Education and Transport and Power can exercise controls under existing legislation. For instance, controls in relation to rates, which are the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government, cannot be as successful as one might wish because rates are controlled by the demands made.  I do not know which aspect of vocational education the Deputy has in mind, perhaps it is charges for term classes, but the Minister for Education has sufficient power to cover that situation.  The Minister for Transport and Power has comprehensive powers in relation to harbour authorities who have to apply for his sanction for any increase in charges.  Any Minister who wishes at any stage to do so could make use of the advice of the NPC who on more than one occasion in the past have expressed themselves as more than willing to carry out investigations at the request of any Department.  The activities which the Deputy by his amendment is asking me to include in the Bill are too broad and my straightforward reply is that there is power in existing legislation to deal with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's difficulty in that this would involve a division of responsibility as between individual Ministers, but let us take the example of a local authority fixing rents on a new scheme of houses.  They are subject to the sanction of the Minister for Local Government and it might well be that on examining the financial situation in relation to a scheme of houses the Minister might be unfair in fixing a high scale of differential rents.  To my mind a Minister should be subject to the same control as a private operator in such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Ministers for Local Government and Finance are more involved in these matters than the Minister now in the House.  It is true that decisions on prices are made with the sanction of the Minister for Local Government.  In Drogheda the income from lease rents is in the order of £10,000 a year.  Rents are subject to the sanction of the Minister for Local <Col N="1173" /> Government but along the line there is the probability of an injustice being done to individual citizens.  I think Deputy Desmond is correct.  We should not forget that local authorities and other such bodies exact prices and if we are to be true to the principle of this Act, then we should bring all prices into its ambit.  The Bill starts out in section 2 to deal with services and commodities to be brought under regulations and subject to the Act.  I take the view that all matters affecting prices should be subject to the Act, although I appreciate the difficulties from the point of view of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the terms of reference of the NPC before me but I would be satisfied if the Minister would assure me there is nothing to debar any Minister from seeking advice from the NPC by way of an ocasional report or of consultant work done on harbours throughout the country or in relation to vocational education fields or in other specific areas of local authority charges.  These tend to become the internal preserves of the Departments concerned with them and these areas of public administration into which major cost elements enter should be subject to scrutiny by the prices body if the ordinary consumer, the man in the street, is to be dealt with fairly.  I do not suggest that the NPC should do an analysis every year of proposed rate increases by local authorities but I suggest that certain areas of local authority administration should be subject to NPC scrutiny at the request of an individual Minister.  If I could have that understanding from the Minister, I think we would be moving in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I have said there is nothing to stop any Department from seeking the advice of the NPC in relation to any aspect they would want covered.  I would point out to Deputy Donegan that even if this amendment were accepted rents would not come under the heading of a commodity or a service or work done for profit.  While not specifically excluded, rent is not included.  I have not power under this legislation to investigate rent increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being critical of the Minister but I submit that this legislation should be all embracing. It has been said &ldquo;not on bread alone doth man live&rdquo;.  Therefore, if we are to investigate prices we should do so in relation to the necessaries of life, one of which is where a person lays his head at night.  I do not wish to proceed by way of telling stories but I give this as an instance. I know a house in which a friend of mine lived 20 years ago.  It has one bathroom and five rooms over a shop. Four families, one to a room, live in it.  The lowest rent is £4.50 a week, the highest £6.50.  The gross income from that floor above a shop is £1,150. The rates on that floor would be £100, netting £1,000 from one floor of an ordinary house.  They are all sharing the same bathroom and other toilet facilities.  One has a husband in a psychiatric home and two have unemployed husbands.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister consider on Report Stage deciding to investigate rents?  If he did so, he would get the full support of this party and I am sure that Deputy Desmond will say that he would get the full support of the Labour Party.  This would be a completely non-political matter and I am referring in particular to the furnished room and flat because apparently this is the area of least right for the tenant.  I find myself at fault that I did not put down an amendment to include rents, as spokesman for my party on this legislation, but I rise now in no spirit of criticism of the Minister or the Government, but merely to say that justice would be done if on the Report Stage or in the Seanad, the Minister took the opportunity to decide to investigate rents and particularly the rents of furnished flats.  These people not only must eat and buy shoes and clothes for their children but must also provide something for themselves and their children to lie on at night and to live in by day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now uncovered something which is quite fundamental to this prices legislation.  My belief is that absolutely everything should be included in this legislation&mdash;I do not <Col N="1175" /> know what one does with diamonds but we can leave them out.  The ordinary necessaries of life and all the things used in life, even to the extent of beer and such commodities, should be investigated under this legislation and should be bound by it, if anything is to be bound.  That perhaps might be arguing against my two colleagues but we can leave that aside.  The Minister is not going to score that point off me but if you sincerely believe that it is the right way to do it, that item of rents must be included.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that there are two other Departments involved here and that we are in a most difficult legislative position.  There is the Department of Justice in relation to the various Landlord and Tenant Acts, 1931 and 1958, the Ground Rents Act of 1967 and all the others.  They are involved on the basis of tenants' rights and landlords' rights.  The Department of Local Government are also involved and I can see a difficulty as between these various Ministers.  I accept the Government's difficulty in this regard but there is the fundamental point which must be driven home, that not on bread alone doth man live but that one of the fundamental things is a roof over his head.  I give you what I was told in my &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; last night when I was shown a rent book with a list of tenants' rights on the inside page which I am having copied to show to a legal man.  I have been looking at statutes for 18 years and I have no right to say I know anything about them, but my view is that it was all of no consequence and gave no rights of any kind to the tenant. When we are putting a Prices Bill through the Dáil, the Government&mdash; and I am certain they will have both the Labour Party and Fine Gael behind them&mdash;should decide to fix rents and allow a tenant if he wishes to apply to an agency and have his housing circumstances examined and the rent fixed.  It would, I admit, be a massive job but well worth the trouble.  Can we have a situation in which in a shop downstairs you fix the price of a tin of soap powder, a loaf or an apple for a kiddie, while <Col N="1176" /> upstairs you have a house providing a net income of £1,000 a year from a furnished flat, the tenant having no rights but the right to a reasonable time to get out of it?  We have reached the stage now at which on Report Stage or in the Seanad the Minister must consider including rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donegan makes a very logical argument about rents and points to the difficulty existing as between the jurisdictions of three different Departments.  He says that it would be nice if we could have a Prices (Amendment) Bill which would be comprehensive and cover a wide field.  This matter will be coming up on the proposed withdrawal of section 3, but there is the need to get ahead with my prices control legislation and the difficulty of hammering out a satisfactory section to cover comprehensively new house prices.  I know that the Minister for Justice has for quite some time been actively engaged in looking at the particular problems to which the Deputy referred in relation to the rents of furnished flats and the inadequacy of the protection for the tenant of such a flat.  The situation being as it is, it would be wrong for me, in my effort to get this legislation through, to convey the impression at this stage that I would be in a position to introduce an amendment on Report Stage covering every field the Deputy has covered. In fact, I look upon that as demanding quite positively a separate piece of legislation because it is a field in which there are problems.  The Deputy has expressed a view which will be shared generally in the House that on the broad details, a Minister introducing legislation covering this type of thing would get the full support of the House, but one gets down then to the nitty-gritty things and there are a great many of them in legislation which endeavours to cover these fields, the renting of furnished flats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have rambled a bit because in talking about this amendment, I think I have conveyed my view that the field is very wide.  Deputy Donegan spoke from the point of view that these matters <Col N="1177" /> were pretty adequately covered by existing legislation and the powers of other Ministers and it was from there that he went ahead into the field which he covered.  I can only reiterate what I said already, that I am satisfied that the powers at present vested in the respective Ministers for Local Government, Education and Transport and Power in relation to the matters dealt with in the amendment are sufficient and this was the reason why I have not included these items in the Bill and why I am opposing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party's amendment is a very good one in certain aspects&mdash;perhaps it is difficult to agree to it in its entirety&mdash;because the Minister.  Deputy Desmond and I all know that the main task of the Minister for Local Government is to get more capital moneys to build more houses&mdash;and one way is to exact more money from the tenants, lease rent-holders and various other people in the community.  If a price is a price, a rent is a price and a lease rent is also a price.  If the Minister and his Department in their desire to build more houses are being unjust to a single citizen, or to 10,000 citizens, that injustice is caused by a price.  There should be some method under the price-fixing legislation whereby rent is taken into account.  I am trying to be helpful, not difficult or destructive. Many times I have seen this in the course of my work on local authorities. I have seen decisions from the Department of Local Government, or refusals which I believed to be unfair. I knew that the Department wanted more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can think of other instances where, in my view, a citizen has got away with &ldquo;financial murder&rdquo;.  There should be somewhere one can go if one is concerned about rents.  If a rent is too high, the unfortunate ladies to whom I was speaking last night cannot buy food for their children.  The amount of the rent is as fundamental as the price of the food.  I know that the Minister has difficulty with this legislation.  The Minister for Justice and the Minister for Local Government have been looking at this matter for the 18 years I <Col N="1178" /> have been in the House.  Perhaps we should give them further help to reach a decision.  The Minister might look at this between now and the Report Stage to see if he can include rents on houses in this legislation.  The Minister said he would not agree to this just for the purpose of getting this Bill through. He will not be impeded in this Bill by me.  The Minister knows my form: I make statements, but I do not hold up legislation if that legislation is necessary for the people.  The Minister might undertake to have a look at this between now and the next Stage, without feeling he is pressurising anybody.</P>

      <P>May I say that the specific reason for my wishing to delete the section&mdash;I hinted at it a moment ago when dealing with a point raised by Deputy Donegan&mdash;is because of the impossibility of incorporating a sufficiently comprehensive control over the price of new houses in a measure like this.  The Minister for Local Government and I had discussions about this and we found that the task would be exceedingly difficult and very time-consuming.  The position now is that the Minister for Local Government will formulate whatever arrangements are necessary to enable an effective system of control to be prepared.  The Government Information Bureau issued a statement last week indicating that, since he was primarily concerned with housing, it was preferable that he should be responsible for the control of house prices.  As an interim measure, therefore, he proposes to refuse to allocate grants, or to reduce or withhold grants in cases in which prices do not appear to him to represent reasonable value.  That is why I am now asking the House to delete section 3 of this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection 1, line 16, after &ldquo;commodity&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and land, which is purchased for the erection of a new house or houses thereon, shall be deemed, for the purposes of the Acts, to be a commodity&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone knows that, because of the scarcity of serviced building land, vast fortunes have been made in the provision of sites on serviced land or on land that can be easily serviced.  These fortunes have been made by people <Col N="1181" /> who had the money to finance such projects and who then overcharged for the sites.  In the cost of a house it is true that an extra £500 may not appear to be a very large sum but, when one takes the number of sites packed on to a few acres, there is a tremendous profit earned by speculators operating at the expense of unfortunate young people who need houses.  I shall deal later with the Minister's desire to delete this particular section.</P>
    <P>I believe that one of the fundamental elements in a house is the land on which it is built.  The Minister has deemed a house to be a commodity. Why not the land on which it stands? The argument seems to be that this might mean that less land would come on the market.  With proper planning I maintain that there should be no difficulty in controlling building land. We are all aware of the developed lands which local authorities, under the Planning and Development Act, 1963, had to produce before October, 1968; these lands have been produced in every town and village and in the rural areas.  There are places where it is possible to provide services, places where communities can be established or existing communities can be expanded. Anyone can buy these development plans and proceed to buy from unsuspecting people what they believe is agricultural land but what eventually turns out to be literally a building goldmine.  If this Bill is to mean anything at all one of the commodities that must be included in it is houses and, included in houses, there should be building land, the lands on which the houses stand.</P>
    <P>With regard to the argument that acceptance of my amendment and that of Deputy Desmond might lead to a withdrawal of building land from sale, there are other enactments to look after that.  There are compulsory powers of acquisition.  These can be streamlined, if the Government are so inclined.  Site prices have risen to astronomical figures.  They must be controlled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are pressing very strongly to have inserted in the Bill an amendment which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> (b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £500 (together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a fine not exceeding £50 for every day on which the offence is continued) or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need for the inclusion of this subsection.  Building land must be brought within the scope of this measure.  There has been a sharp upsurge in prices over the past decade.  It is not to the credit of the Government that they have failed to include this element of price inflation in this Bill. Three years ago the NIEC recommended that an urgent study should be made in order to assemble all the facts about the increase in site value and to establish precisely the extent of the increases that have occurred. Nothing was done.  Retail price levels have gone up by about three-fourths in the past decade.  The cost of new building has doubled in the same period.  The cost of land has gone up eightfold.  The situation at the moment is chaotic.  There is an inflationary price spiral.  The increases are very, very substantial.</P>
    <P>We believe that there is a need for the Department of Industry and Commerce and the National Prices Commission to have a direct statutory function in this essential social need. For that reason we intend pressing the amendment and we support fully the Fine Gael amendment.  No doubt in replying to the two amendments the Minister will assure us that the National Prices Commission are keeping a watching brief on the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is poor consolation to be told that in view of what has happened during the past five years and there are now further increases in the price of land.  It is imperative from an economic point of view and from the point of view of providing houses for those who need them urgently that this provision be made.  In relation to land for new houses there has been direct exploitation of the community during the past <Col N="1183" /> 12 years.  The price of building land has been increased eightfold in that period.  A small number of speculators to whom one might refer as the new Irish industrial land rich have made enormous personal gains out of the social requirements of the community. The only way to stop that exploitation is to include the price of new house building land and the houses erected thereon within the scope of the Bill. We have drawn attention to another aspect by broadening further the scope of our amendment as distinct from the amendment put down by Deputy Donegan.  We have included in our amendment that land which is scheduled by a planning authority or which is zoned within a planning scheme for residential purposes shall be deemed to be a commodity.  This would have the effect of preventing the more shady speculative operations that have gone on by people cashing in on the urgent need for houses.  The Minister should talk to the Dublin city and county manager in this respect and he should read the statement made by Mr. Macken in January, 1971, when he said that the greatest problem facing Dublin Corporation was that, when they sought to buy land or to zone land, the agents moved in and attempted to sell it back to the corporation at grossly inflated prices, thereby making a substantial profit for themselves.  Mr. Macken regarded that position as being intolerable and he is not a man noted in any way for extreme statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>He is one of our most level-headed and esteemed public servants.  The Government have failed to come to grips with the problem. The Minister will probably react to the amendments by assuring us that even if he were to consider bringing land for building within the scope of the commission it would be deemed to be unconstitutional that the State should attempt to fix the price of building land.  Our reply to that is very simple.  We would refer the Minister to other articles of the Constitution which <Col N="1184" /> state that the State may, as occasion requires, delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.  If we wish to apply the concept of the common good as we understand it from the Catholic Sociology that we learned in our younger days, here is the obvious way of doing so.  The overriding interest of the common good demands that this commodity should be brought within the ambit of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not accept any legalistic argument from the Minister that it is not possible to do this without violating the Constitution.  It can be done and I have no doubt that the Supreme Court which is the most progressive Supreme Court that we have for decades would rule that the Minister would have every right to do this.  Also, bringing in this commodity the Minister would be acclaimed by every couple in the country who are in need of housing and who, at the moment, would have to pay up to £1,800 for a site on which to build a house although that same land was probably purchased ten years ago for about £300.  The owners of such land can obtain very easily a tax free capital gain and it is usual to build eight houses to the acre.</P>
      <P>We implore the Minister to take his courage in his hands in relation to this amendment and to assure the Department of Local Government that for long enough they have failed to tackle the problem.  I share Deputy Donegan's concern in relation to the national scandal that exists.  In the constituency that I represent I find it both frustrating and humiliating to have to meet young couples each week who are paying up to £8 per week for one or two rooms and tell them that they have no hope of being housed.  If they could aspire to purchasing their own homes in that area, the cost would be between £6,000 and £10,000 per house.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I shall not disappoint Deputy Desmond in that I will not use any of the arguments that he left open for me to use.  In relation to the question fixing the price for building land, the Minister for Local Government set up a committee in January, 1971, <Col N="1185" /> under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kenny to consider, in the interest of the common good, possible measures for controlling the price of land required for housing and for other forms of development.  At this stage it would be both inappropriate and inadvisable for me to introduce any measures relating to the control of building land prices as the committee have not yet made their recommendations.  It is my opinion that to endeavour to incorporate in legislation something that is anticipated by way of recommendation is almost always found to be unsatisfactory <Col N="1186" /> in that the recommendations made are probably far more all-embracing than I could possibly have proposed for legislation here.  So that with a committee so well headed-up, if you like, the Minister for Local Government is expecting some solid proposals in this regard and because of that it would be inopportune just at this time to introduce the type of amendment of this Bill that is recommended here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained the reasons for wanting the deletion of this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the deletion of section 3, this Bill was to apply to the price of houses.  For the purposes of the Bill a house was to be deemed to be a commodity just as a grocery item or a suit of clothes is deemed to be a commodity.  The price of houses was to be investigated and to be controlled. The housing industry is one of the largest and most fundamental industries in the country and one of the most important because, if people cannot get a house at the right price, the economy is in trouble.  It has a relationship to wage demands and to the frustrations of young married couples looking for somewhere to live.</P>
      <P>The Minister has now conferred with the Minister for Local Government and decided to delete this section from the Bill.  Deputy Desmond and I put down two rather similar amendments&mdash;his was rather broader than mine&mdash;including the price of the land with the price of the house as a commodity. The House decided to discuss them before the Minister moved the deletion of the section and there is nothing we can do about it.  What has happened?  It is nice to know that Ministers of State are now speaking to one another, which they were not doing not so very long ago.  The Minister tells us that he has conferred with the Minister for Local Government and that the Minister for Local Government is looking into the matter and setting up a committee, and that there will be a comprehensive approach to the question of the price of houses.  In the meantime, he may withdraw a grant from somebody whose house is deemed to be too expensive.  That is a very milk and water approach.</P>
      <P>What was the thinking not so very long ago?  One of the good things the Minister has done&mdash;and I have always given him credit for anything he did which I felt was right&mdash;was setting up the National Prices Commission. That body are providing speedy recommendations.  We are not now dealing with prices a year or two years too late.  We are dealing with them within a reasonable period of time. The Minister quoted the report of the National Prices Commission for June. The heading is: &ldquo;New House Prices&rdquo;.  At paragraph 26 on page 22 they said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> In anticipation of the enactment of the Prices (Amendment) Bill, 1971, we&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is, the National Prices Commission&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;asked an Foras Forbartha to undertake a study to assist us in preparatory work in relation to the control and surveillance of the prices of new houses.  The terms of reference for this study were:</P>
    <P>(a)  to examine the behaviour of the prices for similar houses erected by the same builder in the same area over the last three or four years;</P>
    <P>(b)  to examine the changes in land, labour and materials costs over the same period;</P>
    <P>(c)  to suggest ways in which the prices of new houses might be controlled under the Prices (Amendment) Bill, 1971, as introduced.</P>
    <P>The study was made by Mr. L. F. Shanley, Senior Research Officer, and Mr. T. Boland.  We received the final draft of their report on 16th June, 1972.  The report is now being printed and will be published as Occasional Paper No. 2 within the next few weeks.  Interested parties are invited to submit their comments and observations not later than 30th September, 1972.  After we have had the opportunity of studying submissions, we will draw conclusions and make recommendations; we would hope to publish these not later than our November, 1972, monthly report.</P>
    <P>Up to June 16th, 1972, the National Prices Commission were being entirely duped by the Fianna Fáil Party into believing that the Government were capable of introducing price controls that would affect some of the entrepreneurs, to use the kindest word, who lurk among their ranks and who make vast fortunes out of the misfortunes of the less well off sections of our community.</P>
    <P>At the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis in Cork I said that when it came to the fixing of prices which would make the boot <Col N="1190" /> pinch in the case of the people behind the Fianna Fáil Party, the people who give the huge subscriptions and have the power, that would be the day when the Fianna Fáil Government would not enact price control legislation. Everybody knows that large builders are among the large subscribers to and controllers of the Government now in office.  That is the public scandal we are facing in this city in particular and there is nobody in this city who does not know it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an outrageous statement for the Deputy to make.  It is scandalous that a Deputy should come in here and make a statement of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I come in here and make a statement of that kind because I am aware that most of Deputy Timmons' constituents would make the same statement or, if they were here to hear me, they would applaud me for making it if they were allowed.  Everybody in the streets knows it is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>While there may be a facade of price control and profit control in this legislation, it is true that the powers behind the Fianna Fáil Party are the large builders who have been building a large number of small houses or relatively cheaper type houses, for young married couples.  Now the entire section that deals with houses is being withdrawn from the Bill.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Local Government had been doing his job over the past few years, if he had been observing the prices of houses as they skyrocketed, if he had listened to the pleas of the people who had to pay those prices, he would have taken the action long ago which it is now suggested he is going to take.  When the National Prices Commission&mdash;that excellent institution; I give the Minister that&mdash;created a situation in which the boot was pinching in the case of the powers behind the throne, legislation controlling the price of houses went out the window.  I said that in Cork. I said it outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> We will oppose the motion by the Minister to delete this section.  We say as vehemently as we can that the Minister's action is completely against the spirit of price control.  If the Minister for Local Government is to set up a committee to deal with this matter more properly, when this Bill was printed only a few short months ago why was it thought proper by the Cabinet to include houses?  Why should the Minister for Industry and Commerce have to eat humble pie and say: &ldquo;After conferring with the Minister for Local Government and other Ministers, I have decided to delete completely from this Bill any control of houses?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the same spirit the Minister said about an hour ago that he could not do anything about rents.  Rents and repayments on houses have a direct effect on the amount of food and clothes a man can buy for his children when he is living on limited income.  If there is no price control on houses, there is no prices legislation.  The faceless men, who provide even the £100,000 which is locked up until somebody signs for it, have succeeded in taking Fianna Fáil by the scruff of the neck and getting their own way.  Thank God a time is coming when that will not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I understand that we are discussing the deletion of section 3, thereby removing house building from price control. Earlier we sought to include the site of the house in the price control legislation. If there is one thing more than another causing widespread concern in the country at the present time it is the cost of houses and of sites for houses.  The Minister must be aware of this because in the sphere of public authority houses we all have the experience from time to time of tenders being sent up and being considered excessive by the Minister for Local Government and being sent back to the local authority with instructions to readvertise. I suppose the Minister for Local Government has some control over that type of house building.  The result of this, of course, is that local authority schemes are delayed unduly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> There is another type of house-building, the private sector type of house building.  I want to say here what I have said on many occasions outside this House, that I have the greatest admiration for young married couples who build their own houses. I would hate to imagine what the housing position would be today were it not for the sacrifices which these young people undergo in order to provide themselves with proper houses when they are getting married.  Indeed, I do not know whether the tribute should be paid to the young wife or to the husband.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage where people are not prepared, if they can avoid it at all, to accept makeshift accommodation or to rent flats.  That is very wise of them because if in the early days of marriage people tolerate makeshift accommodation, in many cases they are left in this unsuitable accommodation for years.</P>
    <P>When I say that I salute and admire those in the private sector who build houses for themselves, I am fully conscious of the fact that a great number of them are shouldering burdens in excess of what they might reasonably be expected to bear in defraying the cost of these houses.  There are widespread complaints about excessive charges for houses and for sites for houses.  One would have thought that this was a sphere in which the Government would do something positive about controlling prices.</P>
    <P>When this measure was introduced and ordered to be printed on 15th July, 1971, it was thought proper to write in section 3 to control the price of houses. It is an extraordinary thing that when the Bill is about to pass through the Oireachtas there should be a change in thinking as to the method of house price control.  Instead of subjecting house-building to the ordinary machinery of price control, there is this extraordinary proposition by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to delete section 3.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that I spoke to an amendment earlier this afternoon designed to exclude certain services from the ambit of the Bill but in doing so I made it <Col N="1193" /> clear that these services were already controlled and I offered to the Minister another and more rigid, if he liked, method of controlling those services. Here we have a proposal by the Minister simply to delete section 3 and to put nothing in its place.</P>
    <P>We have had what I consider to be a vague statement by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government, over the past few days, in relation to housebuilding, that he proposes to withhold grants in certain cases where he considers that the houses built are not value for money. That is a fair summary of what the Minister proposed.  He gave some vague promise about establishing an inquiry into the price of houses.  I believe that this is, in fact, a gimmick on the part of the Government to delay any real or effective control of house-building.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Government were lobbied, and lobbied very severely, on this issue because we know that a great number of Government supporters and Government financiers are engaged in housebuilding in the city of Dublin and elsewhere.  I believe that the Government are not serious about this proposal by the Minister for Local Government.  I doubt if the proposal to withhold grants is capable of being enforced.  Who will decide in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner in each case whether a house is value for money?  How can you control housebuilding unless you control land prices?  What will the Government do about that?</P>
    <P>This Bill is being sought and probably will be passed before the Dáil goes into recess.  If section 3 were not deleted the Minister would have power under the Bill to control house prices and if he accepted a Fine Gael amendment he would have power to control land prices.  The Bill is being sought without section 3 and in lieu of section 3 we are being given this vague scheme of the Minister for Local Government. When will it come into operation? When will standard prices be fixed?  There are different prices in different parts of the country.  Under the threat of the grants being withheld, will there be a refusal on the part of builders to accept orders for houses unless larger deposits are paid?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> That could be one result of the threat by the Minister for Local Government to withhold housing grants because, as we all know, part of the <i>modus operandi</i> for paying for houses was that the grants and loans were handed over to the builder.  If the builder now finds himself in the position that he may not be able to collect the grants because the Minister for Local Government believes that the house is not value for money he will increase the deposit.  If he does that the result will be that it will be more difficult for people who are in need of houses, and who are prepared to provide them for themselves, to get them.</P>
    <P>Some building contractors would have been brought to their senses if this section was allowed form part of the Bill.  They would have said that they had better play the game and give value for money or they would find themselves subject to the national yardstick which will stabilise prices. The proposal of the Minister for Local Government is very vague.  One of the reasons why the cost of houses has gone up in urban areas is the difficulty in obtaining sites.  We have the Planning Act of 1963 which is enforced very rigidly by the Minister for Local Government.  In some places it is very difficult to get planning permission. You are told you cannot build a house on a national arterial road, if the building constitutes a ribbon development or an urban sprawl, or you cannot build a house if three or four houses are built without public sewerage and have to depend on septic tanks.</P>
    <P>The result of all this is that the local authority planning section are very efficient and operate the Planning Act to the fullest extent.  It does not cost anything to do that and it does not cost anything to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It does not cost anything to say that you cannot build here or you cannot build there. Those urban authorities are falling down in their duty to provide serviced sites.  It costs money to provide serviced sites and if it is in the national interest rigidly to enforce the 1963 Planning Act then the Exchequer should come to the assistance of <Col N="1195" /> people who want serviced sites and there should be substantial grants given in urban areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> No, not on housing in general but on house prices.  If the Planning Act, 1963, is to be rigidly enforced the Exchequer should come along and provide serviced sites in urban areas and in other parts of the country where they are needed.  They are not doing that and as a result it is more difficult to get sites and they are more expensive.  The Government have fallen down completely in their duty to assist in providing houses at reasonable prices for people who want them.  One way in which they have fallen down completely is by not providing proper serviced sites.  There are Deputies from all parts of the country who could point to urban areas in which no sites for the private sector have been serviced by the urban authorities within the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>It would be much better to leave this section in the Bill, even if it took a little time to get teeth to operate it, than to remove it and then promise the vague type of machinery which the Minister for Local Government has promised.  It will be a hit and miss sort of scheme for some time to come. There will be allegations that one man got his grant, that another did not, that one builder was given his grant because he had plenty of influence with the Government and that another builder did not get his grant.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I understand that the case made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for deleting section 3 is that the Minister for Local Government is providing an alternative and a more effective type of price control.  I am trying to point out that the make-believe sham type of <Col N="1196" /> price control promised by the Minister for Local Government will not work. It will hit the man who wants to get the house built rather than the builder and it will make it impossible for people with modest deposits to get houses built.  Deposits for modest type houses will be increased to protect the builder from the danger of the State and local government grants being withheld.  I would like to hear a lot more about the scheme which the Minister for Local Government has in mind before I could agree to deleting housing from the Prices Bill.</P>
      <P>Housing is one of the basic requisites of life and this is something that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is washing his hands of in a Bill which is supposed to control all commodities and all services.  It is a disgrace and I would like to know the reason behind it.  I would like to know what type of lobbying secured the removal of housing from the Bill and the substitution of this other hit and miss type of scheme which is designed to hit the person who requires the house rather than the housebuilder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words.  I arrived here when Deputy Donegan was holding forth in his denigration of the private building sector of our country.  No county has benefited more from building efforts than County Louth, but the Deputy had not the courtesy to acknowledge that.  I have been in County Louth and have seen the development there.  The corporation have made notable efforts to provide houses for the homeless people there and for people who have to be housed under the regulations.  On top of that, the private building sector has helped immensely to enrich the Deputy's county.  Nevertheless, he denigrates the whole system of private building in this country.  Builders have to make great sacrifices in some cases to get sites, and local authorities have made great strides in helping small builders. In this city they have provided thousands of sites.  Deputy Donegan's party is committed to a policy of private ownership, and as long as that principle is accepted obviously prices have to maintain a market value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Prices Commission put forward an amendment to the Bill that section 6 (2) of the Bill as drafted should be amended to provide that persons rendering services may, by order, be required to display their charges for these services. At present price display orders may be made only in respect of a limited number of commodities and the effect of the subsection now being substituted by the amendment will be that I, as Minister, will not be restricted as to the range of commodities in respect of which price display orders may be made.  The proposal by the National Prices Commission that the Minister would also have power to make a price display order in respect of services appears to be a natural corollary to the powers which the Minister will have in relation to the price of commodities.</P>
      <P>In addition, the National Prices Commission put forward a further amendment to the Bill to provide that all prices marked on goods displayed or quoted at retail level should be tax-inclusive prices.  It should be noted that in the amendment the charges displayed or quoted in respect of services are also now included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment stems from the commission's concern that as much information as possible on the prices of goods should be available to the consumer and that as far as possible the consumer should be facilitated in the matter of comparing prices as between one retailer and another.  Therefore, the commission take the view&mdash; and I share it&mdash;that it would not be sufficient to compel retailers to state whether their prices are tax-inclusive or not, since this would mean the consumers would still have the difficult task of comparing tax-inclusive prices in one retail outlet with tax-exclusive prices in another.  It may, in addition, be argued that tax-inclusive prices will make it easier for retailers to charge excessive tax on goods.  The answer to this is that if at present a retailer is bent on charging excessive prices for goods he does not have to have recourse <Col N="1201" /> to charging excessive tax in order to achieve this object.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that the Bill already provides that in the case of retail price display orders the retail price displayed must be inclusive of tax.  There are, therefore, three separate categories.  The provision in regard to tax inclusive prices does not apply in regard to goods whose prices are not displayed.  The whole object of the amendment is to ensure that customers will have better protection.</P>

Of course, people who have been in the town or district for a <Col N="1202" /> while will know the reputation of the café but a person can go into the café wondering if it is too expensive.  It is, therefore, necessary to have a price list displayed.</P>

      <P>The general complaint of housewives is the very wide variation in prices as between one end of a street and another, one town or another or one county and another. At one end of a street a housewife may get the same article for 25 per cent less than at the other end.  Does this give the Minister power to compel the shopkeeper to display prices so that the consumer will know what has to be paid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am doing here is taking power to make it compulsory to display prices but this will not take away the possibility of different prices being charged for the same goods in different towns or different counties or different shops.  I read in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> an article arising from the application of a recent order. A whip around had revealed blatant divergence in prices for identical articles.  Of course, one needs to be very careful or one compares the high price in one place with the low price in another.  Very often the low price means the article is being sold under cost and that article would be what we described during a discussion on earlier legislation as a loss leader. What we are talking about here is the power to make orders that prices be displayed in respect of all commodities. This does not mean there will not be competition.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister confirm whether arising out of the passing of this Bill, and particularly this amendment, in future the scope of the retail price display orders will be substantially increased and that the method of the display itself will be broadened?  This is a matter of great public interest and concern, and confirmation of it tonight from the Minister would be of considerable importance. It has been commented on, understandably, by members of the public that the Third Schedule to the 1958 Act had a very limited range of ten items from the point of view of a retail display order.  Now I gather the NPC can recommend a much more variable way in which the prices will have to be displayed, on tags and statements, and orally.  I would strongly recommend that the Minister should make this fact of life more widely known, particularly in the public press, that the scope of retail prices display orders will be enlarged substantially and that the specified manner of display will also be enlarged quite considerably under the Bill.  The Minister might usefully comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say that there is unlimited scope as to the particular articles that can be ordered into a display list.  The Deputy asked a question about the size of displays&mdash;the size of the print?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not unduly concerned about the actual size but <Col N="1204" /> under the Third Schedule, the old display order we have, including the one which the Minister published recently, was confined to bread, flour, butter, tea, eggs, potatoes, beef, mutton, bacon, pork and oranges.  As I now gather, under the new legislation, the Minister may specify any other commodity and insist that any commodity be brought within a public display order.  It does not seem to have yet dawned on the public that this Bill will give the Minister the power to do that, nor does it seem to have dawned on the public that the National Prices Commission can extend both the range of commodities which will appear on a prices display order but also the manner in which the prices may be tagged on to particular commodities.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to see the Minister accepting in a much more elaborate form the amendment we put down, No. 10, which we are withdrawing, and in which we asked if the Minister could require a person to display the price charged for a service, and that the Minister in his amendment No. 9 has very substantially extended the scope of such orders and the means by which they be displayed, because there is a great deal of jiggery-pokery going on at the moment in relation to the actual marking of prices on commodities and I think&mdash;I make this point now as it is germane&mdash;that a decent Trade Descriptions Act, together with this Bill, would ensure that prices were both true and related to the actual commodity being sold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 27, to add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Whenever functions under the Acts are transferred from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to any other Minister of State there shall be prior consultation with the National Prices Commission on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> In this amendment we are specifically asking that the National Prices Commission be consulted by the Minister before he transfers functions to any other Minister of State.  I gather that as a result of the enlarged scope of the Bill, there is quite a bit of fright in a number of other Departments. Local Government were scared stiff when it was discovered that houses came under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>And got away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Now they have managed to grab back housing under the price control of their Department. Likewise, there was consternation in the Department of Transport and Power but that has been overcome.  My worry is that where a specific commodity particularly under departmental control comes up for surveillance or report, the Minister concerned can grab it and take it to his bosom before the National Prices Commission or the Minister for Industry and Commerce can get hold of it, and it can be neatly shouldered on to another Minister without any prior consultation.  We strongly suggest to the Minister that where in any case he is transferring functions from himself to another Minister, he should first consult the National Prices Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We think that is eminently reasonable and fair, and if the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment, perhaps he would give some indication that the senior officers in his Department, working under the auspices of the National Prices Commission, would keep a watching brief and ensure that if something is to be hived off from the Department of Industry and Commerce to another Department, they will bring it to the notice of the National Prices Commission because inevitably there will be very considerable difficulty.  All the other Government Departments will naturally bitterly resent Industry and Commerce sticking its nose into what they would regard as their private empire in terms of price control and surveillance and we suggest that it is in the national interest that the National Prices Commission should have a general role in <Col N="1206" /> the form of some prior consultation. If he is not prepared to accept the amendment, he might be prepared to indicate, as a matter of personal policy and administrative operation, that he would say to other Departments when they ask him to give them that function &ldquo;May I have some time to consult the National Prices Commission before handing it over to you?&rdquo; We think this would improve the overall effectiveness of the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>I want to say that we on the Opposition side most certainly want to take the opportunity to congratulate the National Prices Commission on the excellent work it is doing in the field of price surveillance and specific reporting on specific items.  We feel it is most deserving of congratulation.  The monthly reports which have caused quite a stir nationally amongst the public, trade unions and employer and trading and commercial organisations, are invaluable and I have no doubt will make a very distinctive contribution to a more effective system of price surveillance and influence, bearing in mind the difficulty of having price control itself.  I have no doubt that the amendment we have down would also add to an improvement in the general operation of the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that I am opposed to this amendment, not because of any specific animosity towards embracing it, but because apart from any other consideration, it would not be desirable that the National Prices Commission should be spelled out by name in the Bill which, as I hope, will be in force over a long number of years.  There might be a possibility at some time in the future that the commisson might be dissolved or replaced by a body with similar functions but with a different name.  In that contingency, the question of amending the Prices Act would arise simply because the National Prices Commission might have become something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention, and I have agreed informally, to consult the commission in regard to the transfer of functions proposed in section 7 of the Bill and to talk to other Departments where <Col N="1207" /> functions are being transferred.  From my point of view I can truthfully say that I would recommend the NBC for doing the job any other Minister might want done in this regard.  On the other hand, the Deputy spoke about the fact that the &ldquo;empires&rdquo; inside other Departments would not like interference in this regard.  It was not the Minister for Justice who was specifically indicating any aversion to taking on the NBC but the people who would be affected by the regulations.  Let us not talk about the Government Departments solely in this regard.  They are not always guilty.  If the Deputy, on behalf of his colleagues, accepts the fact that I have agreed informally to consult with the committee on this point.  I would propose doing that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>Before section 10 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A local authority may with the consent of the Minister for Local Government appoint a committee, hereinafter referred to as a Local Prices Committee to perform such functions as may be assigned to it from time to time by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the consent of the Minister for Local Government.  A Local Prices Committee shall be deemed to be an approved local council for the purpose of the Local Government Acts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The suggestion in amendment No. 15 is rather important.  We are proposing that there should be statutory provision for the setting up of local prices committees to perform such functions as may be assigned to them from time to time by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the consent of the Minister for Local Government. The reason why we have tried to marry-in the prices committees is that we see them as an essential part of local administration and local government. We tried to correlate them with the local authorities and various other local administrative committees operating on a county council basis or a local council basis.  We believe very strongly that there is a need for such local prices committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a growing number of <i>ad hoc</i> local prices committees being set up around the country.  Housewives associations get together on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Trade union organisations get together at council level and set up prices committees.  We believe that it would be an enlargement of democratic discussion and debate, and a useful social contribution, if such local committees were in operation.  It is not <Col N="1210" /> just good enough that there should be a national bureaucracy in Dublin setting out the level of retail prices throughout the country.  It would be very useful if there were local committees with a number of functions. We would concur that these are the functions which the National Prices Commission have suggested.  The local committees would have the function of collecting particulars of retail commodities and services at local level.  The NPC could contact the committees and ask them to do local surveys of the level of prices at any given time.</P>
    <P>We have seen the recently published survey of urban prices.  This was an invaluable survey.  It highlighted the disparities at provincial level.  The local committees could highlight at major level the disparities in the prices of particular commodities. They could collect information and forward it on behalf of individual consumers to the National Prices Commission.  They could generate local interest in prices and price comparisons by handing out information provided by the National Prices Commission. They could act as a general consumer protection agency.  In many countries on the Continent, and particularly in the Scandinavian countries, these local committees are very widely known.  They operate quite effectively.  We recommend that local committees should be set up by the Minister under this Bill.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment, perhaps he would generally encourage its purpose within his Department by asking them to write to the local trades councils throughout the country and to the local branches of the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the various chambers of commerce and the various voluntary organisations asking them to set up these committees.  These committees would give the consumer an opportunity of studying the subject and finding out all the reliable information available.</P>
    <P>That would in some degree overcome the apathy and the timidity.  It would also overcome the sheer ignorance as to what exactly constitutes price control, price surveillance <Col N="1211" /> and price investigation.  By and large it would help the consumer, the manufacturer and the local shopkeeper. Invariably the local shopkeeper is accused of being an exploiter.  Very frequently it is the manufacturer who lays down the guideline to be followed or, perhaps, the wholesaler or the middleman.  These matters could be clarified at local level and that would help community confidence in monitoring prices and price control.  The only alternative will be <i>ad hoc</i> witch-hunts and semi-hysteria which would be of no help to anybody, least of all to the local consumer.  It is for these reasons we urge full consideration by the Minister of this amendment.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Desmond, I got the impression that he was asking me to take power in this Bill to set up local price committees, the power to be handed over to the local authority who would appoint a committee which I would recognise as a local prices committee.  Actually that power is already there and has been used.  It arose out of a recommendation in the National Prices Commission's Monthly Report No. 6 of April, 1972, paragraph 41, page 33, of which states:</P>
      <P>Having considered the comments submitted by the Department of Local Government, the Federation of Trade Associations, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, we recommend as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  The first pilot local prices committee should be set up in Dundalk, subject to the consent of the local authority.  We chose Dundalk because there are a number of active bodies there, representative of traders and consumers' interests.  Moreover, a member of the committee resides there and this will facilitate liaison between the Commission and the local committee.</P>
      <P>In the second paragraph the report deals with the membership of the local prices committee:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  The membership of this local prices committee should be <Col N="1212" /> as follows: a chairman appointed by the local authority, who is neither a trader nor a member of the consumers' organisation;</P>

      <P>He will.  This idea of a local pilot committee was a pet subject of Mr. O'Sullivan's.  When I met the Congress of Trade Unions about 18 months ago this was one of the ideas he put forward at that time.  The report goes on to spell out the membership:</P>
      <P>Mr. Harold O'Sullivan, a member of the National Prices Commission; a Prices Inspector from the Department of Industry and Commerce; one representative nominated by each of the Local Trades Council, the Irish Countrywomen's Association and the Irish Housewives' Association; three representatives of the local traders (including one from the local Chamber of Commerce) nominated by the Federation of Trade Associations.  The committee should have power to co-opt two additional members.  The secretary should be a local authority officer, appointed by the local authority.  All members who represent traders' or consumers' interests should be local residents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the pilot scheme and, in the event of its being a success, there is nothing to prevent me creating other local prices committees of a similar kind.  The power is there.  The only difference, as I see it, in the existing arrangement and the Deputy's proposal is that the Deputy is suggesting that the local authority should set up this committee. While it might be suggested that Dublin is too far removed from the field of local operations, nevertheless I honestly think the type of representation suggested is the ideal type <Col N="1213" /> for the local council to initiate and the power I have is sufficient to ensure the end product the Deputy is seeking here. I assume the Deputy is not anxious to press his amendment in view of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I said on Second Stage that I welcomed this Bill, that I was entirely in favour of giving the vote to citizens at 18 years of age.  I pointed out that I considered this proposal to be overdue and that it had been part of Fine Gael policy from as far back as 1965. At the Fine Gael Ard Fheis held in that year a resolution was passed unanimously by the supreme authority of Fine Gael making it Fine Gael policy to call for the vote at 18.</P>
      <P>Since 1965 there have been marked changes in the approach of middle aged and elderly persons towards youth.  One might say that in those seven years, youth have been emancipated and recognised as playing an adult part in national affairs.  Indeed, as each year passes we find that people are maturing younger and that they are taking part in national affairs at an earlier age.  I read in <i>The Sunday Press</i> only this week that the student body of the National University are demanding two seats on the governing body of the university.  What was adequate in 1965 to satisfy the just claims of youth is not adequate today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in that atmosphere that I suggested to the Minister that this Bill was not going far enough and that in particular this section is not wide enough.  I suggested to the Minister that he should confer on persons who had reached the age of <Col N="1215" /> 18 years the right to offer themselves for election to Parliament and, if elected, to take their seats.  I put down an amendment to that effect but the Ceann Comhairle, no doubt in accordance with Standing Orders, ruled the amendment out of order so that I am not now at liberty to move it.  However, in order to provide an opportunity of discussing this question at a later date I have handed in to the Bills Office a Private Member's Bill which seeks to amend the Constitution by conferring on persons who had reached the age of 18 years the right to offer themselves for election to Parliament and, if elected, to take their seats.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that at the moment the Council of Europe are considering reducing the legal age of majority from 21 to 18 years.  The existing law, which decress that a person is an infant until he reaches the age of 21 years, leads to a number of absurdities.  The argument has been put forward many times that a person is called on to pay taxes at 18 years of age and, perhaps, younger.  There are many thousands of people of 18 years of age who are paying substantial sums each week under the PAYE system.  They have no alternative because the tax is deducted from their wages.  It has been pointed out also that the Civil Service is staffed partially by many fine young people in their teens.  If we were to exclude teenagers from the National Army we would have a very depleted Force.  The qualifying age for recruitment to the Garda Síochána is 18.  Therefore, it is an understatement to say that this Bill is overdue.  As has been pointed out also, a man is entitled to marry at 18 or younger and, when married, he is obliged under the law of this country to provide for his wife and family; yet he is not considered mature enough to take care of his own finances.  If, for example, he wins the Sweep, he cannot collect the money until he is 21.  Is not that absurd and is it not equally absurd to deny him the right to vote at 18?</P>
    <P>I have said that the Bill should go further and confer on people of 18 the right to offer themselves for election <Col N="1216" /> to Parliament.  By and large down through the years the voting age and the qualifying age for taking seats in Parliament have been the same in many countries.  That has been the position in such countries as Australia, Canada, Chile, Finland, Great Britain, Iceland, Nigeria, New Zealand, Norway and, of course, Ireland.  Admittedly, as the Minister will probably point out, some of those countries, notably Great Britain and also the US which is not mentioned on the list I have, have changed the voting age but have retained the age of 21 as the qualifying age for election to Parliament. I concede that, but is that consistent? I do not think it is.  It would be more consistent to have the voting age the same as the qualifying age for taking a seat.  The Minister will also point out, I am sure, if we are allowed to continue in this vein&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am entirely in favour of the Bill but it is inconsistent in giving the vote at 18 and in not giving the right to offer oneself for election at 18.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider the arguments I made on the Second Reading.  If I were in order in doing so now I would expand and develop them at this stage.  I believe the Minister <Col N="1217" /> gave no thought whatever to the proposal I have suggested.  I hope that when this section goes before the people it will be accepted by an overwhelming majority, as I am satisfied it will.  When the Minister was speaking on the Second Stage and replying to some remarks I made he was ungracious enough to express the hope that when this section of the Bill went before the people Fine Gael would campaign in its favour.  The Minister may rest assured of that and that because Fine Gael will campaign in its favour, it will be carried by the people.</P>
      <P>He was ungracious enough on that occasion to say that he hoped Fine Gael would work harder than they did in the recent referendum.  Speeches like that from young Ministers only go to show the different thinking there is in the present Government.  I pointed out to the Minister then that immediately after the referendum the Taoiseach was big enough, gracious and honest enough to compliment Deputy Cosgrave, leader of the Fine Gael Party and the party on the notable part they had played in the referendum on the EEC.  I can tell the Minister that at any time in recent political history when they had not the assistance of the Fine Gael Party in a referendum his party did not do so well.</P>

      <P>Last week, when I was speaking on the Second Stage, I made some references to the voting age and the minimum age for election to Parliament in a number of countries. The information I gave was as up-to-date as was available to me at that time, but since the debate I have had inquiries made through the Department of Foreign Affairs as to the present position regarding the ages for voting and membership of Parliament in a large number of countries. That information has come to hand in the last few days.  It shows that as <Col N="1219" /> a result of recent changes the minimum age for membership of parliament in Norway and Denmark is 20 years, not 21 as I stated last week.  In the case of Sweden the minimum age for voting and membership of Parliament is now 19.  I am glad to avail of this opportunity to put that matter right.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to the question of having the same minimum age for election to Parliament as for voting.  I should like to point out that there is quite a discrepancy and the general trend seems to be not to have the same age for voting as for membership of Parliament.</P>

    <Title>Restrictive Trade Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1972: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm an order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, relating to the supply and distribution of motor spirit.</P>
      <P>The commission's recommendation is contained in their report of a public inquiry which my predecessor requested following representations made to him by the Irish Motor Traders Association, now the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, who wished to have restrictions applied to growth in numbers of motor spirit retail outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A previous inquiry relating to motor <Col N="1220" /> spirit was carried out by the commission in 1961.  That inquiry was mainly concerned with the solus system&mdash;the system under which a retailer undertakes to handle one brand of motor spirit exclusively.  It was found that the system had certain advantages, but that it should be subject to regulation because it encouraged an excessive increase in the number of outlets.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce made an order in 1961 designed to regulate the system and the following year the commission agreed certain guiding principles with the petrol companies with the object of limiting the increase in number of retail outlets.</P>
    <P>The report of the recent inquiry states that the pattern of supply and distribution of motor spirit has not changed significantly since 1961.  There are at present six companies supplying the market; only one of these is wholly in Irish control.  The three largest companies&mdash;Esso, Shell and Texaco&mdash;are subsidiaries of the companies which formed the consortium operating the Whitegate refinery; two others buy their requirements from these three and the sixth imports motor spirit.  One trade association&mdash;the Society of the Irish Motor Industry&mdash;caters <i>inter alia</i> for the retail motor trade, including petrol retailing.  The society have two classes of members&mdash;wholesalers and retailers.  Distribution of motor spirit has become more efficient since 1961 by reason of such developments as increased tanker size, reduction of number of depots, round-the-clock operation of road tanker fleets and assistance to dealers to enable them to increase storage capacity, with the result that prices, exclusive of duty, are virtually unchanged.</P>
    <P>Altogether 25 witnesses were examined in the course of the inquiry.  They included representatives of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, the petrol companies, motor spirit retailers, the Private Motorists Protection Association, various public bodies and the Department of Local Government. Growing control by the petrol companies of the retail trade through ownership of outlets is the salient fact to emerge from the inquiry.  While the total number of dealer outlets seemed <Col N="1221" /> to have stabilised itself between 1962 and the time of the inquiry in 1970, and to that extent the guiding principles which had been agreed with the petrol companies had been successful, the number of company-owned retail outlets had been increasing unduly and the proportion of total sales of motor spirit through these outlets had increased from 16 per cent to 31.1 per cent.  The commission felt that if this trend were to continue unchecked the petrol companies would be likely to secure substantial control over retail distribution in the foreseeable future. Such control would introduce a degree of rigidity into the market which would be likely progressively to reduce competitive pressures and which would lend itself more readily to restrictive practices such as market sharing and pricing arrangements.  They considered, therefore, that the exigencies of the common good demanded that for a limited period these companies should neither purchase nor construct additional company-owned outlets.  They recommended that all the petrol companies be invited to observe this pause on a voluntary basis on the understanding that it would apply to newcomers as well as to existing companies but if they were not prepared to do this the pause should be statutorily imposed. They also recommended that the maximum period of five years allowed for solus agreements under the 1961 order should be increased to ten years because the five year limitation had proved self-defeating in shifting the interest of the petrol companies away from dealers to the development of company-owned outlets.</P>
    <P>Additional recommendations were that the 1961 order should be amended to prohibit any differentiation in the terms and conditions of supply of motor spirit between company-owned outlets and independent retailers; to extend the present obligation on the petrol companies to furnish information in respect of their own outlets to include information on facilities afforded to independent retailers; and to modify the existing prohibition on price discrimination to allow a surcharge to be made by petrol companies to retailers in respect of deliveries below a specified minimum size.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> I accepted the recommendations of the commission and invited the petrol companies to observe a voluntary pause in the construction and acquisition of company-owned stations.  Some of the companies were not prepared to do this, however, as they felt that statutory control would be more effective and more equitable.  I therefore decided to make an order to give effect to the commission's recommendations and I informed the petrol companies accordingly.</P>
    <P>Subsequently these companies made representations to me about certain provisions of the proposed order.  They asked for exemption from the prohibition on the construction or acquisition of new company-owned stations in certain cases where their arrangements had reached such an advanced stage that withdrawal would result in severe financial loss not only for them but also for independent dealers and other private interests who were involved.  I felt that in cases involving the construction of new stations the companies should be given a reasonable opportunity of completing their arrangements and I decided, therefore, that in such cases the order should not come into operation for four weeks after it was made.  I was also asked to provide exemption where a company might dispose of a station and open up one in its place in another location, on the grounds that arrangements of this kind would not result in any increase in the overall number of company stations.  I was not disposed to accede to this request but I decided that exemption would be justified in any case where a station was opened up in place of one which had been compulsorily acquired by a local authority or by-passed by a new road, provided the new station was in the same locality.  Objections were also made to the proposal to allow petrol companies to levy a surcharge on deliveries below a specified minimum size on the grounds that such a surcharge would bear unfairly on remote areas of the country where the majority of dealers who take only small deliveries at a time are located.  I mentioned earlier in my speech that distribution of motor spirit had become more efficient in the <Col N="1223" /> last ten years.  One of the measures adopted by some of the companies in their efforts to achieve this efficiency was the withdrawal of supplies from retail outlets in certain cases where orders were so small as to make delivery uneconomic.  I felt that, while the sale of motor spirit might not provide any substantial income to operators of small outlets, particularly in remote areas, nevertheless, an outlet attached to a shop, hotel or public house was a convenience for customers and it would be a good thing if the petrol companies could be induced to continue or to recommence supplying such outlets.  The surcharge recommended by the commission would, it seemed to me, provide such an inducement and I decided, therefore, that it would, on balance, be unjustifiable that distributors should be prohibited by law from applying it, and the order provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Representations were also made to me that newcomers to the petrol distributing trade would have no chance of getting a share of the market if they were precluded from constructing or otherwise acquiring company-owned outlets.  While I was not too happy with the situation where the scope for newcomers to enter the market was restricted I felt, nevertheless, that to allow them to develop company-owned outlets while prohibiting existing companies from doing likewise might constitute discrimination.</P>
    <P>I also felt that newcomers could obtain a foothold in the market without necessarily constructing company stations or acquiring existing dealer stations.  For instance, a new company could buy sites for sale to dealers and could finance the construction of stations on those sites by dealers in return for ten-year solus agreements, or dealers could be induced to sign solus agreements with a new company when their existing solus agreements with other companies came to an end. In any event, if it were found at a later stage that a new company could not enter the market because of the <Col N="1224" /> order the position could be reviewed. In all the circumstances, I decided that the order should apply both to existing companies and any new companies that might enter the market.</P>
    <P>On 15th June, 1972, I made the Restrictive Trade Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1972, giving effect to the Fair Trade Commission's recommendations with the modifications I have already mentioned.  The prohibition under the order on the opening of new company-owned stations will remain in force for a period of three years and it is my intention to ask the commission to review the position before the end of that period.</P>
    <P>Orders of this kind do not have the force of law unless they are confirmed by Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the Dáil is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the order concerned. With a Bill of this kind, the order which it is proposed to confirm may not be amended by the Oireachtas but must be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters with which the order deals have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, and their report which was presented to this House sets out the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the order.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>So do I.  I speak on this Bill with specific knowledge because my father was the owner of the first petrol station between Dublin and Belfast which was outside a garage.  At that stage, many years ago, an exception was made in his case because of a friend.  While this order is restrictive in itself, the petrol companies have been far too clever and far too self-seeking in their approach towards the marketing of their product.  Those of us in the trade have seen over 20 years a situation in which at times the petrol companies vied with each other in country areas to get shopkeepers and other people to set up petrol pumps and to get them under contract on the solus site system.  Later on when they found that not enough petrol was being sold in certain places, they dropped them like the proverbial hot potato.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> At the same time they were also trying to do other things like getting planning permission to set up solus sites on important arterial roads.  This may be the sort of thing that happens internationally.  It may be the sort of thing that has to happen, but it is not something we like to see in our country.  I am glad that this order has come before the House.  I agree that it is restrictive but I believe that restriction is necessary.  Manners must be put on these people.  They seem to have decided that they will run the country so far as their trade is concerned.  They have decided what they will do, and for that reason I believe this is a good order.</P>
    <P>The solus site system and the company owned site system were the <i>modus operandi</i> under which the companies vied with each other and at the same time, they fought with the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce for the last farthing per gallon, and to make sure that they got the highest possible price.  The people selling the petrol and operating the solus sites&mdash;and I have been operating one in succession to my father&mdash;never got a decent profit.  If you had a 24-hour site in Dublin and were selling thousands of gallons per day you had a goldmine.  There are these goldmines but in this country they are very few.</P>
    <P>In the normal course of selling this product the power was in the hands of the petrol companies, and did they use it?  They certainly did.  The Minister mentioned the refusal of a petrol company to supply if the cost of delivery was too high.  That is an example of how they have behaved over the years.  I am delighted that at last even for three years, which is a very short time, there will be a restriction on the setting up of further petrol outlets.</P>
    <P>We do not need to buy petrol every mile of the road.  There may be the odd person who has not got the money to buy more than two gallons but in a small car two gallons of petrol would bring you 60 miles.  Therefore, there is no need to have a petrol station at every mile of the road.  We must be normal and modern about this.  On the M.1 and other roads in Britain at 20 mile intervals permission is granted for <Col N="1226" /> a petrol filling station on the basis that they will stay open for 24 hours per day and, when they stop doing that, the planning permission is removed. They must also provide, at a modest price, meals for motorists, toilet accommodation, wash-up accommodation and the basic facilities for minor repairs. That is the sort of thing that can never happen in this country because we had an intermittent war between the petrol companies and, at the same time, they were trying to get stations where there should not be stations.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with this order but I must also say that something else has happened in the past six or nine months.  The petrol companies knew about this.  Section 3 (2) of the Restrictive Trade Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1972, provides:</P>
    <P>This Article shall not apply in relation to a motor spirit station the construction of which was completed after the commencement of this Order if the whole of the station at and below ground level was completed not later than four weeks after the date of the making of this Order.</P>
    <P>If I were so disposed I could tell the Minister of two cases where there is a rush on to beat this order by two major petrol companies, to their shame. They have their money and their sales of petrol and their share of the Whitegate Refinery, and they should not be trying to pick up the last shilling, and trying to compete with existing petrol stations which they made solus stations or were made solus stations by their competitors years ago.  What is the date of the commencement of the order?  It is very important that we should know this.  Can the Minister tell us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very important. I know of only two.  I despise this rush to beat legislation by persons in very big business, who should know better, against people in private business, who have very much less money and who have been serving people on the road that I speak of for many years.  Of course, I am not talking about anybody on the Dublin/Belfast far from my constituency.  The position is that the station must have road.  I am talking about another road <Col N="1228" /> been completed at or below ground level before 15th July.  That is all I want to know.  I hope that those petrol companies who have been trying to &ldquo;jump the gun&rdquo; will not succeed in having these stations completed to that extent by that date.  I hope that those whom they wish to supersede, the suppliers in a particular area, will ensure that these companies will be subject to the full rigours of the law under this order and that the Minister and the Department will ensure that that is done.  If the idea is to restrict the number of retail outlets, this should be applied fairly.  If I had been making this order I would not have given one day, even though that might have involved a loss to a petrol company that had started operations and had spent money.  Once a concession is made, a powerful organisation can spend more than anybody else can afford and can succeed in complying with the order by having building work done even within a week or so.  Therefore it would have been better not to have given a month during which people could rush to finish work.</P>
      <P>In relation to the petrol trade generally, the system whereby, for long-term contractors and the giving of solus rights, better terms were applied to people who were prepared to sign their names to this, is one that I deplore because my experience of it both in relation to a small petrol station and other business is that, once your name is put on the paper, somebody else gets a better price.  The big companies decide to give a certain rebate for a certain gallonage of oil. People are delighted to get the rebate. The moment they sign, there is another company that will come in and offer a price that is one-farthing less to somebody beside you.  Such behaviour required to be investigated and I am glad the Minister did it.  The application, while restricted, was necessary and I commend the Minister for having operated as he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every miller, every shopkeeper and every person in business has uneconomic outlets.  Very few of them have the impertinence to refuse to supply. As long as they pay, they are supplied. That goes for the smallest supplier and <Col N="1229" /> the largest supplier.  I think of petrol companies who have been facilitated. They were facilitated under an inter-party Government in the building of Whitegate Refinery which, if the Minister were doing his job, would be expanded to twice its size.  I think of petrol companies refusing to supply what they regard as an uneconomic outlet.  It is time that the State informed these companies as to what they should do, instead of allowing them to decide what they will do.  They should be made to operate in the manner that has been a feature of business since the inception of this State.</P>
    <P>I want once again to indicate my view that any major petrol company that has not complied in detail with section 3 (2) of SI/150 of 1972 should not be allowed to trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantially, I am not in disagreement with the Bill. I have always regarded the price of petrol as being an overcharge.  This has evolved because of the existence of a ring.  On occasions the price of petrol is reduced by 1p or ½p a gallon.  This shows that the control rests with a few people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise the aim of the Bill is to regularise the sale of petrol.  The small person in an outlying district should be allowed to sell petrol.  There is a reassurance on that point in the Minister's speech.  I do not disagree with what Deputy Donegan said, but he lives in a town.  For those who live in isolated districts it is inconvenient that there should be a petrol station only every 20 miles.  I see that what is envisaged in this legislation is to introduce the rule that exists in other countries whereby there is a distance of 20 miles between petrol stations.  For a person in an isolated district who runs short of petrol, this would represent a considerable distance.  The petrol companies mentioned by the Minister&mdash;there are only three&mdash;would have monopolistic control over the sale of petrol.  For this reason I want to suggest to the Minister that they are not sea-green incorruptibles when given a monopoly.  In the village of Ashford, County Wicklow, there was one petrol station, an Esso filling station, about three years ago.  Two years ago another <Col N="1230" /> station was opened.  In the last week another petrol station has been allowed. They have got planning permission. How they managed to get it I do not know.  They seem to have got it extremely quickly.  It is worked out to the last second, so to speak, so that they can beat the order the Minister is bringing in.  I understand the Minister will bring in the order on 14th July.  Am I right in that?</P>

      <P>Those private exploiters who got a licence are in a position to put up a third petrol station in a village which is virtually only a street with a few houses, a post office, a church and this petrol station.  They have got planning permission. We will not go into where they got it from but my information is that they got it by political influence. They are able to open this petrol station.  Only the foundations are laid. There is nothing else there.  The Minister can ring up and find out or he can send one of his officials to find out if what I am saying is true.  There are hundreds of cases like this all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose word has gone out from the Fair Trade Commission that petrol pumps may be set up in different parts of the country to beat the order. <Col N="1231" /> This restriction will start in two days time.  Perhaps what the Minister is doing is necessary but whenever Dáil Éireann are going into recess we always have legislation like this brought in.  The Deputies are asked to acquiesce with everything and not hold up business, not to keep the Dáil going longer than necessary.  By standing up tonight I am probably extending the sitting time of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied, first of all, that small dealers should be restricted from having petrol pumps.  They suit rural Ireland and the people who live away from large petrol stations.  The trend in all legislation we introduce here is that it is all Dublin-minded or big-centre minded legislation.  I want to put in a word for the small fellow, the person who lives in rural Ireland.  I do not see why people who are in a small way of business in a small village, where there is no big company, should be restricted.  The Minister said that the matter would be reviewed in three years time but that is a long time if people have got into the habit of obtaining petrol from those small people.  The Minister for Finance is probably anxious to get more revenue from people who buy petrol.</P>
    <P>This Dáil should legislate for everybody in Ireland.  It should not legislate for Dublin and built-up areas alone.  I appreciate that Ministers are surrounded by advisers who want to do things in the best interests of the country and are inclined to accept things hook, line and sinker.  We have a great many monopolies in this country and I do not want to see any more operating.  I want to put in a word for those whom the majority of Deputies represent, the people who live in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to state what is the position under the Rome Treaty in relation to the right of establishment in relation to this Bill.  Is it in line with the EEC regulations?  The second point I want to make is that it has come to my notice during the past year that a <Col N="1232" /> number of ordinary, decent people who were running their garages under the solus system found all of a sudden they were not owners of the sites on which they worked.  There was a High Court action in relation to this brought by a number of what turned out to be garage tenants who thought themselves to be garage owners.  Apparently the small print which the petrol company had put into all the agreements with these people meant that the people who had worked and developed the business for a number of years were not, in fact, the owners of the business. They were only tenants.  This situation is wrong and there should have been legislation giving those people who had developed their business down through the years certain stronger rights than they had.</P>
      <P>The third point I want to make is that the Minister stated that the distribution of motor spirit has become more efficient since 1961.  He further stated that prices of motor spirits exclusive of duty is virtually unchanged.  I would like to know what prices those are.  Is it the prices as stated by the petrol companies, the prices at refinery level, or at import stage?  What prices have remained the same?  It is obvious from what the Minister said that the duty put on motor spirits over the past ten years has been the main cause of the big jump in the price of motor spirits in the Republic.  I would like the Minister to comment on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the three contributors to this Bill welcomed the making of the order. Deputy Donegan welcomed it enthusiastically and Deputy Esmonde welcomed it to a 50 per cent degree in that he instanced a particular case and indicated that by some peculiar machinations between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the planners, some arrangement had been made within the last month, whereby some individual was able to get planning permission and able to have a petrol station fully erected before now. I am afraid the Deputy cannot possibly expect the House to agree with the allegations he made in this regard.  He went on afterwards to challenge the <Col N="1233" /> right of anybody to interfere with any person building a petrol station down the country; that the country people should have reasonable access to petrol pumps.  People down the country, according to the Deputy, should be free to build filling stations anywhere they are required.  He said that this order was a Dublin-orientated recommendation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy wanted to make some point about a new station at Ashford and this was the reason why he spoke. Deputy Donegan stated that if he were bringing in this order he would not have given a month's grace at all.  The period of four weeks was the minimum period required, as I saw it, to cover cases of genuine hardship.  The month's grace was primarily intended to protect private interests from suffering financially if they had to abandon arrangements which had reached an advanced stage.  I was not thinking of the larger petrol companies from this point of view.  I know in at least one case in which there was a suggestion that a private owner was dependent on the sale of his site to a company to avoid being forced into bankruptcy. Hardship could be imposed by making an order on a particular date, if the order became applicable from rent date.  There was no question of a leakage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the recommendations made to me by the Fair Trade Commission was that I should endeavour to negotiate a voluntary restraint with the petrol companies.  I accepted that recommendation and, arising from that, the officials in my Department had discussions with the petrol companies to see if we could effect a voluntary restraint.  Following the report and the later discussions, all the petrol companies would have been aware that the recommendation had been made and that I was carrying out the spirit of the recommendation by having discussions with them to see if voluntary restraint could be arranged and, if not, that I would proceed with the introduction of an order.  There was no question of leakage.  Companies who knew that I would be introducing an order would, naturally, try to finalise <Col N="1234" /> their plans for the provision of filling stations.</P>
    <P>The situation is now straightforward. For the next three years there will not be any further developments of this nature.  Deputy E. Collins asked how does the Rome Treaty or membership of EEC affect this position.  There is no problem.  Any legislation introduced here is equally effective on all concerned without discrimination.  There is no problem concerned with the implementation of this order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins also referred to solus site owners.  I have no references with me in this regard, nor have I had time to make inquiries.  These owners apparently found that the company owned the stations, not themselves.  In fact, there was a long discussion with Esso. Deputy P. Barry knows of a famous case in Cork.  The station was erected by the company. There was never any question of the tenant being deprived of something he had provided for himself.  Eventually, anyone in possession of a station for more than seven years was able to establish title to it under the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  The companies then introduced arrangements for giving restricted tenancies.  There was no question of anybody building his own station and then, following a solus agreement, finding that the company could take it over from him.  The opposite position was the one aimed at.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to cover the points raised.  I am glad that the House welcomes the order.  It will give the possibility of stabilisation over the next three years, when the position can be examined again.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>That the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1972, prepared by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, and laid before the House on the 11th February, 1972, be confirmed.</P>
      <P>This amendment of the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme is designed to cater for three matters.</P>
      <P>Firstly, it provides that the period of the secondary teachers' strike in February, 1969, may be reckoned as pensionable service.</P>
      <P>The findings of the teachers' salaries tribunal resulted in a situation where allowances are now paid for pass degree qualifications, masters and doctors degrees, special functions, posts of responsibility and teaching in the Gaeltacht.  The effect of the second amendment is to make these allowances pensionable.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement made with effect from the 1st July, 1968, the school or basic salary was increased from £200 to £400.  The third amendment provides for this change.</P>
      <P>It might be mentioned incidentally that at the time the increase in the school salary was made, there was a compensating increase in the capitation grant payable to secondary schools.</P>

There should be a definite move towards having a common superannuation scheme which should cover primary secondary and vocational teachers and which would permit easier exchange between these three areas of the profession. There is more difficulty in moving <Col N="1236" /> from the vocational to the secondary sector than in moving from the national to the secondary sector.  This is connected with the question of mutual recognition.  This is a wide topic.  Perhaps it is not suitable to discuss it now. If a common superannuation scheme could be established for all three sections of the teaching profession, that would be in line with the recommendation of the Ryan Tribunal.</P>
      <P>The amendments to the scheme affect three separate areas.  They allow the 1969 strike period to be recognised as pensionable service.  I approve fully of this attitude.  The teaching profession as a whole have always acted in a responsible manner.  It is only right that the unfortunate strike period should be recognised for pension purposes.</P>
      <P>The second purpose of amending the scheme is to give a wider interpretation in respect of qualification allowances. This, too, is to be welcomed, and is in line with the recommendations of the Ryan Tribunal.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a glaring defect in the present system.  It is in relation to the recognition of service abroad. I am sure the House will accept that such experience abroad can only add to the maturity of the teacher and to his experience.  Teachers who have been abroad and come back have a different and a better approach to teaching sometimes.  This should be recognised and I suggest a certain amount should be added to their pensions as an earnest of this recognition. This would be a major contribution by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the motion was before the Seanad the Minister spoke about increasing the basic figure from £200 to £400.  This was apparently done by agreement and I should like the Minister to widen his explanation of it. He said recently there had been an increase in the capitation grants to cover the difference between the £200 and the £400.  I hope he will elaborate on this, because in relation to capitation grants in general it must be obvious to anybody who has had contact with education that the present grants are inadequate and a source of much criticism in regard to post-primary <Col N="1237" /> schools.  It has come to the point at which parents are being asked for voluntary contributions towards schools attended by their children.  It is therefore essential that capitation grants should be increased substantially if we are to provide the up-to-date secondary school curricula that the Minister has been asking for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points of a general nature.  First of all, I suggest there should be interchangeability as regards pension schemes for the three teaching bodies.  What I mean is that teachers opting to enter employment in industry and <i>vice versa</i> should carry their pension rights with them.</P>
      <P>There should also be some provision for the payment of pensions to widows of teachers or retired teachers.  The present maximum level in respect of contributory pensions is £1,600 per annum and most teachers who have reached their maximum have gone beyond that level.  Therefore teachers are excluded from contributory old age pension rights as operated at the moment.  A widow therefore cannot get a contributory widow's pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment the only payment made to a widow is a gratuity based on the number of contributions the husband had made. No widow should be left in such an insecure position.  Finally, the most important point I want to make is in regard to the calculation of a teacher's pension.  The scheme at the moment is based on units of one to 80 and a teacher must have served 40 years to have a maximum pension of half of his retiring salary.  The modern practice in industry and commerce is to retire a person on two-thirds of his retiring salary.  If we are to attract qualified people into the secondary teaching profession we must improve <Col N="1238" /> their pension at least to the rate of similar personnel in industry.  The House would welcome such a move and I recommend it to the Minister. A final point in connection with retirement pensions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I ask a question? Are we not discussing the secondary teachers' superannuation scheme? The motion states:</P>
      <P>That the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1972, prepared by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, and laid before the House on the 11th February, 1972, be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have we made no progress since 1928? Is that what we are being told?  As the years pass this community and every other community have been taking a different attitude to pensions.  We should have here a Ministry of Pensions. We could not have a worse thing than the pensions section of the Department of Finance because they were knit way back in the dark ages.  I <Col N="1239" /> am not unaware of how long it takes to decide to pay the most simple pension. Take the pensions of those who left the Ordnance Survey in 1916.  Our secondary teachers pay contributions towards their pensions, but what has been done for them?  I am told the Government do not pay any money whatsoever into this scheme.  There is a token sum in the Secondary Education Vote every year but it is purely token.  I am told no money has ever been paid into this scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but you have not told me why I am out of order.</P>
      <P>We are told that this is designed to cater for three matters.  First, it provides that the period of the secondary teachers' strike in February, 1969, may be reckoned as pensionable service.  We all remember what the Department told them at that time.  We were not born yesterday and we all remember what the Department said about the breaking of service and all the rest of it. There is only one group of people who can really be dictated to and the reason is that they are associated with the clerical end of the community who are so decent and obliging that they do not know how to deal with Ministers and civil servants or how to handle them. The explanatory memorandum says that the findings of the teachers' salaries tribunal resulted in a situation where allowances are now paid for pass degree qualifications, masters and doctors degrees, special functions, posts of responsibility and teaching in the Gaeltacht.  The effect of the second amendment is to make these allowances pensionable.  Why should they not be pensionable?  Is this supposed to improve the pension of the teacher who has given long service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> It further says that under an agreement made with effect from the 1st July, 1968 the school or basic salary was increased from £200 to £400.  The third amendment provides for this change.  It also says it might be mentioned incidentally that at the time the increase in the school salary was made there was a compensating increase in the capitation grant payable to secondary schools.  I do not know why that was put in.  Is it in order?  If my remarks are out of order, this is not in order either because it should not be there at all.  It has nothing whatever to do with the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have one thing to ask about secondary teachers' pensions and it is quite simple: why are secondary teachers treated differently from other public servants, from national teachers, vocational teachers and university professors? We all know they are and that is what I protest about this evening. The answer I got from the Minister last week to a question I asked about recognition of service abroad was a disgrace and was outrageous. Recognition of service abroad is related to pensions and it is entirely wrong that people who serve abroad in the advanced countries where education is worthwhile should not have their service recognised.  The fact is that of all those in professional or semi-professional occupations today the worst treated are the secondary teachers. They are certainly the worst treated of all the services when one thinks of the way they pay for their own education, long service and all the rest and the Department have shown themselves to be retrograde and their attitude entirely contrary to decent thinking in the way they treat them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression when I came in with this amendment that it was non-contentious but it would appear from some of the remarks of Deputy O'Donovan that there is some contentious matter in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly what I am getting away with. I am grateful to Deputy Collins for <Col N="1241" /> his acceptance of the proposals as put forward.  There were some points made by him in relation to mobility and I can say that I propose to introduce further amendments later on which will allow for greater mobility.</P>
      <P>With regard to the widows' and orphans' pension scheme, there is a provision for widows and orphans.  The situation in regard to the amount of pension payable to teachers is comparable with that in the public service generally and therefore is not a matter with which I could deal on my own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would look up the situation and he will find that what I have stated is a fact.  Deputy Collins raised the question of the increase from £200 to £400 and asked why this was done. The reason for this was to rationalise the situation in all the schools.  The £400 is a recognition of the fact that the teachers are employed by the conductors of the school and not by the Department.  As I mentioned earlier, all the salary increases which are expressed as percentages are paid by the Department and for the purpose of calculation include the £400 as well as the incremental salary.  I am grateful to the House for its acceptance of the proposals I have put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of March, 1973, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that office, and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to enable funds to be provided for the newly constituted Irish Productivity Centre which was incorporated under the Companies Act on 30th May, 1972, and takes over the functions formerly exercised by the Irish National Productivity Committee who were financed by way of grant-in-aid under the Vote for my Department. Because, however, of its incorporation and change of name it is not possible to issue to the new body any of the sum which had been provided for the Irish National Productivity Committee. The amount being provided for the new body is £145,010 but there are offsetting savings of £145,000 on the provision for the former committee which will no longer, of course, be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish National Productivity Committee, a body representative of employer and labour interests, concerned themselves with the identification of factors which impede the growth of productivity, pinpointing areas where there are significant productivity gaps and in taking steps to bring about improvement in those areas.  In 1971 the committee completed an appraisal of their structure and function following a survey carried out by the European Association of National Productivity Centres.  I have accepted proposals for the restructuring of the <Col N="1243" /> committee which, <i>iner alia,</i> provide for a council composed of six representatives each of the Federated Union of Employers (FUE) and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) with an observer from my Department.  The chairmanship of the organisation will alternate between FUE and ICTU and the term of office will be two years.  I feel satisfied that the new organisation &mdash;the Irish Productivity Centre&mdash;as now constituted, should be more efficient than heretofore since there will be a positive commitment by both the employer and trade union interests to the objective of greater productivity.</P>
    <P>Since 1964, INPC as part of their overall programme to facilitate increased efficiency, have financed the Educational and Advisory Service provided by ICTU.  The rapidly expanding demand for these services has resulted in their absorbing nearly 30 per cent of the INPC grant-in-aid. Consideration is being given to the most appropriate method of financing the service for the future and discussions have taken place on the possible transfer of responsibility for the service to the Department of Labour.  In the meantime the 1972-73 provision is included in the Vote for my Department. I recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of the Irish National Productivity Committee are well known.  They embrace the trade union organisations and the employer organisations.  At this particular time when the national wage agreement <Col N="1244" /> is in jeopardy, or under discussion, whichever way you like to put it, it is only right that there should be such an organisation as the Irish National Productivity Committee to look after these things.  I have before me the report of this association for 1970-71, and the work they have done is quite spectacular. It does not very often hit the headlines but they are doing the essential work of advancing our industry and increasing the number of jobs that will be provided.  As far as we are concerned the voting of this money is merely a formality.  As it is now only 11 o'clock and we are sitting until 12, I could devote some time to talking about this matter.  However, I think it is not relevant to do so, that it would be more appropriate to talk about the Irish National Productivity Committee or the Irish National Productivity Council, as it is now called, on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce.  Therefore this is a Vote that we accede to quietly, quickly and properly.</P>
