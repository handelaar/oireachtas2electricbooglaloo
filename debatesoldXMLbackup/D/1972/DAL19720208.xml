      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The preparation of replies to these Questions would involve the expenditure, by my staff, of an inordinate amount of time which I would consider to be quite unjustified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be in a position to state, of the number of letters he received, what proportion of them would be critical of his policy both on the North and on the economic situation of this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the same kind of question as the original one and I do not think it merits an answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when he proposes to meet each of the heads of State of the six EEC member countries as well as those of the prospective member countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans at present for any such meetings on a bilateral basis.  It is expected that, later this year, there will be a meeting of the heads of State or Government of the present member States of the European Communities and of the four applicant countries.  We have indicated our willingness to take part in such a meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state when he last met the heads of State of each of the six member countries of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy has in mind meetings, for substantive discussions, with heads of Government rather than with heads of States.</P>
      <P>Following the reactivation of our application for membership of the European Communities in May, 1967, I met each of the heads of Government of the member States in that year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the position relative to the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement following on the signing of accession to the EEC by this country and the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement is not affected by the signing by this country and the United Kingdom of the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities, which is subject to ratification.  As regards the position which will obtain from the date of accession to the Communities, it has been agreed in the negotiations that the implementation of the transitional measures should not result in any diminution in the degree of freedom of trade already existing between the <Col N="1189" /> two countries under the Free Trade Area Agreement.  Over the transitional period, we shall move forward from the present system of trade with the United Kingdom to participation with that country in the common market of the Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that, if and when we accede to the EEC, the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement will no longer operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I can give the Deputy an example.  The transitional period in relation to the elimination of tariffs on industrial goods as between us and the United Kingdom under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement operates until 1975.  That will continue, whereas the elimination of tariffs on industrial goods in the EEC will go on until 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I further take it from the Taoiseach's reply that tariffs <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EEC and the United Kingdom will not be the same in that period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Britain will have free access for those industrial goods that are covered by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement by 1975. The other member countries will not, until 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether or not his recent statement regarding the possible change in policy regarding internees, to the effect that they may be tried in court, arose directly from his contact and talks with either Mr. Health or with Mr. Wilson, or both.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether his recent suggestion to the SDLP to consider changing their present policy in relation to internees arose from discussions he had recently with British politicians or as a result of his own policy on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never attempted to suggest <Col N="1190" /> policies to the Social Democratic and Labour Party&mdash;who are perfectly capable of representing accurately the views of their constituents.</P>
    <P>So far as talks are concerned, there is no change in my position&mdash;which is that I have had talks with Mr. Heath and other since internment without trial was introduced in Northern Ireland and will continue to have such talks if I consider them to be useful. Nor has there been any change in the view I have expressed, more than once, that internees against whom there is evidence of breaches of the law may be charged and tried, and the others released.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I appreciate it is some days since I tabled the question, and perhaps the relevancy is not as great as it was then, is it not a fact that the Taoiseach indicated on his arrival back from Brussels that there was seemingly a change in relation to the position of internees and that there might be a situation in which some internees might be tried in the courts and this might, in fact, break the deadlock in which the SDLP have placed themselves?  If this is so surely then it was a suggestion, to some degree, to the SDLP to consider that new situation in the light of their policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that that was the case, but I suggested several times that it ought to be.  I never said the SDLP and the other minority representatives should enter into discussions against their own wishes, but I did suggest that a formula might be found which would encourage them to enter into discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in relation to statements and tape recordings supplied to the Government before internment in the North was introduced and since then, which were made by persons (a) who were detainees and internees and (b) generally involved, he will say (1) when he first received any of these and (2) how many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of material of the nature referred to in the question has been collected in recent months.  It would not be appropriate to <Col N="1191" /> elaborate further on this, or to reveal the sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that a large volume of this type of information has been received by the Government rather than a small volume?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a large volume, yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the Government's policy on ombudsman services as suggested in the Devlin Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to Question No. 1 on the 18th May, 1971, the Public Services Organisation Review Group have recommended that a Commissioner for Administrative Justice should be attached to a Department of the Public Service to deal with the installation and operation of an appellate system in the public service. When the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 1971, is enacted, examination of this recommendation will be among the matters to be dealt with by the proposed new Department of the Public Service provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As stated by the Minister for Finance in reply to the recent debate in Seanad Éireann on the Appropriation Bill, 1971, it is hoped to have the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 1971, enacted during the present Parliamentary session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that the Bill will incorporate an ombudsman service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily, but the Department must first be set up in order to accommodate such an ombudsman if he is appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any indication&mdash;&mdash;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that we should leave it until the debate on that Bill which will be, as I indicated, during the present session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no indication at the moment as to what the Government's policy on it is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we have not indicated that.  Many people seem to think that I am the ombudsman because I get so many appeals from so many sources and organisations. For the sake of self-preservation I should like to see that service set up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach why he has not replied to a telegram sent to him on 15th January concerning a national price freeze.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy has in mind a telegram he addressed to me on the 14th, not the 15th, January last concerning the cost of living and related matters.  I had a reply issued to that communication on the 17th January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I received no reply whatsoever from the Taoiseach.  This indicated to me complete indifference on his part as well as on the Government's part to the soaring cost of living especially where poorer people are concerned.  I got no reply and I would ask the Taoiseach to investigate this matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here a copy of a letter addressed to Dr. John F. O'Connell, TD, 64 Inchicore Road, Dublin 8, dated 17th January, 1972.  I will say that it was a good political gimmick, a good imaginative one by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I resent the statement made by the Taoiseach.  I received no reply.  Otherwise I would not have put down this question.  I am wondering why the Taoiseach calls it a political gimmick.  It was an attempt to bring down the cost of living or to stabilise it.  That is a terrible statement to be made by the Taoiseach.  This matter concerns the people in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, in view of the removal of health services from county councils, he will be prepared to make these services largely a national charge <Col N="1196" /> at least in respect of institutional services and thereby bring the financing of these services more into line with neighbouring administrations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the figures given in reply to a question by the Deputy on 19th January, 1972, show, the cost of the health services is largely a national charge at present.  As regards the Deputy's reference to the proportion of health costs ment from the rates under neighbouring administrations, I would point out that in any such comparison health services must be viewed as part of a general pattern allocating costs as between central and local authorities.  Local authorities in Britain have to meet from the rates about half the cost of some important services&mdash;notably education and police services&mdash;which are almost entirely financed by the Exchequer in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree with me that the proportion of health expenses met from rates in this country is higher than in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and most European countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to make comparisons.  First of all, in a number of countries they have different insurance schemes that enter into the picture of the total cost of health charges.  The Deputy will be interested to know that in 1968-69 out of a total revenue expenditure of local authorities of some £4,000 million the cost of education in England and Wales was £1,450 million and the figure for police and fire was £294 million.  So, you really cannot make comparsions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that when he speaks of educational expenses he is dealing with an entirely different situation in Great Britain?  In this country a very large proportion of educational expenses is borne by individuals and private concerns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether the figure of 26 per cent as contribution from rates towards health charges as stated in reply to a Parliamentary Question of 19th January takes into consideration the central subvention towards the agricultural grant; if he will state the amount of this grant and the percentage contribution from rates to health charges by elimination of the agricultural grant from such computation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage shown related to the estimated amount actually raised by the rates and did not cover moneys contributed by local authorities which they had received by way of Exchequer subvention in the form of agricultural grants.  The percentages for the other areas similarly excluded Exchequer grants to relieve rates.  The estimated total amount of the agricultural grants for the current financial year is £25 million, of which about £9 million is calculated as being attributable to the health services.  I do not understand the last part of the question but the data I have given should enable the Deputy to work out the percentage he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that his claim about giving money through the agricultural grant which is used by two Departments, the <Col N="1198" /> Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, is not quite fair in so far as this money does not help the local authorities? It is merely a help to certain sections of the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not help everyone in the community.  Quite obviously it does not help people in the cities but it helps people in the agricultural community and in the rural areas.  In some counties the cost of the health services is met to a degree of 80 per cent by the combination of the agricultural rate relief and a central subvention from the Government.</P>

      <P>Shannon Airport and Sixmilebridge both lie within Newmarket Dispensary District, which is served by a temporary medical officer at present.

      <P>The development of ethnic traffic has always formed an important part of Bord Fáilte promotional work.  As soon as marketing intelligence showed a reluctance on the part of some British tourists to come to Ireland for holidays this year, the board stepped up considerably their promotional activities among Irish people in Britain and have been concentrating to a much greater extent on expanding the volume of ethnic traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board are at present conducting a special campaign in Britain aimed at people with Irish associations.  The campaign includes advertising on an extensive scale in the ethnic press and visits by marketing groups to Irish organisations.  Some 250 special promotions have been arranged for the period January to March, 1972, and 100 trade representatives from Ireland are participating in them.  In addition, Bord Fáilte are at present drawing up plans for a promotional tour of Britain by a group of staff from the board's head office and the eight regional tourism organisations for the specific purpose of attracting groups and individuals <Col N="1212" /> to spend their holidays in Ireland this year.</P>

Officers of my Department are in daily contact with the State-sponsored bodies and through them and the bodies themselves I keep fully up-to-date on their activities.  In so far as coordination of advertising, marketing and promotional policies is concerned, the State-sponsored bodies are of necessity in close contact with each other to ensure rationalisation and coordination. All these bodies are represented on three joint committees covering publicity, sales and print which integrate the activities in these fields of their parent bodies.

      <P>No decisions or regulations have been adopted by the EEC to date dealing specifically with tourism and I do not expect that membership of the EEC will have any significant effect on our general arrangements for the development and promotion of tourism.  Some consideration has been given by the existing member countries to the question of establishing machinery to deal with tourism matters within EEC.  We will have the right to participate in the working out of any such arrangements.</P>
      <P>Accession to EEC will, of course, strengthen the contacts between this country and the other member States. As a result, interest in Ireland generally, including our holiday attractions, should develop as our involvement in EEC becomes more widely known among the people of the other member countries.  In addition, we will be in a position to avail of any special facilities which the Community may decide to provide in the sphere of tourism. Membership of EEC should therefore present our tourist industry with an opportunity to market their products among a much larger population with whom we will have a special relationship. For these reasons, membership of EEC should lead to increased tourist traffic from Europe and this is already being taken into account in the marketing policies of Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a similar question by the Deputy on 27th October last, I must be prepared to authorise reasonable fares increases if, for reasons beyond the company's control, costs continue to rise faster than revenue.  That is the position at present.  Indeed, due to an unprecedented combination of adverse circumstances the national airline is now faced with a loss situation for the first time over a long period of years. The International Air Transport Association have agreed on fare increases of 10 per cent on the routes between Ireland and London and 7½ per cent on other cross-channel routes for the year commencing 1st April, 1972.  I am at present considering these proposed increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the time might now be appropriate for Aer Lingus, in particular, to look at the idea which has proved to be most successful in the case of CIE?  In other words, instead of increasing charges they should try, as an experiment, to reduce charges. I am convinced this would generate an additional volume of traffic.</P>

      <P>IATA international air fares are calculated in ratios based on two basic currencies, namely, the US dollar and the pound sterling.  The recent devaluation of the US dollar has, therefore, necessitated the determination and application of percentage adjustments to the dollar level of fares and rates in accordance with the needs of various areas.  These adjustments result in minor changes in local selling fares, the change being downwards in the case of non-devalued currencies and upwards in the case of devalued currencies.</P>

      <P>It is an underlying principle of the comprehensive social insurance scheme that only one type of benefit should be paid to a claimant in respect of any period even though more than one of the contingencies for which benefit is provided has arisen in that period in a particular case.  This principle has, however, been departed from to the advantage of widows who claim benefit while ill or unemployed. A widow in receipt of a contributory pension at the full rate who qualifies for disability benefit is paid half the appropriate personal rate of that benefit. If she is in receipt of contributory pension at a reduced rate the half-rate of disability benefit is increased by the amount of the reduction in the pension. If her pension is non-contributory, <Col N="1224" /> the rate of benefit payable depends on the rate of pension and can range from half the appropriate personal rate of benefit to as much as the full rate.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that it was the husband's contributions which provided the pension in the first place and, secondly, if the widow receives only half benefit, could the Parliamentary Secretary prevail on the Minister to introduce an amendment whereby these people would have to pay only half the contribution?  Since they are paying the full insurance contribution and receiving only half benefit does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that this is discrimination against women?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Family income supplement on the British lines would not be a suitable substitute for home assistance.  This supplement is provided only to persons in regular full-time employment on low incomes who have at least one dependent child.  Home assistance is intended to meet the needs of persons with or without dependants who are unable to provide the necessaries of life for themselves or their dependants.  It is payable to persons in employment only in exceptional circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is not correct in saying that the family income is supplemented. This is a form of home assistance to bring the income up to a proper level and this is where the home assistance <Col N="1225" /> scheme does not perform the function for which it was intended.  In Britain, the supplement is designed to bring the level of income to that which would be normal to meet the cost of living and this is what I am asking to have done here.  I am asking for a similar scheme here to replace the home assistance scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the present level of taxation on beer in the Republic and in the EEC; and what sum would fall to revenue under excise duty on beer for 1970-71 if the average EEC taxation on beer were applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish rate of excise duty on beer is £29.167 the standard barrel, which is the equivalent of approximately £21.2 for a barrel of beer of average gravity as sold retail.  Turnover tax is also payable at the rate of 5 per cent on receipts from retail sales.</P>
      <P>The level of taxation on beer in the EEC, by way of excise duty and sales taxation, varies from country to country.  The structures of the duties and the methods of their application are such that their incidence cannot readily be compared with that of the Irish duties.  Broadly, however, it can be said that the application of the average burden of taxation borne by beer in the EEC countries in 1970-71 to the Irish consumption of beer in that year would have resulted in a yield of less than half of that actually obtained.</P>

    <P>* The figures for 1967 and 1968 are for External Monetary Reserves i.e. net external assets of the associated banks and departmental funds plus gold holdings and Ireland's super-gold tranche position in the International Monetary Fund.</P>
    <P>The figures for 1969, 1970 and 1971 are for Official External Reserves as defined by the IMF. These include gold, SDRs, Reserve position in the IMF and foreign exchange (sterling and other currencies).</P>
    <P>&dagger; No firm figure is as yet available for the outturn of the balance of payments on current account in 1971 but taking account of the latest trade figures and estimated trends in net invisible receipts it is likely that there was a deficit of the same order of magnitude as in 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question appears to refer to a statement in a report on the economic situation in the European Community which is worded as follows:</P>
      <P>It would be dangerous for the economies of the member states to continue along the present trajectory of prices and wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus it is particularly desirable that the rise in prices should be gradually reduced to an annual level <Col N="1229" /> of about 3-3.5 per cent in the last quarter of 1972 and that at the same time&mdash;and no later&mdash;wage increases (including additional benefits) should be contained at an annual rate of about 6-7 per cent.</P>
    <P>The statement continues:</P>
    <P>If such results are to be obtained between now and the end of 1972 without damage to the growth rate, the economic and social policy of all the member states must have the support of both workers and employers.</P>
    <P>These are sentiments to which I think every country affected by an inflationary situation could subscribe.  I would point out, however, that the views expressed in the report are guidelines. There is no question of their being incorporated in a regulation which would be binding on the member states.</P>

      <P>The removal of customs posts from the land frontier would not be a predictable consequence of our accession to the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the assumption that the Border has not ceased to exist in the meantime, <Col N="1230" /> existing customs controls would have to be fully maintained during the transitional period of five years when we would be moving towards complete free trade within the Community in industrial and agricultural products.  Also customs control at the frontier would still be essential after the transitional period, for example, for the collection of fiscal duties, enforcement of import or export restrictions imposed for reasons of public policy and for the compilation of trade statistics.  On the assumption mentioned and subject to the reservations I have stated, I believe that after the transitional period it would be possible to relax considerably customs control of cross-Border traffic.</P>

    <Title>Garda Síochána Bill, 1971&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We learned on the last day that this Bill was discussed that the purpose of its introduction is to amend the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925 and amending Acts.  At present the strength of the Garda Síochána is fixed by statute and as the Minister told us when introducing the Bill, the maximum permitted strength is 6,000 gardaí, 1,350 sergeants, 70 station sergeants, 110 inspectors, 157 superintendents, 29 chief superintendents, a surgeon and five of the ranks of Commissioner, Assistant-Commissioner and Deputy-Commissioner.  We were <Col N="1242" /> told that without this Bill it would not be possible for the Minister to increase the force above that strength. The Minister also wishes to create a number of additional inspectors.  However, it is rather strange to note that the force now is considerably below the permitted strength.  In introducing the Bill the Minister told us that with an increase of 1,000 the force will be brought up to 7,560.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that, allowing for wastage, retirement and death, the force now must be less than 7,000.  If my mathematics are correct the present permitted strength is 7,722.  With a reduction in the working hours of the gardaí pursuant to the Conroy recommendations, and with the increase in crime, it is alarming and seems to be unjustifiable that the strength of the Garda is considerably below the permitted level.  We are prepared to facilitate the passage of this Bill through the House because we believe it will give the Minister an opportunity of bringing the strength of the force up to the necessary level.  We do not believe that the proposals outlined by the Minister &mdash;600 for the coming financial year in addition to 400 in the last year&mdash;are sufficient.  We hope that with this machinery at the Minister's disposal, he will be able to use his influence with the people who provide the necessary money, to increase the force by about 2,000.  We will encourage him to do this because we believe, as do most people, that this increase is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides an opportunity for discussing the force and in the time at my disposal the last day, I was pointing out that it seems to be generally accepted in the House and in the country that the morale of the force has never been so low as it is now.  There is discontent in the force at all levels, from ordinary garda level right up to the officer grade.  Since I spoke previously I have noticed that further meetings of the Garda Síochána have been held in the south of Ireland to protest about various matters.  It does not matter very much for the purposes of my argument what these protests were about but the fact that there were protests is a display of an unhealthy atmosphere in the Garda. <Col N="1243" /> Gardaí in Cork have alleged that there were see-saw tactics between the officers and themselves to prevent them attending a meeting held there.  They alleged that they were held on duty unnecessarily, to prevent them attending. Regardless of what are the complaints, the fact is that there are complaints and that there is a low morale throughout the force.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to put on record, although I do not propose to do so at any great length, that the major cause of the complaints, is interference by the Minister and, more particularly, by the Minister's Department, in the workings of the Garda Síochána.  I pointed this out to some extent on the last occasion.  It would be healthy if the day-to-day workings of the Garda Síochána were left to the officers of the Garda Síochána.  There is general dissatisfaction within the force because of interference by the Minister, by his predecessors and by officers of his Department with the day-to-day workings of the Garda Síochána.  There is interference in respect of promotion and also in respect of expenditure, petty and otherwise.</P>
    <P>Of course this interference does not take the form of written demand, written requests or written direction, rather it takes the form of niggling telephone calls to the effect that the Minister will wish such and such to be done, or asking whether so-and-so would not consider that such-and-such would be a better approach.  It is very seldom that there is any direct demand made or direction given but if people on the promotion list and those at headquarters wish to have a happy life, they believe they must fall in line with these requests.  There may have been some improvement since the Minister arrived on the scene.  I appeal to him to take a strong stand on this and to ensure that there is the minimum of intervention at departmental level with the force.  He should see that there is no unnecessary interference with them. I put my request to the Minister in that way.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the head of the force.  I said previously that I believe it is fundamentally unsound to appoint men to the position <Col N="1244" /> of Commissioner with one or two or three years to run.  That is a hard thing to have to say.  It may sound unkind.  It may be said that it is unkind to say to a man who has served well in the force that he should not be appointed Commissioner just because he did not reach the penultimate rung on the ladder until he was 62 or 63 years of age, but it is a hard old life and we must face up to realities.</P>
    <P>It is unsound that a man should be appointed Commissioner when he has only two or three years to run.  That seems to have been the policy in the force for the last number of years.  The result is that when a man thinks he has a chance of being appointed he is certain to fall in line with ministerial and Governmental wishes.  When he is appointed the same thing applies because, in a few cases recently, he has to rely on the generosity of the Government to extend his years of service to qualify for full pension.  It is hard to stand over that.  It is not likely that we will get the best results from a Commissioner who finds himself in that position.</P>
    <P>There should be some sort of a top level board within the force which would recommend to the Government and to the Minister a suitable man from within the force.  There are precedents for that in other walks of life. It would be a good thing if high-ranking officers, for example, the Commissioner Board, or a certain number of superintendents, were to make recommendations to the Minister with regard to the Commissioner. It would be a deplorable state of affairs if we again reached the stage where we had to go outside the force for a Commissioner.  The Commissioner should come from within the force and should come up through the ranks.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take steps to ensure that young men of ability are given the opportunity to prove themselves fit for the position of Commissioner if the necessity for going outside the force for the Commissioner is to be avoided.  It is very much in the interests of the force that that should be avoided.  The way to avoid it is <Col N="1245" /> to have a system of spotting comparatively young men of ability and giving them responsibility fairly early in their career.  There can be only one Commissioner at a time and there can only be a Commissioner Board of five. It is too late to start thinking about Commissioner material when somebody has just slogged up the ladder and got to a certain stage.  There should be some machinery for spotting young men of exceptional ability in the force and giving them positions of extra responsibility at a comparatively young age.  It might be that that responsibility would go to their heads but that would be their bad luck.  They would have fallen down and they would be passed over.</P>
    <P>I dealt with promotion and I do not want to labour it now beyond saying that promotion should be strictly and absolutely on merit.  On the last occasion I invited the Minister to publish the recommendations from the Officer Board.  As we know there is a system whereby the Commissioner Board consisting of the Commissioner, his two deputies and his two assistants, make recommendations to the Minister with regard to the necessary promotions in the following 12 months from the position of inspector to superintendent and from superintendent to chief superintendent.  I put it to the Minister that that list should be published.  The Minister said he did not think it should be published because there are more people on it than are likely to be promoted and it might be tough luck on them.</P>
    <P>I believe that, in the interests of restoring confidence in the force, the list should be published within the force, and never departed from.  The Minister told me on the last occasion that he could stand over the fact that it was strictly adhered to during the 12 months since he took office.  He generously offered to let me see the list for last year.  I accept the Minister's word &mdash;I have no alternative; I am not saying that in any begrudging way&mdash;that he adhered strictly to the recommendations and I am glad he did.  That has not been the case in the past, but it should be the case in the future.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the morale of the <Col N="1246" /> force is low at the moment and I trust the Minister recognises that.  He is a practical man and I do not think he could fail to recognise it from reading the newspapers and from listening to members of the force.  He is in a better position than anybody else to hear the complaints and to know the trends. Protest meetings have been held already at officer level.  Notwithstanding the Conroy Report we had lightening strikes last year and we had protest meetings&mdash;and I am now talking about the south of Ireland.  The alarming thing is that although the lot of the serving garda has been improved immensely after the Conroy Report&mdash; their hours are shorter; their pay is better; they are not obliged to live in barracks; they have more time off&mdash; the dissatisfacation is there.</P>
    <P>The monetary recommendations of the Conroy Report have been implemented but the more fundamental recommendations, including the very last recommendation in the report that the whole relationship between the force and the Department should be looked at and dealt with, have not been implemented.  I leave it to the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the position of recruits I am glad the Minister has said that he is waiving the educational examination in respect of those who have passed the leaving certificate examination with a certain standard.  I hope he will introduce a minimum educational standard for the force because at the moment there is no such standard. There is a qualifying examination which carries no minimum standard.</P>
    <P>I have thought for a long time that it is very doubtful whether four months training at Templemore is adequate to equip a young garda for the complicated and sophisticated duties expected from him immediately he goes on the beat.  It is too short a time.  At one time there was a refresher course after two years before the recruit was established.  I think there is one refresher course subsequent to training but the one to which I refer does not now exist.  I think it should be there.  I find it hard to understand how a recruit raw from school or from the country and brought to <Col N="1247" /> Templemore is to be instructed in all the things in which he should be instructed and acquire all the knowledge he must have in four months.  I cannot understand how that can be done and I suggest a longer training period should be given before a recruit is established.</P>
    <P>A policeman's career requires a vocation; he must be temperamentally suited to deal with all sorts of people, not at their best but at their worst. Not everybody is temperamentally suited for this sort of life.  In general, we have been extremely lucky in the force we have but you come across the occasional member of the force who is temperamentally unsuited for his work and, as in other cases, it is the one person who through no fault of his own is temperamentally unsuitable for the job, or a misfit in other words, who gives the force a bad name. It is not his fault; he should not be in the force but in some other occupation. We never hear much of the 90 or 95 per cent of the force who are perfectly suited for their job and do their work politely and give the best of service but you do hear of the odd member who is accepted in the force but it is not suitable for it and who gets in trouble with the general public and gives the whole force a bad name.</P>
    <P>In addition to the educational examination there is an interview which at present is conducted probably by an elderly superintendent or chief superintendent who came up through the ranks 20, 25 or 30 years ago.  I believe this minimum type of interview does not establish very much, if anything, and I recommend that these interviews should be conducted by professional persons.  We should have a trained psychologist to interview recruits, assess them and decide whether they are suited for the complicated and delicate work required of them later on.  There are several precedents for this.  On the previous occasion I mentioned the church.  I understand religious orders have trained psychologists to discuss matters with young men before they are accepted and this also happens in many other walks of life.  I recommend strongly to the Minister that he should <Col N="1248" /> have a board of psychologists or whatever number is required to interview recruits, assess them and report on them.  This is really in the interests of the candidates as well as of the general public because I cannot visualise anybody more unhappy than a man who finds himself in the Garda but it is temperamentally unsuited to the work and is getting into trouble with the public and with his superiors and his life is miserable.  He makes everybody else's life miserable also.</P>
    <P>In regard to Templemore, I suggest that the sort of instruction that could be given should not be detailed instruction&mdash;I do not know how it could be&mdash;in the various statutes these trainees will have to interpret.  There would not be time for it.  I suggest they should get a broad knowledge of the fundamentals of the law.  I am told we are not equipped very well in this country in regard to technical and scientific methods of detection but it is essential that the recruits at Templemore should be instructed on how such technical and scientific aids as are available, work, so that when they go to the scene of a crime they will know what to look for, what could be tested by scientific aids or technical devices.  I gather that matter is not very well covered at present in Templemore.</P>
    <P>There should be a refresher course at the end of two years such as existed previously but does not now exist. There was another very useful class which applied not only to recruits but which was a daily occurrence in every Garda station, a police duty class.  It was held for an hour in the mornings when the barrack party reported for work.  The sergeant gave them instruction on some aspect of police duties, some new circular that was issued or some new law that had been introduced. As well as that they had a general short discussion on crime in the locality.  I am told these police duty course held every morning were invaluable. They have been dropped, maybe because it would be necessary to pay the members of the force for that hour that was spent on them.  I would recommend to the Minister that with the enlarged force which he will now have he should consider re-introducing them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> There are complaints at all levels of the force, and there are particular complaints at district officer level.  That is bad, because if these district officers, superintendents and inspectors believe they are not getting a fair crack of the whip things will not work out well.  I have told the Minister that meetings are being held by these officers throughout the country.  I think it is with his approval, but, perhaps, his approval is not now necessary; anyway they are being held, and the threats are that if the situation is not improved these men will work according to rule.  That is further evidence of the unhealthy atmosphere in the Garda Síochána.  Several years ago it would have been unheard of that any member of officer status would work to rule.</P>
    <P>There are reasons for this.  Work has been piled on to these men.  Criminal activities of a subversive nature are commonplace all over the country. There has been a considerable strain on the Garda Síochána in the last number of years and there will continue to be a strain, in the foreseeable future, in general, but particularly on the district officers.  Their work involves continual checking, reporting and so on.  Fatal accidents are becoming common.  Road traffic accidents ending in fatalities impose a considerable amount of work on the district officers carrying out investigations, compiling files, reporting to the State Solicitor right up to the Attorney General, briefing the State Solicitor,<i>et cetera</i>.  In recent times further work has been passed on to these officers.  They are not required to pay witneses' expenses in all courts, in the District Court, Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court. They are responsible for paying all gardaí travelling expenses and subsistence allowances.  The system of medical attendance on the garda has now been changed.  The gardaí are rightly entitled to a free choice of doctor. Again, these doctors are paid when they send in their bills instead of annually, and they are paid by the local officers.  There are many other smaller accounts that have to be paid.</P>
    <P>These men complain that with all <Col N="1250" /> this increase in work there has been no increase in staff at the district offices.  The staff has been changed, perhaps, in some offices.  Members of the force who were acting as clerks have been released and been replaced by lady clerks.  However, it is not a qualification for these lady clerks that they should know shorthand.  That means that the officer in charge has to dictate or write out in long hand letters that he wants typed.  If that is true, it is an appalling waste of time.  The answer might be that shorthand is not now as important as it used to be with the advent of dictating machines, but then I am told there are no dictating machines provided.  It is a feature of Garda life now that reports in connection with all accidents which have been investigated have to be furnished to solicitors and other interested parties. Surely it is a waste of time hammering these things out in this stage when they could be done on copying machines in a very short time.  These machines can be hired from many firms.  It might sound ridiculous but there are no adding machines.  With all the accounts that have to be paid now an adding machine would be essential equipment.</P>
    <P>The force should move with the times.  If solicitors and other people were not to provide themselves with dictating machines and copying machines they would not be running their offices economically and giving a proper service to their clients.  These offices should be brought up-to-date and the district offices should be provided with adequate staff or equipment to discharge the onerous duties that have recently been passed on to them.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána is grossly under strength.  The Conroy Report did a good job, by and large, because it recognised that we are living in the seventies and that members of the force were not going to put up with the sort of treatment they got in the twenties.  As the lot of the gardaí improved the manpower available was reduced.  Pre-Conroy a garda worked a minimum of 48 hours which I do not think included meals.  He now works a minimum of 42 hours, excluding meals which, in effect, is about 37 hours.  It follows from those figures <Col N="1251" /> that the improvement in the working week has reduced substantially&mdash;some say 25 per cent and others say 12 per cent&mdash;the man hours available for police duties and there has been no increase in the force since Conroy.</P>
    <P>The Minister recruited 400 this year but that is simply a flea bite.  Apart from a reduction in working hours duties have increased and the crime rate has gone up.  Before the Minister introduced this Bill the procedure was to recruit 200 men in 1972 and 200 men in 1973.  Those figures have now been increased.  There were 400 taken in last year and I believe 600 are to be taken in this year.  I do not think that is enough when you provide for retirements and natural wastage.  I believe a considerable number of men came into the force in 1942 and 1943 and that means there will be substantial retirements in 1972 and 1973.  The proposal to increase the force by 1,000 does not seem to mean very much.</P>
    <P>The present strength of the force is about 6,800 men.  There should be, in accordance with Conroy, 1,625 of these men on rest each day.  There are about 500 barrack orderlies and about 300 clerks.  That leaves something like 4,375.  There should be about 400 men on annual leave each day which reduces the force to about 4,000.  When you allow for men who are off ill you get down to under 4,000.  The gardaí in the city operate on three 8-hour shifts but that does not apply to some parts of the country.  It means, however, that there is between 1,300 and something over 2,000 men available for duty at any one time in city and country.  We must be a very peaceful, law-abiding State if that force is able to deal with it.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that the crime rate has increased and the detection rate has declined.  I believe the figures I have given are substantially accurate, but even allowing for inaccuracies one way or another it seems that the available force to police the country at any one time, in Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Waterford and the Border from one end to the other, is grossly inadequate. We are living in an age when crimes of violence are on the increase and we <Col N="1252" /> should be doing something about it. When the Commissioners' next report comes out it will show that there is a fall in the detection rate of up to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>This, as well as the interference from departmental level which I complained about, is leading to a breakdown in morale in the force because the members of the force feel they are not giving the service they should be giving to the public and the public believe they are not getting the service they are entitled to.  There is loss of respect for the force among the public and there is frustration within the force.  The men feel there is nothing they can do.  They fill in their time as best they can.</P>
    <P>I believe, mechanisation or no mechanisation, there is no substitute for the man on the beat.  This year on a Sunday afternoon my daughter's car &mdash;it was a small one&mdash;was parked in Grafton Street and was removed.  There were three cases in the car which could be seen by anybody passing by.  The car was recovered but the suitcases were missing, the mats from the floor and also the covers from the seats.  If a couple of gardaí were on patrol in Grafton Street that kind of thing would not happen very often.  I am not building my whole case for the men on the beat on this particular incident.  I believe that the city is not properly patrolled.</P>
    <P>It is foolish to close down Garda stations.  A few years ago I would have said that you would have a more efficient force if you closed down barracks and policed the country by motor car and motor cycle patrols.  I have completely changed my mind in that respect.  I believe that the policy is wrong.  Indeed, in times of stress we see that barracks in danger spots are being reopened.  Barracks which were closed for years in Monaghan and Cavan are being reopened, and it is right to reopen them.  The answer may be that there are exceptional circumstances there at the moment but it proves that the powers that be believe people living in the locality are in a better position to get information than people who drive in from ten, 20 or 30 miles away.  That is what the reopening <Col N="1253" /> of these Garda barracks means.</P>
    <P>It means that garda í living on the spot, mingling with the people, get the confidence of the people and are in a much better position to get information and to do the job than a few people driving in in a squad car and driving away again.  Any of us who knows the ordinary country man appreciates that he is suspicious by nature and that he is particularly suspicious of strangers.  To a country man everybody is a stranger, unless he is on talking terms or, indeed, on drinking terms with him.  Therefore, the system of closing down Garda barracks and replacing them with squad cars and motor cycle patrols does not work. Even if there is only one garda with a sergeant in each of those stations it would be worth maintaining them, from the point of view of detecting subversive activities and crimes of violence and larceny.  It is not enough to try to police the country in a general sort of way.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the depleted force and to the fact that it is not being kept up to strength.  Referring to Conroy, I spoke about the amount of work being put on to district officers.  In addition, the ordinary rank and file of the Garda are under a strain as well.  They are expected to guard banks in every town in Ireland, to guard post offices, to guard the houses of landed gentry, where there are landed gentry, to guard the houses of English people residing in this country and to guard public buildings. They are expected to guard gelignite wherever it is stored.  In relation to that, I wonder why gelignite is allowed to be stored indiscriminately in isolated quarries here and there.  I am glad to see the Minister reached as I would have done and has decided to take steps to have gelignite collected and brought to be stored in properly secured buildings where it can be adequately protected.  To me the mystery is that somebody did not think of this before the recent robberies took place.</P>
    <P>These are the sort of things the gardaí are expected to do at the <Col N="1254" /> present time.  As well, they are expected to act as school attendance officers. One young garda told me he is a school attendance officer in a fairly built-up area and that he has paid only one visit since the schools reopened last September because he had not the time.  He is expected to do a hundred other things as well.  There are areas where the gardaí are on top of their heads.  Some officer in Dublin sends down a circular to know why the transport laws are not being enforced.  Everybody knows that if we were to enforce the transport laws we would be obliged to have a squad of gardaí in every station in the country and to listen in in public houses as well to find out what was going on.</P>
    <P>My estimate is that we would need an additional 2,000 men and it is no use saying we cannot afford it.  There are some things you cannot afford not to do and this is one of the things you cannot economise on.  Apart altogether from the circumstances peculiar to the troubles in Northern Ireland which are overspilling here, we are living in an age when violence, protests and disrespect for law and order are on the increase.  It is no use burying our heads in the sand and saying these things will not come here.  They have come here.</P>
    <P>Planning and research were recommended in the Conroy Report and at paragraph 1193 it is recommended:</P>
    <P>We are of opinion that a research and planning unit should be established. The functions of this unit should be, <i>inter alia,</i> to plan police methods, to develop new equipment such as communication facilities, to study the design, use and standardisation of vehicles and office equipment, to study new techniques so as to enable the gardaí to deal promptly and effectively with changes in the pattern of crime and behaviour of criminals.  This unit would require to be staffed adequately by Garda officers and by civilians trained in technical and management techniques.  There is scope to investigate and advise on the unit beat policing system which is in use in Britain.</P>
    <P>Surely to goodness that is a refreshing <Col N="1255" /> paragraph but it is not one that would not drawn on all of us.  It recommends, in ordinary language, that the force needs to be modernised.  We need to plan for the future and to see what sort of police force we want for the future and what the police should be doing in the future, how they should be equipped and trained.</P>
    <P>A unit has been set up pursuant to this recommendation but it is part of the Commissioner's office.  Apart from two civil servants, one of them, of course, from the Department of Finance, there do not appear to be any outside civilians as suggested.  On this matter I would go further than the report and say that although we should have our own force exclusively to meet our own requirements, this unit should have on it some people from abroad who have had experience of the sort of crime, the sort of activities that are developing here.  I am told the unit which has been set up is part of the Commissioner's office and does not contain the type of experts suggested in the Conroy recommendation. It is an invaluable thing.  If paragraph 1193, which calls for the establishment of a research and planning unit, and paragraph 1266 of the Conroy Report which calls for an examination to be carried out by appropriately qualified people into the role, organisation and personnel policy of the force and in particular its relationship with the Department of Justice, if these two were implemented quickly, even at considerable cost, they would in my opinion do a lot to transform the Garda, to modernise it, to restore morale and confidence and to bring about efficiency.</P>
    <P>To get efficiency there must be sufficient numbers in the force.  I believe that the money voted to the Garda Síochána in this House should be largely under the control of the Garda Síochána, should be, with accountants, of course, checking in the normal way, at the discretion of the experienced officers of the force and should not be the subject of niggling, day-to-day queries from the Department.</P>
    <P>If I were to speak in detail about <Col N="1256" /> office accommodation we would be here for a considerable time.  Office accommodation in Dublin Castle seems to be quite inadequate.  The headquarters of the fraud squad, the detection unit, is in a pre-fab.  It is a new pre-fab and a vast improvement on where it was before, but the gardaí see the site which has been cleared there and which is now to be used to build a fine office block for the more fortunate State servants, the civil servants.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I know it takes money to do all these things.  But communications need to be brought up to date.  I am told that a multi-channel radio for cars and <i>vice versa</i> is not available.  The result is an inefficient system.  The centre of communications in Dublin city is housed in a building which I am told is in imminent danger of collapse.  It is propped up by planks and boulders in Dublin Castle.  It is 100 years old.  As a result of this sort of treatment, the gardaí feel that they are the poor relations of the State services.  Telephone lines in this communications centre are crammed.  There are four gardaí dealing with all the incoming and outgoing calls.  The result is that there are undue delays.  There are only four men there because they have not got the equipment or the accommodation for any more.  That should go on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this debate opened we had the burning of the British Embassy.  I dealt with that in the debate on Northern Ireland last week.  I want to join with the Minister in congratulating the gardaí who were there, equipped as they were and trained as they were, for doing the best they could in dreadful circumstances.  I think what we saw at the embassy shows that we will have to think about training and equipping the gardaí who are stationed in the cities, particularly in Dublin, to deal with riots and crowd control.  I respectfully suggest that I am developing a point.  The Bill we are dealing with suggests that the force should be increased substantially and I am suggesting to the Minister that if the force is <Col N="1257" /> to be increased substantially it should be given all training and equipment necessary.  I shall not go into any detail but I suggest that the gardaí who are to be recruited under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, and who are to be stationed in the city of Dublin should get special training in crowd control and in dealing with rioting because this is a thing we will have to live with.  People now seem to want to march apart altogether from the peculiar, unfortunate circumstances bedevilling this country at present.  It seems to be the age of marching all over the world and we will have to face up to that and live with it whether we like it or not.  We will have to recruit gardaí and train those who are to be stationed in Dublin and other big cities in this type of activity.</P>
    <P>It was shocking to see on television the gardaí, supposed to be able to do something about a riot, about a burning building, wearing ordinary headgear, without helmets.  Surely gardaí who are called out on an emergency like this should be provided with helmets?  Of course, this is new to us. Did we ever hear of crash barriers? Should the Garda force not have at their disposal crash barriers to deal with a situation like this?  If they had them, and if it was thought desirable to divert people in one direction or another would these movable crash barriers not be a considerable help? The gardaí did their best in the terribly trying circumstances.  Out of every evil comes some good.  This was a stupid performance in my opinion because it did no good and every harm.  It simply resulted in taking the spotlight off Derry and directing it on to Merrion Square.  However, if this brought home to us that we will have to be prepared for this sort of thing in the future, whether it is subversive activity, a crowd of university students running amok, or people at a football match gone crazy, and be in a position to deal properly with it, then it will have some good results.  We will have to be able to deal with this sort of thing; we are not equipped to deal with it at the moment.</P>
    <P>I understand there is an outstanding claim for an increase of 10 per cent <Col N="1258" /> and that this is being put on the long finger.  Civil servants in general have been paid this increase of, if they have not been paid it, it has certainly been sanctioned.  Local government employees have got it.  Employees of some semi-State bodies have got it.  Why have the Garda Síochána not got it? This is the sort of thing that makes the force believe that they are the poor relation in the State services.  That is not good.  It is not good enough to argue that they did well under Conroy and that that will suffice for a long time.  Conroy merely acknowledged that the force had been grossly underpaid for years and recommended that it should be brought up to a certain standard.  This outstanding claim should be paid.</P>
    <P>I make no apologies for having taken up some time on this Bill and for having availed of the opportunity to debate the Garda Síochána in general.  I believe that was in order. I hope the Minister will take the political paws of his Department off the Garda Síochána.  I hope he will recognise it as an independent police force operating under its own officers, officers who, through their merit, and merit alone, rise to the top of the profession. I hope that he will provide district offices with the equipment and personnel necessary to do the work in these offices.  I hope he will increase the strength of the force more than he has done.  I hope he will acknowledge that the closing down of barracks was unwise and guarantee that these barracks will be reopened.  There was a time when I thought that those who pleaded for the retention of barracks did so because of prestiage.  It is more than that.  Such barracks are an essential part of a police force.  I hope there will be sufficient members to carry out the various duties.  Above all, I hope there will be a reasonable system of patrolling in both cities and towns.  If the Minister implements these suggestions he will have the support of this House in voting the moneys necessary to do all these things.  Any outstanding claims for increases in salaries, which have been recognised and paid to other State servants, should be recognised and <Col N="1259" /> paid to the Garda Síochána immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána is welcome.  I doubt if the Minister's figure will be sufficient in view of the retirement rate and the drop-out rate from the force.  Indeed, the Minister might give us some information about the retirement rate and the drop-out rate in these days when there is so much discontent in the force.  There is massive discontent. That has been evidenced by the strikes, the threatened strikes and the protest meetings.  On 26th January at column 630 of volume 258 of the Official Report, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>It is inevitable, with such a large force, that there will be individuals, and, perhaps, groups, who are dissatisfied from time to time though I think it is somewhat unfortunate that the views of these members are regularly given such wide publicity.</P>
      <P>It is no credit to the Minister to make this statement because, where there is room for discontent and people are discontented, they have a right to give expression to that discontent and to voice their grievances.  This is a right which must be guaranteed to them. Will we tolerate a rigid system in which members of the Garda Síochána are prevented from expressing their views or airing their grievances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is cynicism in the force because of interference with the due process of the law.  No one here will deny that there is interference.  We have seen it.  We have heard about it.  We know that it is there.  If one has sufficient political influence one can by-pass the due process of the law.  A garda said to me on one occasion: &ldquo;As I was taking the man's number he was taking mine and, when I went back to the station, I found he had been ahead of me.&rdquo;  This sort of thing is demoralising. We need an independent force, free of political influence and political interference.  Those things which give rise to discontent should be removed.  It is not due to salaries or the payment of overtime; it is due to a lowered morale because the gardaí are <Col N="1260" /> not able to cope with the problems facing them.</P>
    <P>Vandalism is rife.  The stealing of cars and the destruction of property go unchecked.  The gardaí are unable to cope.  People are afraid to leave their homes because of the destruction of property.  Crimes are reported daily but the force is unable to cope.  This has been brought to the attention of the Department of Justice time and time again.  It has been raised here in this House with the present Minister and with his predecessors.  The situation continued to be ignored.  The Minister is being forced now to do something and I regard what he is doing as totally inadequate.  It is a common experience, having got in touch with a Garda station, to be told that they have no car to send to the scene of the crime, but they will phone another station and ask that station to send a car.  Conditions like this can only lead to frustration.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the incidence of crime is higher, but that is only natural; the situation is the same in other countries.  He forgets this is a small island with a small population and the detection rate here should be very much higher than it is in the countries to which he referred.  This is a very small community and a detection rate of 80 per cent or 90 per cent should be possible instead of the low rate mentioned.</P>
    <P>There should be completed rethinking in regard to the training of gardaí and new standards should be set for detection.  I would envisage special university courses in scientific detection for gardaí so that they could take out special diplomas.  Perhaps, we should send a number of gardaí abroad to study scientific detection and teach it here when they return so that these methods could be used here. When stolen cars are recovered then they could be properly fingerprinted instead of having the gardaí saying: &ldquo;You are lucky to get it back.  We can do nothing about it.&rdquo;  This is not good enough.  We should be able to get fingerprinting done immediately so that this terrible problem of car stealing would be curbed as well as other acts of violence, vandalism and <Col N="1261" /> blackguardism in the cities in particular.</P>
    <P>I should like an independent national Garda authority established. It would be a tremendous thing to have such an authority completely free of the Department of Justice.  It would comprise men who would lay down policy for the Garda so that we would have a force of which we could be proud and which would ensure peace and protection for individuals and the community with proper conditions generally and healthy respect for the law.</P>
    <P>I should like to see gardaí become education officers in schools and communities and become involved with communities so that there would be a garda in the community centre involved in community affairs.  In this way, gardaí could participate in the life of the community, earn respect for themselves and enhance their prestige.  Gardaí have been doing this in a personal capacity and have been involving themselves in youth clubs. This should be fostered so that the gardaí would be seen as leaders in the community and in this way we might change the whole public outlook on the gardaí.  Even underprivileged persons growing up in certain areas might then see the gardaí not as enemies but as friends in the community.  This is where rethinking is required and where a national Garda authority is urgently needed to spell out a policy which the gardaí have not got at present.</P>
    <P>I should like to see proper recreational facilities in the Garda stations so that they could have billiards and table tennis and such things to enable them to enjoy their free time.  This is very important.  Proper facilities should be provided for dealing with complaints and crime so that we would have a statistical analysis of the incidence of crime in a particular area. This could easily be done if the requisite help were provided for the Garda.  If the clerical facilities were streamlined and means provided for noting and processing crime the statistics could be filtered back efficiently to a central office so that we would <Col N="1262" /> know the incidence of crime and complaints at a particular time in a particular area.  We should be constantly engaged in this type of research in the Garda stations.  Despite appeals from Members of the House to the Minister the fact that gardaí have to do clerical work for which they were never trained was ignored for too long.  This meant that they were tied up so much that they were unable to carry out their proper functions.  Unfortunately, they are still engaged in traffic work. I saw this this morning when I found instances of gardaí substituting for traffic at intersections.  We could easily install traffic lights and relieve them of this terrible burden.  That is not the work for which they were trained.  We are slowly changing over but it is deplorable that the position should be as it is when almost five years ago approval was given for traffic lights along the quays.  The lights are not yet there; they are being put up at present but in many other areas gardaí are still employed on traffic duties where they should not be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is not the duty of the gardaí to put up traffic lights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am saying.  It is not their duty but we should have a national Garda authority to ensure that this work was done and that the gardaí did not have to carry out these duties.  Five years ago the gardaí recommended that this should be done but they were not heeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think it wrong that gardaí should be posted at banks to protect the banks' money.  We should compel the banks to employ men to guard the banks and it should not be the duty of the gardaí.  It is not really a duty of the gardaí because if that were so any householder could demand a garda on duty outside his door saying that he has money in the house and that there is a danger that he would be robbed. If the banks have the right, any citizen could demand the same right.  We should see that gardaí are not on duty just to protect banks.  In other countries banks employ their own staff for this purpose and we should insist <Col N="1263" /> that that be done here also.</P>
    <P>In view of the discontent and frustration of the gardaí in regard to the promotion which has been highlighted here without my adverting to it, I think that from the time a garda joins the force there should be some means of continuously assessing his progress in his career.  This assessment should be done by persons properly trained for the purpose and should be completely divorced from any political influence, patronage or interference.  The garda would then know his work in the force was being recognised and that promotion would accordingly follow.  This is vital if the morale of the force is to be improved.  This is not being done at present; the history has not been good; it has been deplorable and we must let it be seen that promotion is on merit alone.  It may now take place on merit but because of the record of the past in regard to political influence and interference it must now be seen that promotion is strictly on merit alone. That can only be done by a process of continuous assessment of the garda's progress in the force.  I would agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick in what he said about refresher courses for the gardaí.  Such courses are vital and the men should be allowed time off to attend them.  If necessary, members of the force should be sent abroad to learn new methods.</P>
    <P>It might help to improve the morale of the gardaí and to give them extra pride in their force if the Garda Band were restored.  This band was symbolic of a great force.  The cost of restoring it would not be exorbitant.  It was a Minister with a petty mind who disbanded it.  It was disgraceful that he should have done so.</P>
    <P>As is the case with any profession, the Garda Síochána contain a number of people who are not suitable for the force.  There should be some means of determining the suitability of a person for this work.  Perhaps, after a year's training or even after he had spent a few years in the force, a man's suitability in relation to temperament, and so on, could be put to the test.  Undoubtedly, there are a few sadists within the force and these people <Col N="1264" /> tarnish the good name of the Garda Síochána.  Protests and complaints made in respect of individual members of the force should be examined.  Perhaps, there could be people such as psychologists available to investigate this aspect so that persons who are not suitable might be encouraged to leave the force or at least that they would be put in a position in which they would not be dealing directly with offenders.  This matter should be considered carefully.  Very often I receive complaints and although all of these are not genuine there have been some cases in which gardaí have been brutal, unjust and guilty of ill-treatment of offenders.  I am aware of the difficult task involved in dealing with offences and in so far as complaints are concerned one would need to hear both sides of the story.  In any case, all complaints should be investigated.</P>
    <P>It has appeared in the newspapers that there is a possibility of the Garda setting up their own trade union but it was pointed out that this would be contrary to Garda regulations.  The Chair may think that I am deviating from the debate at this stage but I crave his indulgence and hope that he will permit me to refer to the importance of this question.  If we are to ensure that there will not be massive defections from the force we must realise that the Garda, like any other body, must have their own trade union.  This is a matter, too, that I should like the Minister to consider and approve.  A Garda trade union might be the means of ending the discontent within the force.  There is no point in taking in another 600 men if, say, 750 are to leave the force.  The force must be maintained at the necessary level.</P>
    <P>Consideration might be given too to the different grades within the force. Perhaps, extra grades might be considered such as the creation of a grade between that of garda and sergeant or between that of sergeant and inspector. The different stages of promotion might be considered.  All these aspects could be studied by a national Garda authority.  In this way men of the necessary ability who work diligently would be promoted as appropriate.  An <Col N="1265" /> independent national garda authority would examine those aspects of the Garda that are vital to that force.  If we did not have a proper Garda we would all be justified in expressing anxiety because it is only possible to have real security if there is also a strong Garda, a force that would win the respect of the people and that would become involved with communities, a force that would carry out educational programmes in respect of such subjects as civics.  We know that wonderful work is being done in this respect by the Garda drug squad but I would hope that this aspect of the work of the force would be improved and extended.  The television programme which features the gardaí is well worthwhile and is helping to win prestige for the force and to enhance their reputation with the people generally. When we compare our force with the force in Northern Ireland we can be very proud of the way in which our gardaí have behaved at various times in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The recent attacks on the Garda must be deplored.  It is a shocking state of affairs when people are prepared to attack members of the force while they are trying to maintain law and order without the use of force.  The recent attack on them by thugs was disgraceful and we would not be acting in our capacity as public representatives if we did not denounce that deplorable conduct.</P>
    <P>It would be fitting to have a special task force within the Garda who were trained to deal with riots.  I would agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick on this matter.  This special force would be trained in riot control so that they could carry out this work without creating animosity among the people.  This is a problem which, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, will have to be faced in the furture.  Marches, protests and parades will be a feature of our life for a long time to come.  It is a problem with which we must be able to cope while at the same time avoiding the creation of riot situations.  Only men trained properly and having the necessary equipment would be capable of dealing with such problems.  In the controlling of crowds, the gardaí must <Col N="1266" /> show forbearance.  The necessary training could be carried out under the control of a national Garda authority.</P>
    <P>While many people may say that the present Minister makes one bristle, I would pay tribute to him in so far as he is conscientious and has tried very hard to apply himself diligently to his work. He is capable of earning for himself great respect and credit and, perhaps, of opening up a whole new way of thinking on the question of improving the Garda.  If he applies himself to the suggestions that I and other Deputies have made, there might well be a restoration of morale within the force.</P>
    <P>It is not the ordinary citizens who fear the gardaí.  It is the underprivileged in our community, those who live in ghettos.  Those are the people who have resentment, even though that resentment is completely unwarranted.  Garda numbers should be increased in those areas, and if they are to undertake the work I have suggested they might win these people around to obeying the law in the knowledge that the gardaí are there not as their enemies but as their friends.  Educational programmes in the schools would enable the gardaí to win the respect they deserve.  If the Minister would ensure that the Garda is completely free of political influence or interference he would be doing a tremendous job and would earn the respect of the public and of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity of paying a tribute to the Garda and also of helping to remove any grievances they have.  We shall never have the perfect force any more than the perfect society but we must deal with any legitimate grievances the Garda may have if we are to be easy in our own consciences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before proceeding I should like to question whether ban-ghardaí are included in the Bill.  I do not see any mention of them, but if they are, then I suppose that in the foreseeable future we can look forward to seeing a female Commissioner of the Garda.  I do not say that in support of women's lib.  but in consideration of the fact that it is only in the past ten or 12 years we <Col N="1267" /> have had a force of women police, and I take this opportunity of complimenting them on the work they have done since they were recruited.  However, I have always been very critical of certain work they were given to do which was never envisaged by those of us who advocated the recruitment of banghardaí. In the early days, for instance, I saw a ban-gharda directing traffic which to my mind was inappropriate Deputy O'Connell mentioned that we should have more traffic lights, which I suppose is a very good idea.  Nevertheless, I do not think you can replace, by artificial means, the garda in the city, the dedicated man who joins the force because he feels that this is his calling.  Gone is the old conception of the six-footer plodding his way along the street and representing law in the area.  There were many good points about having the man on the beat and possibly we would be better off if we still had this type of patrol.  However, in Dublin city alone there are approximately 700 miles of streets and this would require an inordinate number of gardaí.  We should be able to have the happy medium where we would see gardaí on the beat in O'Connell Street and Grafton Street, something which one sees very seldom now.  Itinerant children are sent to sit on O'Connell Bridge in fierce weather and one feels that by having them removed one is doing them an injustice.  The gardaí should get after the people who put those children there in all weathers. About two years ago I crossed the bridge at about one o'clock in the morning and saw a couple, I presume the father and mother of the children who were going to sit on the bridge at that hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise and I shall come back to the Bill right away.  I am trying to point out the difficulty the gardaí have in cases where people put their children on the bridge with a north-easterly gale blowing.  The gardaí are hampered by the fact that they are <Col N="1268" /> considerate men.  The ban-gharda should be sent to deal with these children or the parents who put them there. The Minister should ensure that banghardaí are put only on duties involving women and young children.</P>
      <P>We must strive to have the highest possible standard in the Garda and, therefore, we must endeavour to give those men and women the best possible conditions.  Many of the barracks in the suburbs of this city are there since the days of the DMP, and in some cases they are fortress-like buildings in which the policemen of those days had protection from the public. There was no attempt then to involve the people with the police force so that the people would give every assistance to the police and in return would receive the highest possible service from them.  A number of new barracks have been built in the city, and I am sure, will be built.  Perhaps, this is more a matter for the Office of Public Works than for the Minister, but I am sure he recognises the need for the modernisation of barracks throughout the country.  One of these barracks in my own area is at least 100 years old; it has been changed very slightly and passing by one still sees the cells there. The public can see them.  On very rare occasions a man might be detained there.  It reminds me of the time when wrongdoers were put in the stocks for the public to gaze at them.</P>
      <P>I know it takes a lot of money to provide a really modern barracks but in this society, facing all the changes that are coming, we must give the perfecting of the Garda force and their bases the top priority.  We must have modern stations with all modern facilities.  The Garda must have all the equipment they need to combat the growing crime rate.  The first duty of the Garda is to prevent crime but that is almost impossible because very often, in our changing society, the criminal is much better equipped than the Garda.  I acknowledge the work that is being done by the Garda and for the Garda to make them a really modern force but we have a long way to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, the mass of the people do not break the law.  It is the <Col N="1269" /> small minority who break the law in a serious way.  Probably most of us break the law in small ways by being careless, but I am referring to the most serious form of crime which afflicts our society today.  We have heard criticism of the Garda but I can say without fear of contradiction that in no other country in the world are relations between the police force and the public better than they are here. There is the odd thug in the city or the agitator who will attack the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker mentioned the amount of crime amongst the working classes and the lower classes.  I thought those terms had gone out with the Victorian era.  I have never accepted that the proportion of criminals is greater in the areas where the lower paid workers live than in the more affluent areas in the city. The man in the overcrowded areas may feel less respect for the Establishment than the man from the more affluent suburbs, but they are both human beings with all the weakness that entails.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the Garda for the way in which they deal with some very sordid cases which are brought to their notice.  In cases involving young people, or women, the Garda have always acted with the greatest tact and compassion.  I have never known of a garda who acted as a bully or who acted wrongly in one of these cases, even though his task was very difficult.  The vast majority of the people trust the force and want to see the force getting the best possible deal. They will support the Garda if they are assured that they will not be attacked or penalised afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago a student from Africa was very badly beaten by some <Col N="1270" /> thugs in this city.  I spoke to him in hospital and pointed out to him that he was not beaten up because he was a foreign student and that many other people had been beaten up in the city also.  He said: &ldquo;Yes, I accept that but surely somebody could have rung up the Garda.&rdquo;  When he was being beaten up no one thought of ringing for the Garda.  When they were notified they came quickly and they saved his life. An alert citizenry should know what to do in these emergencies.  The first thing is to call the Garda and have these thugs put where they belong.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we are inclined not to cooperate fully with the Garda for historical reasons.  Many years ago anybody who co-operated with the police force was looked upon as not being a good Irishman.  Surely after 50 years of self-government we must face the fact that the Garda are our men, that they are there to protect the citizens, and that they cannot do this adequately unless they get the full co-operation of the people.  I think this would be forthcoming if the people believed that the force was strong enough to ensure that people who help the Garda and who suffer physical injury will be compensated, and protected if necessary in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to flatter the Minister but since his appointment I have felt that he has been on top of the job.  He is dedicated to giving us the type of Garda force we need, that is, a good force with the best possible conditions and the best possible promotional outlets. We know that every garda cannot be promoted.  We hope that the best means of assessing candidates for promotion will be adopted.  I do not know what the system is at the moment.  In any commercial company there is always the problem that no matter who is promoted somebody else thinks that he should be promoted.  This problem probably also exists in the Civil Service and in other places.</P>
    <P>Deputies have criticised the manner in which promotions are made and suggested that political influence was brought to bear but in commercial companies where there is no political influence people complain that others were promoted and they were not.  We <Col N="1271" /> appreciate the many problems which the Minister faces.  He will be criticised anyway.  We must ensure that justice obtains in the Garda force and is seen to obtain.  Every country in the world is faced with the problem of a rising crime rate.  The very changed society in which we live today will encourage an increase in the crime rate.  Some years ago in England they had the Wolfenden Report on Crime which made a very detailed examination of the whole problem.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That, in view of the deteriorating situation with regard to air and water pollution and the lack of up-to-date legislation to deal with the position, Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Local Government to introduce legislation forthwith to rectify this state of affairs.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy L. Belton.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCott" hpid="Mr. Cott Mr. Cott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cott</NameTxt>
      <P>In this country we have only a very small minority of conservationists, preservationists and amenity bodies who play an invaluable role in keeping the pollution issue alive.  Social consciousness has been awakened to a degree by a vociferous few, who vehemently objected to the proposed siting of the smelter plant at Little Island, County Cork, by the few who deplored the neglect that led to the breach of the industrial effluent tank in Tuam and by the angling groups who are dismayed and frustrated by the everincreasing pollution of our rivers with subsequent loss of all fish life.  Some of these have been dismissed as cranks and fusspots, others as academics who show no regard or consideration for industrial progress and the desperate need to create more employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that those people are genuinely concerned and fully realise the urgent need to strike a harmonious balance between industrial progress and <Col N="1272" /> control of the environment.  I am convinced that men like Professor Scott of University College, Cork, who has been a very outspoken critic, would only be too willing to work with industry and local authorities to develop pragmatic solutions to their environmental problems.  The issue of pollution, because we are not yet in a huge environment crisis, has not entered the political arena but this is already happening in the US, Britain, Sweden, Germany and in many other countries. Now is the time to act before it is too late.  It behoves the Government to initiate a comprehensive scheme for the control and protection of the environment. A start can be made by passing legislation and ensuring its strict enforcement.</P>
    <P>In this regard we should carefully examine how other countries have tackled the problem of pollution and we might well benefit from their experiences.  Sweden has been exemplary in its approach.  Its 1969 environmental protection law is generally recognised as a masterpiece in legislation and its declared aim is that all industry should do everything technically possible and economically feasible to keep production processes from deleteriously affecting the environment.</P>
    <P>Sweden has made some impressive, technical achievements in the pollution control field.  These range from air bubbling processes with applications in revitalising polluted lakes and protecting harbours from oil leakage and sulphur dioxide to scrubbers and advanced techniques for the treatment of sewage and industrial waste.  The Royal Swedish Environmental Protection Board have very considerable powers and it is generally recognised that they are doing a tremendous job.  They have powers to grant subsidies to industries and communities constructing pollution control apparatus.  They have powers in determining areas to be set aside for nature reserves.  They also act as an environmental watchdog and they advise on industrial applications for licences.</P>
    <P>Britain, too, from its legislation, namely the Clean Air Act and the Alkali Act, has benefited considerably. If we have a look at the main pollutants <Col N="1273" /> we find that these consist of industrial effluent, raw sewage, pesticide residues, intensive farm excreta and fertiliser run-off, diesel fumes and, indeed, noise.  We must examine each separately to see how best we can control them without inhibiting progress. We must strike a balance between economic quantity and the quality of our life.</P>
    <P>We find, if we consider industrial effluent, that some of the worst offenders are creameries and food processing plants.  What must we do?  We must ensure that all new plants being constructed are fitted with the most modern pollution control devices and planning permission must be refused by the local authorities unless this is complied with.  Secondly, we must devise a scheme of subsidies for existing industries to install the necessary apparatus.</P>
    <P>Some of the very common industrial pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, the hydrocarbons and the oxides of nitrogen.  We do not know what their precise effect is or the full potential of their dangers but we must be fully aware that they are dangers.  We must be careful about the dumping of toxic materials inland because of possible water contamination.  We must realise, too, that the sea's capacity to absorb and dilute waste is enormous but not infinite.  We must remember, too, that a substantial proportion of productive fisheries are located in shallow waters. Unless we now exercise the greatest caution we will do enormous damage that may take decades to rectify.</P>
    <P>I feel I should mention here the proposed smelter plant at Little Island.  If one is to take an objective, impartial view one will realise that with a very high concentration of industry around the harbour and the pumping of industrial effluent in huge quantities together with massive quantities of raw sewage into it, we run the risk of converting our beautiful harbour into a stinking cess-pool.  Against that we must weigh our critical unemployment situation in Cork and the urgent need to create thousands of jobs.  Therefore, if all pollution control devices are fitted, which should include sulphur dioxide scrubbers <Col N="1274" /> and filters, and if a monitoring station is constructed to keep a 24-hour watch on the possible emission of harmful toxic materials, then economic necessity may weigh in favour of its approval.  I also say that this approval should be dependent on a written assurance of the creation of at least 400 permanent jobs and adequate insurance for the farmers of east Cork against possible damage to their lands and loss of profits from their agricultural industry.  If these guarantees are not forthcoming then we should think again about granting approval.  We must have a guarantee of a satisfactory level of employment for a stipulated number of years and in default the payment of massive compensation.  We cannot be too careful.  There is far too much at stake for us in Cork to view matters lightly.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the unloading of untreated sewage into rivers by local authorities, probably our major source of pollution. The cost of correcting this immediately would be prohibitive.  We must ensure, however, that all new systems conform to a planned pattern. At present, towns surrounded by a network of rivers and streams simply discharge into the closest stream to the site.  If at some future date a plant is needed, the cost will be very high because the outlets will be scattered over a wide area.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, all the outlets ran into a single outfall, a single pipe would suffice to discharge the sewage to the treatment plant, and it should be made compulsory for local authorities to designate one or two major outlets into which all new outlets will be run.  If this is not practicable it should be stipulated that all new outlets must run into existing outlets.</P>
    <P>Unless we begin to make provision for the future here we cannot possibly hope to contain or to rectify our serious pollution problem and at this stage I must ask the Minister immediately to make available money for the construction of a sewage disposal unit in Midleton.  The whole backwash of the inner harbour between Ballinacurra and Midleton is stinking.  One <Col N="1275" /> has to see it at first hand to realise how bad it is.  Its condition has been brought about by the pumping of huge quantities of untreated sewage into it and it has been worsened of late by industrial effluent.  It has silted up in recent years and now its stench is nauseating.  It certainly constitutes a serious health hazard to the people of Midleton and Ballinacurra.  This work must be given priority and must be completed before next summer.  Otherwise there could be an epidemic in Midleton.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned pollutants from industry and the pollution caused by raw sewage.  I should like to say now that the agricultural sector provides its pollutants mainly in the form of pesticide residues, fertiliser run off and drainage from silage pits.  All these make a very high demand on oxygen in the water, thus killing fish and other life.  Fishing is a very important part of our tourist attraction as well as being the main source of livelihood of many of our people.  We must exercise strict control over proper drainage pits for silage effluent.</P>
    <P>With regard to pesticides, there is striking evidence that we should endeavour to end all use of organochlorine pesticides.  Not enough is known of their harmful effects but what is known leaves serious doubts about the advisability of their use. The permissible residue level for food in the United States is extremely low and these levels are being fixed in Great Britain in the near future.  We must keep a very close eye on this to ensure that our exports of beef, lamb and processed foods will continue to remain acceptable on those markets. The indestructibility of the organo-chlorines is extremely worrying.  So is their huge concentration in the biosphere, assessed at several million tons.  Organochlorine and organo-mercury fungicides have become global contaminants.  We have evidence of the damage caused by the spillage of quantities of the organochlorine insecticide endosulean into the river Rhine in 1969 which caused the deaths of millions of fish.  Usages of these insecticides <Col N="1276" /> and fungicides should be controlled by the Government.</P>
    <P>Farmers, too, should be warned of the danger of washing out spraying machines and dumping used containers in water courses.  I suggest widespread adoption of the criteria proposed in the document prepared by the Council of Europe Working Party on Poisonous Substances in Agriculture would go far to standarise procedure in Western Europe.  We have a duty to ourselves and to all nations to ensure that we conform to the standards laid down.</P>
    <P>One of the causes of pollution that is very often overlooked is detergent. Our people should be made aware of the dangers of indiscriminate use of detergents, particularly those containing enzymes.  It has been proved in England that the most up to date sewage plants are only 90 per cent efficient in dealing with synthetic detergents. Normal bacterial action is only 65 per cent efficient.  Enzymes also cause respiratory disorders such as asthma and bronchitis, and exposure to them can result in allergies.  I suggest that the Government, and the Minister for Local Government in particular, should warn the general public on the possible dangers from the misuse of enzyme detergents.</P>
    <P>Two other pollutants are diesel fumes and noise.  As we know, some lorry owners are particularly bad offenders where diesel fumes are concerned. The law should be strictly enforced in this matter and heavy penalties imposed on those who disregard it.  Where noise is concerned, we must carefully set down standards of permissible noise levels.  In England, 45 per cent of the population are estimated to live on roads with an undesirable level of noise.  We should not be lax in this country particularly with young offenders who remove silencers from motorcycles and cars and who thus cause particular hardship to the aged.</P>
    <P>The cost benefit analysis of pollutant control is the necessary starting point for a decision and I would propose a central government economics unit for this purpose.  Regular monitoring <Col N="1277" /> of existing levels is required if the dangers of pollution are to be assessed intelligently.  Regular monitoring may be more effective than routine analysis of the environment.  We could beneficially use our existing university resources and, indeed, the goodwill and the concern shown by university people to combat the pollution problems which are now besetting us.</P>
    <P>I would propose that a special section, under the Minister for Local Government, with complete responsibility for environmental protection, should be formed and a staff member should be attached to each county council.  By introducing effective, comprehensive legislation and by doing so now we can make considerable advances within our existing resources.  I would, therefore, call on the Minister for Local Government to introduce this legislation without delay and ensure that our atmosphere will be pure and our rivers and lakes free from pollution in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on behalf of the Minister who is unavoidably absent.  In view of the fact that the debate on this motion at our next sitting has just 25 minutes to go it would be impossible for the Minister to get in because the mover of the motion has the right to reply.</P>
      <P>Since the adjournment last April of the debate on this motion the Minister has had the opportunity, in the course of the debate on the Department's estimate, to inform the House in some detail of the various steps he was taking to deal with the air and water pollution problems.  While I do not wish to repeat these now, I should, perhaps, refer again to some of the more important ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Inter-departmental Working Group on Air and Water Pollution which the Minister set up to inquire into the nature and extent of the air and water pollution problems, the remedial strategies that might be adopted, the cost of these strategies, how the cost might be divided between the State, local authorities and the private sector, the adequacy <Col N="1278" /> of existing legislation and the need for fresh legislation have not yet completed their examination of these matters.  They are, however, aware of the Minister's anxiety to have their report as soon as possible.  Pending submission of the working group's report various steps have been taken to ensure that the situation with regard to air and water pollution is not allowed to deteriorate.</P>
    <P>In order to establish the facts concerning the extent of the water pollution problem An Foras Forbartha has undertaken at the Minister's request a continuing survey of the condition of all our major rivers.  The first series of investigations is already completed and a report of these is expected from An Foras shortly.  Information obtained from the survey has, however, already been sent to local authorities and they have been asked, where pollution is shown to be occurring to a significant degree, to take immediate steps to establish the source of the pollution and to initiate remedial action.  The Minister has also requested them to take the results of the survey into account when dealing with applications for planning permission for development which might give rise to effluent problems and to use their powers to the full to prevent any new sources of pollution being created.  In order to ensure that as far as practicable a consistent approach is adopted by all planning authorities when they are considering planning applications for new industries or extensions to existing industries liable to give rise to effluent problems guidelines have been issued to them on the subject.  The Minister also made arrangements to achieve co-ordination in this particular matter between planning authorities, the Industrial Development Authority and the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the water pollution position in the Dublin area and I would like to refer to the measures which are being and have been taken to improve the position. Substantial improvement has been achieved in the condition of the Dodder as a result of the interception by the Dodder Valley sewerage scheme of certain discharges which previously <Col N="1279" /> contributed to pollution in the river. Some improvement has also been achieved in the case of the Tolka where the corporation carried out certain works including a rising main and pump house at Finglas Bridge.  Work in progress and planned by the local authorities in the Dublin area in relation to provision of drainage schemes and new treatment works will help to achieve further improvements.  Pollution of the Liffey is caused mainly by the Camac river, which is highly polluted by industrial effluent.  The Camac flows directly into the Liffey near Islandbridge.  The sewers in the centre city area have storm overflows which discharge into the Liffey when the capacity of the sewer is exceeded.  This is another source of pollution of the Liffey.  The Greater Dublin drainage scheme, which will cost an estimated £6,500,000, will cater for these discharges and thus eliminate the main causes of pollution of the Camac and Liffey.  As announced recently, the Minister has approved the contract documents submitted by Dublin Corporation for the construction of the first major stage of a scheme which is designed to provide a modern sewage treatment works for Dublin.  The estimated cost is in the region of £2.2 million.  This section will deal in the first instance with flows coming through the new Dodder Valley sewer which is scheduled for completion in 1974 and which will, in addition to opening up some 6,300 acres of new land for development in the Tallaght area, ensure that the Dodder river will be free from pollution.</P>
    <P>The planning of the remaining sections of the overall treatment works scheme, of which the present project is the first major stage, is proceeding. When the total scheme has been constructed it is expected that there will be a significant and rapid improvement in the condition of the Liffey and Dublin Bay.  As regards pollution of rivers from agricultural sources arrangements are being considered jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in order to minimise pollution from such sources.</P>
    <P>Turning to air pollution, section 10 <Col N="1280" /> of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962 contains wide powers to control air pollution.  The first regulations made under this section are the Control of Atmospheric Pollution Regulations, 1970, which came into force on 1st January, 1971. These regulations control the heavier smoke emissions and make it an offence to cause a nuisance by emission of smoke, dust, grit, gas or fumes from premises other than private houses.  The administration of the regulations rests with sanitary authorities and reasonable progress has been achieved in their first year of operation.</P>
    <P>The emission of noxious gases and acids from certain chemical and other processes is controlled by the Alkali etc.  Works Regulations Act, 1906. Most of the works which are registered under this Act were inspected last year by a firm of chemical consultants with a view to ensuring that they are operating within the limits set by the Act.</P>
    <P>Air pollution measurements are taken at recording stations in six of the larger urban areas.  It is the intention to increase substantially the number and coverage of monitoring stations and sanitary authorities have been asked to arrange, in consultation with the Department, for the setting up of more adequate monitoring arrangements in towns with populations over 15,000.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should say that while the Minister is fully in favour of introducing such legislation as may be necessary in relation to air and water pollution, it is important to ensure that it is the right legislation.  It is essential, therefore, that the report of the Inter-departmental Working Group, to which I have already referred, should be awaited and the Minister hopes to receive it in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cott referred to planning permission.  Local authorities, who are charged with carrying out the provisions of the various Planning Acts, take every precaution to ensure that, before planning permission is given for industrial and other undertakings, provision is made to minimise-indeed, in some cases, to avoid altogether&mdash;pollution of either air or water.  The same applies to planning <Col N="1281" /> permissions which come by way of appeal to the Department.  While it may be necessary to introduce legislation as a result of the study of the problem by the working group, that does not mean that a good deal cannot be done under existing legislation. Indeed, a great deal is being done to prevent pollution or to alleviate its effects.  For that reason, I would ask now that this motion be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call made to the Minister in this motion to introduce forthwith legislation which will deal effectively with both air and water pollution.  While pollution control is management's responsibility, the only real solution to it is the introduction of legislation to control it.  At the moment&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary must agree with me in this&mdash; there is no really effective legislation to enforce anti-pollution measures.</P>
      <P>Safeguarding our environment is vital and people must be made to realise that such safeguarding will cost money.  Money can be found only by increased taxation but, if the seriousness of the situation is brought home to the people, I am convinced that they will gladly pay whatever is required to conserve our environment. Such conservation is urgent.  As a country, we are starved of industry. We have high unemployment and a high level of emigration and one of our problems is to provide industry in order to create jobs and at the same time preserve our environment.</P>
      <P>Control of pollution should be our priority.  I do not advocate, and neither do the movers of the motion, that people should become hysterical about control.  What we suggest is that the Minister should introduce legislation of a kind designed to help in the conservation of our environment and, at the same time, help in creating new jobs and avoiding any hardship on any section of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, in Fermoy, I saw two films.  They were American films and they were shown by the local anti-pollution committee in the town.  This committee are doing great work in bringing to the notice of the public <Col N="1282" /> generally the dangers of pollution and showing how easy it is, if we all take a hand, to help in its control.  Anyone looking at these films could not but be alarmed at the magnitude of the problem in the USA.  Neither our industrial arm nor our population has grown in the same way as theirs but we can learn from what has happened in other countries and benefit from the experience of other countries.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Cott, said, detergents, washing powders, insecticides, pesticides and new forms of fertiliser all contribute to aggravating the problem.  I read somewhere recently that of the 3,000 food additives in use only 30 have been fully tested for safety.  That will give some idea of the magnitude of the problem. The biggest problem is the pollution of our waters.  There are four main sources&mdash;untreated sewage, silage, the run-off from fertilisers and from piggeries and the effluent from factories. The Parliamentary Secretary says he hopes to have the report on pollution from An Foras Forbartha shortly but the problem is one of such magnitude that it is vital that we should tackle this immediately.  I appeal to him to introduce the necessary legislation. Existing legislation is ineffective.  Only yesterday I read in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of people being brought before the court charged with polluting certain rivers and they got off; they were not fined.  It may be that the court acted correctly.  On the other hand, the unfortunate poor devil who takes a salmon is fined anything up to £50. In my opinion, local authorities are the biggest polluters of our rivers.  But they get away with it.</P>
    <P>Legislation will have to be introduced to solve this problem.  I read recently that more than one-quarter of the 20,000 miles of rivers in England and half of Britain's 1,500 miles of canals are officially recognised as being polluted.  That is a startling fact and that is just another reason why we should now take time by the forelock and tackle the problem.  The river Tyne in England is now described as an open sewer flowing through such places as the heart of Newcastle. I was glad to hear the Parliamentary <Col N="1283" /> Secretary say that there is a good improvement now as regards the Dublin rivers, Dodder and Tolka.  I do not know if he mentioned the Liffey but in any case this is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>But it is unfortunate that when you consider the river Lee and the Munster Blackwater the problem still remains. I have read in regard to the Lee that millions of gallons of untreated sewage are emptied into it at Passage West. Ships' captains are fined for polluting water with oil while we ourselves are big offenders.  Indeed, in regard to the Munster Blackwater, I live in Fermoy and as a member of the urban council perhaps, like others, I am to some extent responsible.  It is true that sewage there is also going untreated into the River Blackwater.  That is the river we are proud to call the Irish Rhine.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons the Parliamentary Secretary should have a serious look at these problems and take cognisance of the wording of the motion. Apart from the danger to health of discharging untreated sewage into these rivers, as Deputy Cott has said, thousands of fish are being killed.  The extent of the pollution and damage to fish life has shocked officials of the Inland Fisheries Trust.  I am sure they have been in touch with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and Local Government.  I am informed that the stumbling block is that no prosecutions can be brought in many cases.  If that is so, I think the House will agree that amending legislation is urgently required.</P>
    <P>I read recently a criticism of the Irish Government for not being represented at the international conference in Oslo last October concerning marine pollution.  The reason given was that it was not thought necessary to send anybody there.  We have been sending public representatives to far corners of the world for less important reasons. We should have sent representatives there to learn about the problem instead of sitting at home talking about it.  As regards having no legislation to enforce against those who offend in regard to pollution it is only right to mention that Britain has a <Col N="1284" /> law which allows them to destroy a ship if it is likely to pollute the British coast with oil.  That shows how seriously the British Government view the whole problem.  In West Germany there is a law to protect people from noise and air pollution covering all sources from industry to lawn mowers. It is designed to prevent environmental damage and it carries penalties of jail sentences up to ten years or fines of up to £12,500.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that very strict measures were being taken to ensure that industry would do as little damage as possible by way of effluent from factories.  Up to recently little notice was taken of this problem but if it is being tackled now it is a step in the right direction.  We should realise and recognise that conservation is a problem for all of us and we should try to create greater awareness among those employed in factories that this is a major threat to civilisation.  We, as legislators, have a responsibility to ensure that we shall pass on to posterity a world in which they can live and that we do not impose any hardship or cruelty on them by our negligence in this very important field.  Like Deputy Cott I believe a department of environment should be set up now with representatives from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>It is rather a pity that Conservation Year passed over with so many people showing so little interest in it.  I believe people are now much more conscious of their task of ensuring that air and water will be kept as clean as possible. It is all right to send circulars to local authorities from the Department of Local Government asking them to do this, that and the other but, as a member of a local authority I appreciate that they have so many other problems with which to grapple now that unless there is some financial aid involved for them in tackling this problem, I fear the circular will get no results.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department of Local Government to take a very serious view of this matter and to try to get <Col N="1285" /> across to people that it is their business and a serious matter for them and that all we are trying to do here and as members of local authorities is ensure that Ireland in the future will be as good and as clean as it is now as regards air, water and noise.  We hope the country will remain as it has been, and should be in this respect, an attraction for tourists who will be able to recognise it because we kept it so clean.</P>

      <P>As I will indicate in a moment, I am wholeheartedly in favour of dealing with the problem of pollution and of dealing with it as quickly as possible but after years of seeing Bills of this nature going through the House, for instance, Bills dealing with traffic regulations, and then seeing the legislation ignored in practice, I would suggest at the outset that we should be serious about legislation and ensure that it is enforced. On another occasion I mentioned the fact that we have a whole code of traffic regulations and laws which nobody bothers about.  Only this morning in this city I saw a main thoroughfare blocked by a lorry that was manoeuvring. All traffic was held up for a quarter of an hour but nobody seemed to care.  Notices of speed limits can be seen all over the country but only too often one finds people driving at a speed much greater than that specified for a particular area.  However, that is not the matter before the House but I mention it to illustrate the futility of bringing in legislation while not having the means to enforce it.  It is a fault of all administrations, of all bureaucracies, to think that once a law is passed that is the end of the matter but the experience of the modern world should indicate that what is important is enforcement of laws and that laws mean nothing unless they can be enforced. In fact, laws are bad if they cannot be enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> It is with that very depressing thought in mind that I approach this very admirable initiative on the part of the people who have thought well to bring the matter before the House. I cast no reflection whatsoever on them but it is important to remember that, although civil servants do their work on the preparation of Bills, judging from the actions of the Department of Local Government and, in particular, the actions of the Department of Justice, insufficient thought is given to the question of realistic enforcement of legislation.</P>
    <P>In a matter of this nature it is obvious that there will be great problems in respect of enforcement.  Serious attention will have to be given to the methods of enforcing whatever are the regulations and it is my belief that it would be better to have a small amount of legislation that could be enforced effectively rather than having a lot of window-dressing legislation which, in the last analysis, will leave matters worse than they were before.</P>
    <P>If my memory serves me correctly, there are provisions in the road traffic regulations for dealing with pollution caused by vehicle exhausts and there are regulations also dealing with noise and with litter but I will leave it to Deputies to judge for themselves how much enforcement there is in respect of these types of pollution.  The problem of pollution is one not only for us but for the whole world.  Mankind is destroying the planet on which we live.  I am afraid that this planet can be compared with a hill into which rabbits have burrowed reducing it to sand.  Humanity, having acquired such a degree of control over the environment, is destroying it.  This encroachment is not peculiar to us because it is happening all over the world.  It is noticeable in the destruction of certain species of animals and in the destruction of vegetation.  There was the famous dustbowl experience of the United States.  The process is accelerating. There are pessimistic forecasts about the future of the oceans.  There has been mention of four-fifths of the earth being water.  In any case, if certain authorities are to be believed. <Col N="1287" /> there is proximate danger of significant disastrous pollution of the oceans. That is a frightening thought.  Therefore, when we approach this problem of pollution, we must take into account the problem in the world generally and also how people are reacting to it.</P>
    <P>Motor-car exhaust fumes, particularly in built-up areas, constitute a from of pollution that is rising above a level that is tolerable.  It might be desirable but certainly not feasible to ban the motor-car from the entire area of this city.  The point I am making is that we must have regard to the facts and to what people will tolerate in regard to any action taken on this problem.  In other words, we must have regard to what is feasible and I fear that feasibility will be conditioned largely by what is acceptable universally and what is acceptable will be dictated by the acuteness of the problem generally.</P>
    <P>No doubt Deputy Barry and others who have supported this motion will be under the impression that I am making a case against it.  I am not doing so.  What I am trying to do is to raise some points which must necessarily be considered so as to give effect to any measures that may be passed. There is the question of enforcement and ancillary to that and, perhaps, part of it, the question of the feasibility of provisions proposed having regard to the level of acceptability of such provisions by the population.</P>
    <P>Having said that, let us look so far as we can to what is our local problem in regard to pollution.  Ours is a growing problem and I should like to join with Deputy Barry and with any other Deputy who may be pressing for the early consideration of this problem in saying that we could start in Dublin city.  Those here who approach the city daily from the south or south-west, in particular from high ground, will have seen that there is a blanket of smog, a layer of concentrated and potentially dangerous pollution, over this city.  It may also be noticed from the north.  It has grown in recent years. Possibly it is associated with expansion at the perimeter of the city.  This <Col N="1288" /> in itself should be the danger signal.  It may ultimately lead to smokeless fuel and other measures of that nature which had to be taken in other countries.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into arguments here as to precise levels of pollution, but a few facts will do.  We built one huge chimney at Ringsend, which is a useful indicator as to how the wind is blowing.  Yesterday there was smoke from it blowing east; today it was blowing west.  There are two ESB chimneys alongside it.  I have often been tempted to take a camera out and photograph the volumes of black smoke belching out at certain times. There are other orifices around throwing smoke into the atmosphere.  However, I mention the other two because they are public undertakings and we can blame nobody else but ourselves for those.  I do not want to blame either, because the other side of the coin is, supposing you close them down, what would Dublin do for power?  There is no use just shouting about pollution.  There is no use going after the poacher for one salmon and letting the local authorities destroy the river with sewage.  Therefore, there is no use in getting after one small factory while allowing the ESB to throw out, and apparently necessarily throw out, this big volume of black smoke.  Sometimes pollution is inseperable from industrial activity, and while I am advocating minimising pollution, we should be realistic in facing up to where the pollution is coming from.</P>
    <P>The air in certain parts of the city is quite polluted.  I was amazed to find recently that the pH of the rain water in a certain area not far from the docks in this city was four.  What that means is that the acidity of that rain water was one thousand times more than the acidity of pure water.  That acidity was sufficient to corrode heating installations and things like that.  Remember that the pollution is not just the smoke dust or coal dust or whatever it is that is coming out from factories; there are more subtle and more dangerous effluents in invisible gas.  Trace these to their sources, which will be just as I say, and you will have the problem of compromise.  The community want <Col N="1289" /> certain things; they want certain employment, but the cost of all that is the production of these noxious substances, and you have to consider the feasibility and the cost of controlling that.</P>
    <P>The only effective way to deal with his problem is not to deal with it globally but to find out the important cause of pollution and try to control it, as well as minimising other causes if possible.  Another example is the chemical factory at Avoca.  Although I was not near enough to smell them as I passed along there, I should be very much surprised if the yellow gases which I saw coming out from one particular point were not nitrogen oxide lumes.  What struck me was how little was coming out, but that quantity was significant from a pollution point of view.  It is very easy to say that we do not have a factory like that, but it is not as simple as kiss hands to say you will have no pollution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry put his finger on the nub of the water supply problem.  We have an expanding population and consequently an expansion of housing. That means water supplies and the removal of sewage.  The two are interlinked. Heretofore we have been very well off in regard to water, so well off that we are prone to forget that the supply of water is a major problem in other parts of the world and that, as a whole, the world may be short of fresh water.  We in this country have had it so plentiful that we are very prodigal in its use.  However, sewage is a problem in Dublin city and I do not know what the answers are.  There is a great deal of untreated sewage going into the Liffey.  You only have to go out in a boat in Dublin Bay to discover that it is completely polluted with sewage.</P>
    <P>The bay between Bray Head and Killiney Head has now become a very polluted area.  I mentioned that area because it is what I might call very proper to us.  We cannot blame anyone else for that form of pollution.  Of course the Irish Sea is getting its share of pollution from the other side and from other sources.  We definitely have a big problem where water is concerned.  I mentioned air pollution first.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> The problem of water pollution may also be a problem of water conservation. It would be in other countries. I do not think it would help to go into the mucky details of that because the details are mucky.  If we are starting anywhere it might be a salutary thought to start there.  If we do we must be prepared to find the very considerable sums of money that are entailed in that operation.  I for one would be prepared to subscribe to finding that money but we have to educate other people into the importance of this.  It is like the way we saved on the police and skimped on the Army.  In concentrating on essentials we seem to have been a little tight in this area also.</P>
    <P>The problem of sea pollution may be beyond us.  In the near future there must be moves by a number of people on this matter and we may be involved in this when we enter the EEC. They are concerned about conservation of stock in the seas and pollution of the seas in the vicinity of Europe. We will probably have to play our part in that.  It will be very much in our interests to do so.</P>
    <P>I suppose that when people talk about pollution they are thinking particularly of the type of pollution Deputy Barry and I talked about but there are other insidious pollutions that are so tied up with conservation that it is difficult to know which word to use.  Mankind is discovering&mdash;and it is to be hoped that it acts on it before it is too late&mdash;that you must keep areas of nature intact, that you must keep green areas, areas of trees and vegetation, that there is a limit to the way you can distort nature and get away with it.</P>
    <P>The oxygen supply of the world is greatly dependent on the vegetation of the world.  We are beginning to understand now that it is a very good thing for the health of a community to have interspaced green areas.  It may be said that this is no problem for us, that we are an agricultural country and we have plenty of greenery, plenty of green plants, and so on, but if cities like Dublin grow it is rather important to keep some greenery in them.  Pollution <Col N="1291" /> and conservation become very closely linked at this point.</P>
    <P>There is another thing&mdash;would you call it a pollution?  I would&mdash;that is, the way the modern treatment of seeds and certain agricultural and horticultural practices are affecting forms of animal life.  I am not competent to judge this because I have not made any particular inquiries, but I am told that there are areas in the country in which the bird population has gone down because of the treatment of seeds. Certainly the indiscriminate use of insecticides has influenced the balance in some ways.  One cannot always foresee where this kind of thing is leading to.  For us as an agricultural country, as a country that depends on nature and on the land, there is a need to be very alert to the side reactions and uncalculated long-term consequences of using chemicals to disturb the normality of nature.</P>
    <P>I know that argument could be pressed too far.  That argument could be shoved back to the stage where you would not use artificial manure or where you would never improve your farming.  I hope it will not be taken in that sense.  What I am saying is that the indiscriminate use of chemicals for such purposes has its dangers and can be a pollution.  A survey of that whole area is highly desirable when approaching a problem of this nature.  I suppose I could go on and cover a lot of the ground that has been covered already but other people want to take part in this debate as well.</P>
    <P>Therefore I should like to summarise briefly the points I made.  If we are to legislate let us make adequate provision for enforcement.  Let us be realistic about it and not have window-dressing legislation.  If we are to tackle air pollution let us have regard to the realities.  Let us not pass an Act that will catch, to take Deputy Barry's analogy, the poacher who takes one salmon and will let the person who is polluting the whole river and killing hundreds of salmon get away with it, no matter what excuse, whether it is essential or otherwise.  Not only is that an unfair way but it is a dangerous <Col N="1292" /> way to approach a problem like this because it enables the main pollution to be bigger and worse than ever.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of water pollution, the question of the sea, the question of the birds, and lastly what I would call the chemical pollution of the environment through the use of chemicals for any purpose, particularly agricultural purposes.  All these things have to be considered.  If any measure is brought into this House in support of conservation or the minimising of pollution.  I will give it my wholehearted support because this is a vital problem at this time.  It affects our life in the long term.</P>
    <P>In many ways it is the greatest menance to our lives and wellbeing in our own country and to our being able to develop our country.  All these threats can be summed up in the word &ldquo;pollution&rdquo;.  I want to stress that, lest my attempt to come to grips with the snags and the realities might be interpreted as putting obstacles in the way of coping with the problem.  I should like to see the obstacles overcome. It is a very good thing that we should consider this whole matter in the House and I hope we will heat more about it in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion in the names of Deputy Belton.  Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Cott.  My only regret is that the motion does not go far enough.  Matters appertaining to our environment are of such urgency and importance that a special department should deal with them. Although our country is as yet very largely unspoilt there is growing evidence all around us that our scenic beauty, our natural heritage and our natural amenities are very obviously under constant attack from scientific, industrial and technological forces. Already many of our rivers are severely polluted.  Large sections of our coastline are polluted, some to a shocking extent.  Certain of our rivers and portion of our coastline at present are like stagnant cess-pools of filth and stench.  Fish life in our rivers has been seriously threatened and in many instances in small rivers and portions of large rivers it has been wiped out time and time again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> The very air we breathe is contaminated. The air we breathe in the city of Dublin is regarded as being twice as dirty as was that of London before the introduction of the smokeless zones there, even though this country escaped the industrial revolution. There is evidence that our food is being contaminated more and more by the growing use of pesticides and insecticides, some of which are known to result in dangerous residues in the food we use.</P>
    <P>Many of our buildings of historical interest and architectural importance and also many beautiful landscapes have been destroyed.  Serious threat to our fish life has come about by the discharge of industrial and agricultural effluent of a deadly and noxious kind as well as the discharge of untreated sewage and, indeed, rubbish of all kinds.  Wild life, especially in the native habitat, is threatened.  Wild fowl and bird life is being exterminated by the growing interference with their natural habitat.  Some of our State bodies are responsible to a marked degree in this regard.</P>
    <P>Our environment is regretfully changing for the worse and nothing effective is being done by our Government to arrest this trend.  The Government have not been facing up to their responsibilities in this important matter. Despite what may be said from the Government benches and by Ministers from time to time there is no positive policy for dealing with the vitally important matter of our environment. There are no adequate funds and there is no effective legislation to deal with the problem; on the contrary responsibility for our environment is scattered over a range of State Departments such as the Department of Local Government, which one would imagine would be primarily responsible, the Department of Lands, the Department of Health, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Transport and Power.  What is everybody's business in this crucial matter is clearly nobody's business.</P>
    <P>We should have one ministry and one effective piece of legislation to deal with all aspects of environmental pollution. <Col N="1294" /> There are at least seven Acts of Parliament which refer to the environment and surely this is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.  We require one Act and one ministry and sufficient funds for research and assistance to all concerned to grapple with this great task.  There is as yet no legislation to prevent air and water pollution by industries set up prior to 1963. Local authorities, it must be admitted, do not make sufficiently strong conditions on industry in respect of matters of pollution.  The local authorities are unable, through lack of funds, to deal with the awful problem of raw sewage which constantly pours into our rivers and streams throughout the country.</P>

    <Title>Garda Síochána Bill, 1971&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress I was referring to the changes in our society which pose new problems for the gardaí.  In today's society the lowering of moral standards makes the task more difficult.  I am not suggesting that this is a new situation because history has shown us that there have been many instances where the lowering of moral standards led to a state of degradation.</P>
      <P>Today the problems facing the Garda Síochána are much more sophisticated and complicated than in the past. Therefore the Garda must be modernised and sophisticated to such a degree that they can cope effectively and efficiently with the new problems, one of which is the abuse of drugs, which unfortunately seems to be on the increase. The Garda have already tackled this problem in an admirable way and they should be given every assistance so that they can grapple not so much with the unfortunate people who have become addicts as with those who import drugs and sell them to unwary young people in this city and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Garda are at least containing this danger, particularly when I read of the position in other countries.  The problem here is <Col N="1295" /> only starting but there is a danger that it will grow so long as there are people willing to pay fantastic prices for drugs. A lot of the work must be done in the home and parents must give every assistance to the Garda in their efforts to trace the suppliers.</P>
    <P>Another modern problem is crowd control.  We all agree that people have the right to protest in a legitimate way, always bearing in mind that their fellow citizens have the right freely to walk the streets of our cities.  I wonder if our gardaí are being trained adequately in crowd control.  Recently at a football match in Dublin I saw a sergeant and three gardaí first of all rescuing the referee and then splitting the crowd and handling it very cleverly. They must have been trained in crowd control because they did a wonderful job.  We are so anglicised that what happens in London and Manchester seems to have become the pattern for behaviour at matches here.  It may be said that cross-Channel and French and German police are better trained in crowd control but in the matter of controlling football mobs I think our gardaí are as good as the best.  Perhaps we have not the same problem here as regards crowds.</P>
    <P>Still I think it would be a good idea if we had a mounted police force to deal with crowds.  We boast about the superiority of the Irish horse.  I suggest we should have a mounted force of gardaí for crowd control.  A crowd may be peaceful but it can contain unruly elements and then trouble starts.  There may be panic in a crowd and there is danger in that also.  Members of a crowd may suffer from claustrophobia and this may cause panic.  I realise that initially it would be costly to establish a mounted police force but the rewards would be great. A mounted garda would have much more power; he would be better able to divide and control a crowd.  As well, crowds would tend to be more peaceful when they realised they were dealing with mounted police.  The Garda would also have better ability to protect people from those who want to stir up trouble.  We now have a population of 800,000 in Dublin.  By 1980 it will have <Col N="1296" /> risen to 1,000,000 in Greater Dublin. It is another indication of how the problems of the Garda are growing.</P>
    <P>Therefore the Garda must be developed into a modern force, not simply to stop raids but in order to ensure that our democratic institutions are safeguarded and that even the humblest citizen will have his rights guaranteed and protected.  This will cost money but although we are a small nation we should not hesitate to provide money in order to protect the rights of our citizens.</P>
    <P>It was said earlier that political influence has been used in the Garda. We will always have such accusations. They would be made even if we had a perfect force.  First of all the Garda must have the respect of the vast majority of our people.  Secondly, they must be efficient and get all possible aid to give them that efficiency.  I do not mention power in this context. They must be efficient and the people must know they are efficient and, therefore, trust them to deal with any situation.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the gardaí should be engaged only in the fight against crime, in crowd control and national security. I suggest that the ban-ghardaí should be dealing solely with the problems of women and young children or those of them who have broken the law. Thirdly, we should have a traffic corps. It is no good passing laws here to control traffic if the gardaí cannot give their full attention to it because they have so many other duties to perform. The traffic corps should deal with all traffic problems.  At present in this city the Garda Síochána are the traffic authority and all questions concerning traffic must be decided by them.  A local authority cannot erect traffic lights unless the Garda, as the traffic authority, have sanctioned them.  We find some of the best brains in the Garda force grappling with traffic problems while there are other problems in need of attention.  If we had those three divisions it might help to streamline the whole force.  The traffic corps might not at first be welcomed by motorists but eventually it would.  At present when there is a march or a <Col N="1297" /> football match we see gardaí directing traffic while there are pickpockets, <i>et cetera</i>, having a great time because the gardaí have insufficient time to give to real crowd control.</P>
    <P>The standards of our police force are as high as those of any in the world. We are fortunate that we have not had scandals such as we read about taking place very near here.  However, we have no right to believe that the Garda force will go on being as good as they are in face of the increasing difficulty facing them unless we are prepared to vote taxation so that the Garda force may have all the equipment they need, proper transport, and scientific equipment.</P>
    <P>We are facing, and we are glad of this, a growing population so our problems will become more like those of the urban areas of Europe as time goes on.  At present we have a comparatively small population.  Even in Dublin one knows a tremendous number of people.  We still have a small city or village atmosphere.  This is changing. Dublin is becoming a very consmopolitan city.  People will come to live here who will not have the standards that we have been used to and they will find it difficult to accept some of our laws just as we would find it difficult to accept the laws of Germany, France, Belgium or other countries.  Therefore, we have a growing population, our cities are becoming more cosmopolitan and crime is becoming more sophisticated.  It would be impossible to fight crime just by doing away with the squad car and putting all the men back on the beat.  We must take the best of the old system and what we need for the future.  I would like to see more gardaí on foot patrol in the centre city areas.  I know it is impossible for the gardaí to patrol in the suburbs. They have the problem of suburban vandalism to deal with.  This is a problem too, for the schools and the parents.  Vandals are mostly uneducated people, uneducated in the broad sense, not in regard to booklearning but in the general appreciation of the society in which they live.  When they are guilty of acts of vandalism they must be punished but the schools and the parents must also help in this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> A previous speaker referred to the good work done by the gardaí in youth clubs.  I know gardaí who give all their spare time to the running of youth clubs in this city.  While the present generation may not reap the full benefit of that, future generations will because young people will be trained in civics and proper citizenship. When the gardaí have the trust of the people we will have a far better society.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the gardaí for the work they have been doing in difficult circumstances.  I am saddened to read in newspapers a report of Garda unrest.  I am not suggesting that if there is unrest it should not be reported.  I should like to see any complaints the gardaí have dealt with very quickly and effectively.  I am sure the Minister would not brook any delay in dealing with their complaints.  We know it is impossible to meet all the wishes of all sections of the people but the Garda Síochána are a most important section these days.  I hope that the Minister's plan for the future will bring the force not just up to strength numerically but up to the strength to combat crime and assure that our democratic institutions will be protected against the very small minority who would destroy them.  It is the duty of every citizen to support the gardaí because they are representing the citizens when they deal with lawbreakers. If they sometimes fail it is not always their fault.  We must begin at the root of the problem by providing proper stations, the best of pay and general conditions.  The man who joins the Garda force today must be dedicated. He would not join otherwise.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that we should have a psychiatrist to examine each garda.  This may be necessary to some extent, but I do not think it is a priority.  There are sufficient young men who would make good gardaí if they got the best of training but, if aptitude tests are necessary, the vocational education committees in Dublin are already providing these so there is no great problem there.  The greatest aptitude test a garda could have would be regarding his job as a vocation, instead of just a job, because he <Col N="1299" /> believes he has a part to play in our society and the part he chooses to play is that of a garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume this Bill is intended to facilitate the better usage of our Garda force.  If that is the intention, then there are many, many little things that could be done, even as things stand, the better to utilise our existing manpower.  It could be, of course, that the intention is, as rumour has it at the moment, to enable the Government to set up a new force to ensure that the Border is not breached in any way.  Perhaps when the Minister comes to reply he will enlighten us as to whether the jurisdiction of serving chief superintendents, superintendents and men in so far as Border areas are concerned is to be replaced by a special force under a special corps of officers. If this is so, then the House is entitled to know whether or not that is the likelihood and the reasons underlying this change in policy.  If, on the other hand, it is just rumour, then the sooner rumour is scotched the better.  I hope it is rumour.  At the moment the continued existence of the Border is in doubt, in most serious doubt, and surely this would not be the time for us to create a new special force for the purpose of special Border duty, with responsibility to their own officers and not to the normal chain of command, the chain of command we have known since the Garda were first established.</P>
      <P>We have a very fine body of men but, as in every large group, they are not all saints.  Nobody will agree with that more readily than will the majority of the gardaí themselves.  There are those within the force who do not do the image of the force any good.  These people discourage those who might be willing to join from doing so.  Perhaps something could be done to get rid of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, is there any reason why there should be a non-uniformed force in our peacekeeping forces?  Is there any necessity for a special force? Is there any necessity for a &ldquo;special&rdquo; special force which does not come under the jurisdiction of the normal <Col N="1300" /> chain of command?  The operations of the Special Branch, supplemented by the &ldquo;special&rdquo; Special Branch, or the B Special Branch, as it was called not so long ago, are resented by the uniformed gardaí.  Their activities in crowd control as recently as last week were not conducive to the peace the uniformed gardaí were trying to restore at a very critical time on the other side of Merrion Square.  Do we need these? That is a question that needs to be answered.  Are they contributing anything or are they a disruptive element, disrupting peace rather than maintaining it?  This is possibly an aspect into which the Minister has examined. There is no pressing need for a special force and these men would be far more useful in uniform.</P>
    <P>I think everybody will agree that the appearance of a uniform can be beneficial.  A uniform is respected and its appearance is more likely to be conducive to the restoration of peace than is that of numbers of non-uniformed people whose identities are unknown and whose actions may be similar to those of the hooligans they are operating against.  They have no insignia to show they are a special branch and in Merrion Square last week it was pretty evident that the activities of some of the Special Branch were resented by the uniformed gardaí.  A very serious situation could have been created.  The usefulness of this particular force is very much in question.  The need for it should be further examined with a view to wiping it out altogether and putting these men back into uniform.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would question the utilisation of our forces, whether it be uniformed gardaí or non-uniformed Special Branch, in collaborating with the forces in the Six Counties.  That is a wastage of the manpower of our forces.  This should be examined urgently.  Again, would the Minister tell us when he comes to reply whether we need to send our gardaí to the English courts to prosecute people there for political offences?  If this is happening, and I have good reason to believe that it is, I would ask the Minister to explain to the House why five gardaí.  Technical Bureau people, <Col N="1301" /> fingerprint experts and ballistic experts should have been sent across to England to help in the prosecution of the two men picked up in connection with the import of arms on the &ldquo;Queen Elizabeth&rdquo; not so long ago. Is it a fact that two specimen pieces of armaments in that alleged consignment were brought over from here to aid the prosecution by the Crown on the other side of the Channel?  If that is not true no one will be more delighted to learn that it is not true than I will.  It has been suggested that it is true.  If the Minister did not know about this then it is time he did.  If it is suggested the Attorney General did not okay their going and that neither he nor the Minister had any knowledge of this, then someone has broken the chain of command and a stop should very, very quickly be put to that someone's actions.</P>
    <P>We have been assured that where political offences are concerned there will be no collaboration between our peacekeeping force and the alleged peacekeeping forces in the Six Counties and cross-channel.  Has that changed? If it has we are entitled to know when it was changed and how it came to be changed and what activities are being carried out in our name by our police forces, whether they be Special Branch or uniformed gardaí.  We are entitled to know why the change, when the change and by whom.  We are entitled to know what the most recent activities have been in the particular case I have mentioned.  I understand five of our people went over last Friday week and attested the statements already given by them.  I understand that the arms produced in evidence were in fact, supplied by these men.  That is a waste, to say nothing more, of the manpower of our peacekeeping forces.  It is a waste we can ill afford with our chronic shortage of manpower.  If these activities are taking place with the Minister's knowledge, then they should be stopped.  If they are taking place without his knowledge, then he should see to it that whoever is responsible is stopped, that we shall have no more of it and that members of the force will be utilised for the purposes for which <Col N="1302" /> they were recruited and appointed.  It is not their job to go outside this country to help prosecute people charged with political offences relating to, or directly concerned with Partition and the removal of the Border.</P>
    <P>As regards traffic control in the city, instead of wasting time talking about what could be done with more gardaí to control traffic, the Minister and his Department should lean very heavily on the Department of Local Government which in turn should lean on the local authority to get on with the job of making it possible for traffic to move in this city in the near future.  It would be little use to have more gardaí or specially trained traffic police&mdash;which I think we should have throughout the country&mdash;if we continue going blindly ahead choking up the city with developments which the road structure was not intended to carry.  Despite all the talk in my time, before it and since, nothing has been done about it and the city is being slowly choked.  All extra gardaí will do is add to the congestion, so bad will it become before many years have passed.  I sympathise with the Garda and the Department of Justice in the dilemma in which they find themselves.  It will soon be a physical impossibility to keep traffic moving and no amount of manpower will make any difference if the streets are unable to carry the amount of traffic we are trying to put through them.  This is being added to day by day without taking any of the obviously necessary steps to relieve the bottleneck. Even if it costs many millions to do so, that job must be done and if not done now it will have to be done later at much greater cost.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal about crowd control which I suppose is topical and appropriate enough on this Bill, but it would rate quite a low priority so far as I am concerned as regards what we need for our peace keeping force.  I am thinking of gardaí going around, wasting good time checking dog licences, helping in census taking and other matters which are surely not work that should be required of the gardaí today.  This matter should be re-examined and all the trivia that make up so much of the drudgery of <Col N="1303" /> a garda's life should be examined with a view to handing these tasks over to some other specialised group.  They should not clutter up Garda stations, taking up the time of the gardaí and officers with paperwork which could have no impact as far as peacekeeping is concerned.  For years the gardaí themselves have been concerned about this work with which they are still burdened to a degree greater than they should be.  To some extent removal of these duties could expand the manpower available for the purposes for which it is really needed.</P>
    <P>The conditions of premises in which the gardaí must work are in many cases stone-age.  A good deal has been and is being done and I have to doubt an even greater amount requires to be done urgently in the future not only in regard to the barracks and offices in which these men work but throughout the country in regard to the provision of a decent quota of housing by the Department of Justice for their own personnel in every sizeable town in the country.  A good start was made on this some years ago where 1,000 of these houses were commissioned by the Department.  Half of them were built by the NBA and the remainder by the Board of Works.  This job should continue to be done and should be accelerated.  I am talking not only about the improvement of housing conditions for the gardaí because in many cases their arrival in local towns places an added burden on the housing resources available.  There would be a double benefit therefore, if more houses were built for the gardaí, because not only would the members of the force benefit but local authorities would be relieved of the task of providing houses for them as they are doing in many cases at present while they have great numbers of deserving cases on the waiting list for houses not yet provided.</P>
    <P>These things could be of some value in creating a better atmosphere and better conditions for the gardaí.  They should be relieved of trivia that are no real part of a policeman's life and they should be able to devote their time entirely to police work.  I think they <Col N="1304" /> should also be given the opportunity of knowing who is working with them when they are engaged in any involved situation such as might occur at any time in the big population of a city like Dublin.  They should be at least aware of those who are supposed to be helping them from the Special Branch and there should be some way in which the ordinary garda would be able to recognise Special Branch men.  If they are to be recognised, they must be uniformed and if so, I suppose they could thereafter be regarded as members of the Garda Síochána which I advocate they should become.  At the moment there is no place for them in our society: they are not a help to uniformed gardaí and may often be a hindrance.  Very often they may be working not directly under uniformed men and can create more trouble than they can help to avert.</P>
    <P>The Garda are doing their best about traffic but it is a problem about which they cannot ultimately do very much. What they are doing is being done with very inadequate tools in that day to day decisions are taken which result in choking up the whole city.  This is happening in the towns also.  Additional gardaí can do nothing to relieve the congestion which is now becoming so great in Dublin that shortly traffic will not be able to move at all.  This is no fault of the Garda.</P>
    <P>There may well be justification for the erection of more traffic lights and this matter is said to be the prerogative of the Garda, but in the situation of drastic traffic congestion in which we find ourselves there should not be so many traffic lights in the centre of the city.  There is no substitute for a good pointsman in getting traffic to move to the best advantage.  Far from welcoming more traffic lights in the more congested streets of cities and towns I say we need less of them and more well-trained, &ldquo;born&rdquo; traffic policemen who can put through more traffic than lights can, whether time-controlled or switch-controlled. Father out from the city or the town traffic lights can take some of the burden off the gardaí and I favour that; but as congestion grows, the traffic lights now in the heart of Dublin should be taken away and reinstalled <Col N="1305" /> perhaps nearer the perimeter. As congestion further grows out there they should again be removed further out because no mechanical device can substitute for a good pointsman no matter how good it may be or how well-timed and used.  It does not give the same throughput of traffic as the human operator.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not be influenced by the pressure for more manpower by releasing men from point duty and using lights for the purpose of directing traffic.  That would be self-defeating and could not be a solution to the problem.  The local authorities and the Department of Local Government must get a move on to create greater space for the movement of traffic.  This is what we should aim at.  Nobody knows better than the Department of Justice that in the present circumstances it is not possible to have a free flow of traffic because, as one might say, you cannot put a quart into a pint measure.  This is what we are trying to do at rush hours in this city and in other towns throughout the country.  Either we have more space or there will have to be a strict clamp down on developing traffic within the city, traffic that now must get out through the bottlenecks that are there.  We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot develop within the city while, at the same time, not spend money eradicating these bottlenecks.</P>
    <P>In regard to whatever new arrangements may be made in respect of the gardaí, we look forward to hearing the Minister indicate whether the question of a special Border force is merely rumour or whether such a force is being contemplated.  I hope such is not being contemplated but if it is perhaps the Minister will be able to enlighten the House as to why it is necessary, how it will be constituted, whether it will be officered by men already in the force, whether it will be an entirely new force, whether it will be under the chain of command in any way of the existing Garda command structure, or whether it will be a free floating force under some new agent and not connected with the Garda in the strict sense.  However, <Col N="1306" /> I hope all of this is only rumour and that we are not discussing this Bill under a false pretence and that it is for the general purposes indicated by the Minister, and on the basis that it has been discussed by the other speakers.  I would hope, too, that there may be some useful purpose in the passing of the Bill but, candidly, I cannot readily see any such purpose. Of course only those working from within realise what disabilities the present laws may be imposing in respect of the gardaí and in respect of the utilisation of the force.  I was not aware that there was such a disability to the extent that a Bill such as this is necessary.  If the Bill is for the purpose of eradicating the type of disadvantages that we have experienced already, it will improve the role of the force and will be well worth the time given by the House to its consideration. Before the next Stage we will know whether the Bill is for the purpose of creating the rumoured force I have mentioned.  If it is we would have to be well satisfied that such a force was necessary and justified and would be useful and helpful in so far as the future of our peace-keeping is concerned before we could support the Bill.</P>
    <P>While our Garda force is excellent we must not, at the same time, do too much back-clapping in regard to them merely because they are the force in command and in authority in so many ways connected with our daily lives.  Where we are aware that there are a few within that force who are not a credit to it we should not be afraid to condemn because those few are not creating a good image for the force but rather are being detrimental to it in so far as the public are concerned. They are resented by the vast majority of their own colleagues who know them better, perhaps, than anybody else.  Those who deserve our praise, that is, the vast majority, should receive it but the others should receive our condemnation and there should be some manner by which they could be removed from the force.  The force consists of a large body of people and like any large body, contains people who are not all good.  There are a few in the Garda Síochána whom we would <Col N="1307" /> be better off without not only from the point of view of their own colleagues but also in so far as the public are concerned.  Because of the actions of these few, a bad image can be given to the force generally.</P>

      <P>Last week Deputy Blaney was described as a warmonger but there is a danger this week that he might be described as a rumour-monger. However, I shall leave that to the public to decide.  An increase in the Garda force need give no rise whatever to any fear on the part of any law-abiding citizen.  I would like to pay tribute to the Garda force not only for what they are doing now but for what they have done through the years.  As a member of the party that established this force, I am proud to be able to pay tribute to them.  Last week television viewers throughout the country watched gardaí trying to protect an embassy.  Would we not expect the same effort by the British police if our embassy in Britain was attacked?  There must be adequate means by which the gardaí can be protected in the course of their duties especially on duties such as the one I have just mentioned.  It was galling to see the behaviour of some of the troublemakers outside the British Embassy.  I would say that at least 95 per cent of the people who took part in that protest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course.  Certain standards are required before one is accepted as a recruit in the force.  In the past recruitment was reasonably easy but with so many jobs available to young men today they will not be very anxious to have a job in which, at times, they must work during the night and in which their lives are endangered.  Therefore, it might not be quite so easy in the future to recruit martyrs for dear old Ireland.  Of course, there are rules to be observed at the training depot in Templemore but some of these are nothing short of tyrannical.  Is it not strange to hear that the recruits must have three haircuts in a week?</P>

      <P>With these tyrannical rules in existence you will not get young men to join the force.  While I do not hold with long hair-do's, neither do I agree with making the gardaí bald.  These are the things that create a rebellious feeling among the gardaí.</P>
      <P>It is very interesting to compare the conditions of criminals with those of the gardaí, especially in the country areas.  The criminal has a nice, centrally heated cell; he has his meals served up to him.  The garda often occupies a damp room.  If he hangs up a coat it is green-mouldy after a few days.  You are looking at me, Sir, but I have been listening to this debate all day and a certain amount of freedom has been given.</P>

From the way some unscrupulous solicitors present a case, one would think that the garda himself was the criminal and not the actual criminal.

      <P>Young men will not go into the force to be faced with this set-up.  Fair play has been given to the gardaí by the Conroy Report.  Judge Conroy is a countyman of my own. Seeing that at one time Mayor Lynch hanged his own guilty son in the name of justice, I am glad to see justice being dispensed by a man from my own area.</P>
      <P>I wonder will the wastage we have at the moment be compensated for by the numbers who will be recruited.  I think it is a matter of locking the stable door when the horse has gone.  The only hope now is that the field gate below will be locked and that the horse can be kept in.</P>
      <P>I often give a lift to people coming from my town to Dublin and have asked them how many policemen they have seen in crossing the countryside, and they say: &ldquo;Not one&rdquo;.  I have used the occasion to say that it shows the amount of peace we have here.  If you go to the North of Ireland you will find a police state.  We have not reached that and, please God, we never shall.  Nevertheless there should be a greater increase in garda numbers than the Minister is providing for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In England the police do not use squad cars of the type we have here. They use a little pepped-up van that can travel at up to 80 or 90 miles an hour, although, to look at it, you would hardly take it to the scrap yard.  That is how the criminal is caught off-side. I would recommend the use of this type <Col N="1310" /> of van here in order to apprehend criminals.  The squad car here has the light flashing on the roof and the criminal sees it and goes up a side street and escapes.  I am not saying that the gardaí have not done wonderful work with the squad cars, but this &ldquo;Here we come&rdquo; sign gives the criminal advance warning.  Therefore, I would recommend to the Minister that he would consider the suggestion I have made.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the time of gardaí has been wasted in guarding banks. The banks have their own man there with a little bit of hardware in his pocket that will deal with these gentlemen when they come in.  It is not fair to have gardaí placed outside these banks, as has been proved already in this city; I do not like to refer to it. I do not see why they should make martyrs out of themselves when the bank could provide greater protection for itself than that of a mere garda with a baton.  The criminal will take his own way out and the garda has no chance.  Of course if it was a man-to-man combat many of these criminals would not get away.</P>
    <P>I should like to inquire if there have been changes or if it is proposed to make changes in the standard qualifications for the gardaí, and if those changes relate to height, the standard of education, or what.  I hope that if such changes are implemented they will not interfere with the type of garda we get.  A man who might be under the requisite height could be tough, the type of man criminals would not expect to be a garda, and with a little bit of judo he could wrap some of these fellows around his back and they would have great respect for him.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a greater knowledge of first aid among the gardaí.  I know they get a certain amount of training in first aid.  Never was there greater need to save life than at the moment.  The function of a garda is to save life and property. First aid can play a very important part in saving life.</P>
    <P>Once again I should like to pay tribute to the Garda and I hope that the few points I have raised will be noted by the powers-that-be.  I know <Col N="1311" /> the minds of the Garda throughout the country.  My people before me were interested in the establishment of the force.  We have a certain degree of pride in them.  I am glad to see that they are keeping a high standard and I hope that will continue.</P>

      <P>The fact that the Garda force are about to be increased by some 600 will be received with joy and a sense of relief throughout our country.  Many will say that this is indeed long overdue.  It has come about as a result of public clamour for an increase in the Garda force.  Over the past number of years anxiety and widespread indignation have been felt by all our people as a result of the diminishing force and the vast increase in the incidence of crime.</P>
      <P>Almost all of our public authorities have had to protest publicly and send representations and deputations to Ministers for Justice in recent times demanding that the force be increased in order to protect life and property.  It has been a matter of astonishment to us all that successive Ministers for Justice did not act quickly to increase the force, especially having regard to the political climate in which we live. The Minister for Justice and his predecessor were guilty of dereliction of duty to this House and to our country. They were guilty of the greatest crime of all, that of leaving the lives and property of large masses of our people in cities, and towns, and villages and in the countryside, devoid of adequate protection.</P>
      <P>A large number of our citizens have been stricken with fear: fear of attack in their homes, especially the lonely and the isolated, fear of attack on the streets of our towns and cities, fear of attack in their places of business.  These attacks have been growing and many have resulted in tragedy.  Despite that worsening situation, despite our endeavours in this House, we failed to impress upon the Minister for Justice the urgency and the necessity for increasing the Garda force and giving our people the protection to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increase in the force is long <Col N="1312" /> overdue, as I have said.  We expect to have a force of 7,560.  I assert that it will take that force a long time to catch up on the backlog of crime, and to attain normalcy again.  The Minister admitted in his speech that crime has increased considerably.  Our prisons are full to capacity.  Indeed, there are two and three prisoners where only one should be in a given cell.  The force have been recognised as being inadequate for a number of years.  The force as constituted were, to the minds of many men expert in the field of crime, wrongly and wastefully deployed.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Conroy Report.  The Minister boasts and gloats in his speech that he has implemented in very large measure the recommendations in that report in respect of better pay, conditions of employment, leave of absence, rest periods, and proper pay for overtime worked.  I assert that the Minister has welshed on the Conroy Report.  Part of our problem in respect of the lack of detection of crime has been that the Conroy Report was not implemented by the Minister in the spirit and intention of the report especially in the matter of payment for overtime.  This concession was given grudgingly, if at all.  There was a marked reluctance to pay the Garda adequately for extra duties.  This has had serious repercussions. The Minister should have been prepared for the consequences of payment for overtime on the acceptance of this report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not pursue the matter, but I was about to make the point that this was in very large measure attributable to a marked reluctance on the part of garda to do extra duties for which the Minister was not prepared to pay them.  This destroys the whole concept of the policeman who is supposed to be on duty all the time.  It was, therefore, a great pity that for pecuniary reasons the Minister and his Department sabotaged this essential part of the report and made <Col N="1313" /> impossible the proper utilisation of the marginal force that was available in our various centres.</P>
      <P>In recent times the Garda force in this country have been run down to a new and dangerous low.  Crime detection and prevention, as such, are things of the past, and it has become all the more difficult to deal with crime.  One could talk for a long time about the recommendations of the Conroy Report but this might not be in order.  The obstinacy of the Minister in refusing to apply the appropriate rates of pay as laid down in that report, especially for overtime work, was a grave mistake.</P>

      <P>We had to contend with a bad situation, and it was aggravated out of all proportion by a stupid decision to close Garda stations. This has left our people in many parts of Ireland open to attack from thugs and gangsters of all kinds.  I hope that in the present climate there will be a re-think on the matter of closing Garda stations in rural Ireland.  On every occasion that there has been a closure we know that the adjoining Garda station were unable to take on the additional duties because their own numbers were depleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy who spoke before me referred to the utilisation of so many of our gardaí for the protection of our banks.  I have protested about this on many occasions in this House.  It is grossly unfair to the rest of the population in a small centre where there are only a few gardaí to maintain law and order that a number of them are utilised day in and day out standing outside the banks.  The rest of the population in the country are also property owners and ratepayers, who have their lives and property to protect. The banking institutions in this country with their vast resources should be able to protect their own properties and funds.  The Minister for Justice should insist that they should take over the protection of their properties.  It is pathetic, especially in a small rural town, where there <Col N="1314" /> are only half a dozen gardaí, to see them outside the bank as if it was the only thing of importance in that community. We know it is important but it is no more important than the property of the rest of the community.  If there were sufficient gardaí they could stand there night and day, but the fact of the matter is that there are not sufficient gardaí and they should not be utilised in protecting banks alone.  In these modern times, with the sophisticated mechanisation available to banking institutions, they should be able to guard their own property.  The Garda force are wrongly used in protecting banks to the exclusion of other property in the particular area.  We also wish to see the Garda becoming less involved in menial tasks of dealing with parking offences, traffic wardens, collection of dog licences and all those paltry things which could quite easily be passed on to some more appropriate body.</P>
    <P>There has been talk here of improvement in the facilities of the Garda force.  We should like to see our Garda force ultra modern with the best equipment in the world.  We know they are respected by our people and we expect them to act in a courteous and humane manner at all times.  Some of the appliances which they are obliged to use are very primitive, archaic and outmoded.  It is well known in this city that criminal minded people are far in advance of the gardaí in respect of many devices.  The utilisation of the patrol car is understandable but its use in rural Ireland leaves much to be desired.  Many of us in this House have always asserted that no one can effectively replace the man on the beat. He is the person who has been primarily responsible for maintaining law and order in this country and every other country.  The movement away from the man on the beat is something to be deplored.  The action of the patrol man was the most successful deterrent against crime of any kind.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us his views on the desirability of utilising more and more the police force for patrol duty of the kind I have in mind.  It is of great astonishment to many of us in the towns and villages of <Col N="1315" /> this country that policemen who were always known to be on duty at a particular point to carry out a certain beat are now no longer to be seen.  Our people are worried at the length of time it took to get a garda when serious incidents involving attack, robbery and bloodshed occurred.  This is also true in respect of serious accidents.  There is something fundamentally wrong when you do not see a garda on patrol duty in a town or village and when it takes a considerable time to get one to the scene of a crime.  I appeal to the Minister to desist from emphasis on the patrol car. Some people unfairly and wrongfully allege that it is merely joyriding around.  As I have said, I do not think anything can beat the policeman on foot who has specific duties to perform in the area of his patrol and who knows intimately all the people and the property in that area.  He cannot be replaced and I trust the Minister will agree with me.</P>
    <P>We are talking in circumstances in which the Minister admits our detection rate in respect of crime amounts approximately to 50 per cent all over the country.  In other words, half the crimes committed are not solved.  This is the position at a time when the incidence of crime has increased by 20 per cent, almost, in the past 12 months. In the political climate in which we are living it is fair to assume that major crime is increasing.  As I said earlier there are people who live in fear.</P>
    <P>I had to bring to the Minister's attention by way of question the fact that old people living alone in isolated areas were being attacked in my constituency, beaten nearly to death and robbed of their possessions.  As yet no one has been caught for these nefarious crimes.  This is a fairly regular occurrence. There is widespread vandalism. Pickpocketing is rife in the cities, old people are being picked on in particular and are subjected to assault by thugs.  Thuggery is on the increase. There is evidence of brutal assaults. Breaking and entering is on the increase according to statistics.</P>
    <P>There is fear throughout the land <Col N="1316" /> that there has been an abandonment of the people by the Minister for Justice. Worse still, up to now there has been no redress for such victims.  One reported a crime and that was the end of it.  It has not been the fault of the police because they have been inundated with work at a time when they were frustrated in their attempts to improve their working conditions. A grudging Minister and his Department did nothing for them and their morale has been at a very low ebb.</P>
    <P>I hope to see that situation improved in the near future.  We had reached a sorry stage when the feeling was abroad among criminal elements that crime does pay, that by reason of lack of Garda supervision there was licence to do virtually what one liked.  We have had too many criminals getting away with too much and the Minister did nothing about it.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House unduly on this important measure but I should like to refer to the Minister's speech and the reference to the Report of the Conroy Commission. He spoke about improvements in Garda conditions of employment.  We want to have a happy and contented Garda force, properly paid for the work they do.  The Minister should appreciate how important that is from many aspects&mdash;that gardaí should be properly paid so that they do not have to resort to any other means to maintain themselves.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear that something is being done to provide for Garda widows.  They have been shabbily treated by this House and by successive Ministers for Justice.  By reason of the very small pensions they had, many of them found it necessary to apply for non-contributory old age pensions. Unfortunately, as a result of a small increase in their pensions in recent times, many Garda widows partially lost their pensions as well as some perquisites such as free electricity, free travel and free television licences.  I sincerely hope that the provision now being made for Garda widows will be adequate, and I ask the Minister to consult with the Minister for Social Welfare so that reductions, curtailments or withdrawls of widows' pensions <Col N="1317" /> or old age pensions will be avoided in respect of Garda widows with slender means.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's absence I mentioned my concern about the continuing closures of Garda stations in rural areas and the inability of neighbouring Garda stations to deal adequately with the needs of the people.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that he will desist from his policy of closing these stations and that he will even consider the possibility of reopening some of those that have been closed.  This would give new hope to our already panic-stricken people, and we can point to many areas where this is the position.</P>
    <P>Naturally I support the idea that there should be better housing conditions for the gardaí.  Many of the houses at the moment leave much to be desired.  I was pleased to learn that the services of the National Building Agency have been utilised for the acceleration of the drive to build houses for the gardaí.  Having the State depending solely on the Board of Works could not have the desired effects.  Indeed in respect of a body like the Garda, I would not be at all surprised if I saw the Minister establishing his own work force to deal with the important matter of adequate accommodation, but if the services of the NBA were used more and more it might meet the situation.</P>
    <P>I rose in this debate to express my appreciation of our Garda force.  I appreciate the difficulties under which they work.  Many of us were deeply distressed of late when we saw them under attack from our own citizens.  I know that our citizens on that occasion felt enraged by what had been happening in another part of our country and what had been done to our people there.  Allowing for that indignation and the rage which we all experienced, we should respect our own forces.  I trust that respect will be forthcoming in the future.  We should all in this House be concerned about the welfare, the efficiency, the respect for and the morale of the Garda force.  I assure the Minister and his Department that we will render every assistance we can to <Col N="1318" /> bring about that happy situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are to have an increase of 1,000 in the Garda force but to get rid of some of the unemployment there should be an increase of 2,000.  If we employed more gardaí we would have to spend more money on their salaries and their training but as against that we would save a tremendous amount on malicious claims and increasing crime because people are getting away with it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy mentioned smaller villages in which there are no gardaí and gardaí have to travel five or ten miles to them.  I shall speak about Dublin.  In Dublin there are police stations which have just been built and they are overcrowded already.  At one time when I asked a question of the previous Minister for Justice there were 24 gardaí in the Coolock Garda station; there are 37 there now.  That station was only built about a year ago but it will be too small for the number required for that area.  The area policed from that station is bigger than Limerick city and much bigger than Galway.  There are 37 gardaí there including sergeants.  Galway has something like 75 gardaí for a smaller population.  I know there is a surrounding area of farmland there but the Coolock area extends to Malahide, Raheny and Santry.</P>
      <P>Areas of Dublin, north and south, are completely under-manned.  I have got letters&mdash;members of the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Parties have got them too&mdash;from people whose houses have been broken into.  They get the gardaí but the only way the gardaí can catch the person concerned is by catching him in the act elsewhere and having him admit this particular crime. There are gangs, not always from the poorer areas but from many of the wealthier areas, roaming round in Dublin.  The gardaí do their best to stop them but find it impossible because they are understaffed.  I know of a case where a petrol bomb was thrown into oil in a fish and chip shop. The whole place went on fire and there could have been three or four people killed.  There are not sufficient gardaí to go round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the hours were reduced, following <Col N="1319" /> the Conroy Report, overtime&mdash;I do not know whether on the direction of the Minister, his Department or the men's immediate superiors&mdash;has not been paid to many gardaí.  Their hours have been very nearly halved over a number of years.  I do not know whether the superiors have some incentive to keep costs down but they are giving practically no overtime. Where overtime is given the station sergeant has to sign seven forms before a man can be paid the money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <P>I am afraid, Deputy, this does not arise on the Bill. As I pointed out to Deputy Treacy, it has no relevance.  It would be a matter for the Estimate but not for the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The gardaí should be used outside doing the work they joined the force to do and typists or clerks could do the work they are doing in the station.</P>
      <P>Instead of increasing the number of gardaí when the hours were reduced there was a reduction because of people retiring, dying, <i>et cetera</i>.  The numbers were allowed to dwindle.  Now we are increasing the number by 1,000.  I reckon we should increase the force by 2,000, 2,500 or 3,000.</P>
      <P>I only agreed with one point made by Deputy Blaney.  When he was a Minister he did not tell the Minister for Justice what he told the Dáil today. We have got too many gardaí doing office work, delivering summonses, dealing with census forms and dog licences.  All these things could be done in another way and let the gardaí do the work they chose to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was a practising solicitor so he knows the amount of Garda time taken up in courts.  I have often gone to court for the renewal or confirmation of a licence.  The garda must be there and the judge tells him to go to the end and wait.  I have seen 40 or 50 gardaí waiting.  Surely there should be a lay-out of hours so that ten people would be heard in the first hour and ten people in the next and so on.  As it is, the gardaí must wait on to suit the judge rather than the judge suiting them.  You will find 50 gardaí <Col N="1320" /> in court, some with criminal charges. You may find a superintendent there for a licensing application which could have been ratified, provided there was no objection to the licence, without going to court.  Very often when the gardaí go to court after months of work the people concerned are let off with a warning.</P>
    <P>A greater number of gardaí are required for the Dublin area.  There are duties we do not think of like the policing of Leinster House, the embassies, Dublin Airport and Aras an Uachtaráin.  These things take gardaí away from their normal duties.  Then there is the traffic problem.  I agree with Deputy Blaney that it is a bottleneck. The city is getting bigger and no matter what the gardaí do they cannot control the traffic problem.  It was suggested at one time that staggering working hours might lead to a better opportunity of regulating the traffic but, so far, nothing has come of that suggestion.</P>
    <P>In the last few years, particularly in the last two years, the gardaí have had extra work to do.  One of these is guarding the banks.  As Deputy Treacy said, they get no payment for this.  If a private individual needs Garda protection he must pay for it.  I do not see why the banks should not pay.  They are private concerns.</P>
    <P>At the drop of a hat there is a parade.  You mention it and they will march.  These parades present certain difficulties.  Deputy Blaney does not want a Special Branch.  Now I wonder why?  At the moment we have people threatening business people.  A premises was burned right beside me the other day because someone thought that it should close.  People were subjected to threatening telephone calls: Close, or else!</P>
    <P>More police are required.  I do not think 1,000 more will be enough.  I think the figure should be 2,000 or 2,500.  The existing force cannot cope with all the work.  There has been an increase in bank robberies.  I do not know what percentage of these robbers were caught, but I am sure if it was 10 per cent that is as much as it was.  Violence cannot be controlled if the strength of the force is inadequate. <Col N="1321" /> Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick of Cavan suggested we should have riot squads.  I agree with that.  These squads should be properly equipped to enable them to police the country properly.</P>
    <P>As I said, Deputy Blaney is against the Special Branch.  He seems to think that the 1,000 proposed recruits are for the purpose of having a special &ldquo;O'Malley Brigade&rdquo; to hamper Deputy Blaney and his friends.  At least, that is all I could get out of what he said.  If these men are needed on the Border I do not see why they should not be used there.  Wherever there is trouble that is where the police must be.  Oddly enough, Deputy Blaney does not want them on the Border at all.  I believe the Special Branch should be increased in number.  I do not know of any country which has not got a special branch of some kind.  I think recruiting 2,000 or 2,500 more men would be a good investment; the increased numbers would be more than compensated for by the fact that local authorities and the Central Government would no longer be required to pay out huge claims for malicious damage, such a claim as we will have to meet for the British Embassy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions in this Bill.  Appeals have come from all over the country for an increase in the number of gardaí.  The need for this increase is underlined by the rising crime rate.  The force is under strength.  It is not equipped as it should be equipped and there are many shortcomings in facilities.  The Minister has received resolutions from local authorities all over the country demanding more gardaí.</P>
      <P>I join with those who have asked the Minister to implement the outstanding recommendations of the Conroy Report. I appeal to the Minister to make conditions such as will restore confidence and the happy relationship that existed and which seems to have disappeared. Much remains to be done from the point of view of improving conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a word now about widows of gardaí.  They have <Col N="1322" /> been hit by inflation and the pensions some of them draw bear very little relationship to the present value of money.  They are at a disadvantage. Above anything else we must have a happy and contented police force.  This is most important.  Perhaps more than in the case of any other group of State employees we should do everything possible to ensure that not only do they get but appear to get a fair deal. They have a difficult job to do at times and particularly in recent times they have had an especially difficult job to do and sometimes a very unpopular job.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one aspect of Garda duties.  I think it is appropriate to do so on a Bill such as this. Possibly, I would prefer to deal with the matter in another way, but the opportunity which presents itself might not be available to me again if the other means by which I would hope to raise it failed.  I want to deal with the subject-matter of a number of questions which I put to the Minister in past months dealing directly with the duties of members of the Garda Síochána.  I hope that the increased membership will not be used to allow gardaí to engage in the activities to which I now wish to refer.  Only today, as a trade union official, I attended a meeting of trade unionists who were locked out of work because they used their constitutional right to join a trade union.  This morning, I discovered that while we were at the meeting we were kept under observation and those who came to the meeting or left the meeting, including myself, were kept under observation by gardaí.  I do not want to go into detail.  I mention it primarily because we are discussing a Bill to increase the membership of the Garda Síochána and I think we are entitled to question and probe the use to which the force is sometimes put.  At the end of October last this trade dispute to which I refer began at the premises of North Kilkenny Meat Exports, Limited, at Freshford, County Kilkenny, when 15 workers out of 21 who joined the Irish Transport and General Workers Union were locked out of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would permit me finish what I have to say on this point.  They arrived at their place of work, not knowing they were going to be locked out, at the normal starting time.  The manager of the plant had the gate locked and he also had the local sergeant there&mdash;I shall not say to assist him&mdash;but certainly, the action the local sergeant took, of stopping the cars of those who were locked out, checking their licences and insurance, their tyres, <i>et cetera,</i> while those going into work were not stopped, conveyed the impression to these men that they were some kind of criminals because of what they had done.  I think the Minister will agree this sort of thing should not happen, that gardaí should not be used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I can supply the Minister with more details about this matter into which I would ask him to hold an inquiry.  I tried to do it by means of questions but in replying to questions on this subject the Minister had wrong information, information I know to be untrue.  I can prove this.</P>
      <P>When we have a Garda sergeant stopping or holding up in the street people who are honouring an official trade union picket and questioning them on what was said to them at the picket line, and when we have the employer telling people who do not pass the picket that they must not leave the area until they have been interviewed by the local sergeant, I think we are entitled to examine the position.  We are entitled to an inquiry.  As a trade union official I am responsible for these men who have been out of work now for 16 weeks.</P>

      <P>I shall simply pose those few questions.  I should like to know why, on a certain date, people who honoured a picket line were held up and questioned by a Garda sergeant with a view to ascertaining why they did not pass the picket.  They were asked what had been said to them by those on the picket line.  Another incident I might quote concerns what happened to me while driving on the Ashbourne road.  On that occasion I was followed by a patrol car which was manned by a sergeant and a garda. While they followed my car, the blue light on their vehicle continued flashing so that one would get the impression that I was a criminal of some kind. Having passed me, they stopped in front of me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I want to know is whether the proposed extra gardaí are to be used for activities of the nature I have just described because if such is to be the case, I could not support the Bill.  All the sergeant had to say to me on that particular occasion was that the rear number plate on my car was dirty.  At the same time that car was escorting two lorries from Northern Ireland that had passed picket lines.  One of the lorries had no number plate at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish these matters to be investigated.  The Garda are being misled in this situation.  They are <Col N="1325" /> taking advice from outside to which they should not listen at all.  In order to carry out their duties fairly they should not listen to one side of a story only.  On the 16th December last, in reply to a supplementary question, the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>On that occasion I told the Minister that there were two patrol cars with each consignment of horse meat but the Minister replied that such was not the case.  I merely wish to point out to the Minister that his information was not accurate. Since then there has been only one patrol car with most consignments.</P>
      <P>From what I have witnessed during the past 16 weeks, I am concerned about the activities of the Garda.  The activities of the Garda Síochána should be examined and an inquiry held. Members of the force should not be engaged in providing encouragement because that is what they are doing indirectly in so far as lorries from outside the Republic are concerned.  In this way the rights of workers according to the Constitution, are being denied to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed the Deputy to develop a point but at this stage I advise the Deputy to deal with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point that I wished to make on that particular subject.  I did so because I considered it relevant to the Bill.  I wanted to emphasise that particular aspect of the matter so that the Minister may become aware of what can happen through no fault of any individual in the force but what can happen, possibly, from outside influences and pressures.  I hope that these isolated incidents will not be allowed continue.  There is much useful and urgent work that members of the garda must undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the number of <Col N="1326" /> mobile patrols would have a bearing on the matters I have raised in so far as I have definite information regarding patrol cars being used to escort consignments of horse meat from a particular plant.  As many as 20 gardaí are being used at any one time on this task while the crime rate is rising steadily.  We all welcome the extra facilities being made available to the Garda.  The provision of additional cars and improved radio equipment is very necessary.  The figures quoted by the Minister of the increase in crime <i>et cetera</i> are no reflection on the gardaí because they have been working under tremendous pressure over the past number of years, pressure that leads to frustration and discontent.  I would urge the Minister to continue his efforts to ensure that discontent is diminished and eventually abolished from the force.</P>
    <P>The provision of Garda stations and new living quarters should be accelerated. In many cases the gardaí are still living in buildings that were inherited from their predecessors.  The force has a very high tradition of service to the community to live up to.  That high tradition can be maintained only by increasing the numbers and improving the conditions of the gardaí.</P>
    <P>In regard to the matters to which I have referred.  I could go into much more detail to spotlight the type of outside pressure that is sometimes brought to bear on members of the force, pressures which should not be exerted from any quarter.  The gardaí should be able to carry out their duty in an independent way; they should be able to preserve the peace without fear or favour.  Furthermore, they should not accept wild accusations or jump to conclusions.  I am referring to the incidents in Freshford in my own constituency. People who are locked out of work should not be made feel that they are criminals.  People who honour pickets should not be made feel they have broken the law.  Lorries from outside the State can come in and flout the regulations regarding registration number plates, while a citizen like myself can be pulled up for having a dirty number plate.  When such incidents as those to which I have referred occur they should be investigated and the <Col N="1327" /> law should be applied in as fair a way as possible, as it is in 99.99 per cent of cases.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is very difficult to convince many members of the trade union I represent that the law is being applied fairly in the Freshford area at present.  I would hope that the doubts and suspicions which have been aroused and the questions I have posed here tonight would be examined further. I should hope there would be sound explanations for them.  However, when I came out from the trade union meeting this morning I found that down the road everybody that attended that meeting was being observed, on whose instructions I should like to know.  Members of the force do not, as a rule, do things on their own initiative unless they are pretty certain of something happening.  The 15 people in Freshford should not be made feel inferior in the eyes of the law as against their employer, and the sooner that is cleared up the better.  I can supply dates, times and witnesses in relation to what I have quoted here, if the Minister requires this.  The reason I refer to the matter on this Bill is that I believe it is appropriate seeing that we are providing for more gardaí.</P>
    <P>I would hope that this measure would make the people of this country and their property somewhat safer than they have been in the past, and that the provisions contained in the Bill will result in an increase in the crime detection rate.  If there are any other measures like this that the Minister wants to introduce into this House to improve the conditions or the equipment of the members of the force, then he can expect full support from this party.  If we have any criticism to make it is that not enough is contained in this Bill.  We hope that the Minister will have further Bills to bring into the House and further steps to take to improve the situation of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I am in very close touch with the Garda force in my constituency.  I have the greatest respect for that force.  At all times they are prepared to discuss any problems <Col N="1328" /> that may arise.  They are prepared to use their discretion.  They are prepared to give the benefit of the doubt if it is in their power to do so.  They are very helpful to a youth who has the misfortune to break the law or to commit a small breach of the regulations. He can go to a member of the Garda, to a sergeant, or a superintendent, or a chief superintendent if need be, and those gentlemen are always prepared to talk to him, to discuss the offence and to help him.  That has been the attitude of the Garda since they were established about 50 years ago and put in a very sound position under the commissionership of the late and well-known General Eoin O'Duffy.</P>
      <P>I sometimes call into the Garda barracks.  On one occasion I referred to the condition of the barracks.  I was told by a very well-known police officer who met with a tragic accident and was killed outside Sligo only a few months ago&mdash;he was a great friend of mine&mdash;that plans were being prepared, money was being allocated and a good job would be done on the Garda barracks in the near future.  In my opinion it will be a long time before that job is done: like the extension jobs, the reconstruction jobs and the new buildings that are on the waiting list.  Many patched jobs were done instead of major repairs.  A thorough job should be done to provide comfortable accommodation for the force. I should like to mention the closing of Garda barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The force would be increased if what I am about to suggest were done by the Minister.  In my constituency and in many other constituencies the force has been reduced considerably and Garda barracks have been closed down.  One goes with the other.  The result is that crime goes undetected.  In some areas people live in dread.  A most unusual crime was committed in Sligo.  One evening an eleven-year-old child disappeared. This was reported immediately but, through lack of co-operation and lack of contact between the <Col N="1329" /> Garda and the people, that crime went undetected.  Later on, the remains were found.  After all the work, and effort, and hardship that went into the investigation of this crime, the culprit was never found.</P>
      <P>It is admitted by the public&mdash;and the public are not bad judges&mdash;that the Garda have lost contact with them. The squad car is driven around the country manned by two members of the force.  They see the people on the roads and they go through the villages but there is no contact with them. There is a big difference between having a squad car driving through the village of Strandhill and turning at the seashore, and having a sergeant and four gardaí in the area in contact with the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was always said from these benches that it was unsound economics to close a Garda barracks.  When complaints are made from these benches about the closing of barracks the answer we get is that it is now more economic and that it may provide a better service for the public.  We have the proof of it now.  In many cases, through no fault of the Garda, the information is not forthcoming to the young men who go around in the squad cars.  In the early days we had Garda barracks dotted all over the country.  This meant that money circulated&mdash;much more money than is put into circulation amongst the people by having a £2,000 squad car on the roads.  We have today in some villages perhaps one garda. There is a garda station on the road between Mullingar and Edgeworthstown and for years there was one garda stationed there. We have villages that always had four gardaí and a sergeant and now they only have a sergeant and one garda.  I suggest to the Minister, particularly at this stage when our country is in a very serious state due to the Border situation, that Garda barracks be opened at Strandhill, that there be an increased Garda force in Dromahair, that Garda barracks be opened in places like Ballintubber and that the force be increased all around.  It would not be money wasted if this were done.  If we had young gardaí in all those small villages all over the <Col N="1330" /> country it would add considerably to the security of the country and to a reduction in the number of crimes committed.</P>

      <P>Although this has been a long debate in general the terms of the Bill have been welcomed.  A great deal of other things have been said but basically the Bill has been generally approved by the House.  So many points have been made that I cannot guarantee in the time available to deal with them all. As so often happens in replying to a debate like this it is easier to deal at the outset with the last point that was made.  In this instance it is a point which was made not alone by Deputy McLaughlin but by quite a number of other Deputies as well.  It is the question of the closure of rural stations of which I was accused throughout this debate.  I would like to put the position in this regard clearly before the House so that they will have what in fact it is.  I became Minister for Justice on the 7th May, 1970.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I never will. Since that date no Garda stations have been closed, apart from those on which decisions had already been taken and arrangements to close them had been made well in advance of the date I became Minister.  I found then that without causing considerable problems to a large number of people, as a result of the arrangements made, I could not interfere with the closure of those stations.  Apart from those two or so stations, which were not closed by my decision, no stations have been closed since May, 1970.  That is the position and therefore I think it is quite wrong for Deputies to refer to this as if it were a continuing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was done some years ago for a good reason and if I had felt that it would not be too risky a policy in relation to the protection of people in rural areas I would have continued that policy.  I am afraid we have a tendency now that we did not have before for certain crimes, particularly of violence, to be committed in rural <Col N="1331" /> areas, not by people from those areas, or even people connected with them in any way or indeed from any other rural area, but by people who travel from urban areas by motor car.  It is part of our changing pattern of crime and is one that quite frankly can only be dealt with by a highly mechanised, organised police force with good communications.</P>
    <P>That is why in the last year I have placed so much emphasis on this and why we had to double the provision in the Estimates last year for cars.  That is why I have made such elaborate arrangements with regard to a radio service which, within a matter of about five months from now, will cover the whole country, whereas the previous plan would not in fact have had it covered for about four years.  It is a type of crime that it is difficult for the man on the beat, as it were, to deal with.  The man on the beat, the local &ldquo;bobby&rdquo;, is an ideal man to deal with crime in a local area when that crime originates in that area, but, increasingly, we are finding that the crime does not originate in a local area.  It is not local people who perpetrate the crime but people travelling in cars from a city or town 20 or 30 miles away, who perpetrate the crime and the local man is only of limited use in solving that crime.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk in the course of the debate about the morale of the Garda Síochána and about alleged unrest in it.  I do not want to minimise any unrest there may be but at the same time I would be unfair to everyone if I did not say that the alleged unrest is greatly exaggerated. I have consulted the Commissioner specifically on this point on several occasions.  While he says there are grievances and a feeling of unrest in certain areas in relation to certain things, and undoubtedly that is so, there is no question of it being widespread, or of there being general unrest, or of morale in general in the force being bad.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that morale generally in the force will be made bad if members of the force are continuously being told that their morale <Col N="1332" /> is bad, that there is widespread unrest, that there are protest meetings of one kind or another being held continuously. There are meetings being held, of course, by members of the Garda Síochána, as they have been almost since the foundation of the force 50 years ago, but nowadays every meeting held is described as a protest meeting. Meetings are held from time to time where grievances are discussed. This has always been so but unfortunately even quite trivial things and very localised things tend to be shown up as national issues, which they are not.</P>
    <P>I am not complaining that these matters get coverage but I believe that it is not in the national interest to have a situation where unrest or lack of morale is almost created by the very statements made in relation to these perfectly normal meetings that are held from time to time.  The purpose of gardaí, or indeed anyone else in an organisation, holding a meeting is normally to discuss pay or conditions or grievances of different types.  The disciplinary regulations which I made at the end of last year recognised the fact of these meetings, the right to hold them and to discuss matters of interest to members of the force.</P>
    <P>I will do all in my power to ensure that morale in the force is as high as it possibly can be.  I cannot guarantee that every grievance will be rectified on the spot.  Indeed, I cannot guarantee that things that give rise to grievances can of their nature possibly be rectified at all, but within the obvious limitations that the Commissioner and I are faced with, both of us will do everything we can to ensure that morale is as high as it possibly can be.</P>
    <P>It struck me during the past year or so that one thing that could do a lot to increase morale in the force would be the re-establishment of the Garda band and I intend, having regard to the large increase in the strength of the force which is about to take place, to re-establish that band.</P>

      <P>I hope to have it back in action in time for the formal <Col N="1333" /> commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the force which the Commissioner is organising for later in the year.  I might add that the force was founded 50 years ago tomorrow, at a meeting in Dublin on 9th February, 1922, but the Commissioner felt, and I agree with him, that the summer would be a more suitable time for the celebration of this anniversary.  I hope the band can be quickly restored to its former proud place as a showpiece of the force and I should like all its members to look on this as an earnest of my intentions to help build the Garda into a police force second to none in the world.</P>
      <P>Through the years, members of the Garda have on numerous occasions shown outstanding devotion to duty and have performed exceptional police work.  I have often thought that such men deserve some special note of recognition but up to now the only recognition has been the Scott Medal which can be awarded only for deeds of exceptional personal bravery.  I have discussed the matter with the Commissioner who has taken the views of his senior officers on it and I now propose, with the Commissioner's agreement, to make provision for the award of a new medal which will be presented to members performing police work of exceptional merit and showing outstanding devotion to duty.  I am arranging to have the various representative bodies' views on the matter.  The medal which I now propose to establish will not in any way cut across the Scott Medal which has been there for a good many years but which, as I said, has been awarded only for exceptional acts of bravery where the member's life has been in serious danger.  The medal I propose to establish would be for something that would be for less than that, for exceptional police work or for devotion to duty not entailing bravery to anything like that degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the statements made by Deputy Blaney in the course of his speech, in particular to his allegation or, as he put it, the repeating of a rumour, that it is proposed to establish a new force that would seem in some way to be independent of the Garda Síochána.  He referred to <Col N="1334" /> this after some time as being a rumour.  I am happy to assure him that is what it is, if it is even a rumour.</P>
    <P>The Government have no intention of establishing any force outside the Garda Síochána, nor is it intended to form a force of any particular type within the Garda on the lines Deputy Blaney seems to indicate.  He went on to question at some length why it should be necessary to have a non-uniformed force in the Garda and he referred to the Special Detective Unit or the Special Branch, as he calls it, as if it were something apart from or separate from the Garda.  This is a line that is taken by certain people apparently in order to try to drive a wedge between the uniformed members of the Garda and members of the Garda not in uniform.  There are no grounds for saying that an effort should be made to do anything of this kind.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, a non-uniformed section of the Garda.  We have always had it and always will have it.  I regard it as one of the most important sections of the Garda.  Not alone would I not take kindly to Deputy Blaney's suggestion that we close down the Special Detective Unit or the non-uniformed branch, but indeed I propose to strengthen it further from the extra men who will become available during the next 12 months.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blaney also suggested that members of the Special Detective Unit in some way seemed to have caused trouble at the British Embassy last week and he felt that they should wear some form of identification.  I want to put it very clearly on record that such members of that unit as were on duty at the British Embassy, far from causing trouble, did their duty very valiantly, as did all the other gardaí, to try to avoid the trouble that was caused by a small segment of the crowd.</P>

      <P>We often get requests that more gardaí should have numbers&mdash;that gardaí throughout the entire country should have them.  However, we will not put numbers on the Special Branch members.  Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke the last day about the question of political interference with promotions in the force.  As a result of the offer I made to him the last day I think he accepts that there is no foundation for this.  The fact is that I have gone into this very carefully and have extracted the statistics for the past 30 years and they do not bear that out.  I should make it clear that the position about promotion in the force is that the appointment of officers of superintendent rank, or higher, is by law a matter for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>These appointments are made by the Government under sections 6, 7 and 10 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act of 1925. The Government, therefore, have a statutory responsibility and duty for appointments to officer rank in the force and there can be no question of interference on their part.  The records show that during the past 30 years there have been only six promotions out of 91 to chief superintendent which were not recommended in the first instance by a selection board of senior officers.  Of these six cases, four were special posts outside the run of normal police duties and in the other two cases, in 1949 and 1955, the then Government, apparently, considered that there were special reasons.</P>
      <P>I can speak with first-hand knowledge of the position since I became Minister for Justice and I have with me, and I will show them to Deputy Fitzpatrick privately if he wishes, lists in respect of promotions last year.  He will see that the recommendations of the selection board have been followed in precise detail in every case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me on to another point <Col N="1336" /> made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I sometimes think that the sort of men who are being put up for promotion by these selection boards, which we have always followed meticulously, may not in the long-term interests of the force be the most suitable men.  I say this particularly because older men or more senior men tend to do better than younger men.  It is quite understandable this should be so, particularly from the point of view of police officers recommending their promotion.  At the same time there may be something in what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said about the promotion of younger men to posts of responsibility at an earlier age to allow younger and more active Commissioners to be appointed in the future.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has pointed out that a man tends to become Commissioner only towards the very end of his service, perhaps with two or three years to go.  I agree that that has frequently been the position in the past; but at the same time perhaps I see two sides to this problem more clearly than Deputy Fitzpatrick might.  The first difficulty one creates if younger men are brought up over the heads of more senior men, even though they may well be deserving of it on their ability, is that it will immediately give rise to cries of interference.  In fact you are really back to where you started because any younger man who is brought on will be alleged by those who are senior to him to have been brought on by some interference from outside the Garda Síochána.  This undoubtedly would cause some unrest in the force and I am afraid it would probably cause as many problems as it would solve.  It is a matter to which I will give some thought but it is not as simple at all as Deputy Fitzpatrick may have felt it was when he made the suggestion.</P>
    <P>Another problem that it would give rise to would be the question of what happens to a man who is promoted to Commissioner at, say, the age of 45 or 50?  Does he continue there for an abnormally long period like 20 years, which I think is very undesirable, or should he be asked to retire after a reasonable period such as five or six years?  If he is asked to retire which <Col N="1337" /> would probably be the better thing to do, where does he go then?  He is still a comparatively young man.  As a former Commissioner he cannot reasonably be put back in the force.</P>

      <P>He may be taken into some Department but he is a professional policeman who has devoted his life to the police and it may not at all suit him to be put into some form of employment, however well remunerated it might be, that simply does not suit him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also mentioned the increase in strength which I have decided on and which we are implementing this year as being inadequate but I recall when I mentioned here last year that we proposed to increase the force by 400 that I was told then that that was inadequate and that we should increase it by 1,000.  It is now 1,000 and what I want to make clear, because I think some Deputies may have misunderstood, is that it is a net increase of 1,000.  It is an increase of 1,000 between last year and this year over and above the replacement of normal wastage.  Deputy Fitzpatrick made the point that a very large number of people joined the force in 1942 and that they would be retiring in 1972 and that there would be an abnormally large number of retirements in 1972. That is not so.  The number who joined in 1942 was 300.  The number who are due to retire in 1972-73 is 42 and the number who are due to retire in 1973-74 is 36.  If one adds to that a small figure for deaths and voluntary resignations the overall wastage in that year is not likely to exceed 100 by very much.  That figure will be replaced quite separately by recruits in addition to the 1,000 new people who will be brought in.  They will bring the strength of the force to 7,560, which is the highest it has ever been in the history of the force.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the fact that the refresher course for recruits did not now seem to be held. That is not so.  Their training is in two parts.  The first part is about five months in Templemore.  Before the end of their probationary period they go back there for a further course which is part of their general training and they are not regarded as trained men until they have completed both parts of it.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the Conroy recommendations. Out of 52 recommendations contained in the report in regard to remuneration and conditions of service of the Garda Síochána 38, including all the major ones, have been fully implemented, three have been partially implemented, five have been accepted and talks are going on to determine how best they may be implemented. The acceptance of one other has just been announced in the last couple of days and the remaining five are being considered in accordance with priorities determined by the Garda Representative Bodies.  This means that only five of 52 recommendations have not been dealt with and those five are being dealt with in the order in which the representative bodies have asked for them to be dealt with and, as one might expect, they are five of the least important of the recommendations.  It is fair to say that 90 per cent of the recommendations have either been fully implemented or are on the point of being fully implemented.</P>

On the basis of a sample passenger card inquiry and passenger movement figures it is estimated that in 1970 575,000 visits to Ireland were made by persons resident outside the State, who travelled by sea from Great Britain.  In the sample inquiry respondents <Col N="1237" /> are asked to indicate the reason for their visit.  On the basis of the replies the following classification of the total of 575,000 has been obtained.</P>
