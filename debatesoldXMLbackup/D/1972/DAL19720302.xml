      <P>Last night I was trying to say what part education should play in the life of boys and how we should try to lead them to a full and useful life.  The remark of Deputy Cruise-O'Brien here last week caused considerable controversy and speculation.  Certainly people spoke to me about it.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien said that we had a system of education <Col N="826" /> under which we were breeding little IRA men.  Most of us, while being educated, found that we were never taught English history.  Irish history up to 1916 was taught.  Evidently the country sank to the bottom of the ocean after that and England never existed.  This was an unfair and biased way of teaching pupils.  The English can look after themselves, but it is unfair to turn out children with a narrow, insular, one-sided view of history.</P>
      <P>Cromwell was presented to the pupils as public enemy No. 1.  His place in Irish history was not explained with the background of the English system as it was at that time.  What Cromwell tried to do in England was not explained either.  No overall picture was given to the pupils.  The pupils were taught that the Island of Saints and Scholars was sending missionaries to Europe and were looking for French aid in order to free themselves from the tyranny of England.  Any part of English history which had a bearing on Ireland was glossed over.  Since last week, because of the publicity given to Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's speech, many people have said to me that his remarks were very true.  These people felt that they had been educated, not with a love of their country or a pride in the place which our country had in Europe, but with a hatred of the English.  They felt that Deputy Cruise-O'Brien had struck the right note when he made this remark.</P>
      <P>My experience was that the history of England was left out of the curriculum when I was being educated. This always struck me as being narrow-minded.  I know that schoolboys are not anxious to take on extra work trying to find out why the English had adopted such an attitude towards Ireland.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister said that that attitude had now changed.  The Parliamentary Secretary quoted from Part II, page 116 in the section on civics in the curriculum for primary schools.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything which savours of chauvinism or any form of excessive nationalism tends to blur the child's awareness of the common bond of <Col N="827" /> humanity.  The more violent aspects of history should not be stressed and the real value to humanity of men of peace and progress, such as Edmond Ignatius Rice, Madame Curie and Mahatma Ghandi should be placed in proper perspective.</P>
    <P>A curious combination of people are mentioned here.  Perhaps someone else would delve into the mind of the person who wrote this to try to find out why these three names are mentioned.</P>
    <P>Anyone who wants children to come out of school and to contribute something in a positive way to their country will realise</P>
    <P>that anything which savours of chauvinism or any form of excessive nationalism tends to blur the child's awareness of the common bond of humanity.  The more violent aspects of history should not be stressed...</P>
    <P>If this is being done now in primary and secondary schools they are on the right road.  We will turn out people with a less selfish outlook from the national point of view and they will probably be better citizens of the world.  That is really the purpose of education.  I made the point last night that education is an end in itself.  We should try to steer people's minds away from thinking of education as a means to a better job.  I wonder how successful we have been in that.</P>
    <P>I have a letter here which I received early this week.  It is dated 24th February, 1972.  It comes from one of the post-primary colleges in Cork. This is not a free college.  The letter reads:</P>
    <P>My classmates as well as myself are firmly agreed that there is a desperate need for a change in the drug laws of this country.  The reason is that there is no protection for us in the law as it stands.  We have included some news items from the papers for your easy reference.</P>
    <P>We are asking for much heavier penalties for drug pushers as in other countries.  There will be drug rings coming to this country as you will gather from some of the enclosures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> This letter was signed by about 30 boys whose average age is 15 or 16 years; they are students of this very good college in Cork.  If they consider it necessary to write to their public representative to try to have legislation to protect them from drugs it must mean that there is an awareness among the young people of the danger and that there are drugs circulating in Cork city.  The standards we have must be wrong if 16-year olds end up in the hands of drug pushers.  I do not want to exaggerate the problem because I realise that it will occur fairly rarely but it worries me that a class of schoolboys of 15 or 16 years consider it necessary to write to their Deputy to try to get something done to cope with this danger.</P>
    <P>Last year there was considerable confusion in Cork about post-primary books.  Evidently the secondary and vocational schools did not notify the retailers until after the term had started regarding the books they required.  The result was that classes could not start until a fortnight later as the books were not available.  Had there been some organisation in this matter this inconvenience could have been avoided. The Department plan their courses in advance; if they could let the schools know what books would be on the curriculum for the following year, and if they requested the schools to make their choice, where this was necessary, and to pass the list on to the shops in the months of June or July, this would help.  From the parents' point of view it would be to their advantage to spread the cost over several months.  I realise this is only a minor point but a little organisation in this matter might remove a certain amount of irritation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the teacher/ student ratio is one to 32 throughout the country.  In my constituency many national schools have 50 or 60 pupils in classes and this makes it extremely difficult for the teachers.  I hope the number of students per class will decrease but, at the moment, while the suburbs are growing the number of schools is not increasing.  This is one matter on which there could be cooperation between the Department of Education and the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> On the outskirts of Cork city there are many housing estates, both private and corporation schemes.  Schools should be provided at the same time that the houses are being constructed instead of waiting for two years or more before the construction of the schools commences.  As a result there is confusion and over-crowding in the existing schools and sometimes it is necessary to send children a considerable distance to another school.  Every county and city has a development plan and the areas for housing are zoned.  It should be possible for the Department of Local Government to give the Department of Education a rough idea about the housing programme and thereby allow for the construction of school premises at the same time.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the future of community schools and how we should endeavour to treat the minority religions with regard to education.  In a speech recently, Dr. Walshe of Limerick said that if we wanted to unite the country and integrate the Protestant community here and in the North into our society it would be necessary for us first to put our own house in order and ensure that Catholic and Protestant children should not be educated separately except in matters of religion.  It strickes me that even before that there is a form of integration that might be more fundamental, namely, co-education.  One of the results of separate education for boys and girls is that when they leave school they have not the ability to mix socially; I could instance the case of young people in a dancehall, where the young men stay at one side of the hall and the girls at the other side. This inability to mix socially is due in part to separate education for the sexes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Protestants will feel free to enter the community schools and that this will lead eventually to the co-education of Catholics and Protestants at primary, post-primary and university levels.  I realise this is some time ahead but the Department should start preparing people's minds to the fact that if we wish to unite the country we must start by uniting the children who are in our care.</P>

      <P>It is sometimes the fate of an Opposition party to meet with a blanket of silence when a new initiative is taken in relation to any matter.  In my case this happened when I spoke in this House on 3rd March, 1971, on the occasion of the proposal of a motion that Dáil Éireann formally rejects the use of force as an instrument to secure the unity of Ireland. In seconding that motion, I drew the attention of the House and the country to a matter which has been referred to by a number of Deputies and which subsequently got more extensive coverage than when I introduced it.</P>
      <P>In volume 252, at column 246, of the Official Report, I stated:</P>
      <P>Is there anybody here who will not admit that the teaching of history which he received in his education in school was coloured, to put it mildly, to some extent by a romanticising of the physical force element in our history?</P>
      <P>I said:</P>
      <P>...we must now unequivocally send out a message from this House to all organs of opinion and all the people we can influence as Deputies to cease forthwith any one-sided, romanticised, glorification of physical force.</P>
      <P>I went on:</P>
      <P>I, perhaps, more than most Members of this&mdash;</P>
      <P>I should have said &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; but I said &ldquo;Constituent Assembly&rdquo;; at that time I was taken up with constitutional law; that word should not have appeared there</P>
      <P>&mdash;Constituent Assembly, can appeal to my former colleagues in the teaching profession, that we, as a profession have something to be blamed for in our presentation of the facts...</P>
      <P>I went on to say:</P>
      <P>Lay teachers and religious teachers are equally at fault in this regard.</P>
      <P>I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask my fellow-teachers and colleagues to examine themselves to see if they, in fact, are in any way <Col N="831" /> to blame in relation to the perpetuation of this glorification, this idea that young people have that there is something romantic and something to be achieved by taking to arms.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this theme has received attention in this debate.  The fact that it has received the attention it deserves is of great satisfaction to me.  There was one exception to the blanket wall of silence which met my introduction of this theme into this House.  It was the reference by a well-known political commentator who writes in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday mornings who, in a remarkably forthright article, written in his usual style, took up this theme and said, quoting me, that:</P>
    <P>...if we are to get a generation which will abhor the solution of the gun, the revolution must be fought in the classrooms of the nation.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that we had heard one of the better speeches on the subject of the North and that we might reflect on &ldquo;the irony of the situation in which we find a leading culturemaker getting up in 1971 to urge his fellow-educators, who operate alongside and under the final control of the official Christian Church whose prescriptive bag is to educate, to instil Christian charity into the culturemaking value-system instead of the unchristian one of glorifying violence and the gun.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>The teaching of history in any culture is merely the process by which licensed culture-makers or culture maximisers transmit those approved happenings which bolster best the current concept of nationhood.</P>
    <P>Further on he said:</P>
    <P>Quite astonishingly, it was left until this week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;that was March, 1971&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;for a Member of Parliament to get up and, apart from noting it was so, do something concrete like appealing to his fellow teachers to smash the old mould.</P>

      <P>Saturday, 6th March, 1971.  This is the only aspect of this debate to which I intend to refer, because other matters have been referred to by other Deputies and I do not wish to go over old ground. The problem here, it seems to me, arises from an antithesis between what one might say was the moral force concept on the one hand and the physical force concept on the other.  This first came to public attention very strongly in the era of O'Connell and the Young Irelanders.  Anybody who wishes to read up that can do so for himself.  The debate from that point has gone on and has coloured the attitude of all of us and the emphasis which we place in our attitudes towards the teaching of history, particularly in our schools.</P>
      <P>We must face the fact that any teacher going into a classroom brings with him all his experience, all his own educational experience, and perhaps also a political bias.  Each one of us must admit that we are the sum total of all our experiences.  There is an onus on a teacher, particularly in putting forward the historical view, to try as hard as he can at least to give both sides of the question.  It seems to me that if any criticism can be levelled at our profession over the past 50 years, it is that some may have allowed themselves the luxury of over-emphasis on one aspect of these matters.</P>
      <P>I take, for example, one item which occurs in the English course for intermediate certificate pupils.  This course was drawn up by a committee of which I was a member and therefore I have no criticism of the course.  The item in question is Padraig Pearse's speech at Rossa's funeral.  A teacher goes before a class to deal with this piece of literature and he reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And if there is anything that makes it fitting that I, rather than some other, I rather than one of the grey-haired men who were young with him and shared in his labour and in his suffering, should speak here, it is perhaps that I may be taken as speaking on behalf of a <Col N="833" /> new generation that has been rebaptised in the Fenian faith...</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>And we know only one definition of freedom: it is Tone's definition, it is Mitchel's definition, it is Rossa's definition.</P>
    <P>A good teacher taking that piece will, no doubt, have to explain what was Tone's definition, Mitchel's definition, Rossa's definition.  Tone's definition, in brief, was &ldquo;to subvert the tyranny of our execrable Government&rdquo; and &ldquo;to break the connection with England, the never-failing source of all our political evils, and to assert the independence of my country&mdash;these were my objects.&rdquo;  Further on he said: &ldquo;To substitute the common name of Irishmen in the place of the denominations of Protestant, Catholic, and Dissenter.&rdquo; These are very laudable sentiments. We come to Mitchel and we find an almost apocalyptic tone where he quotes from the Bible: &ldquo;I swear to you there are blood and brain in Ireland yet, as the world one day shall know.  God! let me live to see it.  On that great day of the Lord... let this poor carcase have but breath and strength enough to stand under Ireland's immortal Green!&rdquo; He also said: &ldquo;an aspiration of King David haunts my memory when I think on Ireland and her wrongs: &lsquo;That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and that the tongue of thy dog may be red through the same.&rdquo; Mitchel is the immediate ancestor of Fenianism, &ldquo;the noblest and most terrible manifestation of this unconquered nation&rdquo;, a quotation from &ldquo;The Sovereign People&rdquo; by P. H. Pearse, in &ldquo;Political Writings and Speeches&rdquo;, page 371.</P>
    <P>What I am advocating is that, in approaching a piece like that, one must approach it critically.  In an edition I brought out I tried to do this before ever I entered politics.  For example, by asking a question such as: &ldquo;Do you agree that some of the statements in this speech though rhetorically appropriate are philosophically unsound?&rdquo;  What I am suggesting is that we must, as a profession, as a people in fact, approach these questions with an open mind seeing <Col N="834" /> all aspects of the question as best we can.</P>
    <P>If we were to follow that a little further and to explain the thoughts behind Pearse's writings we might be led to his work on the Fianna, published in 1914 where he said, for example: &ldquo;Our programme includes every element of a military training.  We are not mere &lsquo;Boy Scouts,&rsquo; although we teach and practise the art of scouting.&rdquo; Further on he said: &ldquo;...and opportunity is given to the older boys for bayonet and rifle practice.&rdquo;  The emphasis on the military is there right through this man's writing.  We must be very careful, I suggest, in dealing with these matters to give the pupils a sound philosophical basis for their judgment in relation to these matters. It is not alone in relation to the teaching of history but also in relation to the teaching of literature that this is important.  For an Irish child at school this kind of material is heady stuff, indeed, in the charge of a person who does not handle it with care.  We have only, for example, to remember the effect which certain plays had in the early part of this century, plays, for example by Yeats.  I refer particularly to the play <i>Cathleen ni Houlihan</i> which was produced by the Abbey Theatre and a man of the eminence of Stephen Gwynn, as he quotes in his <i>Irish Literature and Drama</i>, page 158, could say of the effect on him of this explosive material:</P>
    <P>The effect of <i>Cathleen ni Houlihan</i> on me was that I went home asking myself if such plays should be produced unless one was prepared for people to go out to shoot and be shot.</P>
    <P>In one of his later poems Yeats said:</P>
    <P>All that I have said and done, Now that I am old and ill, Turns into a question till I lie awake night after night And never get the answers right. Did that play of mine send out Certain men the English shot?</P>
    <P>I would take the last line of that poem and with all humility and having a fairly clear conscience in this matter, ask, have those who had in their hands <Col N="835" /> the malleable mind of the Irish youth, ever lain awake at night and asked: &ldquo;Did any words of mine send out certain men&rdquo;&mdash;turning the phrase slightly&mdash;&ldquo;who shot the English?&rdquo; Because, there is a terrible responsibility on the profession in this matter.</P>
    <P>Those who regard the teaching profession as simply people who inculcate the three Rs must by now have realised that the profession is given a much greater responsibility, a responsibility for the total fabric of the culture and the mind of the nation and this is a responsibility which must be handled with the utmost care and attention.</P>
    <P>One man writing in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i>&mdash;1st March, 1972&mdash;took up the theme which Deputy Cruise-O'Brien introduced in this debate and which I had introduced last year, in the following terms:</P>
    <P>Chuir an Dr. Conchuir Crúis-Ó Briain ceist sa nDáil an lá cheana arbh féidir gurbh é a n'oiliúint scoile a ba chúis le oiread sin dár muintir a iontódh amach ina bpleascadóirí.</P>
    <P>He went on further to say:</P>
    <P>Bhí ar a laghad dá mhúinteoir le mo linn agam nár tháinig stop orthu ach an cothú gránach ar Shasana agus ar Shasanaigh ionainn.  Fear amháin acu&mdash;ba sa chúigiú rang é, sílim&mdash;nuair a bhíodh sé ag cur síos dúinn ar Eilís a h-Aon gabhadh cineál istéire é agus thagadh cár scannrúil ar a cheannaghaidh le teann fuatha.  &ldquo;But boys,&rdquo; adeireadh sé, &ldquo;we have the satisfaction of knowing that the oul' rip is roasting on the hot hob of hell today!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Agus nár fhága mé seo marab é an fear ceanann céanna a bhíodh ag múineadh an Teagasc Criostaí dúinn!</P>
    <P>This, then, I suggest, is a theme which has by now been well aired.  It should engage the attention of our teaching profession.  I do not speak in condemnation of any person and these suggestions should not be taken as condemnation. All I am appealing for is that <Col N="836" /> the matter be studied with a view to eliminating any suspicion that a wrong emphasis here or there may have led to the results which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say on this question.  I leave all the other aspects of education which are important to other Deputies who may wish to speak.  I would reiterate that those closing lines of Yeats are a lesson to us all, when he said:</P>
    <P>Did that play of mine send out Certain men the English shot?</P>
    <P>We have a terrible power as educators. We must use it with the greatest restraint and responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis placed by the last speaker on Irish history teaching is well placed.  History is so often the story of the victor.  In our case much of our history is the story of the vanquished. It must be, indeed, difficult to get objective history but a history that is too biased is highly reprehensible. It is particularly difficult in our case because we have in this country a large emigrant population and, from my own experience of Irish emigrants, they find it difficult to adapt to what they regard as an alien environment.  I dealt with this thing on previous occasions and I emphasised that undue preoccupation with our past wrongs and grievances, political and religious, is psychologically wrong.  Under a different environment very often two different results arise.  First, we have the development&mdash;and this is particularly noticeable amongst our emigrants&mdash;of an introverted anti-social maladjusted, inward looking emigrant society, a body of people with a chip on their shoulders.  On the other hand, we have the development in the same environments amongst certain sections of that society of a complete rejection of all earlier values and standards and an often quite illogical anti-Irish attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked somebody recently, an educationalist from England, a lady, did she think that history as taught in England was biased and she said, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  She said she thought that history in most countries had a slant giving a colourful appeal to the country about which it was written by the <Col N="837" /> people who wrote it.  That may well be true but I believe that in our particular circumstances there has been an undue emphasis upon one aspect of our history. I doubt if it has been examined and presented in a proper, objective fashion.</P>
    <P>I can recall a story told to me some years ago by a medical man who had brought his family back from England and he told me the story with some amusement&mdash;at least, it was amusing to him.  This was a Catholic family. Presumably the children had been attending a convent school in England and they were attending a convent school here.  His daughter came to him and said, &ldquo;Daddy, can you tell me, how is it that Elizabeth I was Good Queen Bess in England and the wicked Queen Elizabeth in Ireland?&rdquo;  He told me that he did not know how to answer her.  I am sure there is a long involved answer but to carry it to the youthful mind would be another matter.</P>
    <P>I have skimmed through the Minister's speech.  I was disappointed to find that there was no reference here to our higher university education and what integration, functional or otherwise, had taken place at that level.</P>
    <P>In speaking on education here about eight years ago I dealt with this matter and&mdash;Official Report 27th May, 1964, volume 210, column 266&mdash;I had this to say:</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why no Minister appears to have examined the question of two universities in this city.  In each of the cities of London, Oxford, Cambridge, Cardiff, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, there is one university. Yet we have two universities in Dublin.  I do not know of any other city of comparable size which has two universities.  Surely economies could be effected and greater efficiency achieved if there were closer liaison or integration between the two establishments in this city?</P>
    <P>I recognise that the existence of two universities here is a historical hangover, a hangover largely based upon religious and political problems of days gone by.  The same political and religious differences which have <Col N="838" /> caused a partition in our university educational system in Dublin have caused the geographical partition of our country.  The religious differences are none of my business.  They are matters for the ecclesiastical authorities to resolve in the spirit of the Ecumenical Council initiated by the late Pope John.</P>
    <P>In the secular field, some efforts, in the interests of efficiency and economy, should be made to secure a closer integration of the two great universities in this city.  I believe there will be difficulties in regard to vested interests which have grown up there, just as they have grown up around the Border.  However, if we in the secular field have so far, in good measure, failed to break down the education partition in our capital city, what hope have we of breaking-down the Partition between the Six and the Twenty-Six Counties. This is a problem to which the Minister and the Government might address themselves and let the world see that we can secure in our capital city and at university level a degree of federation, integration, call it what you will.  If we are able to do that at university level, it will be a good omen for the future in regard to what we may be able to do ultimately in the field of Partition.</P>
    <P>That was in 1964 and it was subsequent to that that the late Deputy O'Malley, as Minister for Education, announced the merger of the two universities here. There has been a strange silence about this problem since then and in the meantime there has been considerable structural expansion of UCD at Belfield and now there is a proposal to extend Trinity College.  I should like to hear from the Minister whether this matter is still a viable project, whether integration is still Government policy.  I believe his predecessor not so long ago said it was still Government policy.  It was a strange hiatus in his speech here that he should pass over this subject without mention.  In replying, perhaps he would tell us if the matter has been referred to some committee: that is the usual procedure when faced with a difficult problem&mdash;refer it to some board or interdepartmental committee or Dáil sub-committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> This project was first mentioned by me in 1964.  I do not know how long after that it was undertaken in a formal way by the late Deputy O'Malley, but surely by now we should have clarified our ideas on the problem and should at least be able to signpost the particular difficulties. Have the vested interests proved too difficult for the Minister?  When I mentioned this it was perhaps a matter of greater importance than it is now in that at that time there was a religious objection to the public entering Trinity College.  This objection, as far as I know, has since been removed and in effect that probably did secure a degree of enrolment integration at least.  I should like to know if a formal fusion of the two universities is still policy. If not, what has been done to secure a functional integration with greater effciency and economies as a result?</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the sports grant.  The Parliamentary Secretary dealt at length with school transport and the question of the development of sports and the expenditure of the sports grant.  The matter has particular interest for me not so much in the field of sport which has been dealt with at length by both the Minister and other speakers but in regard to finance. This is one of our grant-in-aid expenditures. The magic figure of £100,000 was given to the Minister not only as a grant-in-aid but an open-ended grant-in-aid where the recipients were not named.  Grants-in-aid in general are not a matter for debate now but I mention in passing that of our total voted expenditure, 14 per cent is in the form of grants-in-aid.  In respect of the civil voted expenditure in the UK the proportion is 3.3 per cent.  There is an emphasis here that should be examined and questioned in the light of the high proportion of expenditure on grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>I mention this because I am not aware whether any detailed return has been made as to how this grant-in-aid was spent.  For example, has the Minister placed in the Library of the House a list of the recipients of this grants-in-aid and the amount given to each body?  The recipients are unnamed and <Col N="840" /> I presume there is no obligation on the Minister to give details of the expenditure but in the interests of good public relations he might deem it advisable to do so, just as Bord Fáilte did recently.  In the present atmosphere this might be desirable.  I do not expect the Minister to give a long list in his speech to the House but if he made the information available to Deputies by placing it on the Table of the House so that Members could see it in the Library I think he would meet in substance the wishes of the majority of the Members.</P>
    <P>I might also mention the question of the movement of the Department of Education to Athlone.  The matter of decentralisation of Departments has been again at the talking stage for a considerable period.  By way of letter to the Public Accounts Committee on 21st May, 1970, one accounting officer gave information, as published in the last Public Accounts report, to the effect that development sketch plans for new offices both at Castlebar and Athlone were proceeding and that it was expected that documents for tendering would be available within 12 to 18 months, assuming that no changes in planning were necessary.  Those 18 months have now passed and parliamentary questions on this matter have been tabled on different occasions and, as usual, the replies to them have not been very informative.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us if the Government intend pursuing this policy of decentralisation and what steps are being taken to implement it; also, how soon the transfers will take place.  I do not expect the Minister to answer for the Department of Lands but he should be able to tell us what is the position regarding his own Department&mdash;how far planning has progressed, what percentage of the Department it is intended to transfer and what modicum, if any, of higher officials it is intended to retain in Dublin.  There is a general suspicion that all this is airy-fairy and, like the draining of the Shannon, is something put forward at election time to bring solace to the people of the West and then to be forgotten as soon as the Minister and his entourage return to town.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> Personally, I could not care one way or the other but I would like to see the Minister upholding promises that have been made and letting us know what is Government thinking on this whole matter.</P>
    <P>I must deal now with the very vexed question of community schools, a matter that has been dealt with extensively during the debate and which also has been the subject of much public comment.  In so far as this policy affects my own constituency to a fairly substantial degree, I consider it my duty to refer to it here. Let me say at the outset that the concept of post-primary community education is a very sound one.  In a country where educational and financial resources must be of necessity be limited it is only logical to try to devise some rationalisation of our educational system so as to secure the greatest benefit for the greatest number of our children.</P>
    <P>Having said that I take the Minister to task for the ham-handed way in which he dealt with this matter.  I am not in a position to give a chronological summary of the day-to-day proceedings such as Deputy FitzGerald attempted to give&mdash;indeed, nobody knows exactly the full details of this entire business&mdash;but I understand that initially discussions were opened between the Minister's Department and the Catholic bishops.  Apparently, these discussions were not of a very open nature.  There was nothing wrong with that.  One must accept without reservation the interest which the Catholic Hierarchy rightly have and should have in education here at all levels.  However, it was not for some considerable time later that the Protestant bishops became aware of these discussions.  I do not know whether there were any leakages as to what was in the pipeline but it did appear that the Protestant bishops were presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    <P>The plan arrived at was the amalgamation of local post-primary schools, vocational and religious, in certain areas to form community schools the ownership of which was to be given over to the Catholic bishops.  The rights of religious bodies to their property <Col N="842" /> was ignored.  The authority of the bishops was regarded, presumably, as sufficient to supersede this.  The rights of local authorities and vocational bodies in respect of vocational schools was ignored also.  Again, the Minister, presumably, regarded his personal wish and authority as sufficient to supersede this right.  The local community rights or interests in both types of property was ignored, presumably, the Government position was regarded as sufficient to supersede this. The rights of parents in respect of the teaching of their children was ignored to a great extent.  The State, presumably, regarded itself as superseding this.  Finally, the rights of teachers were ignored because, for the most part, they were not consulted.</P>
    <P>The Minister had statutory machinery available to him in dealing with vocational schools.  Financial sanctions were to hand so far as he was concerned in respect of the religious communities. Against this background and with the trump card in his hand of whatever consultations he had with the Cardinal, he proceded to give out the plan.  The plan was a simple one.  The campaign was launched by the despatch of a couple of well-briefed officers from his Department to five or six different centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This plan, and the decision to put it into operation, was essentially political. The decision was taken by the political head of the Department and the kiteflying was entrusted to the unfortunate civil servants.  Had there been in this exercise the promise of a triumphal tour no doubt the Minister would himself have headed the procession; Fianna Fáil have never been slow in posturing and presenting themselves for the plaudits of the populace.  Had it appeared that the exercise would be even moderately successful, no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary would have been entrusted with this task.  In the event, even poor Deputy Joe Dowling was not asked to go.</P>
    <P>The campaign was a fiasco.  As a public relations operation, if by any stretch of the imagination it could be either regarded as such or described as such, it was both precipitate and illtimed. <Col N="843" /> Politically, in terms of North/ South relations and in terms of Irish unity it was disastrous, perhaps intentionally so.  I have for long regarded the intentions of Fianna Fáil in respect of Irish unity as Machiavellian.  The irony of the whole situation is that the concept itself was basically sound.  The minority population in Southern Ireland were grieviously affronted.  The Protestant religious leaders, who would be expected to have, and who did have, an interest in post-primary education were not properly consulted.  At least, they did not receive a consultation invitation at the outset, as they were entitled to do.</P>
    <P>The Protestant minority can never be described as a factious people.  They are good citizens, hard working, industrious, honest.  In this instance, however, there was both pastoral and lay objection from that community, and very properly so.  The way the Minister handled this whole situation cannot be too highly condemned.  &ldquo;Cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo; how-are-you!  Letters from protesting citizens filled our newspapers and have done so for months past.  I shall quote now a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 29th February, of a meeting in St. Patrick's College the night before:</P>
    <P Just="Center">COMMUNITY SCHOOLS&mdash; THE CRUX</P>
    <P>Dr. Roy Johnston, speaking &ldquo;as a scientist and a minority parent,&rdquo; told a meeting on community schools in St. Patrick's College last night that the political problems of the ownership and control of the new system were not insoluble, but that the main obstacle was the insistence by the Department on dealing with the Hierarchy.</P>
    <P>He added, according to a supplied script:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The way in which the community schools are structured is of crucial importance to the religious minorities outside the cities.  This is their opportunity to really join and participate in the community as Irishmen and women.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Protestants who look for boarding <Col N="844" /> grants or transport subsidies are seeking to build a ghetto for themselves. They should instead stand up and insist on their right to participate in the community school structure.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No one has asked the rural Protestants what they really want, nor explained the options to them. It is simply not true to say that they want segregated education, in the abstract.  Governing boards of élite fee-paying schools are asserting this without evidence.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those who assert that denomininational education is desirable should explain how the luxury is to be paid for.  Are the Roman Catholics who favour denominational education prepared to pay for their Protestant neighbours to go to boarding-school?  Are the Protestants who demand segregated education on a free basis not asking their Roman Catholic neighbours to subsidise them?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main subjective obstacle to full Protestant community participation is the Ne Temere decree.  Is it too much to ask that this be waived, forgotten, or quickly overlooked, and a gentleman's agreement worked out in the interests of equality and mutual respect?  Could not the fact that it has no standing in State law be extended, by a few tolerant words from the Church authorities, to the domain of social custom?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first part of that excerpt deals with the difficulty the attitude of the Minister has created.  There have been dozens and dozens of letters in similar vein in <i>The Irish Times</i> and the other newspapers, all expressing the reaction against the Minister, this Minister who, in clumsy, dictatorial fashion, has shown his incompetence and his total lack of even the fundamentals of public relations.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to find out how many friends the Minister made as a result of this exercise.  Perhaps he made some. He certainly made many enemies.  The religious orders, the teachers, both lay and clerical, the parents and the Opposition here have all tried to make <Col N="845" /> the Minister see sense.  The threat of phasing out was held over certain schools.  The threat of &ldquo;No amalgamation, no money,&rdquo; was hurled at the religious orders.  Alleged recalcitrance was used by the Minister as a pretext for withholding money, money which, if the truth were told, he did not possess, money which a crumbling economy resulting from Government mismanagement the Minister could not provide.  Teachers and parents were, and still are, in a state of turmoil because the Minister, by his conduct, has brought about educational chaos.</P>
    <P>With regard to our relations with our Northern fellow-Irishmen one can hardly imagine a worse or more illtimed performance.  Deputy FitzGerald in this House last week described his meeting with a mixed audience in Northern Ireland.  He described the general condemnation there by that audience of this particular affair and he mentioned that objections came from Catholic clergymen in that audience; these were men who had come face to face with sectarian bigotry and its catastrophic consequences. We can all recall the BBC programme on the community school affair.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to reconcile this Minister's behaviour with the gentle words of peace, charity and goodwill coming from his leader, the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch.  I find it also hard to reconcile the conduct of the entire Fianna Fáil Party with those words.  I wish to quote a leading article entitled &ldquo;Grasping Nettles&rdquo; which appeared in <i>Hibernia</i> of February 18th last, in which these difficulties are outlined.  The article quotes from the Taoiseach's Presidential Address at the 1971 Ard-Fheis:</P>
    <P>I said in Dáil Éireann on 28th July, 1970, &ldquo;In so far as there are Constitutional difficulties which are legitimately seen by people to be infringements of their civil rights, then their views are worthy of intensive examination and we should try to accommodate them in our Constitution and in our laws.&rdquo;  I repeat that now.  The Constitution of a united Ireland requires to be a document in which no element of <Col N="846" /> sectarianism, even unconscious or unintended, should occur.</P>
    <P>Those are lovely words.  I find it hard to reconcile that paragraph from the Taoiseach's speech to the nation at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in 1971 with the behaviour here of his Minister in respect of community schools.  I find it equally hard to reconcile that speech with the behaviour of the Government in respect of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill which was tabled by Senators Robinson, Horgan and West in the Seanad and of which they were denied a First Reading.  I also find it hard to reconcile it with a similar Bill introduced in the Dáil recently in the names of Deputies Dr. Browne and O'Connell which met with a similar fate.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister for Education making his contribution to a united Ireland.  United Ireland how are you! I believe that, in spite of all protests from parents, teachers, some members of religious orders, Protestant ecclesiastics and the public generally the Minister was determined to persist doggedly in his pernicious ambition to force this global scheme upon the community.  I am pretty confident in my belief that his change of attitude in no small part arises from the opposition provided in this House, and I pay equal thanks to Fine Gael and Labour for providing that opposition.  This House and the country owe a debt of gratitude to Deputy FitzGerald who almost caught this Minister by the scruff of his sectarian neck and hauled him forth into the full gaze of public opinion.</P>
    <P>The vocational system was set up by Fine Gael.  It is perhaps the only nondenominational system at post-primary level that we possess.  For many years it was regarded as nothing more than the poor relation, the poor boy's secondary school.  In recent years it has been upgraded and now it is being given full post-primary status, and the pupils of these schools can proceed to leaving certificate and higher education.  This is a very desirable development, and here let me express my gratitude to the Minister for whatever contribution he may have made to that development.</P>
    <P>Recently Cardinal Conway announced that he had no interest in the <Col N="847" /> ownership of these vocational schools and that the bishops in general had no such interest.  He has gone further and expressed his regret for not speaking out sooner on this matter.  Some time after this announcement, indeed, very recently, the Minister announced a new deal, and it appears that under this new arrangement the control of these schools will lie largely with the Minister for Education.  It is too early as yet to comment on this new deal.  All we can hope is that the Minister will produce a new pack and deal a clean hand.</P>
    <P>I wish to address myself to the same matter at local level.  As I mentioned earlier, there have been repercussions in my constituency to the Minister's community escapade.  This has happened in Cashel.  Now an effort is being made by the Christian Brothers school and the convent school to go it alone.  At present there is considerable agitation in respect of the Loreto Convent in Clonmel.  My postbag is filled with letters from outraged parents from Clonmel.  I could spend two or three hours here reading these letters, but I wish to spare the Minister's blushes and I do not want to be the cause of some civil action arising later on.  I daresay we are at the peak of an emotional storm in this regard, but the parents certainly regard their rights as being infringed by the Minister and his Department.  The story of Loreto Convent is again a story of bad public relations and gross mismanagement.</P>
    <P>An agreement was arrived at in Clonmel that the convent would close its primary school and it was given ten years to develop its post-primary school to meet the departmental requirements and prove its viability in the secondary sector of education.  I understand an arbitrary figure of 400 pupils was mentioned.  Now the impression has been created that this agreement is not to be honoured and that the school there will be phased out. The parents feel their interests have not been properly considered and that they are being by-passed.</P>
    <P>The sister in charge took a very reasonable attitude in this affair.  Her attitude was that if the parents want <Col N="848" /> her to continue her school and if a majority of them feel that she and her fellow teachers are providing a worthwhile service for them she will endeavour to provide that service.  The parents were overwhelmingly in favour of the continuation of the school.  If the Minister does not believe me he can arrange for a public opinion poll to be taken among the parents and he will find that they want the school to continue.  The nun in charge recognises that the arguments put up by the Department have some force.  She recognises that to provide a broad spectrum of education in a modern world one requires a basic school population.  I understand the view of the Department is that they would like a minimum number of 400 and in a bigger centre they would like a larger number.</P>
    <P>There are two ways to go about a community school: the ham-fisted way adopted by the Minister with his secret behind-closed-doors-negotiations, or the open method of approach in which the idea is properly presented to the people concerned and a degree of co-operation sought and secured.  The Minister adopted a sectarian approach to the bishops at central level and a dictatorial approach to the parents, teachers and religious at local level. The Minister, in his entire handling of the situation, has made a joke of the pious pronouncements of 1971 from the bull ring at Ballsbridge.  Are pupils and teachers so immobile that where a structural integration cannot be secured, or where there are financial or administrative difficulties, a degree of functional integration could not be secured in the first instance?</P>
    <P>In Clonmel there are two convents, a Christian Brothers school and a vocational school.  In a subject requiring special equipment and specialised teaching, such as the teaching of science, chemistry or physics, is it necessary to have all the pupils under one roof to get the advantages of functional integration?  If one science laboratory was provided in Clonmel would there be any insurmountable difficulty whereby the pupils of the other schools could not attend at the classes given there?  Could not this form of mobility of pupils and teachers <Col N="849" /> be extended to other areas?  As a first step towards community thinking in regard to pupils would this not be a good exercise in developing co-operation and understanding among the people in regard to what the Department are aiming at?</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy asked in this House yesterday if the Minister would meet the parents or representatives of the parents in respect of the school at Clonmel.  Did the Minister say he would meet them?  He did not.  He said an official of his Department would meet them.  Surely this is of sufficient importance to a Minister who has already made a hoax of this affair to appear in person and in some way explain the matter to the unfortunate parents who at present feel outraged? I suggest that he should re-arrange his thinking in this entire matter, that he should endeavour to approach this by open, revolutionary methods and not by the approach which he has adopted up to this.  If he does that I believe he will have the full support of every Deputy on this side of the House.  I believe he will have the full support of every rightthinking citizen if he can establish that he has clean hands and that he means to conduct this matter in an open and honourable fashion.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I wish to raise one matter.  It deals with a scholarship application by the son of a small farmer in south Tipperary.  It involved a higher education grant and I understand that the last day for securing this grant was 1st September.  Representations have been made to the Minister about this.  On 4th October he acknowledged representations from Deputy Treacy and on 11th October he communicated his refusal to Deputy Treacy who had asked him to vary the regulations governing this grant.</P>
    <P>I understand that this student made application in the Tipperary (South Riding) County Council office on 1st September, the last day for the application. I have a notion that he was one day late, but I am not certain.  All I know is that he was late.  I agree there must be a deadline in these matters. Personally I should like to see a bit of <Col N="850" /> leniency but I appreciate that in all such matters, if there is a final date and if you start breaking it you can never finalise it.  On 15th October the Department informed the Tipperary South Riding County Council that the application for the grant had not been accepted and that that was the end of the matter as far as this person was concerned.</P>
    <P>However, he received a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Fahey.  I will read this letter because this person&mdash;the Minister can have his name if he wants it&mdash;consulted Deputies Treacy and Fahey.  He consulted Deputy Treacy after he had consulted Deputy Fahey.  Personally I am on excellent relations with both Deputies and there is nothing personal, no animosity, in my raising it here.  It is my duty to raise it because it gives a wrong slant to public administration. This letter from Deputy Fahey was issued from the Office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>I have been making further inquiries about the grant.  You will remember I got the matter more or less settled that day on the phone. However, I understand that when you left me another party intervened. The matter had then to be formally submitted to the Department for a decision and they ruled it had to be rejected on the grounds that it was late.  I am sorry about this but I am sure you will appreciate that I did what I could and I feel that if things had been left as they were when you left me you would have been all right.  Perhaps I can be of help in some other way in the near future.</P>
    <P>The implication in this letter is that a citizen can go to a member of the Minister's party, make representations to that member and if he stays with that member he may get his problem resolved, but if he happens to make representations to another Deputy his position is vitiated.</P>
    <P>I am giving the Minister an opportunity to say to the House that as far as he and his officials are concerned equal consideration will be given to all <Col N="851" /> Deputies irrespective of whether they belong to the Government party or to the Opposition parties, whether they make representations in writing or on the telephone and whether the representations are likely to be a matter of public record or not.  If such a letter with such a slant is written by a responsible Deputy then that Deputy can blame only himself if he brings contumely on his head.  The Minister is now free to comment and he can leave himself open to the thought or even to the conclusion that he is part and parcel of this type of approach.  I do not ask him to rebuke the Deputy concerned but he can repudiate the implication if he wishes.  That is all I have to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the community schools, I propose simply to add my voice to the voices of those Deputies who have spoken at much greater length.  I think the original proposals of the Minister, as has been widely held by both Opposition parties, were bigoted and sectarian in intent.  I can see no other construction one can put on the original proposals and I think they have done harm to the cause of unity of the communities here.  I also think the proposals were a continuation of the strands we have seen in Irish education during the whole life of this State, namely that the approach to interested parties has been authoritarian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can be blamed for that, but I think it is fair to say that he was continuing the traditions and attitudes which have been those of our education policy for so long as we have had a separate education policy for this State. The Minister can be blamed for not changing those traditions and attitudes. Every party in this House and everyone involved in policy making or administration in regard to education has to accept some responsibility for the situation we have allowed to grow up here in the last half century&mdash;in my view a disgraceful and unsatisfactory situation.  That is not to say that there have not been reasonable and admirable and dedicated people working at all levels of education but they suffered from lack of frank and <Col N="852" /> democratic discussion.  We now find ourselves in a situation where evidently the Minister thinks the only way in which to do things is in an authoritarian and devious fashion.  He is not alone in responsibility for that.</P>
    <P>Before going on to the main topic I want to discuss I should like to voice one criticism of the whole presentation of the community schools issue.  It has been characterised by lack of frankness which at certain moments, not always, amounted to deception.  If the Minister thinks that comment is harsh or unjust I would give one instance to which I referred already in the House and which I look on as scandalous. I refer to the occasion when interested parties in Tallaght met and when the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Kennedy, produced and purported to read from a letter from the Church of Ireland board of education indicating a certain attitude towards the community schools proposal.  The Parliamentary Secretary was challenged to read out the whole letter.  Under pressure he did so and it was revealed that the essential sense of that letter was contrary to the sense that Deputy O'Kennedy had been trying to convey to the meeting by the reading of selected excerpts.  That damages the possibility of trying to discuss the situation. I wanted to make three points. Before leaving the subject of community schools I must say that I have seen an evolution in the Minister's position.  This has been a welcome evolution, but I do not think it has gone far enough.  The Minister has shown himself able to respond to criticism and to change his point of view. This is heartening.  I hope that that evolution will continue and that nothing said in this House or elsewhere will produce a freezing of attitudes. This party have assailed the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>It is easy to forget that the essential concept of a community school is a good one and the defects which we have seen and stigmatised, although they are serious in our view, are not an enormous part of the whole parcel. The parcel is capable of being made acceptable if the Minister continues <Col N="853" /> in his present attitude.  The Minister is entitled to some praise.  I am not claiming that the evolution in the community school attitude has resulted from Opposition criticism.  It is difficult for someone who has been sharply assailed to change the content of his proposals in order to make them more acceptable to the people who are assailing him. The weaker thing to do is to say: &ldquo;That is it.  You can take it or leave it.&rdquo;  It is not fair to say that the evolution is not a welcome one.  The present position is not completely satisfactory, but it is better than it was in regard to the control and ownership of the schools.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to a topic which has not been discussed in this debate. I have not talked about the subject previously in the Dáil.  It is an area of agricultural education in which I claim some expertise.  I recognise that a large part of agricultural education is not the responsibility of the Minister.  I do not propose to discuss the portions of such education which are not his responsibility. I have a long connection with such education and I would like to give the background to the proposal I am initiating.  Whatever the future of the current campaigning in regard to the referendum on entry to the EEC, the evolution of world markets in livestock products will mean that we will have a very special place in the whole world market in regard to livestock production.  That has nothing to do with the debate on the Estimate for Education but it becomes relevant when we consider livestock production all over the world.  There has been a terrifying rate of technical evolution in regard to livestock production.  To use an Americanism, there is a &ldquo;future shock&rdquo; because one sees new techniques and methods being developed in various parts of the world.  Our potential is very great but our attainment is not so good.  A good deal of work is being done in regard to veterinary education in the university.  Such education is the responsibility of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have been teaching veterinary students for 17 years.  I have been involved in voluntary educational work and farmers' organisations for many years. <Col N="854" /> I have been a journalist for perhaps 15 years and an agricultural broadcaster. I am also a farmer so I see the problem from many different angles.  Some magnificent work has been done in third-level agriculture.  I use &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; in its widest and university sense at this stage.  We are entitled to be a little bit disappointed with the overall level of both research and extension work in the universities.  In the veterinary profession there has been an unsatisfactory position for all 21 years of my professional life, and for even longer.</P>
    <P>Originally there was a veterinary school under the care of the Department of Agriculture.  In the late fifties we had a judgment of Solomon because it was decided that veterinary education should become part of the university system.  This trend exists in many parts of the world.  In Dublin the question arose: &ldquo;Which university?&rdquo; Since neither university loved the &ldquo;child&rdquo; enough to relinquish it the &ldquo;child&rdquo; was chopped in two.  In the judgment of Solomon human life and human wisdom prevented the destruction of the baby but in our case it did not prevent the destruction of the veterinary school.  This was wasteful of public money.  It resulted in the waste of buildings.  A certain unity was destroyed.  The cohesion which had existed in the veterinary school was destroyed.  The decision resulted in the waste of time of both students and staff.  It was a deplorable solution which is on its way to resolution now, but has not yet been resolved.</P>
    <P>I should say again that since we are predominantly a livestock country and since our place in the world in regard to livestock could be so special we could be one of the four or five countries in the world in which animal science was at its very best.  It seems to me that this section of our third level education is profoundly important. Each one of us is inclined to think of his profession as the most important one, and I, as a veterinary surgeon, think this is important.  One can make the case that animal science should be the crown of third-level academic endeavour.  We have all the conditions for it.</P>
    <P>I come now to talk about the way in <Col N="855" /> which I believe the whole complex of agriculture and veterinary education should be conducted in the future.  The Minister is probably in possession of facts which I am not in possession of. He must now know the contents of the report of the Commission on Higher Education.  I do not know what the report will recommend but before it becomes public knowledge I want to set out certain principles which must be observed if we are to have the glorious future in animal science to which this country is entitled and which it requires.</P>
    <P>The veterinary profession have always had a rather divided mind regarding their relationship to two other disciplines; one is the discipline of human medicine and the other is the discipline of academic agriculture.  In the evolution of our knowledge, whether it was knowledge of disease, knowledge of the structure of the body, or the workings of the animal body, we have borrowed heavily from human medicine.  In the past with agriculture as a separate university discipline, much younger and until recently less coherent than medicine, the veterinary profession were inclined to think that their place was close to medicine.</P>
    <P>For successful animal science, two separate conditions must be fulfilled. First, the agricultural and veterinary faculties should be independent and sovereign.  It is not possible to mix them together and have a satisfactory outcome.  The other requirement is that they should be close to each other and that they should cross-fertilise each other.  By cross-fertilisation I do not mean formal committees; I mean the student bodies should know each other and co-operate on certain matters; the staffs should see each other in the libraries, in the college restaurants and in other social ways.  Their relationship should not be only by way of formal committees but should be the informal relationship that comes from co-operation and proximity. There are many pressing tasks facing animal science.  We must try to fulfil these tasks if we are to take our place in the forefront of the livestock <Col N="856" /> countries of the world.  All of these pressing tasks overlap the boundary lines between agriculture and veterinary science and they can be tackled only by joint projects that draw on both disciplines.</P>
    <P>We are talking about an area which is expensive in university terms.  It is an area like physics or engineering where money must be spent because it is necessary to have equipment and facilities.  I do not want to pre-empt the report or to offer an answer and I look forward to the report of the Commission on Higher Education.  I heard the Minister giving an undertaking in this House that when the report is published all the interested parties will be consulted.  We must have a rationalisation of veterinary education quickly because, not only is the present situation wasteful of money, it is wasteful of talent.  It is preventing us from raising standards and getting on with the research and teaching we need if we are to face up to the challenge.</P>
    <P>The question arises about where it should be rationalised in terms of taking decisions with regard to physical location.  If I may be self-critical, I think the veterinary profession is a rather ingrown one.  We do not publicly express our commitment to the animal industry and the well-being of the nation very much.  As a profession we do not lobby; we are rather silent and isolated and are inclined to get on with our job.  I can assure the Minister there is a feeling in regard to the future of veterinary education that we are being thrown in the scales of one side or another, as a kind of &ldquo;make weight&rdquo; in the working out of a deal between two universities in the decision as to who gets what.  There is a feeling in the profession and in the teaching staffs in both universities, of a lack of consultation, a lack of participation, and a lack of discussion before decisions are made.  I believe a decision will come quite soon when the report is published and I hope firm decisions will not be taken pending discussion with all the interested parties.</P>
    <P>The interested parties are not just agricultural and veterinary academics. <Col N="857" /> The agricultural industry realises that in the field of animal production we are as good as our research and technology and that the rate of change is very high throughout the world.  Even to stay in place we must be very good. We are not satisfied with staying in place, we want to improve our position. That means that difficult choices must be made with regard to the expenditure of moneys and to the location of buildings.  It means that the location of the veterinary faculty must be considered.  I have made the point that it must be close to agriculture. Everyone involved in veterinary education is of the opinion that what we want for our students is that they should be part of the university, with all the benefits as regards a wider education.  They should belong to student societies and they should participate in academic life to the full. We recognise that part of our isolation comes from the fact that in the past veterinary education tended to be shut away in veterinary schools that did not participate fully in university life.</P>
    <P>We look on undergraduate education as being more than simply learning. Therefore, the consensus of opinion among the veterinary profession is that our place is on the campus rather than as part of a separate institution. In Copenhagen there is what is known as a veterinary and agricultural high-school&mdash;a separate highschool of the European tradition, cut away from the rest of the university. I think the consensus opinion in the veterinary profession is that this is not what we want and people connected with agriculture are of the same opinion.  My belief is that the schools of agriculture and veterinary education must be on the same campus.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go further than that.  However, in order to have satisfactory buildings that will cope with demands in the future this means a suitable site must be obtained because the possibility of expansion must be taken into account.  Of course, this is on the assumption that the present Ballsbridge site will not be retained and that in the early years veterinary <Col N="858" /> education will go to one or other university. I can assure the Minister that this is the opinion of every academic veterinarian I know; it is necessary to have an independent and separate faculty.</P>
    <P>Given the independence of the veterinary faculty the greater will be its co-operation with agriculture.  The modern veterinarian thinks of himself as the technologist of the animal industry. I am uttering these thoughts because I have the impression that this matter is being considered in the Department at this time, or that it soon will be considered.  I am not asking the Minister to comment on what I have said because presumably we will have a debate on the report of the Commission on Higher Education.  I am not asking the Minister to pre-empt decisions; I am not doing so either. I am throwing in attitudes and reactions and trying to delineate the problem.  I hope the Minister will believe me when I say that it is not just the professional pride of someone in the veterinary area which makes me emphasise the enormous importance of this part of third level education for Ireland's future.</P>
    <P>Surely within the next three or four years we must solve this problem properly at last.  The solution which split the faculties between UCD and Trinity was not satisfactory.  People have carried it on and done their best, but nobody liked it and we want it ended.  Therefore, we are faced with the question of, where?  In resolving that question of, where, I have not put what I consider to be a clear, or sharp or final answer because it seems to me that it is a matter for consultation with the interested parties.</P>
    <P>These would be both the universities and certainly the agricultural faculty in UCD.  They would be the veterinary schools of both universities and also the whole agricultural industry through the farmers' organisations. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries as well as the Minister's Department should have an interest and a voice in this.  There are many separate and absolutely valid interests to be consulted.  I am not suggesting <Col N="859" /> that the answer is an easy one.  I am not now offering an answer.  I am offering thoughts which seem to me to be the essential ones from which the correct answer could be drawn.</P>
    <P>As an academic veterinarian at a time when the whole matter of veterinary education and its place in third level education is up for decision, I felt I should take part in the debate on this Estimate.  I beg the Minister to gather the viewpoints of all the interested parties and not to leave the question unresolved for too long, because it is a pressing one.  We need very good graduates and, when I say very good graduates, I am not just thinking of veterinary graduates; I am thinking of the whole level of animal science in Ireland.  We need very good research and we need it quickly.  I am not pretending it is an easy problem but we have to face it and we have to solve it.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture has suffered in the whole life of this State because of the way in which we structured our third level education in the whole field of animal science, and because of the fact that we did not rationalise these things. Because we did not rationalise them, they were not cost effective.  Responsible people who wanted to see public moneys well used saw this as an endless drain down which you could throw public money.  It has been a messy and unsatisfactory situation.  The veterinary profession has suffered and agriculture has suffered, and, therefore, the country as a whole has suffered.  It is not easy to resolve but it is capable of resolution along the lines I have tried to outline very gently.  I hope that, when the Minister's more pressing problems with the community schools, perhaps, are out of the way, or, perhaps, even simultaneously, he will give thought to a satisfactory resolution of this problem.</P>

      <P>I had intended and still intend to speak in Irish on the various aspects of the Irish language problem but, since Deputy Keating has been speaking on the matter of veterinary medicine, I should like to assure him that the rationalisation of the teaching <Col N="860" /> of veterinary medicine at third level is undoubtedly one of the things that will arise out of the report of the HEA which is being printed at present and all interested parties, including the Deputy, will have an opportunity of commenting on it.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtús ama buíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí uilig a labhair ar an Meastachán seo.  Caithfidh mé a rá go raibh caighdeán ard díospóireachta ann.  Taispáineann sé seo an tsuim ar leith atá ag na Teachtaí in oideachais agus ar dhóigh amháin is cineál íomháigh é seo den tsuim atá ag muintir na hÉireann uilig i gceist an oideachais i láthair na h-uaire.  Tá na laethe thart anois ina dtiocfaidh linn an díospóireacht ar oideachas a chríochnú taobh istigh de lá amháin. Táimid anois le trí seachtain anuas ag gabháil don díospóireacht seo agus sílim gur comhartha maith é ó thaobh cúrsaí an náisiúin go bhfuil an oiread sin suime á cur ag Teachtaí sa Roinn Oideachais agus san obair atá á déanamh ag an Roinn.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla rud a rá fá dtaobh de na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha. Tá cuid mhaith conspóide ar siúl fá dtaobh díobhtha seo agus ba mhaith liom a rá gurab é polasaí mo Roinne ná lán chuidiú a thabhairt do chumainn tuismitheoirí gur mian leo gur tríd an Gaeilge go hiomlán a thabhairfí oideachais dá gcuid páistí.  Tagann sé seo ó pholasaí náisiúnta an Rialtais agus na Roinne Oideachais an teagasc trí Ghaeilge a fhorbairt mar chéim i dtreo athbheochaint na Gaeilge mar theanga chumarsáide i measc an phobail.  In aon chás inar iarr dreamanna tuismitheoirí cuidiú ón Roinn chun scoil lán-Ghaelach a bhunú fuarthas an cuidiú sin go fial: mar shamplaí, Scoil Lorcáin i mBaile Átha Cliath Theas, an scoil lán-Ghaelach ag Ráth Éanna agus an Scoil lán-Ghaelach i mBaile Munna.  Mara mbeadh an cúnamh speisialta a fuarthas ón Roinn ní bheadh aon cheann de na scoileanna sin ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is cinnte go bhfuil deacrachtaí móra sa tslí ar dhream tuismitheoirí a dteastaíonn uathu oideachas lán-Ghaelach a chur ar fáil dá gcuid páistí.  I gcás na bunscolaíochta de is cuid bhunúsach den chóras go bhfreastalódh bunscoil <Col N="861" /> ar cheantar nó ar limistéar áirithe cinnte, paróiste nó cuid de pharóiste, agus go soláthródh tuismitheoirí an cheantair sin cuid de chostas soláthar na scoile: an láthair féin, cuid de chostas na tógála, agus ina dhiaidh sin cuid den chostas cothabhála.  Chomh maith leis sin, is gnáth gur sagart na paróiste a bhíonn ina bhainisteoir ar an scoil agus gur tríd sin a dhéanann an Roinn na gnóthaí uilig a bhaineann le soláthar, cothabháil agus rialú na scoile.</P>
    <P>Is soiléir go mba dheacair do dhream tuismitheoirí, gan eagraíocht pharóiste a bheith ar a gcúl, an saghas sin soláthair a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ní mian leis an Roinn, ar an taobh eile den scéal, córas faoi leith a bhunú le haghaidh soláthar bunscolaíochta trí Ghaeilge.  B'fhearr ar gach bealach na scoileanna lán Ghaelacha a choinneáil laistigh den chóras atá ann faoi láthair. Taobh amuigh de aon ní eile, ba dhíobhálach don Ghaeilge féin a thabhairt le fios gur dream scartha amach ón phobal i gcoitinne iad siúd ar theastaigh oideachas lán-Ghaelach uathu.</P>
    <P>Chun teacht thar an deacracht sin, tá an Roinn sásta téarmaí speisialta a thabhairt do dhreamanna tuismitheoirí chun scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha a bhunú agus tá sin á dhéanamh i gcás na scoileanna a luadh cheanna féin.</P>
    <P>Mar pholasaí i leith forbairt theagasc trí Ghaeilge go ginearálta, áfach, measter go gcaithfear sin a dhéanamh tríd an chóras scolaíochta go hiomlán má tá aon rath le bheith air.  Tá tábhacht leis na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha mar seampláir agus mar chuspóir don phobal i gcoitinne, ach is tríd an teagasc trí Ghaeilge a fhorbairt i ndiaidh a chéile sna scoileanna uilig is fearr a dhéanfar dul chun cinn.  Tá na deacrachtaí atá sa mbealach ar scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha a bhunú chomh mór sin&mdash;agus an deacracht is mó buíon tuismitheoirí a bheith sásta an dícheall agus an íobairt is gá a dhéanamh&mdash;nach féidir a bheith ag súil go mbeidh iontu ach eisceachtaí.</P>
    <P>Is ar an intinn sin atá sé socair a chur ar chumas na múinteoirí sna scoileanna náisiúnta agus ins na hiarbhunscoileanna cuid den teagasc i ngach scoil <Col N="862" /> a thabhairt trí Ghaeilge agus é sin a fhorbairt i ndiaidh a chéile.  Tá soláthar speisialta déanta ina chomhair sin sa churaclam nua bunscoile agus déanfar an soláthar céanna i gcás na n-iarbhunscoileanna i ndiaidh a chéile.</P>
    <P>I dtuaisceart na cathrach tá scoil náisiúnta lán-Ghaelach do bhuachaillí agus do chailíní á bunú ag na Siúracha Doiminiceánacha i nGlasnaíon, taobh leis an iarbhunscoil lán-Ghaelach. Measter go mbeidh ceithre seomraí sa scoil ó thús na scoilbhliana 1972-73 do na haoisghrúpaí ó naíonáin shóisireacha go páistí ocht mbliana d'aois.  Cuirfear seomraí breise agus seomra ilfhóntach, <i>et cetera,</i> leis an scoil de réir a chéile, de réir mar a bheas an scoil ag fás fhad leis na hard-ranganna bunscoile agus páistí ag teacht chuige ó na ceantracha a mbeidh sé ag freastal orthu, mar atá, Fionnghlais, Baile Munna, Droimchonrach. Beaumont, Seantreabh, Fionnbhrú, <i>et cetera</i>.  Meastar go mbeidh ocht seomraí ranga sa scoil amach anseo, maraon le seomra infhóntach, agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Rath hÉanna, tá suíomh nua faighte i gcóir na scoile nua agus pleananna den fhoirgneamh nua a n-ullmhú.  Cuirfear tús leis an scoil le cúig seomraí ranga agus cuirfear seomra ilfhóntach agus seomraí ranga breise ar fáil de réir mar a fhásann an scoil.  Freastalóidh an scoil ar Chluain Tarbh, Baile Harmon, Sutton, Beinn Éadair, Cill Easra, Cúlóg Ard Aidhin, <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;an leath eile de thuisceart na cathrach.</P>
    <P>I ndeisceart Bhaile Átha Cliath tá soláthar déanta anois le oideachas iarbhunscoile lán-Ghaelach a sholáthar do bhuachaillí agus do chailíní.  Bunaíodh Coláiste Eoin do bhuachaillí i dtús na scoilbhliana 1969-70 agus Coláiste Íosagáin do chailíní i dtús na scoilbhliana 1971-72.  Tá sé beartaithe foirgneamh nua a thógáil don dá scoil ar láthair Choláiste Eoin i dTigh Lorcáin agus beidh bloc comónta de chóiríocht speisialta eadar an dá scoil. Táthar ag súil go mbeidh 500 daltaí ann ar fad&mdash;250 i ngach scoil.</P>
    <P>I rith na bliana, bhí cuid mhaith cainte ann fá dtaobh de téacsleabhair i nGaeilge.  Ceann de na cúraimí a <Col N="863" /> leagadh ar an Ghúm ó bunaíodh é téacsleabhair i nGaeilge a sholáthar. Cé gur chuir an Gúm breis agus 100 téacsleabhar ar fáil sa tréimhse suas go dtí 1964 níor leor an soláthar sin ag am ar bith.</P>
    <P>Ní mór a chuimhneamh go raibh deacrachtaí móra sa tslí ar sholáthar téacsábhair i nGaeilge ón tús.  Ní raibh téarmaíocht údarásach ar fáil, agus gan sin ní rachadh údair i mbun saothair.  Bhí athruithe ag dul ar ghramadach, ar litriú agus ar chló na Gaeilge, rud a chuir cosc go mór mór le foilsitheoirí príomháideacha maidir le soláthar téacsleabhar i nGaeilge. Níor tháinig an scéal sin chun socrachta go dtí gur foilsíodh, faoin Ghúm, foclóir de Bhaldraithe 1959, rud a chuir an ghramadach, an litriú agus an cló i riocht caighdéanaithe os comhair phobal na Gaeilge den chéad uair.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, is ó 1959 i leith a b'fhéidir cur i gceart chun téacsleabhair i nGaeilge a sholáthar.  I gcás na téarmaíochta, afach, bhí an deacracht fós ann&mdash;níor leor a raibh de théarmaí ar fáil chun deighleáil leis na hábhair scoile uilig agus go háirithe le habhair eolaíochta a bhí de shíor ag forbairt.</P>
    <P>Deacracht mhór eile a b'ea i gcónaí, agus is ea fós, a laghad daoine atá ar fáil a bhfuil idir Ghaeilge, cháilíocht agus cumas scríbhneoireachta acu chun téacsleabhair a scríobh.  Ceapeann daoine nach bhfuil de dhíth chun leabhra a chur ar fáil ach go mbéadh Gaeilge ag an duine a scríobhann iad ach tá i bhfad niós mó sa chás.</P>
    <P>Táthar anois, afach, i mbun an scéil ar bhealach eagraithe, dea-riartha:</P>
    <P>(1)  Tá gléas iomlán ag obair faoin Ghúm chun téarmaíocht a chur ar fáil.  Tá foireann bhuan ag obair ar chlárú ar bhailiú agus ar eagrú téarmaí.  Tá coiste stiúrtha i mbun eagrú na hoibre sin ar fad agus tá mórchoiste buan ann leis na mórphrionsabail a chinntiú.  I ndiaidh a chéile táthar ag soláthar na téarmaíochta is riachtanach chun téacsleabhair a chur ar fáil i ngach ábhar léinn.  Is bunchéim é seo i soláthar téacsábhair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> (2)  Tá cúram iomlán soláthar téacsleabhar glactha anois ag an Ghúm air féin agus tá foireann speisialta ceaptha chun an gnó a eagrú agus a chur chun cinn.  Is mar seo a leanas a dhéantar an obair:</P>
    <P>(a)  Cuireann an Gúm bunleabhair á scríobh agus tá scéim fial íocaíochta ann do na húdair.</P>
    <P>(b)  Tugann an Gúm deontais fhiala do fhoilsitheoirí príomháideacha chun bunleabhair a chur ar fáil.  Bíonn cúnamh an Ghúim le fáil ag na foilsitheoirí ó thaobh soláthar téarmaíochta de agus ó thaobh comhairle eagarthóireachta go ginearálta.</P>
    <P>(c)  Tugann an Gúm deontais fhiala do fhoilsitheoirí príomháideacha chun téacsleabhair a aistriú go Gaeilge agus bíonn an cúnamh céanna téarmaíochta agus eagarthóireachta le fáil acu ón Ghúm.</P>
    <P>(d)  Cuireann an Gúm féin téacsleabhair á n-aistriú go Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Mar thoradh ar an bheartas sin uilig is mar seo atá staid an scéil ó 1964 i leith.</P>
    <P>1.  D'fhoilsigh an Gúm féin seacht dtéacsleabhair bhunaidh agus cúig aistriúchán; tá ocht dtéacsleabhair bhunaidh eile á gclóbhualadh nó á n-ullmhú don chló; tá deich leabhair á n-aistriú faoi láthair agus tá socruithe á ndhéanamh seacht leabhar eile a chur á n-aistriú.</P>
    <P>2.  Sa tréimhse chéanna, faoi scéim dheontais an Ghúim foilsíodh 21 bunleabhar.</P>
    <P>3.  Sa tréimhse chéanna freisin, foilsíodh deich n-aistriúcháin faoi scéim dheontais an Ghúimh.</P>
    <P>4.  Faoin scéim deontais le haghaidh aistriúcháin tá 17 eile de leabhair á n-aistriú nó á gcur i gcló faoi láthair ag foilsitheoirí príomháideacha.</P>
    <P>5.  Faoin scéim deontais le haghaidh bhunleabhar tá trí leabhair eile ullmhaithe don chló ag foilsitheoir príomháideach.</P>
    <P>Go hachomair i rith na tréimhse ó 1964 i leith foilsíodh, mar aistriúchán nó mar bhunleabhair 43 téacsleabhar i <Col N="865" /> gcomparáid le 100 sa tréimhse ar fad ó 1927 go 1964 agus tá 45 leabhair eile, bunleabhair nó aistriúcháin dá n-ullmhú ag an Gúm agus ag na foilsitheoirí príomháideacha; is é sin, san iomlán beagnach oiread téacsleabhar foilsithe nó á n-ullmhú ó 1964 i leith agus a foilsíodh ar fad sa tréimhse 37 mbliain ó 1927 go 1964.</P>
    <P>Ní hé líon na leabhar nua fhoilsithe an scéal ar fad, áfach, ach go bhfuil gléas agus meaisínreadh anois ann chun a chinntiú go mbeidh soláthar téacsleabhar i nGaeilge á dhéanamh go rialta agus ar líon a méadóidh ó bhliain go bliain.</P>
    <P>Ní miste anois lua a dhéanamh ar an soláthar speisialta atá déanta agus beartaithe do na bunscoileanna.</P>
    <P>Sa chéad áit tá i lámhleabhar an churaclaim nua soláthar iomlán le haghaidh an teagasc trí Ghaeilge, téarmaíocht, stór focal agus samplaí.  Ina theannta sin tá socrú déanta leis na foilsitheoirí príomháideacha, faoi scéim dheontais, téacsleabhair a chur ar fáil le haghaidh teagasc gach aon ghné den churaclam nua.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta sin arís tá cúnamh speisialta airgid á fháil ag dream múinteoirí Gaeltachta chun a chur ar a gcumas téacsleabhair le haghaidh na Gaeltachta go speisialta a sholáthar. Tá roinnt leabhar curtha ar fáil cheana féin acu agus á scaipeadh sna Gaeltachtaí go ginearálta agus tá tuilleadh leabhar beartaithe acu.</P>
    <P>Shíl mé gurb fhiú tagairt a dhéanamh don méid atá a dhéanamh ó thaobh téacsleabhair a chur ar fáil mar ón méid a léim faoin cháineadh a bhíonn ag siúl ag roinnt daoine fa dtaobh de tá cosúlacht air nach dtuigeann siad na h-athruithe móra atá tagtha ar fhoilsiú na leabhar seo ó 1964 i leith agus nach dtuigeann siad go minic na deacrachtaí atá ag gabháil leis a gcineál seo oibre.</P>
    <P>Tá gné amháin de chúrsaí na Gaeilge gur deacair brí ná tuiscint a bhaint as agus gur deacair foighneamh leis go minic.  Tá mé ag tagairt don síorcháineadh agus don síordhisbeagadh a bhíonn ar siúl ag daoine áirithe faoin Roinn Oideachais agus faoin Aire Oideachais i leith chúrsaí na Gaeilge. <Col N="866" /> Is gnách go mbaineann na daoine seo le hinstitiúidí tábhachtacha ardoideachais, ach cé go mbíonn siad ardghlórach faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge sa chóras bunoideachais agus meánoideachais, ní bhíonn focal astu faoin bhfaillí agus faoin bheag-is-fiú atá á dhéanamh ar an Ghaeilge sa réimse ina bhfuil siad féin ag obair.  Ní léir, ach oiread, aon rud a bheith á dhéanamh acu féin chun feabhas a chur ar chúrsaí na Gaeilge ná an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sna hinstitiúdí ina bhfuil siad ag feidhmiú.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is fada ó bhaile a labhrann an pilibín míog,&rdquo; adeir an seanfhocal, agus is fada ó bhaile a labhrann na hollúna ardoicheais a bhíonn ag síorcháineadh daoine eile.  An é nach bhfuil aon ní cearr le cúrsaí na Gaeilge sna hinstitiúdí acu féin?  An bhfuil teagasc na Gaeilge agus an teagasc trí Ghaeilge gan cháin gan locht iontu? Cén uair a fheicfimid an lá nuair a bheidh cumann i measc múinteoirí ardléinn is ardoideachais chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sna réigiúin sin?</P>
    <P>Dé réir dhealraimh, mar atá an scéal faoi láthair, ní deacair leo suan ar chnea duine eile.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking on the question of all-Irish schools and Irish streams and the provision of textbooks in Irish and I should like to make a few remarks here on a statement which was issued recently by Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge in relation to all-Irish schools and Irish streams.  The first sentence in the statement issued on the occasion of a meeting organised by An Comhdháil on January 11th to discuss the position of all-Irish schools and Irish streams in English-medium schools is, in my view, fairly typical of confused thinking proceeding from insufficient knowledge and a tendency to polarise.  The statement says, and I quote:</P>
    <P>It appears that the idea is being put forward that the establishment of an Irish-medium stream in Englishmedium schools is preferable to the foundation of an all-Irish school.</P>
    <P>This is said in spite of the fact that in the very quotations given from official statements by me as Minister for Education <Col N="867" /> and the Department of Education, it is perfectly clear that what is being proposed and advocated is the extension of teaching through Irish throughout all the schools by having one aspect of the curriculum or one stream in the school taught through Irish, in addition to the provision of all-Irish schools where there is sufficient support to make this feasible.</P>
    <P>The confusion of thought manifested in the statement from An Chomhdháil can be illustrated by a few quotations. It is said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>We strongly disagree, however, with the idea that Irish-language streams in all-English schools are preferable to all-Irish schools.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, such a polarisation of choice has been advocated by nobody.  The statement, however continues, and I quote again:</P>
    <P>And we further disagree that it is possible to Gaelicise an Englishmedium school through the establishment of an Irish stream in the hope that it will eventually become an all-Irish school.</P>
    <P>Further on the statement says:</P>
    <P>It is obvious that it is not possible to maintain successfully an all-Irish stream in an English medium school in a wholly English language environment not to mention attempting to expand it generally.</P>
    <P>The logical effect of these statements is that the development of teaching through Irish in our schools can come about only through the establishment of all-Irish schools and in the foreseeable future such schools can form only a tiny minority.  Why then should we ensure that all our teachers be qualified and competent to teach through Irish? Must we abandon the concept that what is fundamental to the new primary school curriculum is the teaching through Irish of some aspects of the curriculum to all our pupils in all our schools?  Is it not absolutely clear that the development of teaching through Irish depends on the degree to which all pupils, all teachers and all parents are involved in the process?  Is <Col N="868" /> it not clear also from official statements that this concept is being put forward, not in opposition to, but complementary to the development of all-Irish schools.  The word &ldquo;ghetto&rdquo; is used in the statement from An Chomhdháil. If teaching through Irish is to be developed through all-Irish schools only, as seems to be laid down in the statement, is this not a deliberate creation of a ghetto situation?  All-Irish schools, certainly, but not in polarised opposition to all-English schools.  In my view such an approach would do irreparable harm.</P>
    <P>I have announced already my decision to re-open the school at Ranafast.  The decision to close the school there was reached when the enrolment of pupils fell to a point where the retention of a second teacher was no longer possible.  It was my belief that an injustice would be done to the children if a one-teacher school were to be continued in operation. Some of the parents of the district had anticipated the amalgamation of the school with Annagry and sent the children to the latter school before the official amalgamation took place on the 30th June, 1970.  At that time the combined enrolment of the schools at Meenaleck and Ranafast, totalling 59, would not have been sufficient to establish a three-teacher school, which I regard as the smallest unit that can be considered to be viable and effective educationally.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there was no alternative to amalgamation with Annagry school. I had a number of surveys carried out in the area and a recent survey of the two districts of Meenaleck and Ranafast shows that the combined numbers now warrant the setting up of a three-teacher school at Ranafast.  I am glad that it is now possible to bring together into one school the children of these two districts, districts that are known so well for the purity and the richness of the Irish spoken in them.</P>
    <P>As I am on this particular topic, I would like to make reference to a matter that arose some time ago in connection with a parliamentary question that was addressed to me with regard to two texts, the publication of which arose in one case and the acceptance <Col N="869" /> of which as a suitable text for the certificate examinations arose in the case of the other.  During the course of my reply I gave the reason why, without the omission of certain poems in one case and of certain stories in the other, my Department could not agree to the publication of the poetry text or the prescribing of the prose text.  The author of the poetry text, Criostóir Ó Floinn, is under the misapprehension apparently that my use of the word &ldquo;Gársúil&rdquo; referred to his text.  It is due to him for me to say that in using that word I was not referring in any way to his text.</P>

      <P>This long debate on education has been very valuable not only in the context of the speeches made by the various Deputies but also in underlining the fact that the Department of Education is recognised now as being one of the most important Departments of State.  The interest shown by Deputies during this debate is a reflection of the exceptional interest of the people in the subject of education.</P>

      <P>Our whole future as a nation is dependent on the type of education being made available to our young people and it is through the co-operation of all concerned that we can make available the necessary educational facilities for our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire debate was conducted on a very high level.  However, I regret to have to exclude from this the opening remarks of Deputy Desmond when he treated us to a rather condescending performance.  He adopted what is now his well-known pose of addressing us with an air of superiority.  I mention this merely in passing but I accept that the remainder of his contribution was very good.  He did not do himself any particular credit by the kind of personal remarks made in the early stages of his statement.  I can understand the <Col N="870" /> chagrin of the Opposition parties in relation to education because the Opposition in the past classified this Department as being the &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; one whereas it is now one of the most important of the Departments, thanks to the enlightened policy of Fianna Fáil.  In recent years there has been an educational revolution in this country of the very best kind.  I am prepared to ignore remarks such as those made by Deputy Desmond in so far as they concern me.  The achievements of the past three years will speak for themselves and future generations of Irish children will have every reason to be grateful for what has been achieved.  Deputy Desmond appeared to think that I would become known as the one who had done nothing.  Fortunately for the educational development of the country and, in a very minor way for myself, the vast majority of the people appear to think otherwise and, indeed, some believe that I am doing too much.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I welcome constructive criticism.  I do not pretend nor do my Department pretend to know everything or to have all the knowledge in connection with education. I am very anxious to have consultation with all those concerned in the educational field.  We all recognise that this is an era of rapid development in education.  One of my problems in relation to consultation is that the pressure of work and of change is so great that I cannot devote as much time to it as I would wish.  All I would say in relation to the aspect of pressure of work is that an aspirant to this particular office in the future will need to be not only alert mentally but to be very fit physically also.</P>
    <P>With regard to constructive criticism and personal abuse all I can say is that it does not cause me the loss of any night's sleep.  When people stoop to personal abuse their case, I believe, is already lost.  I also believe that such people are invariably more frustrated than I am.  I am not now referring to Deputies because, to be honest and fair, so far as I personally am concerned, there has been very little personal abuse involved.</P>
    <P>What does tend to annoy me to a minor extent&mdash;and I am, I think, difficult <Col N="871" /> enough to annoy&mdash;is the situation in which there is what I might call the oversimplification of problems.  I remember recently reading a leading article in one of our daily papers in which it was said&mdash;I am paraphrasing now&mdash;in relation to community schools, that if the Minister had made a simple statement, such as he has made now, at the beginning, we would not have had to go through the problems and difficulties of the past year. When I read this I began to think of all the varied interests involved, of all the long hours of argument, discussion, deliberation, dialogue, consensus and, finally, agreement, to the credit of those directly involved, and I wondered if the leader writer had thought of what might have happened had I issued in the beginning what he regarded as a simple statement.  He would, I think, agree that, because of the very difficult problems involved and because of the very many interests involved, we would have had the same amount of trouble and the same degree of emotion, perhaps not on the same points but certainly on different points.</P>
    <P>It should be underlined that nothing in this life is simple.  There are no easy solutions in circumstances such as, for example, the teachers dispute, the community schools and all the other problems in the educational field. There is nothing simple about any of these.  When a problem is solved it is very easy to have hindsight and to assert that, had it been dealt with in another way, it would have disappeared of its own accord.  It most certainly would not.  To overcome problems of this kind it is essential that there should be discussion, deliberation, dialogue and so on; then, ultimately, with goodwill on all sides it is possible to overcome difficulties.  But there is nothing simple about it.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress that in my approach to education the child is the basic element and my whole aim is to ensure that the child will have his full talents and abilities developed to their fullest extent whatever the social background of the child.  The many changes which have been and are being made <Col N="872" /> in the educational field, both in the content of the courses and in the administration and organisation of the system, might possibly convey to the superficial observer the impression that these changes are the result of a haphazard, piecemeal approach.  That is very far from being the case.  Those who trouble to inform themselves will find that the growth, development and expansion of the educational system are proceeding in accordance with a well thought out and clearly enunciated overall educational plan, a plan which has formed the basis of public pronouncements by various Ministers for Education over the past decade.</P>
    <P>It is a truism that each child is a unique human being.  As is pointed out in the primary curriculum handbook, each child is also a complex human being with physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual needs and potentialities.  Because each child is an individual he deserves to be valued for himself and to be provided with the kind and variety of opportunities which will enable him to develop his natural powers at his own pace and to his full capacity.  How he will develop is influenced not merely by his own natural endowments but also by his environment.  It is the vital role of the school to develop the child's potentialities, to foster what he brings with him from his environment and to endeavour to supply that which may be lacking in that environment.</P>
    <P>The principles which underline what we are setting out to achieve may be stated briefly as follows: (1) the provision of equality of educational opportunity for all&mdash;that implies catering for the aptitudes and abilities of every child; (2) in our endeavours to achieve this, the providing of education on comprehensive lines in both the primary and post-primary schools; and (3) the promotion of the idea of education as a continuous and integrated process.  Any action or initiative taken by my Department will bear scrutiny in relation to any or all of these objectives.  The principles I have enunciated form an integrated and coherent philosophy of education which will enable us to face and overcome <Col N="873" /> the problems and challenges in this most exacting field.  This philosophy has not been formulated in isolation. We have drawn strength not only from the pace of educational change elsewhere which our involvement in UNESCO and, more especially, our involvement in the OECD has made us aware of, but also from the various domestic inquiries and investigations undertaken, the most significant of which is Investment in Education which clearly pointed out the way we must go to satisfy the needs of our people.</P>
    <P>When one seeks to rationalise educational needs one is confronted with two broadly-based considerations&mdash; first, the moral development of the individual as a person in his own right and also, of course, as a self-reliant integrated member of the community in accordance with the values and conditions of that community and, secondly, the fostering of the individual's innate aptitudes and talents and their translation into skills and achievements so that each person will be enabled to live his own full life and, in the process, make the maximum possible contribution to the community to which he relates.</P>
    <P>The logical application of these objectives to the physical world of the educational system means that the programmes of instruction must adapt to the person and not the other way round and the range of choice in subject material offered must be as wide as the range of aptitudes presenting themselves; in other words, the system must be concentrated and comprehensive. It is towards this goal that all our endeavours are directed.  Much has been achieved towards this end, especially in the area of the school curriculum.  The primary schools, freed from the constraints of premature examinations, are regrouping themselves in large units and facing up to the challenge and the fulfilment of the new curriculum which enshrines the child-centred concept of education and is the basis of the integrated comprehensive system.</P>
    <P>On the post-primary side courses have been broadened in line with our comprehensive thinking and syllabuses <Col N="874" /> have been brought to the necessary pitch.  It is here, since the introduction of free post-primary education in 1967 that the thrust of expansion has been most marked, rendering the need for the rationalisation of facilities correspondingly urgent.  We have put forward proposals for the resolution of the problems posed at post-primary level by the implementation of the comprehensive idea.  Unanimity was never a feature of the Irish scene, and it was inevitable that our proposals should be resisted.  However, I am confident that, with the goodwill of all concerned, agreement can be obtained, as it must.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made and is being made in the provision of the regional technical colleges and in the setting up of the Limerick Institute of Higher Education.  This accords with our stated objective of providing for the practical and technicallyminded among our students and will correct the serious imbalance of expertise brought about by our traditional bias towards academic studies. Community schools, as we are now aware, are being provided in Tallaght and Blanchardstown and are proposed for other areas.  These, coupled with the rationalisation of other post-primary centres to which I have referred, will not only provide a proper mix in this area of education but will enable facilities to be provided whereby any person of any age may be enabled to follow whatever educational pursuit he needs or he feels he needs to make him a fuller or a more competent person.</P>
    <P>I have sketched here in broad outline our philosophy and our planning. In my view, what I propose is rational and reasonable; it is essential and also inevitable.  Its promise is so great that, by comparison, the difficulty of its implementation fades into insignificance. We in the business of education have for our raw material the nation's most precious asset, our children.  Let us give them the opportunity they deserve and a system for which they will thank us.</P>
    <P>During the course of the discussion mention has been made of the issue of a White Paper.  One would get the feeling from some of the statements <Col N="875" /> made in relation to this that a White Paper is a panacea for all ills.  I have no doubt that, had I myself proposed the issuing of a White Paper, many of the people who criticise me for not having done so would have no hesitation in stating that my issuing of the White Paper was purely for the purpose of holding up the implementation of much-needed reform.  There is nothing in relation to the Government's educational policy which has not already been fully spelled out, apart from, perhaps, higher education, and, as I have already mentioned, I shall consider the situation in relation to the publication of a White Paper on Higher Education when the report on higher education has been published and when we have got the views of all those interested.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in relation to this, there is nothing of such a complicated nature in our policy that would demand an elaborate White Paper in order to explain it.  The policy is simply a recognition of the onus that is on the State to provide, as far as possible, equality of educational opportunity for all our children.  In the case of post-primary education this can be done only if schools are sufficiently large in size to provide a fully comprehensive curriculum catering for literary, scientific and practical subjects.  Educational guidance can be effective only if, when the pupil's aptitude and ability have been ascertained, the school curriculum is sufficiently broad to cater for his particular bent.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive education on those lines can be provided in secondary schools, vocational schools, comprehensive schools and community schools, provided that they are sufficiently large to enable the very wide range of subjects involved to be catered for.  While co-operation between existing schools can be a help in this direction, the administrative and other difficulties involved are usually such as to reduce very much any potential benefits.  In pointing out that comprehensive education may be given in any type of post-primary school provided it is sufficiently large to offer the necessarily broadly based curriculum, it must be <Col N="876" /> stressed at the same time, as I have done on many occasions before, that the schools is not merely a building, that it is essentially the sum total of the teachers and the pupils who work in it.  It should, therefore, be an extension of the home and should reflect and cater for those values which are prized by the pupils and by their parents.  I have made all these observations on many occasions previously, and repeating them in a White Paper could serve very little purpose other than to delay the implementation of a policy which is both explicit and unambiguous.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred here to the question of special education.  It was very obvious to me that those who were interesting themselves in this matter of special education recognised the very considerable progress that has been made by the Department in this regard, particularly in recent times.  I noted that some Deputies had a very clear knowledge of what was being done, while other Deputies who made statements in relation to this matter quite obviously had not the slightest idea of what was being done by my Department. Special education is being provided for and increasing number of children each year.  The number in special education at the present time is over 6,000.  The most significant increase is in the case of schools for the mentally handicapped where the provision of extra facilities at the existing schools and the recognition of new schools at Carlow, Tralee, Sligo, Roscrea and Castlebar have brought the number to over 4,300.</P>
    <P>An extra 117 teachers over and above the normal staff of schools have been sanctioned for remedial teaching in ordinary national schools throughout the country.  Of course, for those children who cannot be catered for within the ordinary school special remedial teaching will continue to be provided in the child guidance clinics.  Bearing in mind that there are children in many parts of the country who are not within easy reach of these special facilities I have asked county medical officers to bring these cases to the notice of the appropriate divisional inspector for the area.  In this way I hope it will be possible to make some special arrangement <Col N="877" /> for an ever-increasing number of those pupils with learning problems in primary schools.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made during the course of the debate to socially and culturally-deprived children and to the equalisation of educational opportunity particularly in relation to culturally and socially deprived children.  In general, I should say that the equalisation of educational opportunity must commence at an early stage of the child's educational career.  For this reason alone is it essential that we continue our efforts to bring about the most favourable conditions feasible in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the introduction of the new curriculum, making as it will for greater flexibility and furnishing the opportunity for more group and project teaching, will enable greater care and attention to be devoted to the individual child and to the development of his particular aptitudes and abilities.  The improvement in pupil-teacher ratio resulting from a greatly increased input of teachers to the schools and the better distribution of the teaching force through the amalgamation of smaller rural schools is also vital in this regard.</P>
    <P>The continuing expansion of arrangements for remedial teaching will play a further significant part in this process. Already there are some 120 remedial teachers in larger schools. The intention is to have this number increased by 70 to 80 teachers per annum.  The question as to the extent to which the educational capacity and cultural development of children is affected by their home background, by social conditions, by family environment in their pre-school and early school years is being studied in the Rutland Street project.  The research aims of this experiment are to identify the factors present in educational disadvantage and to suggest appropriate remedial measures in an Irish setting.</P>
    <P>A number of practical steps have been taken with these aims in view. These are (1) the provision of a pre-school centre for 180 three and four year old children; (2) the provision of a junior school for children in the five, six and seven year old range and (3) <Col N="878" /> improved equipment and a more favourable staffing ratio.  The original group of 90 children entered the pre-school centre in June, 1969, and they completed the two-year period of the school in June, 1971.  They are now following the first of the three years which they will spend in the junior school.</P>
    <P>Detailed findings of the experiment will not be available until 1974. Already, however, there are encouraging signs in relation to the success of this project.  Some of the children have reached a level in excess of their contemporaries in the city areas.  A favourable attitude on the part of the children to school is clearly perceptible. Furthermore&mdash;and perhaps this is a factor of particular importance&mdash;the parents have shown a keen interest in the project and it is now obvious that most of them have developed strong, positive attitudes towards education and the success of the children in later life.  I would like to pay here a particular tribute to the parents for the manner in which they co-operated with and involved themselves in this projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is the Van Leer experiment in Rutland Street.  It has been operated by my Department and the Van Leer Foundation in co-operation with each other.  I feel it is a project of exceptional importance because when the full findings of the experiment are available to us we will be able to make use of them in relation to our schools generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has also been made during the course of the debate to reformatory and industrial schools and to the report of the Committee on Reformatory and Industrial Schools issued in November, 1970.  I may say that, in so far as the observations made in this report should be interpreted as a criticism of the State's role in the past in this field of activity, I acknowledge the deficiencies in the administration of the system.  It was a recognition of this fact which led to the setting up of the committee.  On the other hand, I should like to avail myself of this <Col N="879" /> opportunity to express my own and the Government's gratitude to the conductors who guided the fortunes of these schools for so many years under very difficult conditions, for their untiring zeal and constant devotion to the interests and the welfare of the children under their care and for their unremitting efforts to improve the circumstances of the children and extend the opportunities for their educational development.</P>
    <P>The observations and recommendations in the Kennedy Report have been submitted to various interested organisations and associations for their views.  Decisions will be taken by the Government in due course with full regard to the views expressed and in the light of the relevant considerations. In the meantime, as I have already mentioned in my opening statement, certain measures have been taken to meet urgent priorities and to ensure that the interests and welfare of the children at present in care are given immediate attention.</P>
    <P>Major works of reconstruction and adaptation of buildings have been undertaken in some cases for the purpose of creating smaller self-contained group units.  Where new buildings are required it is intended that the necessary accommodation should be provided by way of group home units, a prototype of which has already been drawn up.  The new St. Laurence's Centre in Finglas will have a remand and assessment unit as well as a school for delinquent boys.  Almost all the boys who were sent on remand hitherto to Marlborough House may now be sent to St. Laurence's.  When a separate building is available for the remand and assessment units before the end of 1972 and a planned new school in substitution for St. Conleth's.  Daingean, is available in Oberstown, County Dublin, it will be possible to close down Marlborough House completely. In the meantime, I am seeing what further I can do in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in those young people.  As I said on a previous occasion when speaking on this Estimate, <Col N="880" /> as far as I can remember the first official visit I made to any area in relation to my Department was to St. Conleth's in Daingean.  I made a number of changes there, having surveyed the whole situation in relation to the educational aspect.  Very significant advances have been made in the area of children in care in the last two years and it is proposed that further developments will be promoted in the immediate future with even greater impetus.  I can deal briefly with the matter in relation to two broad categories of children referred to in the Kennedy Report.</P>
    <P>The first category represents the great majority of the children in these schools.  They lead perfectly normal children's lives.  Then there is the small minority and this category represents problem children who have come into conflict with the law.  In regard to the first group, there are at present major works of reconstruction and adaptation being undertaken in many of the schools, the purpose being to create smaller self-contained units.  This is a very important aspect of the work. In other cases, new buildings have been acquired and it is proposed to provide this accommodation by way of group units.  The first of these homes is already under construction, another of them has reached the tender stage and a third will be built in the near future. In conjunction with such developments, arrangements are being made to acquire houses in suburban areas in which residential accommodation will be provided for groups of children from the schools.</P>
    <P>The training of staff has been referred to in the report I have mentioned. This is of vital importance.  Special in-service training courses have been organised at various centres.  Furthermore, a special one where professional courses for the younger members of the staff&mdash;the first of its kind in the country&mdash;can be provided has been organised in Kilkenny with financial assistance from the Department during the present school year.  These courses will be repeated in the next five years. Special attention is paid to the arrangements for satisfactory educational facilities for the children at primary, <Col N="881" /> post-primary and, where appropriate, post-secondary levels.  The increase in the number of children staying on in schools for longer periods is a particularly welcome development and a source of satisfaction to all concerned. I am particularly interested in this and, so as to increase and to facilitate this development, it has been arranged that in the case of children who remain on in schools after the age of 17 to complete a course of education suited to their aptitudes and abilities, a grant equivalent to the full statutory grant may be paid as from 1st July, 1972.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the problem of boys who have come into conflict with the law.  In this sphere also, significant progress has been made.  It should be emphasised that the object of the provisions being made in this area is the rehabilitation of the children through a programme of education, using that term in its very widest sense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton in the course of his speech said that we appear to be laying more stress, or too much stress, on the clever pupil rather than on the other pupils.  I want to assure him that is not so.  We are concerned with the development of every child irrespective of his abilities and irrespective of the social class from which he may have come.  We are equally concerned with the education of the mentally handicapped as with the education of any other children.  That is even more so because it is true to say that in no aspect of our educational system has so much been done by the Departments in recent years as in the education of mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is still true to say that the greatest assistance goes to the brilliant child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  It is really a matter of what our concern is Particularly in recent times, we have been very concerned with the education of the mentally handicapped and the physically handicapped and we have made very worthwhile progress. The whole atmosphere in this respect has changed.  We are too well aware of <Col N="882" /> the time when parents did not admit to having a mentally handicapped child as if it were some type of stigma.  This attitude has gone.  People now realise that a mentally handicapped child can be born into any family, whether rich or poor, whether from people of high or low intelligence.  In this respect I should like to pay a tribute to the dedication of members of my staff who are directly concerned with this aspect of education.</P>
      <P>At this point I shall give some figures.  In relation to the moderately mentally handicapped, in 1964 there were six schools, 19 teachers and 316 pupils.  In 1971, the figures were 23 schools, 120 teachers and 1,560 pupils. In relation to mildly handicapped people, in 1964 there were 11 schools, 55 teachers and 882 pupils.  In 1971 the figures were 24 schools, 170 teachers and 2,650 pupils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not got that.  I dealt at considerable length in my opening statement with the new curriculum in the primary schools because I felt that this was an exceptional innovation and one which has been regarded as well worthwhile by all those who have studied it.  It is true to say that all parties in this House have welcomed this new curriculum. The text books for the implementation of the new curriculum are being prepared.  We have the question of these text books under very active consideration in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new curriculum was introduced in the primary schools on 1st July last.  That is a mere few months ago. It is very understandable that a full complement of text books could not be available immediately to cover all the various aspects of the curriculum for every class.  Remarkable progress has been made.  I should like to acknowledge the whole-hearted co-operation which the educational publishers have given to my Department.  At present the publishers are preparing a new series of English readers.  In fact, they are preparing a complete learning <Col N="883" /> scheme which is based on the most modern approach and is specifically geared to meet the requirements of the curriculum.  New textbooks on mathematics are already available for all classes and are setting new standards in presentation and illustration.  Various aspects of social and environmental studies are well catered for by a substantial number of textbooks which are stimulating in their approach and are very well produced. In addition to these textbooks we have some helpful handbooks available for teachers.  There are also handbooks on the teaching of art and craft and on the teaching of physical education.</P>
    <P>My Department are compiling comprehensive song books which will supplement the collections available now from some of the educational publishers.  Every school in the country has been provided with the nucleus of a reference library but the greatest single help towards the implementation of the new curriculum is the very fine handbook recently produced by my Department.  The two volumes of this handbook have been sent to every teacher in the country.  I am happy to say that they have been received with universal approval and appreciation.</P>
    <P>I notice, in a statement by Deputy FitzGerald that all parties are agreed on the policy of amalgamation of small rural national schools.  This has not always been the case.  There were some prominent Fine Gael speakers who in the past extolled the virtues of two-teacher schools and argued against their absorption in a larger unit.  The policy of amalgamation has as its foremost consideration the benefit to the children in the schools concerned. Amalgamation may take place in circumstances where there is no reduction in the number of teachers employed in the amalgamated school as compared with the combined staff of the individual schools.  At the same time I am fully conscious of the contribution which the amalgamation of small schools makes either immediately or ultimately to the more equitable distribution of the total teaching force. A teaching post saved on the amalgamation of two or more schools represents <Col N="884" /> a teacher made available for services in another school and a contribution towards the reduction in the number of unduly large classes in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I should mention that in the course of the year ending 30th September, 1971, 64 posts were saved immediately on the day of amalgamation, while it is anticipated that a further reduction of 34 posts will be made over the year with the retirement or transfer of a member of the existing staff of schools amalgamated.  As was to be expected on the occasion of amalgamation, the conditions of service of the existing staff are especially safeguarded by an arrangement for the retention of a teacher on the staff in excess of what is allowed under the normal regulations. Where the normal staffing provision is exceeded the additional teacher is encouraged to transfer to another post, and an incentive payment scheme was introduced in 1969, as Deputies are aware.  Under this scheme teachers may be transferred from a supernumerary position in a certain school to another school and are paid a lump sum of £200.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, in order to make this scheme more attractive I have arranged that the amount of the lump sum shall be increased to £400.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Hardly.  It is estimated that there are about 100 teachers at present in such supernumerary posts.  I am aware that, for personal reasons, some of these teachers would not be willing to leave their existing posts, but I should hope that others who are not so restricted in their choice of school would be induced to take advantage of the terms of the incentive payment scheme as now revised.</P>

    <P>The question of the age of transfer to post-primary schools was raised again this year.  I examined this matter deeply in my reply on a previous debate and I do not intend to go into the matter now.  The minimum age of transfer is 12 years on 1st January <Col N="885" /> following the commencement of the school year.  In other words, the child must be 11 years eight months on the first day of the school year in which he enters the post-primary school.  There was always a minimum age limit in regard to entry to secondary schools. The present age limit is the result of a full examination of this question, which took place at the time of the introduction of the free post-primary scheme when meetings were held with representatives of the various school associations.  The Plowden Report, in discussing the age of transfer, comes down in favour of transfer at 12 years of age.  That is, it favours the transfer in the September following the twelfth birthday which gives an age of 12 years and eight months on admission to secondary schools.  These are some of the arguments in favour of 12-plus instead of 11-plus, and they are relevant. It has been said that a break at 11 years of age may cut across a phase of learning and attitudes.</P>
    <P>An unself-conscious period in art, for example, may last until 12 or 13 years of age.  Many children at the top in the primary school may find their progress slowed down by premature emphasis on class instruction. Plowden makes a number of other points which I do not intend to quote.  I spoke of this at some length in my reply to a previous Estimate.  The Scottish Council of Research in Education sponsored a detailed inquiry regarding the age of transfer from primary to secondary schools, the results of which were published in 1966.  The age of transfer in Scotland is 12 years.</P>
    <P>In my introductory statement I mentioned that we were proposing to provide teacher centres in various areas throughout the country.  The introduction of the new curriculum in national schools renders it necessary to familiarise the majority of national teachers with its meaning and with the methods and approaches inherent in the curriculum. Apart from the changes in the curriculum, it is essential that teachers be brought up-to-date in aspects of education that have been brought to the fore by advances and developments in educational and psychological studies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> The role of primary education has changed fundamentally.  It is now the first stage in a continuous integrated process and no longer is it a self-contained system.  In itself this demands a new approach from the teacher.  Furthermore, it is important for the teacher to have a basic knowledge of assessment techniques, of child psychology, of the problem of the backward child, environmental and social problems, and so on.</P>
    <P>The problems confronting post-primary teachers are no less formidable; indeed, they are similar in many respects.  Changes in the range and nature of the curriculum are involved as well as the consequent changes in methods and attitudes.  Furthermore, it is essential that teachers be familiar with the modern approaches and techniques and with many of the products of modern technology if the pupils are to derive full benefit from the educational opportunities now offered to them.</P>
    <P>A great number of in-service courses have been provided, not only by my Department but by teachers' organisations and by various teachers' study groups.  These courses have given considerable impetus to curricula development and to the advancement of educational thought among teachers generally.</P>
    <P>However, it is considered that courses alone cannot meet the needs of the situation and that something more permanent in nature and more closely identified with the day-to-day work in the classrooms is required. For that reason, I decided to set up teacher centres at various places throughout the country, perhaps starting with ten this year.</P>
    <P>By a teacher centre I mean a place that is suitably furnished, equipped with library and teaching aids, where teachers in all branches of the educational system can meet and discuss problems and exchange ideas.  I see it as a place where teachers may prepare equipment and materials for use in their own schools and for distribution among schools in the locality.  It will be a place where teachers can become <Col N="887" /> familiar with the use of audio-visual aids, where the work of the teachers and the pupils may be displayed, and where publishers may exhibit textbooks. Lastly, I see it as a place where primary and post-primary teachers are afforded an opportunity of becoming familiar with each other's work and with each other's difficulties.  It is a place where many of the problems associated with the transfer of pupils from primary to post-primary schools may find a solution.</P>
    <P>There has been a welter of debate and discussion regarding community schools.  So many red herrings have been drawn across the trail that there has been a tendency to lose sight of the basic issue.  As I have said, the main objective of Government policy with regard to education is to provide equality of educational opportunity, for all, irrespective of ability, social class or the area of the country in which the child lives.  As part of the achievement of this objective, it must be stressed once more that the onus is on us to provide at post-primary level comprehensive facilities in each area in order to cater for the varying aptitudes and abilities of our children. In this way we will avoid wastage of our most precious resource, namely, the initiative and capacity of our people.</P>
    <P>Within the limits of the resources of finance and manpower which are available, or are likely to be available, we must aim at achieving our objective in a way that will avoid unnecessary waste and duplication, not only of capital expenditure but of scarce teaching skills.  For historical reasons our post-primary schools have developed in a haphazard way.  We have a large number of small schools, resulting in a fragmented post-primary school pattern.</P>
    <P>Our secondary and vocational schools have evolved in different ways but now there is considerable overlapping in relation to the services they are providing for the community. Within the vocational school service, 38 separate vocational education committees are operating, to a great extent independently of each other.  Within <Col N="888" /> the secondary school service there are lay schools and schools run by the religious.  There are boys' schools, girls' schools and mixed schools, with a host of authorities who operate independently of each other.</P>
    <P>We could not continue to justify this on any rational grounds.  The need for reform and restructuring of our post-primary educational system to meet the challenge that lies before us is obvious and it is accepted by all parties. When I set my hand to this task I had no illusions about the difficulties. It is too easy for various vested interests to misrepresent my motives and for armchair critics to devise weird and wonderful alternatives that have no relationship to reality and have no hope of being accepted by the legitimate interests involved or by the great majority of our people.  Awareness of the difficulties involved and the fact that any initiatives from me would be misrepresented did not prevent me from formulating proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was in the formulation of these proposals that the idea of community schools emerged.  For Deputy FitzGerald and other Deputies to stand up in this House and tell me that Opposition Deputies forced me to modify my proposal in relation to community schools is simply ridiculous. He is the Deputy who, while speaking loud and long in the House about the position of the minority community in relation to the community schools, had in the policy statement he made on behalf of Fine Gael nothing to offer them other than that their problem was a difficult one.  In the same statement he had no solution to offer for any of the other problems except a whole mass of generalities which, in the effort to be all things to all men, meant nothing to anybody.  If I were to rely on the Deputies who criticised me in that respect for suggestions as to how I might modify my proposals, I would be waiting a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies insisted for a very <Col N="889" /> considerable time on saying that I was subservient to other groups but, if that statement had been true, how is it that I have now made changes?  The fact is, of course, that my preliminary proposals were published as if they were final proposals.  This was responsible for the further fact that it was almost impossible to discuss the proposals in an unemotional manner.  I made it clear from the beginning that they were only preliminary proposals and that I was not inflexible on them.</P>

      <P>The fact is that I was not inflexible.  It should be patently obvious by now that no individual was more aware than I was that modifications would be made after all the necessary consultations had taken place.  I can well appreciate how dissatisfied the Opposition are at the fact that I have succeeded in reaching the point where there is general acceptance of the basis on which community schools would be established.  I have solved the problems to which they could offer no solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me remind the Opposition that criticism is no substitute for action and, when it is engaged in without any reference to the national interest, it is nothing short of criminal.  We heard the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; being bandied around this House for the benefit of those who would classify themselves as liberal. The fact that the same people are absolutely illiberal in relation to the doctrines they profess seems to be irrelevant.  What is terribly relevant is that the constant use of the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; has given a handle to be latched on to by those in the Six Counties who are past masters in the art of blatantly sectarian practices.  I will not labour this matter further except to say that the minority community here have every reason to acknowledge, as they have repeatedly acknowledged, that there is nothing sectarian in the manner in which they <Col N="890" /> have been dealt with by my Department.</P>
      <P>The question of teacher representation on the board was also raised. Naturally enough, as a teacher myself I have the very highest regard for teachers.  I gave this matter deep consideration before framing my proposals. The House will appreciate the difficulties of a situation in which, for example, an assistant teacher sat on the board of management to which the principal and other teachers holding posts of responsibility in the school would be subject.  I do not think this would make for harmony in the school.</P>

      <P>The arrangements which I have proposed are those best suited to giving the teachers an important say in how the schools should be conducted.  The principal the vice-principal and the representatives of the teaching staff will form an advisory council which will assist the principal in the ordinary day-to-day running of the school and will be able to submit, through the principal, to the board of management, views and recommendations on the overall educational policy and administration of the school.  There <Col N="891" /> will, therefore, be an established and readily available channel of communication between the teachers, the principals and the board of management.</P>

      <P>I want to say another word in relation to the community schools.  Whatever argument there might be as to how the proposals have developed, surely there can be no logical argument against providing, particularly in areas of lesser population, one school sufficiently large to cater for a wide range of subjects at pass and honours level, and to provide pupil guidance which will be meaningful in the sense that once pupils' aptitudes and abilities have been ascertained the school curriculum will be sufficiently broad to cater for their God-given talents.  All I ask is that Deputies of all parties will lend their hand in ensuring that, at the earliest possible moment, the children from the areas I have mentioned will be given an education of the quality and the diversity which the community schools can provide.</P>
      <P>The facilities which will be provided in the schools will match the ambitious programme which these schools will have to offer: science subjects, technical subjects, arts and crafts, commercial subjects, language studies, home economies, social studies, music and drama will all have their place.  The opportunities here for the provision of courses for adults will be considerable. Both the students and the community will be further catered for by a large assembly lecture area and a range of other lecture rooms, audio-visual aids, library facilities as well as a sports complex.  The provision of community club rooms as part of the school facilities will add to the community sense of identification with the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have many notes here on the Fine Gael proposals for community <Col N="892" /> schools but I do not propose to use them.  Deputy FitzGerald said that his party felt they should be more specific in their criticisms and, at the same time, he said that they would not propose any rigid alternatives.  This appears to me to mean that the Fine Gael policy is no policy.  Deputy FitzGerald appears to want to go a bit of the road with everyone and sees nothing incongruous in the fact that all these roads lead in different directions.  The one thing which the Fine Gael statement shunned completely was any mention of money.  If it really wants to, every school authority can go its own way and there is no mention of the cost or how it will be met.  The present fragmented post-primary system is to be largely perpetuated because to try to do something about it is too difficult and some vested interests might be upset.</P>
    <P>One searches the Fine Gael policy in vain for any mention of children and the service that they have a right to expect and that we have a duty to provide.  So far as I can see, the Fine Gael Party appear to be concerned only with juggling with institutional interests.  They must be kept quite at all costs.  I had studied the policy very carefully and had intended going in detail into the various aspects.  However, I will not.</P>
    <P>I should like now to say a few words in relation to co-operation. There has been a great deal of talk about co-operation between schools, particularly in the context of the community schools proposals.  Ever since January, 1966, when the then Minister for Education, Deputy Colley, issued a personal circular to all post-primary schools asking for co-operation between them, my Department has held meetings every year in centres throughout the country in an effort to promote and encourage co-operation.  I have got to admit that results have been very meagre.  It is extremely difficult to get co-operation when you are dealing with two different systems and, in the local situation, with three different managers, three different principles and three different sets of teachers recruited in different ways.  The one shining example of what it is possible to achieve is always quoted without any <Col N="893" /> explanation as to why other centres have not followed its example.</P>
    <P>A lot of credit for what has been achieved in Ballinamore, which is the example cited, must go to one man who not only initiated the development there but was able to get the co-operation of his fellow-principals and teachers in all three schools, not forgetting the sheer hard work of co-ordinating timetables and curricular development, which is tremendously important in this kind of structural arrangement. We all of us have enough experience of the human factor to know that such development is just not on everywhere.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the development in Ballinamore.  In fact, I went to Ballinamore to open an extension to one of the schools there specifically for the purpose of drawing attention to what was being done in it but I am afraid the importance of it was not recognised at that time because my visit or what was intended by it did not get very much publicity.</P>
    <P>An important point to remember is that the community schools are proposed in areas where new schools are in any event required.  This is something which is not generally understood. If we take the 25 rural areas which have been mentioned in relation to community schools, there is need of new building, in some instances, new building of all the schools, in others of some of the schools.  It should be appreciated that in an area where a Minister is faced with having either to build three new schools&mdash;knowing that, if he had, in fact, got the money to build the three schools, he would still have to endeavour to get the co-operation which I have already explained is so difficult to get&mdash;or one school, a community school, then everybody would accept that, in the interests very particularly of the education of the children and also having regard to the financial aspect&mdash;this while not by any means so important as the educational one is nevertheless an aspect which must be kept in mind in a country which has a limited amount of money to spend&mdash;the obvious thing to do is to build the community school.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the amount of <Col N="894" /> money being spent on education has increased in the last ten years from about £50 million to £88 million, nevertheless to do all that we would like to do in the Department of Education would require an extra sum. So, it is essential that from the financial point of view we should make the best possible use we can of the finances available to us.  I would like to stress that our basic consideration here is the education of children. Surely it would not make any sense in such circumstances to build three schools, perpetuating all the old problems, instead of bringing all the available expertise together in one large school?  I would simply add to that that in all of the other centres in which a community school is not contemplated in the near future my Department will continue to press for co-operation between the existing schools.</P>
    <P>The question was raised here about the optimum size of a school.  This is something which has engaged a great deal of attention both here and elsewhere. My Department's research shows that the optimum size is about 800 pupils.  The Dublin and Cork Advisory Councils recommended the creation of schools of the 400 to 800 pupils size.  I have accepted this recommendation. The OECD suggested some years ago that the minimum size for a comprehensive school is around the 450 pupils mark.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputies might be interested in one of the studies made.  Having regard to the requirements of presentday living, one could expect of any school catering or professing to cater for the interests and abilities of its students, that it should provide instruction to honours standard at leaving certificate level in a modern continental language, in a science subject and in mathematics.  Taking as a criterion a single Grade C or better in each of these areas for the leaving certificate examination of 1969&mdash;what we were looking for here was a Grade C in honours science, in honours mathematics and in honours continental language, and we were not concerned whether one student got the honours in the three subjects or whether three <Col N="895" /> different students each got honours in one of the subjects&mdash;we found that of schools with under 150 pupils, the number of schools providing this level was 9 per cent; of schools between 150 and 299 pupils, 13 per cent; of schools between 300 and 449 pupils, 38 per cent and of schools with 450 pupils or over, 69 per cent.</P>

      <P>Householders as such are not liable to pay these contributions.  They are payable by persons with limited eligibility for health services in the three broad categories of those insured under the Social Welfare Acts, self-employed persons under the income limit of £1,600 a year and farmers under £60 valuation.  The one contribution covers a person and his dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts, contributions are collected by a supplement to the stamps for social welfare purposes. Contributions from self-employed persons, other than farmers, are collected through the Revenue Commissioners and health boards will collect them from farmers.  In both these cases, <Col N="899" /> annual demands for payment will be made by the collecting authorities about this time of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping Ltd., with my approval, have entered into an agreement with Lion Ferry of Sweden, and Fearnley &amp; Eger of Norway, for the operation of a new car-ferry service on the Rosslare-France route, commencing June, 1973.  The new service, which replaces the Normandy Ferries service withdrawn last year, will operate on an all year round basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> The early re-introduction of the Continental link was made possible by the fact that the Swedish company held an option on favourable terms with a German shipyard, for a new car-ferry with passenger and car accommodation suitable for the Rosslare route, and a delivery date for early in the 1973 tourist season.  The new £4 million ferry will have cabin accommodation for 540 passengers and space for 200 cars.  The 21 knot ferry will fly the Irish Flag and be owned 50 per cent by Irish Shipping Ltd. and 25 per cent each by Lion Ferry and Fearnley &amp; Eger.</P>
    <P>As a result of the 50 per cent shareholding of Irish Shipping Ltd. in the new ship, there should be no recurrence of the premature abandonment of the service as happened in the case of the Normandy Ferries Service.  The accommodation and facilities on the new ship will be of an even higher standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. S. Browne Mr. S. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply is good news for all concerned for 1973, but I would like to ask the Minister whether there is any hope of bringing this arrangement forward to the coming summer season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We made every effort to achieve what the Deputy suggests should be done.  This is what we would like to have done but the deal made was the best we could make in view of all the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this arrangement.  However, is it within the power of the Minister's inspectors to ensure that the new ferry is run to a higher standard of cleanliness and general personal satisfaction than at least one of the Normandy Ferries ships which, to my personal knowledge, was disgraceful and uncomfortable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the Deputy.  I have no sympathy whatever for Normandy Ferries in their various operations and in particular the manner in which we were left holding the baby, as it were.  This new arrangement, with a 50 per cent participation <Col N="904" /> by us, will ensure continuation. That was not the situation when we had no financial participation.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Treacy</b> asked the Minister for Local Government the meaning of the terms &ldquo;agreed unit costs&rdquo; and &ldquo;block capital allocation&rdquo; mentioned in circular 2/72 dated 11th February, 1972 addressed to all county council secretaries; and why he did not refer to these matters when replying to a parliamentary question on Thursday, 24th February, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham) Liam Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to my replies to supplementary questions asked by him to Question No. 54 of the 24th February, 1972.  The capital allocation to which I referred in my reply to that question is the &ldquo;block allocation&rdquo; mentioned in Circular N.2/72.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;block allocation&rdquo; means the amount which I will allocate to a county council to meet their expenditure in a financial year on the schemes of not more than six houses, and individual rural cottages.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;agreed unit cost&rdquo; in the circular means the maximum cost per house or cottage which will be regarded as acceptable in an area.  This cost will be agreed, in discussion, between officers of my Department and of each council.  The new procedures outlined in the circular will apply to all schemes of not more than six houses and to all individual rural cottages on which no expenditure will have been incurred before 31st March, 1972.  The old and new procedures may apply concurrently for a short interim period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Meath County Council 1970 agreement scheme, comprising at present 42 rural cottages, to which the Deputy referred in his supplementary question on 24th February, will be regarded as coming under the new procedure for tender purposes and my <Col N="910" /> sanction to the tenders for these cottages will not now be necessary.  As, however, the council have already applied for a separate loan to cover this scheme, their application will be allowed to stand and I hope to give a decision shortly on this loan application. This will clear the way for work on the cottages to be started&mdash;subject only to keeping the expenditure within the block allocation which I will make for the purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree now that the Minister's replies to supplementary questions on Question No. 54 last Thursday gave a misleading impression inasmuch as the Minister implied that any group of three, four or five houses did not require the sanction of the Department?  Deputy Tully asked if the Minister's reply meant that a scheme comprising 45 rural houses submitted in groups of three to five houses would not require sanction and the Minister replied &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  His reply was unequivocal.  Does the reply now to the question today mean there are certain strings attached and that what the Minister said last Thursday is not actually the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister's reply to Deputy Tully was quite correct.  Meath County Council submitted an application for 45 individual cottages.  If no expenditure is incurred on those before 1st April, then it will not be necessary to have tenders sanctioned by the Department.  The work can be done out of the block allocation which will be notified to the Meath County Council.  This applies to every county council.</P>

I would appreciate it if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell me that the report indicated that the work was substandard. After several queries, this is the first time I have heard this excuse of substandard work.  There was no mention of it before.  I have made numerous inquiries about the payment of this grant and I was told it would be out in a few weeks, and a few weeks, and a few weeks, and now it is months.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Work started on this House in January, 1970.  This was a system-built house, and in June, 1970, the firm made application on behalf of the purchaser for a grant for the house.  Work was completed and the job was inspected in December, 1970.  The supervising inspector reported <Col N="913" />&ldquo;a standard of finish deplorable for a system-built type of house.&rdquo;  Again it was inspected in August 1971, and it was also pointed out that this type of work could not be accepted for grant purposes.  An effort was made by the inspector to contact the representatives of the firm.  He left a message for the representative to phone him and the representative failed to do so. The inspector reported in February, 1972, that &ldquo;the amount of remedial work necessary is extensive&rdquo; and as an exceptional measure the grant was not allocated because of the standard of the work.  It is proposed to send the supervisory inspector to make an early appointment with a representative of the firm, but a great deal of work must be done in order that such a building would qualify for a grant.</P>

I am not advocating here that the firm should be paid for substandard work.

In the meantime, the applicant became a member of a group scheme on Sherkin Island.  This dragged on for some time and eventually the group scheme was abandoned and the County Council decided to put a County Council water supply on Sherkin Island costing £28,000.  It may or may not be possible for this person, who is a member of a group scheme, to get water as a result of the new proposals of the county council.

      <P>Because of the importance of what is involved, I should like to repeat and further clarify the matter to which I referred just before Question Time.  We were merely looking at schools which brought even one candidate to honours level in the leaving certificate examination in a modern language, in a science subject and in mathematics.  When I say one candidate I do not mean he had to be the same candidate in the case of all three subjects.  Let me repeat the results of our survey: schools under 150 pupils, 9 per cent; schools between 150 and 299 pupils, 13 per cent; schools between 300 and 449 pupils, 38 per cent; and schools with 450 pupils or over, 69 per cent.</P>
      <P>The question of an adequate curriculum at leaving certificate level was also raised, and I shall just state what the aims are: first, the provision for higher and lower level courses in each subject; secondly, a full range of academic, scientific and practical subjects; thirdly, teachers qualified in subjects they are teaching and scarce specialist teachers who should be available to all children in the centre and not confined to one school; and, fourthly, the provision and economic use of proper facilities for the teaching of the subjects to the level required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a common fallacy that because a child will normally take only seven or eight subjects, that is all that will need to be provided.  This, of course, is not so.  If we are to develop the varying ability and aptitudes of our children, then a reasonably wide range of options must be provided.  Another slightly more sophisticated fallacy is that because a school lists a fairly large number of subjects in its programme, then all is well.  The important thing is that these subjects be available at pass and honours level and that the option of taking them be available to as many children as possible <Col N="916" /> and not that certain subjects be offered on a completely mandatory basis to certain children in the centre.</P>
    <P>We are now developing an educational guidance service in our post-primary schools manned by experienced teachers with special additional training in this field.  These teachers have available to them the advice and assistance of my Department's staff of psychologists.  All this is of very little use if the subjects which the pupil is advised to take are not available in the school which he attends.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed during the course of this debate that I am opposed to an independent examination board being set up.  I would like to state clearly that this is not so.  I told the House on a previous occasion that a departmental committee had been set up to consider the feasibility of such a project.  This committee have submitted their report to me and I hope shortly to arrange for a meeting of all the interests concerned to consider the issues involved.</P>
    <P>There was also some discussion on the question of remedial education in the post-primary sphere.  Steps are being taken to provide training for experienced teachers with a liking for this kind of work.  In the first term of the current school year a training course for 28 teachers was conducted by my Department in co-operation with the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  The course was conducted on a block release basis for three days a week over a period of 14 weeks.  The results of this course are now being assesed and further courses will be organised.  The psychological service of my Department is available to advise schools and teachers of problems in this area.  The aim is to provide remedial services in each school.</P>
    <P>This, like so many other services, is easier and more economical to provide in reasonably large schools.  Our resources are unlikely ever to be large enough to provide services such as this in small schools.  There again, co-operation between schools, if it is forthcoming, would enable the service to be provided on a pool basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> There was some discussion in relation to mathematics at the higher level leaving certificate examination of 1971. It might appear from a statement made that there were only five candidates presented for mathematics at higher level in Waterford in 1971.  The fact is that there were 36 candidates presented.</P>
    <P>My Parliamentary Secretary dealt with some aspects of the speech of Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.  I would like to deal with another aspect of it.  In suggesting that our system of second level education, as compared with that of other countries, is not designed to prepare students to think for themselves the Deputy seems to ignore the whole basis of our second level courses.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the intermediate certificate examination is to testify to the completion of a well balanced course of general education suitable for pupils who leave school at about 16 years of age and alternatively to the fitness of the pupils for entry on more advanced courses of study in a post-primary school.  The aim and purpose of the leaving certificate is to prepare pupils for immediate entry into open society or for proceeding to further education.  It is made clear that high standards are set in this examination and it is strongly recommended that pupils should not be presented in too many subjects, not more than seven.</P>
    <P>As to the subjects themselves and their treatment in class we find the programme emphasising again and again statements such as the following:</P>
    <P>English Intermediate Certificate:</P>
    <P>The aim is:</P>
    <P>(1)  To stimulate the pupils to think, to speak and to write correctly.</P>
    <P>(2)  To elicit their sincere response to their own experience of life in literature and</P>
    <P>(3)  to cultivate an understanding of and an interest in good literature.</P>
    <P>English Leaving Certificate:</P>
    <P>(1)  To pursue the fundamental aims of the Intermediate Certificate course and <Col N="918" /> (2)  to equip the pupils for life after school, whether at work or in higher education,</P>
    <P>(a)  by cultivating their powers of communication</P>
    <P>(b)  by developing their judgment in relation to language, literature and life</P>
    <P>(c)  by enriching their experience of life through literature.</P>
    <P>This is indicative of courses of study far removed from the mere inculcation of information.  The Deputy may rest assured that the operation of the courses to schools is in accordance with the aims set out in the programme.</P>
    <P>In making adverse comparisons in this respect between our situation and that of other countries, the Deputy seems to be indulging in the old illusion &ldquo;Bíonn adharca fada ar na buaibh thar lear&rdquo;, &ldquo;The faraway hills are always greener&rdquo;.  That, of course, is not a literal translation.  Without wishing to commit the same error in the opposite direction could I recommend that he study a bit more closely what the situation actually is in other countries?</P>
    <P>May I quote from the substance of a recent statement by a Minister for Education in a European country.  He said that he would maintain, notwithstanding difficulties, the objectives of the major reform announced three years before in the content and methods of teaching the programme in the home language so as to orientate the teaching to the outside world and put the emphasis on the pupils' motivation and personal expression.  This was to say that what Deputy Cruise-O'Brien was recommending to us and what is actually in operation here, although he does not appear to be aware of it, is only in the process of being introduced as a major reform in another European country.  I am far from suggesting in our approach here that we are superior to other countries but I am suggesting very strongly that it is quite wrong to think that we are always in an inferior position to other countries.</P>
    <P>One of the first specific tasks which was assigned to the Higher Education <Col N="919" /> Authority, when it was set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, was to make recommendations on the question of training primary teachers in the context of the future provision for higher education generally.  The authority pointed out that as the training of teachers was a wide national issue they felt they should concern themselves with the problem generally and not confine themselves to one group of teachers. Therefore, they set up a working party to identify the main problems in teacher training, to collect and analyse informed views and to advise the authority on their conclusions.</P>
    <P>An túdarás subsequently presented their report on teacher training to me and this has since been published.  The principal recommendation was the setting up of an authority for teacher training.  An Foras Oideachais.  I have sought the views of the various interested parties on this report and these recommendations and the various views are being considered at present.</P>
    <P>In relation to the entrance to the training college this year with the introduction of a scheme for the recruitment of a number of mature students to train as primary teachers the obligation to repeat the leaving certificate examination is waived in the case of those who fulfil the necessary requirements for entry to that examination. This means that students who sat for the leaving certificate examination when they were too young to apply for entrance to training will be allowed to opt for that examination, under the mature students scheme, up to the age of 28 years.  Similarly, students who are too old for open competition will qualify for consideration provided they have qualified in the leaving certificate examination.  This point was raised by Deputy FitzGerald who was concerned about the student who was too young for entry to the training college when he did the leaving certificate examination.  Deputy FitzGerald will be interested to see that such a student can now enter for the competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, yes.  I think there is some small factor which I cannot remember offhand.  As the House is aware, legislation was enacted late last year to empower me to set up an independent board to take over the governing of the National College of Art and Design.  I am awaiting the nominees of the student body and as soon as I receive them I will be in a position to appoint the members of the board.  To put it mildly, I am rather surprised at the inaction of the student body so far in regard to the election of student members.  The staff of the college have already done so and have sent me their nominees.  I hope the students will very shortly elect their nominees and let me have the names.</P>
      <P>Otherwise I would be compelled to establish a board without full student representation.  I understand the night students are considering balloting for one student member.  I would prefer, if at all possible, to establish a full board and, therefore, I hope the day students will elect their nominee and let me have the name as soon as possible. Otherwise, as I have said, I will be compelled to set up a board, as I am empowered to do by the Act, without that particular representation.</P>
      <P>The financial provision for higher education has been raised by a number of Deputies.  This provision is made mainly but not entirely in Vote 32, the Vote for Universities, Colleges and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. The provision for the current years is £10,199,000, representing an increase of nearly £2 million or 24 per cent more than the amount contained in the main Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate last year.  In Vote 27, the vote for the Office of the Minister for Education, there are several subheads which also relate to higher education.  I need only instance the subheads for higher education grants, university scholarships, scientific research grants and fellowships.  For these four items alone this year's provision at £818,000 is higher by 20 per cent than that for 1970-71.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>State aid for the colleges of technology is included in the grants for vocational education committees in Vote 30.  This also has been substantially <Col N="921" /> increased by 17 per cent.  In that Vote also are the special subheads for regional technical colleges.  The amount for building grants has fallen because building operations in some of them have been completed.  However, recurrent grants have been increased by 30 per cent to £430,000.</P>
    <P>I mention these figures in order to place firmly on record that there is a constant and substantial increase in the amounts of money being made available for higher education, for education in other levels and in forms other than instruction and training.  It is not necessary that Deputies should try to impress on me that greater financial provision is desirable for higher education.  No Deputy in the House knows that or appreciates it more keenly than I do.  However, where budgeting is concerned&mdash;and this holds for the individual citizen in his domestic and personal activities&mdash;one must always weigh what is desirable against what is possible to try to achieve much of what is desirable within the bounds of what is possible.</P>
    <P>Of course, one does not doubt the sincerity of Deputies who during the debate always demand that more money should be provided for the various aspects of higher education, but one challenges their logic knowing that they will march steadfastly into the division lobbies to vote against any proposal the Government may make to obtain the additional money required. We are making steady progress in the field of higher education. Anyone who does not appreciate this should think again.  Of course, I will admit that much more requires to be done and I would be the last to deny it.  Much more will be done.  I am thankful for the constructive criticisms and suggestions which have been offered in regard to the various aspects of higher education.  Deputies who have shown very considerable interest in this whole matter need have no doubts about my good intentions in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Institute for Higher Education in Limerick was mentioned.  This institute will commence operations in September next.  Already the appointments of 13 lectures in addition to <Col N="922" /> the director and the small administrative staff have been approved.  The specialist staff members, graded as lecturers and senior lecturers, have been appointed for the following areas: applied science, electronics, business studies, European studies, secretarial science, computer science and European languages.  A librarian is also being appointed.  This will form the nucleus of a teaching force which will increase in numbers and in the range of specialisation as the institute builds up to attain the objective of providing trained personnel, technicians, higher technicians at professional level, to serve the needs not merely of the region from which the majority of the students will be drawn but in certain specialisations to serve the requirements of the country.  Suitable accommodation, comprising lecture rooms, workshops and laboratories and administrative offices are also available.</P>
    <P>The planning board of the institute, a voluntary body, have done excellent work in bringing the arrangements to a stage where one can be confident that the institute will be successfully initiated and that it will develop to the stage of becoming a noted and important element in the higher education structure of Ireland.  The planning board expect that on opening the institute they will have an enrolment of about 100 students.</P>
    <P>No one can with truth say that I have not listened to and given consideration to the representatives of students and to their opinions in relation to the various aspects of the educational system as it affects students. There is a close liaison between the National Union of Students in Ireland and my Department.  Representatives of the students have had frequent consultations with me personally and with senior officers of my Department on matters in relation to which students wish to have their views heard.  Deputies who have referred to student representation are aware that in recent years I have had students nominated to the governing bodies of the colleges of the National University and, of course, the new legislation for the new College of Art and Design provides for student representation on the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> I will continue to listen to the representatives of the students on matters related to education and administration and I will endeavour to meet such requests as seem just and reasonable.  I will not, however, be browbeaten or deflected from the course which I consider to be the best in the interests of the community by threats or other forms of intimidation.  The tone of the debate at the annual congress of the NUI in January of this year would give the impression that the overwhelming majority of the students in third-level institutions are ardent revolutionary socialists, devout disciples of Karl Marx.  I understand that one of their publications for the congress expressed the wish: &ldquo;Rath Karl Marx oraibh.&rdquo;  I do not believe that the picture so presented is a true one.  I believe the great majority of our students would wish to build rather than tear down, to improve rather than to destroy.  The vast majority of the students are, however, blameworthy in that by their passiveness they are not having their viewpoint adequately represented in the body whose task it should be to speak for all of them.</P>
    <P>It causes me neither surprise nor distress that the Dundalk Congress passed a resolution of no confidence in me as Minister for Education.  Indeed, had they expressed confidence in me I should have felt, knowing the ideology and philosophy of so many who spoke, that I must seriously consider in what way I was going wrong and to what extent I was betraying the ideals and objectives of the Irish people.  With regard to the discourtesy which was shown to me personally I have only this to say: I was invited to attend the congress dinner and, although it required some rearrangement of existing engagements, I accepted that invitation.  I was requested to speak at that function and agreed to do so.  When, at the president's invitation and in fulfilment of that undertaking. I rose to speak I was subjected to some abuse and a number of those present left the hall rather than listen to what I had to say.  It seems to me that the assertions of civil rights which these people had been making during <Col N="924" /> the congress were in rather strange contradiction to the efforts which were made to prevent me from speaking.</P>
    <P>I would suggest also that those who remained and who did not try to silence me although they might not have agreed with my point of view, and particularly the small number who clapped, gave an example not merely of courtesy but also of moral courage from which their companions might benefit.  What distressed me about this incident was not the discourtesy shown to me personally but that young people who should be fitting themselves to take up positions of responsibility and leadership in the community within the next few years should have so little regard for the principles and attitudes accepted as fundamental by all civilised people.  In this, as in the political philosophies which they express, I believe they are not truly representative of the student body in general.  If I were to think otherwise, I should have to abandon my firmly held conviction that the future of our country and of our civilisation will be safe in the hands of these young people who within a short period of years will have the privilege and responsibility of guiding the country's destiny. I should like to place on record that the president and officers of the union who had invited me to be a guest at the function had no part in this unworthy demonstration.  They extended to me the courtesies which civilised tradition demands of a host towards a guest.</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer briefly to the incident in St. Patrick's Training College.  All I have to say in relation to this is that it was said that for two years the students were unable to meet me.  I want to place on record that I met the students on 3rd February, 1970, 2nd March, 1970, and 29th November, 1971.</P>
    <P>Another matter which was raised here by a number of Deputies, and in which I have a particular interest myself, refers to the National Museum and the National Library.  I should like to make some reference to the situation in relation to these two cultural <Col N="925" /> institutions for which my Department are responsible.  The problems which exist in relation to these institutions are basically problems of accommodation and inadequacy of space. There are questions also as to the inadequacy of staffing, but these two problems are linked together.  Seven additional posts as technical assistant have been created in the National Museum.  Four of these posts have been filled and the remaining appointments are in the process of being made.  A post of librarian in the National Museum has also been created and arrangements are in hand for the filling of that post through a competition conducted by the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    <P>Proposals for further increasing the staff of both the National Museum and the National Library are receiving the attention of my Department.  I can assure the Deputies that it is my wish and intention that these two institutions should be suitably accommodated and staffed to fulfil the very important cultural functions and to give the best possible service to the community.  When I speak of accommodation problems in relation to the National Museum and the National Library I really mean problems and not just difficulties.  These two institutions, housed here on the same compound as Leinster House, cannot on their present sites expand to the extent that the tremendous increase in the scope and scale of their work demands.  There are great advantages from the point of view of the convenience of the public in the present locations of the institutions.  This is particularly true in relation to the National Library, since it is desirable and to be expected that the healthy collaboration which already exists between the National Library and the library of Trinity College will develop and strengthen.  The proximity of the two institutions to each other is an important, if not an indispensable factor, in such co-operation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the National Museum, while it is desirable that the entire institution should be in one location, it would not give rise to disadvantages of the same degree to have the various collections or departments <Col N="926" /> housed in buildings at some distance from each other.  There are some firm proposals for the long term solution of the accommodation problem in each instance.  The present College of Art building adjoins the National Library premises.  When the new College of Art building on the Morehampton Road site has been built the College of Art will be located there.  I have had a survey made of the College of Art premises to see if they are suitable for library purposes.  I am satisfied that they would not be capable of adaptation. When they are vacated completely the only solution would be to demolish the building and to have a new building erected there designed specifically for library requirements. This is a long-term project.  A number of years must pass before the College of Art and Design will be completed and occupied.  It will also take some time before the present building can be demolished and rebuilt as library premises.</P>
    <P>With regard to the National Museum, the splendid premises of the former Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, have been preserved and used as a folk museum and perhaps as a place of exhibition for some of the museum's collection.  To make the present building suitable for that purpose would involve demolition to some extent, and restoration, adaptation and preservation work to some degree.  This would cost about £300,000 or even more.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are engaged in the necessary planning and other preliminaries but the extent of the work to be done is such that its completion cannot be regarded as an immediate prospect.  I am happy to say that an interim arrangement, which will give an amount of relief to both institutions, has been arrived at.  In the new building to be erected in Kildare Street, on the opposite side of the street from the National Library, it has been arranged that approximately 33,000 square feet of floor space will be given to the National Library and about 22,000 square feet to the National Museum.  This is an interim arrangement and it is not by any means suggested as a final solution. It will not meet fully the requirements <Col N="927" /> of either institution but it will ease the problems.</P>
    <P>As an illustration of the extent of the easement it will provide, the consultant I appointed to advise me on the accommodation needs of the National Library says that an area of 10,000 square feet would house approximately 100,000 to 125,000 volumes, nearly 100 readers and several staff members.  We are giving more than three times that area.  The total usable floor space in the existing library building is about 50,000 square feet so that the additional area to be provided as an interim measure will increase accommodation by more than 60 per cent.  The use to which the additional space will be put by both institutions is the subject of discussion between directors of the institutions, representatives of the Commissioners of Public Works and those engaged in the planning of the new building.</P>
    <P>I have given full consideration to representations that have been made to me by the Irish Manuscripts Commission and by other interested parties about the establishment of a national archives.  I consider the National Library is the appropriate institution for the housing of the national archives and our plans for the library envisage that function being carried out by the National Library.</P>
    <P>In March, 1971, the Government decided that legislation should be prepared to establish a national council for educational awards on the general basis of a recommendation which had been made by the Higher Education Authority.  The authority had referred to the demand and the need on the part of industry for actual and potential technological students and for more advanced technological and other specialised courses for the formal recognition on a national basis of such courses and of qualifications awarded relevant to them.</P>
    <P>They suggested the establishment of a national council for educational awards with powers and functions on the following lines: first, to grant certificates, diplomas and degrees to persons who have successfully pursued <Col N="928" /> courses of study at third level institutions other than university; second, to determine the conditions governing the grant of such awards; third, to approve courses of study to be pursued by candidates in order to qualify for such awards including, where appropriate, arrangements for industrial and commercial experience in association with such courses.</P>
    <P>When it became apparent that there was no prospect of the proposed legislation being prepared and enacted in sufficient time to allow of the statutory councils being set up and to enable them to assess study programmes which students in the regional technical colleges have been following since 1970, and to prescribe conditions for the award of appropriate certificates to students who had successfully completed two-year courses, it was decided to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> council.</P>
    <P>This body will come into existence immediately.  It will exist for a period of three years or until such time as the statutory council are established. it will consist of a chairman, 21 ordinary members and a director who will also be a member.  Invitations to serve on the council have been issued to persons holding academic posts in universities, persons with teaching experience in third level institutions other than universities, persons having experience in industry, agriculture, commerce, public relations or related fields, and to persons having experience in post-primary education.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that there is urgency attending the establishment of suitable machinery for the granting of awards to certain classes of students who will complete the appropriate courses this year, there will be an advantage in having an <i>ad hoc</i> council in operation for a period.  As in the case of the Higher Education Authority, it will provide a valuable background of experience against which the merits of the proposed legislation can be judged.</P>
    <P>In a debate which has ranged over such a long period it would be impossible to reply in a reasonable time to the individual points put forward by Deputies, but I have tried in a general way to reply to all the main points that were raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of March, 1972, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Árd-Chlaraitheora) and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous Grants and certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The supplementary sum of £10 now being moved will enable the House to discuss the main Estimate for Health for 1971-72 in the sum of £45,912,000, as published in the Book of Estimates for the current financial year, and the Supplementary Estimate of £7,390,000 recently circulated.  It will also provide an opportunity for the House, should it so desire, to discuss the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, for which there is a separate Estimate.</P>
      <P>As in previous years, subhead G is the main subhead of my Department's Vote.  The subhead provides for grants to health boards in respect of expenditure on health services during the year 1971-72; there is also the normal provision for payment of balances of grant due in respect of previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the current year is concerned the net health expenditure by health boards as originally estimated and published in the Book of Estimates amounted to £68,200,000.  This represented an increase of almost £7,000,000 over the 1970-71 costs, as then estimated, which in turn showed an increase of £6,100,000 over the original estimate for that year.  There was thus a total increase of almost £13,000,000 <Col N="930" /> from the original 1970-71 estimate to the original estimate for the present year.  These increases are attributable largely to improved pay and improved conditions of service for staff and the rising cost of drugs, medicines, foodstuffs and so forth.  In a service with such a high staff cost content inflationary increases in incomes have a very marked effect.  The public has been made aware of the reasons for most of these increases in costs.  Other factors which have contributed to increased costs are increased accommodation and improved services for the mentally handicapped, improvements and extensions of hospital services and improvements in child health services.</P>
    <P>When Deputies are considering the level of Exchequer support for the health services, I would suggest that, having regard to the exceptional circumstances involved in the two years, they should look at the years 1970-71 and 1971-72 together.  I have shown how health cost increases over the two years have been exceptionally high. For 1970-71 it was decided that the Exchequer grant which, as I said in my speech introducing the Estimate for that year, had included a special provision based on the original Estimates, to limit rate increases for health services, should be increased to absorb the full excess over the original Estimate. This involved an added liability of more than £5 million on the Exchequer.  If it were not for this exceptional arrangement the rating authorities would have had to provide, in the 1971-72 rates, for debit balances emerging at the close of the year 1970-71.  In terms of rates, this alone would have meant an average increase of 15p in the £.</P>
    <P>Subhead G in the present year's original Estimate provides for the part of the statutory grant of 50 per cent payable within the year and for supplementary grants amounting to a further 6 per cent approximately, which were allocated to all areas in such a way as to confine the increase in the health rate struck for the current year within a limit of 44p in the £.</P>
    <P>In addition to the grants paid to health authorities towards their <Col N="931" /> revenue expenses there was provision for an Exchequer contribution of £7,900,000 to the Hospitals Trust Fund, in subhead K.1, designed to supplement the income from sweepstakes so as to meet the revenue deficits of the voluntary hospitals. These deficits arise almost entirely from the discrepancy between the actual average cost of treatment of patients and the capitation rates paid by health authorities for the treatment of eligible patients.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate of £7,390,000 arises, as I have said, mainly from adjustments in the course of the year in levels of remuneration for certain hospital and health board staffs, including the first phase of the 13th round of the national wage agreement, the recruitment of additional staff resulting from improved conditions of employment for hospital staffs, increases in other areas of expenditure due to movements in prices of commodities and increases in rates of allowances approved in the 1971 Budget.  The Supplementary Estimate also includes a sum of £1,800,000 for additional grants-in-aid of the Hospitals Trust Fund&mdash;that is, £1.5 million extra for voluntary hospitals deficits and £300,000 extra for hospital capital works in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The total additional expenditure of health boards in the current year over the total sum shown in the Book of Estimates is £5.8 million.  Of this amount about 56 per cent would, in the normal course, be recouped by the Exchequer, the remainder falling on local funds.  The latter would ordinarily emerge as a debit balance in the local accounts and be carried forward to be covered in rates struck in 1972-73.  As this arrangement would, however, mean an average estimated increase of 16p in the £, I am again this year, as I did last year, providing for full recoupment of the additional expenditure to obviate the need to carry forward any debit balance.  Any further reference by me to the rating position for next year would, of course, be out of order in this debate.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to Deputies that the supplementary funds being sought are <Col N="932" /> necessary to meet unavoidable increases in pay and prices.  Health expenditure is particularly sensitive to increases in levels of remuneration and to improvement in conditions of employment, as staff costs take up more than half of the overall cost.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer also makes a major contribution by way of grants to local authorities in relief of rates on agricultural land&mdash;the &ldquo;Agricultural Grant&rdquo;.  The amount of this grant which may be attributed to the health rate relief, is of the order of £9 million for the year 1971-72.</P>
    <P>When account is taken of all these subventions from central funds the amount of Exchequer support in the year 1971-72 will be over £62 million towards a gross expenditure of over £83 million, that is a contribution of just 75 per cent of the total cost.  Many people do not seem to realise that the Exchequer meets such a high proportion of the cost of health services. However, it must be admitted that in certain towns and cities the health rate forms a higher proportion of the total rates struck.</P>
    <P>The total running cost of the services in the current financial year is four times what it was only ten years ago and represents a rate of increase which is much greater than the growth in national production.  Indeed, the volume increase in health service expenditure at constant money values has doubled in about a decade.</P>
    <P>In common with other countries the objective will be on the one hand to ensure efficiency and to restrain costs, and, on the other hand, to secure a volume increase representing expansion of services and new services at between 3 per cent and 5 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>When the employers and trade unions meet to discuss changes in remuneration it is to be hoped that the repercussions of increases in remuneration on labour intensive services will be noted.  The health services are now costing £28 per head per year.</P>
    <P>The proportion of the Budget which goes to meet health costs has risen from 7 per cent in 1961-62 to 9 per cent in the current year.  This has entailed mounting demands on the rates <Col N="933" /> and taxes and has resulted in great pressure from rate payers in particular for measures to relieve them of the burden.  In the face of competition of demands for other purposes, for economic expansion no less than for social services, it has become clear that rates and taxes must be supplemented by other means.  This was the background to the introduction of the health contributions scheme in October of last year.</P>
    <P>The contribution is at the rate of 15p per week for insured workers and £7 per annum for farmers and others in the &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; category who are eligible for hospital and other services.  Medical card holders are, of course, exempt from paying the contribution. I do not think that this modest contribution, towards an essential and very expensive service, can be regarded as unreasonable when considered alongside the real increase in living standards over recent years.  The total yield of this contributions scheme in a full year is expected to be about £5 million.</P>
    <P>A detailed explanatory memorandum on the health contributions scheme is contained in the document circulated to Deputies.  The assistance towards heavy expenditure on drugs and the abolition of in-patient and out-patient charges must be considered when discussing the contributions scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that by 1976 all Government Departments will be operating a programme budget system.  Already nine Departments, including my Department, are at various stages in the introduction of programme budgeting.</P>
    <P>Programme budgets will identify for five years ahead, not alone the estimated cost of programmes, but also the expected results and will thus provide the Government with information on which national priorities can be planned for a number of years ahead.</P>
    <P>The health boards and my Department will be involved in planning on the basis of programmes designed to achieve defined objectives.  The three overall programmes adopted by the boards are: community care, general hospital care, and special hospital care. <Col N="934" /> In these programmes the focus will be on positive and preventive measures; for example, health care for target groups such as children, old people, persons suffering from mental illness and physical or mental handicap <i>et cetera</i>; and on hospital specialities such as medicine, surgery, obstetrics and so on.  The aim will be to define desirable standards of provision across the whole spectrum of health services and to draw up plans to bring existing services up to these levels, taking account, of course, of the resources available to meet them and consequently to establish an order of priorities.</P>
    <P>The programme budget system, when fully developed, will reflect the plans for developing health services over a five year period ahead, the minimum for which effective forward planning can be done with estimates of the costs involved and the benefits expected.</P>
    <P>The management structure for the health boards aligns with the three programmes to which I have referred. Thus in all health board areas there will be a programme manager for community care.  In the larger areas there will also be separate programme managers for general hospital care and for special hospital care while in the areas of the smaller boards the same person will fill the role of programme manager for both general hospital care and special hospital care.</P>
    <P>In developing the programme budget system my Department's immediate task is to translate the traditional estimate for 1972-73 into programme budget form.  When fully developed, programme budgeting for the health services will serve the needs not alone of the Government and the Department of Health but also of the health boards and voluntary hospitals, by facilitating the development of good management techniques and securing economy coupled with effectiveness in the operation of existing health services and their development to meet future needs.</P>
    <P>The health boards and voluntary hospitals have shown a most co-operative attitude.</P>
    <P>When I spoke to the House on the Estimates for last year I was about to put before it the draft regulations for <Col N="935" /> the establishment of the health boards. I would now like to review some of the major events of the reorganisation which has taken place since then, to refer briefly to the changes in services which have been made over the last year or so and to look forward a little to the next steps which we hope to take in effecting the changes to be made under the Act.</P>
    <P>I have given in the documents circulated to Deputies details of the membership of the health boards, including an interesting break-down of the membership by occupation.  This illustrates the broadly-based representation which has been achieved on the health boards and augurs well for our achieving the community involvement which I would hope to see carried right through the affairs of the health boards.</P>
    <P>The boards are now fully involved in the administration of the health services and will be considering their priorities in allocating the necessarily limited amount of resources in relation to the tremendous demand for services. This is, of course, a key function of the health boards.  They have inherited a large body of decided policy; they now come to the stage where they can begin to make their own contribution to key decisions.  I have every reason to believe that the boards will be a success and I am very heartened to learn how well the different interests on the boards are working together. Let me say straightaway that neither I nor my Department are in any way complacent about the major tasks which lie ahead for the boards.  We must, all of us, guard against complacency and constantly seek better ways of doing things and higher standards of performance.</P>
    <P>In this, their first year of responsibility, the health boards have been enormously helped by the ready co-operation and assistance of the local authorities which previously operated the health services, their managements and staffs and I would like to pay a special tribute to those for this vital contribution.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer briefly to the management organisation and <Col N="936" /> processes which are being adopted under health boards.  As all of you know, we have had the benefit of a very comprehensive report from McKinsey &amp; Co., management consultants, on three key aspects of the health boards' affairs, that is to say, (1) the division of functions between the boards and their chief executive officers; (2) the management organisation which would appear to be best suited to achieve the objectives of the health boards; and (3) the management processes to be adopted by the proposed organisation.  The first two parts of the report, which dealt with the division of functions and the top management organisation, have been accepted by all of the health boards. At present the health boards and my Department are considering the recommendations made in the last two parts of the consultants' reports on planning and on the organisation below the top management level.</P>
    <P>The basis of operation is the requirement that part-time health boards must be presented with detailed reports on (1) performance of each branch of the service; (2) evidence of efficiency or equally the need for stepping up productivity consistent with good service; (3) accounts and budgeting statements; (4) a list of long and short term priorities for implementation based on, (a) national health policy as presented by the Minister for Health, (b) available current and capital resources.</P>
    <P>The boards can make their decisions on priorities in framing each year's budget.  The boards can make representations to the regional hospital boards about major hospital projects, and make representations to the Minister for Health on contentious matters during the year and there is no lack of communication facilities.</P>
    <P>There has inevitably been some criticism of the recommendations made in the reports and of the extent to which it may be necessary to increase the number of people engaged in top and middle management in order to put the recommendations into effect.</P>
    <P>My policy can best be described in the following extract from a book entitled <i>Management and the Health Services:</i><Col N="937" /> With so many competing claims on the national budget and obvious limitations in manpower and other capital resources, it has become imperative to use them wisely, and careful priorities have to be worked out for the promotion of health and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of sickness.  Sound management of health services can only be achieved if the men and women in key executive positions are knowledgeable and well trained.  The modern health service administrator can no longer operate effectively and efficiently on hunches and guesstimates.  He needs hard data with which to formulate his plans and work out his programmes and budgets.  He needs to know what objectives he is seeking, the most efficient and economic way of achieving them and whether, in fact, the community is getting &ldquo;value for money&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of cost, I have already stated in public that in the current year the overall cost of administration of the health services is about 3 per cent of the total expenditure. The cost of top management in the health service at present represents about one-quarter of 1 per cent of the expenditure on these services; and if top management make the contribution expected of them then the enhanced value for money obtained through greater efficiency and effectiveness will far outweigh any additional cost.</P>
    <P>Some difficulties have been experienced in filling the top management posts under health boards.  The document circulated gives a list of the appointments made to date.  At present a competition is under way to fill the remaining programme manager posts.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the health boards and the changes in organisation and management processes have naturally led to a considerable increase in the need for consultation and agreement with staff organisations regarding the members' interests.  The consultative council which I established to smooth the transfer of staffs from local authorities to health boards played a most useful role in dealing with the <Col N="938" /> difficulties which arose and I would like to pay tribute to the members of that council for the valuable contributions which they made.  The experience gained during this consultation will be of invaluable assistance to us in establishing permanent consultative machinery for the health boards.</P>
    <P>When the White Paper on which the proposals to set up the health boards was under consideration in 1966, there were some protests from local interests, including local authorities, against the proposal, on the grounds that larger units would tend to lead to remoteness and excessive bureaucracy in the operation of the health services.  I have made it clear on many occasions that the larger health administrative area is based on the following principles. First with the growth of consultant specialisation and consultant team work and the development of laboratory techniques, the reorganisation of the hospital services must be administered on a regional basis particularly if the number of patients sent to Dublin from rural areas is to be kept at the lowest acceptable level.  Secondly, the decentralisation of services for the community, comprising out-patient psychiatric clinics, psychiatric social worker services, general medical services, the public health service, the development of all-embracing all-purpose social service councils inevitably, of course, means the retention and improvement of locally-based decentralised administrations and medical staff.</P>
    <P>The contacts between the public and the health board services at local level is, of course, continuing.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, for the development of communal services whose double effect will be an improvement of service and a reduction in the growth of hospital in-patient service, it is absolutely vital to have managerial and professional expertise of the highest calibre and a career structure designed to encourage the best talent.  There must be first-class organisers for social work developments, the child health service, <i>et cetera</i>.  The development of decentralised services could absolutely never have been achieved by a staff system related to single counties.  I might <Col N="939" /> mention that, in the Dublin area, the health board is initiating a process of decentralisation by establishing a pilot project to test the feasibility of the provision of community services in the city and environs through integrated community-based teams of medical, ancillary and support staff.  While important policy decisions have been concentrated in the health boards, much remains for decision at local level and more will be so decided in the future.  That is the policy recommended to me by the management consultants. In passing on this recommendation to the health boards I endorsed it and look forward to their work developing on these lines.</P>
    <P>The regulations establishing local committees under section 7 of the Health Act, 1970, were made recently. Local authorities can now proceed to appoint members to these committees and the health boards will be inviting nominations for appointments to the committees from the bodies representing the medical and other professions concerned.  These local committees will advise the health boards on the provision of health services in their areas and will maintain contact with local needs.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that it has been possible during the past year to reach agreement with the organisations representing the medical profession and retail pharmacists in regard to their participation in the choice of doctor scheme for persons entitled under the Health Acts to free general practitioner services.  I have circulated for the information of Deputies the main features of the conditions agreed on.  The arrangements for the scheme will provide special inducements aimed at retaining doctors and pharmacists in the less populated rural areas.</P>
    <P>As I have informed the House already, it is proposed that the new scheme will come into operation on 1st April next in the Eastern Health Board area and in the remainder of the country later in the year.</P>
    <P>In regard to persons entitled to the new service I might mention that at the end of September, 1971, there were 861.256 persons covered by medical <Col N="940" /> cards.  Each CEO is now in the process of preparing for the area of his board means assessment regulations of a consistent pattern, the hardship clause, of course, being retained.</P>
    <P>Changes in the medical card lists for each area are in the main attributable to such factors as significant upward revision of income, migration from the district and, of course, the death of a medical card holder.  These factors are normally brought to notice on the occasion of the periodic review of the register of medical card holders which health boards are required to undertake. Pharmacists serving the Eastern Health Board are at present being invited to participate in the new service.</P>
    <P>The participation of private medical practitioners and retail pharmacists in the new service will represent a notable landmark in the development of our health services and will remove finally whatever discrimination still exists in the provision of family doctor services for those who cannot afford to pay. But now that we are on the eve of the dissolution of the dispensary system, I am glad to pay a tribute to the dispensary doctors who over the years have provided such a high standard of service for the public patients in their care.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has now almost completed the task of getting the many thousands of persons covered by medical cards to make a choice from among the 400 family doctors who have provisionally agreed to take part in the scheme in Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare.  This necessary preliminary work has proved tedious and troublesome and I must compliment the staff of the board on the manner in which they have coped with a difficult assignment.</P>
    <P>I have recently established a special consultative council which I have asked to take a thorough look at all aspects of general medical practice and to advise me as to the manner in which it might be placed on a footing where it can derive the maximum benefit from the advances of modern medicine and where it can be co-ordinated in the fullest sense with the other elements in the health services. Far too many of our people are being <Col N="941" /> admitted to institutions because they are sick or infirm.  Apart from the upset that this means to the individual concerned and to his family, there is the purely economic consideration&mdash; namely, the great drain on public funds for both the capital and running costs of these institutions.  The family doctor is the great bulwark against hospital admission and it is my policy to do all I can to facilitate him in that role.</P>
    <P>For some people not covered by medical cards the cost of hospital treatment and drugs for long-term illnesses can be a hardship.  This situation has been improved considerably under regulations made by me which came into effect on 1st October last.  These regulations give power to health boards to provide drugs and medicines, free of charge, to persons suffering from mental handicap, cystic fibrosis, epilepsy, diabetes and a number of other conditions all of which are long-term and involve the suffer in continuing expenses on drugs and medicines.  This scheme will apply without regard to the individual's income.  For most of these conditions hospital treatment will be free for children under 16 years old, also irrespective of means.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that this scheme represents a worthwhile step forward in alleviating the hardship of long-term illness.</P>
    <P>The document circulated to Deputies contains the usual annual statistics about births, marriages and deaths and tables showing deaths from various causes.  The birth rate in 1970, at 21.8 per 1,000 population, is showing no sign of declining.  The marriage rate, at 7.1 per 1,000 population, is the highest ever recorded in this country. The death rate at 11.5 per 1,000 population, is about the average figure for the past few years.</P>
    <P>The death rate from heart disease went down slightly in 1970 as compared with the previous two years.  The death rate from all forms of cancer was the same as in 1969, which was higher than in previous years.  Unfortunately, the death rate from lung cancer continues to increase and in 1970 reached a rate of 32.6 per 100,000 population, which is 50 per cent higher <Col N="942" /> than the 1963 figure.  I will be speaking later of the main cause of lung cancer deaths&mdash;cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>Deaths from accidents in the home totalled 462, the same as in 1969.  Both these figures are higher than in former years, thus highlighting the need for extra care in the home, particularly as regards young children and old people.  Nowadays more than twice as many people die as a result of accidents in the home than from respiratory tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>Infant mortality in 1970, at 19 per 1,000 live births, was the lowest on record.  The maternal mortality rate was much the same as in the previous years.  It is low; but could be lower and I hope will be lower in future years.  In general we are among the top countries when judged by expectation of life and other vital statistics but standards are improving and complacency is entirely unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>The advances made over the past decade in regard to the more significant infectious diseases, to which I referred last year, continue to be maintained. The number of new cases of tuberculosis registered showed a decrease from 1,641 cases in 1968 to 1,397 cases in 1970.  These incidence figures represent a decline of roughly 15 per cent over a short period of two years.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to other diseases is equally encouraging.  No cases of poliomyelitis or of diphtheria were notified during 1970, while only two cases of typhoid were notified.  In the latter part of 1969 a booster campaign against polio was initiated and a highly satisfactory response of over 90 per cent of children under 18 years was achieved.</P>
    <P>Another important immunisation service has been introduced recently.  This is the vaccination scheme against rubella (German measles) under which girls will be protected against a disease which, if contracted early in pregnancy, can bring a very real possibility of serious congenital defects in the unborn child.</P>
    <P>The number of cases of gonorrhoea and syphilis show no significant upward change.  However, some patients seek treatment privately particularly for <Col N="943" /> gonorrhoea, some cases of which are not notified to the Department.  I have had the matter under close examination over the past year and I can say that some positive steps are about to be taken in an effort to insure that, as far as possible, this country will not find itself faced with a problem of the appalling magnitude prevailing elsewhere, resulting from the escalation of these diseases.</P>
    <P>The control of communicable diseases in international health is now becoming increasingly important in the light of the considerable increase in the volume of international traffic and the ease and speed of travel.  The westward spread of cholera over the past year demonstrates this.  To alert the public to the danger to health which may be involved for travellers abroad, I have had special advisory leaflets circulated through travel agencies.  A leaflet was also issued as a handy summary of information for medical practitioners who might be asked for advice by persons intending to go abroad for holidays.</P>
    <P>In recent years it became evident that the lack of adequate facilities available to the official side, represented by the County and City Managers' Association, was creating difficulties in dealing promptly and effectively with the staff side on wage claims and other conditions of service. It was decided that the most appropriate way of improving the situation was the establishment of a corporate body to provide the necessary staff and other resources to enable managers collectively, and the chief executive officers of health boards, to discharge fully, efficiently and expeditiously their functions in this field. With this in mind, the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971, was enacted in the early part of last year and under its enabling provisions the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board was established last July.  The board will provide such services as may be required for the purpose of staff negotiations, including proceedings under any scheme of conciliation and arbitration for local authority staff and also Labour Court <Col N="944" /> proceedings in respect of staff who have recourse to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>A chief officer to the Staff Negotiations Board has been appointed and the other necessary staff are at present being recruited.  In addition to the steps taken to improve the facilities for negotiations by the official side, a special review has been undertaken of the existing conciliation and arbitration scheme for local authority officers with a view to bringing about some improvements. The existing scheme, which was introduced in 1963, has worked reasonably well but in the light of the experience gained since its introduction it is considered that some amendments may be desirable.  The current review has been undertaken by a working party representative of the staff and employer sides and the Departments of Local Government and Health.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that these developments will improve staff relations generally in the local authority field and will lead to more meaningful negotiations through the more effective machinery that is being made available. Initially the Staff Negotiations Board will act on behalf of local authorities and health boards.  When they have become firmly established it is intended that they will extend their activities to embrace other bodies, such as voluntary hospitals and their staffs.</P>
    <P>While I am on this theme of methods of improving staff relations, I should mention the recent strike by psychiatric nurses in the mental hospital service.  This strike, which I very much regretted, must have caused acute distress to many of the patients and great anxiety to their relatives.</P>
    <P>The insistence by the trades unions representing the nurses that promotion in the psychiatric service should be based solely on seniority has been an issue between management and staff since 1959.  Management were gravely concerned to improve nursing standards as an essential element in their efforts to up-grade the psychiatric services and were convinced that a new basis for promotion in which seniority was not the over-riding consideration must be found.  They pointed out that the existing system had evolved when mental hospital services were largely <Col N="945" /> custodial and that a change was essential in order to meet the challenge presented by modern methods of treating psychiatric illness.  The staff side on the other hand, wanted to retain seniority as the determining factor.  In the rest of the public service the promotion of staff is, in general, on the basis of merit, seniority being taken into account.</P>
    <P>The promotion system was the subject of a special investigation by the Joint Industrial Council for psychiatric hospital nurses in 1965.  The agreement then reached between staff and management representatives, which provided for promotion by open competition, but with concessions and safeguards for existing staff, was rejected by the main body of the staff.  In 1968 the dispute was heard by the Labour Court and was the subject of a recommendation to the effect that 50 per cent of vacancies should be filled by competition and the other 50 per cent filled on the basis of seniority.  This recommendation was rejected also by the staff side.</P>
    <P>Regarding the recent settlement terms I feel I must record my genuine concern that under these terms promotion in the psychiatric nursing service will still be based primarily on seniority.  The best interests of the patients must be our first concern in this matter.  I am convinced that the best possible nursing service, which involves the maximum of patients activation and group therapy, can best be assured only on the basis of promotion by merit.  A person may be reasonably good as a nurse working under direction but he or she may lack the qualities necessary to lead, to instruct, to control and to encourage other staff.  In such a case I do not think he or she should be placed in charge.  Under the terms of the settlement the position is to be reviewed when the report is available of a working party who are examining the whole question of the psychiatric nursing services.  When this report is available I can only express the hope that the staff side will give full consideration to the interests of the patients, and not to the interests of nurses only.</P>
    <P>I have spoken with frankness on the <Col N="946" /> subject of strikes in the health services. I have had experience of industrial relations problems for ten years as Minister for Transport and Power and did my utmost to encourage the adoption of the most modern practices in improving management-staff communications. In many countries of Europe strikes in essential industries never take place, arbitration being freely accepted by management and staff.  I do not question the fundamental right to strike.  I repeat again that I regard strikes in the health and hospital services as normally unjustifiable, since the only effect is to injure and depress the sick and infirm.  The health and hospital staffs have a measure of built-in security of service which should make it possible for them to accept arbitration on an agreed basis.  The psychiatric nurses' strike took place a week before the open hearing of the Labour Court.  The action taken was, in my view, indefensible.</P>
    <P>No one in the House can suggest that I have shown a lack of sympathy in regard to branches of the health administration where there was an obvious need for improving conditions of service, or the wage level.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in making this observation no one can suggest that I am over-conservative.  Indeed, decisions by agreed arbitration are more prevalent in those countries with advanced private enterprise plus a socialist intervention type of administration.</P>
    <P>The recommendations for re-organisation and integration of general hospital services contained in the Fitzgerald Report on Hospital Services are of critical concern in the regional centres of Dublin, Cork and Galway and very positive steps have already been taken towards the development of integrated facilities in these areas, in general accord with the ideas outlined in that Report.</P>
    <P>The initial steps taken in Dublin included the setting up of bodies to run St. James's Hospital, formerly St. Kevin's, and the James Connolly Memorial Hospital at Blanchardstown. The development of James Connolly Memorial Hospital as a general hospital is a specific recommendation in the Fitzgerald Report.  Following negotiations between the then Dublin <Col N="947" /> Health Authority and the three voluntary general hospitals in north Dublin &mdash;the Mater, St. Laurence's and Jervis Street&mdash;and with their full agreement, I made an order under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act of 1961 setting up a body known as the James Connolly Memorial Hospital Board which leased the Blanchardstown hospital from the Dublin Health Authority with effect from 1st April, 1971.  The board intend to provide a general hospital which initially will have a bed complement of 120.  In order to achieve this object certain reconstruction works, involving operating theatres, X-ray and out-patient departments are necessary.  This work is now under way.  The full provision of 120 beds will not be feasible until the reconstruction work is carried through, which we expect will be completed during 1972.  However, the board have already made a modest start in the admission and treatment of medical and surgical patients.  The ultimate objective here is a considerably larger hospital than the initial 120 beds, and the board are considering the further development that will be necessary.</P>
    <P>In south Dublin, following negotiations between Dublin Health Authority and their successors, the Eastern Health Board, and the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals, agreement was reached on the establishment of a similar corporate body to develop and manage St. James's Hospital, formerly St. Kevin's.  The intention is to develop medical, surgical and teaching facilities on the site, including services now being provided in a number of the constituent hospitals of the federation.  The intended scale of development here will be very substantial and will include new in-patient accommodation providing not less than 350 beds.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Health Authority and their successors, the Eastern Health Board, have negotiated with the voluntary hospitals in a most helpful and co-operative way in these initial attempts at hospital rationalisation, and I am convinced that the progress of these projects so far augurs well for the future of the hospital services in Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> The planning of the Cork Regional Hospital is practically completed and I expect that the Cork Hospital Board will be in a position to invite tenders by the end of next March.  The new hospital will be an up-to-date teaching hospital of 580 beds planned in full consultation with medical teaching interests. There will also be a small hostel of 20 places, to cater for patients who need overnight accommodation convenient to the hospital facilities.</P>
    <P>Special provision is being made for medical education in lecture theatres and a library in addition to ward teaching facilities.  There will also be a nurses' training school.</P>
    <P>A new hospital will provide a regional pathology service and will cater for specialist clinical investigation procedures and research.</P>
    <P>In approaching the problem of providing modernised hospital organisation in the west it is fortunate that Galway Regional Hospital of 567 beds is a comparatively new building, having been completed in 1957.  This hospital and large modern complex at Merlin Park originally provided as a regional sanatorium are at present in process of being integrated.  The emphasis in Galway can usefully be placed at this stage in the building up of specialist staff.  In the last three years the following additional appointments there have been approved: 2 surgeons, 2 physicians, 2 pathologists, 2 obstetrician-gynaecologists, 3 radiologists, 1 paediatrician, 1 geriatrician.  Some of the new posts have not yet been filled.</P>
    <P>These developments in Dublin, Cork and Galway represent a substantial contribution to the practical implementation of the recommendations in the Fitzgerald Report.  This has been done by <i>ad hoc</i> negotiations between the bodies concerned&mdash;the Department, the voluntary hospitals and the health boards.  The Fitzgerald Report, however, recommended that there should be permanent formal machinery for achieving co-ordinated development of the services and this recommendation was endorsed in general by the Health Act, 1970, which provided for the setting up of special bodies to achieve this co-ordination.  These bodies will be Comhairle na nospidéal and three <Col N="949" /> regional hospital boards, based on the medical teaching centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Since the Act was passed, I have had discussions with a number of the interests involved on the setting up of these bodies and I have now reached the stage where the formal consultation with all interests involved which are required by the Act are in train.  Very prolonged informal consultations have already taken place.</P>
    <P>A draft of my proposals for the regulations setting up these bodies and spelling out in detail their functions was circulated at the end of November. I had hoped that the draft would come before the House for discussion and, approval, in February.  As, however, a number of organisations have asked for further time to consider the proposals I had to extend the time for the submission of comments until 29th February, 1972.  On this basis consideration of the draft regulations by the Oireachtas will not be feasible until after the Easter recess.  In the mean-time, I do not wish to comment in detail on the proposals.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised previously the importance of management in our health services, and it was never more important than now when we are faced with ever-rising costs, a substantial hospital re-organisation which will involve very considerable capital expenditure, increasing demands made by the public on our health services generally, particularly our hospital services, and the continuous impact of scientific development and medical progress.  I believe that the management teams as worked out for the new health boards are a good beginning in that field. Increasing development and running costs, which as yet show no tendency to level off, necessitate radical managerial thinking in regard to priorities and the need to select from a variety of options, if the resources developed in our health services are to provide maximum benefit to the community.  This type of management operation must have available better information on which to base decisions than we have at present.  Within any organisation concerned with health services, and more particularly with hospital services, we must look for an adequate feedback <Col N="950" /> of relevant information and statistics on which decisions can be taken.  The in-patient survey being carried out by the Medico-Social Research Board with the co-operation of the hospitals should be of great value in the study of needs and priorities.  In this area, too, there will be much need for expertise in looking at the over-all picture and I would envisage that Comhairle na nOspidéal and the regional hospital boards when functioning should give valuable light and guidance to management at the policy level.</P>
    <P>The necessity to give the most active attention to efficiency and economy in the day-to-day running of the service is also beyond question and we must look to management to maintain a most active interest here.  I have taken the initial steps to set up a unit in my Department which will concern itself with work-study and management generally and the services of this unit should be of great value to hospitals in achieving increased effectiveness, particularly in relation to personnel organisation which is such a heavy factor in hospital costs.</P>
    <P>Continuing attention to &ldquo;throughput&rdquo;, or the number of patients treated per bed over a specified period, must also remain a necessary concern of management and indeed of the hospital organisation at every level.  The continuing increase in the numbers requiring admission for acute hospital treatment poses a special challenge, and every line of approach which would forestall unnecessary increase in acute hospital beds and consequential operating costs must be adopted if we are to contain the demand for services within available resources.</P>
    <P>When all the steps possible are taken to reduce the intake into hospitals so as to shorten length of stay, to induce better administrative management, to co-ordinate and integrate hospital services, to keep as many old people as possible at home, I must make it clear that if one out of every ten people spends some time in an acute care hospital every year the cost of the hospital service is going to increase and will have to be paid for by the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> In conformity with the policy of extending consultant out-patient clinics and providing specialist treatment in our hospitals, I have sanctioned the appointment of 49 consultants in the last two years.</P>
    <P>The statement circulated to Deputies contains lists of the major hospital building projects completed since April, 1970, projects under construction at November, 1971, and projects at an advanced stage of planning on that date.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure on hospitals, in common with other public capital expenditure, is governed by the overall control measures which it has been necessary to apply in the public sector generally.  Despite this constraint, however, it is expected that some £4.2 millions will be spent on hospital building works in 1971-72, of which £2.65 millions will come from the Hospitals Trust Fund and £1.55 million from the Local Loans Fund and other sources.</P>
    <P>One of the most important elements of the current hospitals capital programme is the provision of extra accommodation and facilities for the mentally handicapped, to which I will refer in more detail later.  In so far as general hospitals are concerned, the new St. Vincent's Hospital at Elm Park, Donnybrook, Dublin, replacing the old St. Vincent's Hospital at St. Stephen's Green, became fully operational early last year.  A new central laundry and sterilising service for hospitals in the Dublin and adjoining areas is expected to be completed by the end of March.  Other projects nearing completion or just completed include new operating theatres at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, and the Sheil Hospital, Ballyshannon, and new nurses' homes at Temple Street Hospital, Dublin, Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, Dublin, and the North Infirmary, Cork.  Work is expected to commence early this year on a major scheme of improvements at St. Laurence's Hospital, Dublin, to enable it to carry on its essential services until such time as new facilities are provided elsewhere, as part of the proposals for reorganising the hospital services.  Planning <Col N="952" /> is in progress on a number of other hospital projects which are expected to commence in 1972, including a new X-ray department at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, kitchen and staff dining accommodation at the Meath Hospital, Dublin, reconstruction works at Linden Convalescent Home and extensions to St. Joseph's School for the Blind, Drumcondra, and St. Mary's Home and School for the Deaf, Cabra.</P>
    <P>During the past year or so work was completed on a scheme of extensions at Sligo County Hospital where 100 new beds have been added, including maternity, gynaecology, ENT, ophthalmic and paediatric beds.  Other additions included a new out-patients' department and a pathology laboratory. Three blocks of flats to accommodate 54 nurses are nearing completion. The extended hospital will be able to cater for about 228 patients and will provide specialist services in paediatrics, ENT, and ophthalmology on a regional basis for Counties Donegal and Leitrim as well as County Sligo.</P>
    <P>Work has commenced on the erection of a new health centre at Ballymun at which child welfare, antenatal, ENT, ophthalmic, immunisation, psychiatric, dental and welfare services as well as general practitioner services will be provided.</P>
    <P>Planning of certain important works at area health board general hospitals has reached a stage where it is expected that tenders will be invited this year&mdash;for example, new units at the County Hospital, Wexford, which will cater for maternity and medical patients and extra operating theatre accommodation and laboratory facilities at Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that when introducing the Estimate last year I dealt at length with the recommendations of the Commission of Enquiry on Mental Illness and indicated the progress which had been made in this connection.  The process of implementing the commission's recommendations has continued since then.</P>
    <P>However, I should make it clear that the report of the Medico-Social Research Board indicates that there <Col N="953" /> is a very much larger number of first entrants, both urban and rural based, to mental hospitals in the 25 to 34 years age group largely due to schizophrenia than in the neighbouring countries. This has caused me to revise priorities.  The Medico-Social Research Board will be investigating the socioeconomic conditions relating to this age group of patient.</P>
    <P>With the advice of psychiatrists in my Department and outside it, I have decided to give priority to important schemes which will have the greatest impact on the younger age group. These schemes include short stay units at general hospitals, industrial therapy and workshops, the appointment of psychiatric social workers and the stepping up of social community services.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Mental Illness were very concerned at the very high numbers of in-patients in our psychiatric hospitals.  The latest figure available of 15,392 patients on 31st December, 1970, shows a reduction of 3,250 (17.4 per cent) since the commission reported.  This is very conclusive evidence that the new intensive care approach enables patients to be returned to the community much earlier.  Accommodation in some hospitals is still overtaxed but a reduction of 17 per cent must permit a better use of facilities and an improvement in the lot of those patients who may have to remain in hospital.  At the same time attendances at out-patient clinics have increased from 83,769 in 1965 to 150,244 in 1970.</P>
    <P>The scheme of the division of the psychiatric service in Dublin city into seven separate areas has progressed during the past year.  Each area has its own team of psychiatrists, nurses and supplementary staff and the aim is to provide an acute unit in each area. As recommended by the commission, the co-operation of the private mental hospitals has been sought in providing such acute units.</P>
    <P>The programmes for 1970-71 and 1971-72 include accommodation for in-patients and the provision of out-patient clinics at St. John of God, Stillorgan, St. James's Hospital, James's Street, St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, <Col N="954" /> and at the former private mental hospital at Cluain Mhuire, Blackrock, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my gratitude to the private hospitals concerned for their willing co-operation and participation in the new scheme.  It posed for them a challenge which they gladly accepted and I am certain that much good will result for the hospitals and the general public.</P>
    <P>In Cork a great deal of success has attended the new psychiatric units established in St. Fachtna's, Skibbereen, and at Sarsfieldscourt.  I am hopeful that in a few years the success of these units will result in reducing appreciably the much criticised overcrowding in Our Lady's Hospital, Cork.</P>
    <P>I have long been conscious of the need to improve recruitment of medical staff for the satisfactory operation of the psychiatric service, even though the number of psychiatrists per 100,000 population compares well with that in Great Britain.  With this in mind I felt it was essential to give consultant status to senior psychiatrists employed in the service and to bring their remuneration in line with that of consultants in other specialities. Following discussion with representatives of the medical staffs I am glad to say that agreement was reached on revised duties and improved remuneration for the staff concerned.  These have been accepted in principle by the health boards and are in process of being implemented.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board have appointed an acting director of forensic psychiatry, pending the filling of the post in a permanent capacity.  His duties will include responsibility for the administration of the Central Mental Hospital at Dundrum, County Dublin, the administration of which was transferred to the board on 1st September last.  He will also be responsible for the new &ldquo;closed&rdquo; unit for drug addicts at Dundrum and for the new adolescent centre for behavioural disorders, including drug abuse, which has been established by the board at Usher's Island, Dublin, and which came into operation on 8th February, 1972.</P>
    <P>A working party, comprising representatives <Col N="955" /> of the health board, the Department of Justice and my Department, has been established to consider how new buildings, which I have agreed should be provided at the Central Mental Hospital, can best be planned and utilised.  Needs in regard to treatment and research will be borne in mind by the working party and the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>Last year I referred to the problem of alcoholism.  The recent International Conference on Alcoholism and Addiction, organised by the Irish National Council on Alcoholism, has helped to focus attention on this disturbing problem. A recent analysis by the Medico-Social Research Board of first admissions into our psychiatric hospitals has shown that 1 in 7 of such admissions are due to alcoholism or alcoholic psychoses.  Last year over 1,000 new alcoholic cases entered psychiatric hospitals for treatment.  These figures emphasise the necessity of taking all practicable steps to combat the disease of alcoholism in our society.</P>
    <P>With this in mind I have recently requested the council to consider, in the light of the recent conference, what should now be done to deal with this problem and I can assure the House that the measures advocated by the council will be examined and, whereever feasible, implemented with the least possible delay.  I should point out that the problem related mainly to community consciousness.  I have asked four of the health boards to appoint social workers with the necessary vocational gifts to organise the community services and to highlight the problem of excessive social drinking.  I am urgently concerned with the problem of reaching the heavy drinker before he becomes an alcoholic. In this field I feel there should be a real hope, through education, of arresting the progress towards alcoholism and I am confident that the recommendations of the Irish National Council will pay special attention to this aspect of the problem.  I might say here that my Department has recently commenced a campaign to draw public attention to the widespread problem of alcoholism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> A leaflet about the danger of excessive drinking has been prepared&mdash;a copy is with the documents circulated to Deputies&mdash;and will be circulated as considered appropriate.  Incidentally, supplies of this leaflet were recently distributed to public houses throughout the country.  This step was taken in agreement with the Licensed Vintners' Association and the Federation of Licensed Vintners, whom I wish to thank for their co-operation in this publicity effort.</P>
    <P>A number of short-stay psychiatric units associated with general hospitals have been provided in recent years and it is planned to provide further units at Galway Regional Hospital, tenders have recently been received for this unit, Limerick Regional Hospital, Letterkenny County Hospital, Nenagh County Hospital and Kilkenny County Hospital and also at the projected Cork Regional Hospital and Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    <P>Other improvements in the mental hospital field include the erection of a 100-bed unit at Kilkenny Mental Hospital to relieve overcrowding and provide better treatment facilities.</P>
    <P>Work continues on schemes for the renovation and upgrading of existing mental hospital buildings, including the provision of new and improved sanitary and bathing accommodation, catering and dining facilities, electrical, boiler and central heating installations, ward and general improvements and staff accommodation.  Improvement schemes of this kind are in progress at Ballinasloe, Cork, Ennis, Enniscorthy, Monaghan, Mullingar, Sligo and Youghal Mental Hospitals.  Planning is in progress on improvements schemes for other mental hospitals. Tenders for the provision of work therapy units at a number of mental hospitals have been sanctioned.  Planning is well advanced for the provision of units at other centres to provide work and occupational activity for suitable patients.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Working Party on Drug Abuse was published last May and, as Deputies will be aware, it contains comprehensive recommendations relating to the problem of drug abuse in this country.  Most of these <Col N="957" /> recommendations have been acted upon.</P>
    <P>I hope to introduce legislation in the current session containing more comprehensive measures for the control of drug abuse.  The legislation will propose more flexible powers for the Garda in dealing with drug offences. It will also enable the Minister for Health to exercise certain additional controls in relation to such matters as the safe custody of drugs, the keeping of records and the availability of certain drugs liable to abuse.  In addition, provision will be made for dealing specifically with offences involving the forging of prescriptions or their use. Provision will also be made for the working party's recommendations regarding &ldquo;scaled&rdquo; penalties depending on the drug involved, with harsher penalities for drug &ldquo;pushers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As regard the treatment of drug abusers, the special out-patient treatment and information centre at Jervis Street Hospital continues to provide a valuable service.  A 24-hour telephone service is available at this centre for persons wishing to arrange for treatment or to receive information or advice regarding drug abuse.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, a special &ldquo;closed&rdquo; unit for the treatment of drug abusers has been established at Dundrum by the Eastern Health Board, with accommodation for 10 patients.  The need for and extent of any additional accommodation that may be required in the future is being assessed.  Patients discharged from this unit may attend any of the psychiatric out-patient clinics provided by the Eastern Health Board during their period of rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>I will deal later on in this speech with the measures being adopted in the field of health education in relation to drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Last year I explained at some length my approach to the organisation of institutional services for the care of the aged, and my policy in that regard will be reflected to a considerable extent in the future building programme. Progress on the building side continues to be reasonably good.  Some 2,400 places have been provided in new or reconstructed accommodation since <Col N="958" /> 1963.  Schemes in progress at present will make places available for about 1,230 patients.  Tenders have been invited or obtained for further schemes which will provide accommodation for some 328 further patients.  The estimated total cost of the schemes completed and in progress and at tender stage is about £7 million.  I am making provision in next year's building programme for projects which, when completed, will provide about 560 further places.</P>
    <P>A start has been made on the planning of special new assessment and rehabilitation centres for the aged.  The new Cork Regional Hospital will have a unit of 30 beds while a 40-bed unit is to be erected at St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork.  Changes are being made in the geriatric unit now in course of construction at the County Hospital, Tullamore, so as to provide facilities for assessment and rehabilitation as well as long-stay hospital care.  Similar provision will be made in units envisaged for the County Hospitals at Nenagh, Kilkenny and Lisdarn.  This policy will be continued when geriatric units are provided in the future in close association with acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>The first of the new style welfare homes to be provided by health boards is nearing completion at Kilrush, County Clare.  These homes will provide for frail old people who cannot continue to live in the community, even with the aid of supportive services, but who, nevertheless, do not need to be hospitalised on a long-stay basis.  Much of the accommodation will be in single rooms.  There will be adequate day-room and recreational space.  The homes will, as far as possible, be located convenient to churches and shops.  Local voluntary organisations will be encouraged to maintain close contacts with the residents and the general approach will be to avoid an institutional atmosphere as far as possible.  Tenders have been received and approved for six other homes at different centres throughout the country.  Provision has been made for six further homes in the 1972-73 building programme and I intend to include a number of welfare homes in each succeeding year.  While the present <Col N="959" /> series of homes are planned on similar lines I propose to keep an open mind in regard to future developments.  I intend to ask health boards to keep in close touch with those responsible for running the homes and to submit recommendations for any changes they might consider to be desirable if further homes were being provided in their areas.</P>
    <P>A further experiment is being carried out at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, where a day hospital has been provided. This unit accommodates up to 50 geriatric cases in any one day and its main functions are to provide care for former in-patients who need continuing treatment on an out-patient basis and to provide an alternative method of care for persons who otherwise might need to be admitted as in-patients.</P>
    <P>The important role being filled by voluntary organisations in enabling elderly persons to continue to live in the community has received generous encouragement from my Department. In 1971-72 a sum of £200,000 is being made available through health boards to voluntary bodies performing worthwhile social work for the aged.  The Department has continued its encouragement to health boards to make full use of this scheme, which gives the boards discretion to make grants, without seeking my specific sanction in each instance.  To promote the scheme further, three social work advisers were appointed to my Department to assist and advise health boards and voluntary organisations active in or intending to become active in the community care of the aged.  A pamphlet was prepared by my Department and issued for the guidance of these organisations in providing services for the elderly.  A copy of this pamphlet is in the document circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>A wide range of worthwhile services of a health or welfare nature provided by voluntary organisations are supported by grants under this scheme. Grants are paid to support the cost of the day-to-day activities of these organisations.  A wide variety of services are provided in or out of local <Col N="960" /> community centres, halls, club houses, schools and convents and other premises.  Perhaps the most frequent and most appreciated of these services are the meals for elderly and disabled people, and laundry services, home visitation, and home help for the house-bound.  Included also would be social activities in these centres for the elderly, as well as regular outings and parties.  Where suitable premises do not exist to provide cooking facilities, arrangements are often made whereby a family will cook and deliver a meal to a neighbour in need.</P>
    <P>The lack of a suitable centre does not prevent the provision of a variety of worthwhile services for old people. However, groups who feel restricted in the range of services they provide because of the lack of suitable premises may also obtain a grant towards the capital costs involved in the provision of an appropriate centre.  Areas such as Longford, Athlone, Ballinamore and Blackpool, Cork, have been among the centres which have thus benefited.</P>
    <P>There is a recognised need to increase the number of social workers employed by health boards and, as a step in this direction, a number of posts of senior social workers in the health boards' service have been sanctioned. It is intended that, where trained social workers are not already employed for statutory services such as child care, these extra social workers will be responsible for this work, will examine and report on the further social work needs in their areas and will co-operate with voluntary organisations in the provision of community social services.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years the number of public health nurses employed on district duties has been doubled and a district nursing service has now become established in every area in the country.</P>
    <P>New entrants to the public health nursing service qualify in public health nursing following a nine-months training course organised by An Bórd Altranais.  Refresher courses are also provided at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>The target set in 1966 of having a district public health nurse available in each district has now generally been achieved.  Practical problems have, of <Col N="961" /> course, arisen in the operation of the service and I have had representations about a variety of matters connected with it.</P>
    <P>After consultation with the appropriate professional bodies, including the Irish Nurses Organisation, I established a working group last May to survey the work-load of the public health nurse and to make appropriate recommendations relating to the service.  The working group have completed a pilot survey, with the co-operation of 20 selected nurses, in preparation for the main survey which they hope to commence in February.  The main survey will last for a period of four weeks.</P>
    <P>Last year I gave the House a review of the services for the mentally handicapped. The steps which I then outlined for the improvement of facilities have been pushed ahead as rapidly as possible.  There are now 4,148 residential places available, compared with 3,100 in 1965.  Work is going ahead on the provision of additional places.  The documents circulated contains particulars of projects completed since 1st April, 1970, and gives the locations of the additional places which are at present in course of construction or in planning providing for 1,500 places in all.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputies and the public are anxious about the provision of places for the mentally handicapped. I have mentioned before that there are no accurate statistics here or, indeed, in any country, regarding the numbers of mentally handicapped persons.  The programme planned, however, will meet the targets set by the Commission on Mental Handicap and, on the basis of all information available to me at present, I am reasonably satisfied that these targets are realistic ones.  I am having the matter kept under continual review, however, to ensure that our programme is adequate.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the expansion of residential accommodation, there has been a continued growth in the numbers being cared for on a non-residential basis.  The numbers now receiving care in this way have increased from 600 in 1965 to 3,000 at present.  Day care permits fuller development of the personality of the mentally handicapped <Col N="962" /> person and avoids the difficulties which could arise after a prolonged period in a residential centre.  The co-ordination of residential and community services coupled with the development of a wide scale of educational and social training will, it is hoped, help to maintain in the community all those mentally handicapped who can be so maintained.</P>
    <P>While it is hoped that it may be possible in the future to achieve a situation where the majority of the handicapped will be able to live in the community, there will always be a need for lifetime residential care for many of the more severely handicapped for whom such care is unavoidable.  For these patients it is my policy to ensure that they will be adequately housed and that they will be given the opportunity of being trained, including training in sheltered workshop activities, to the extent that their disabilities will permit.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that a comprehensive assessment service for handicapped persons on the lines recommended by the commission is being developed for the whole country.  This service is based on teams and a multi-disciplinary approach is being adopted in the formation of these teams.  Skilled personnel for medical, psychological and social aspects are included.  The full assessment, which could involve examinations over a period, will go into all aspects of the patients' handicaps and chart the measures considered necessary for their care, and their education and training to fit them into normal community life.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to the House to know that the facilities already available and in course of expansion in this country for providing residential care for the mentally handicapped are proportionately greater than in Great Britain.  I am told that, in general, our service bears favourable comparison with that of most countries in the world.  We are keeping in close touch with progressive developments elsewhere. In the schemes for new places we are changing over to a large extent to small chalet-type accommodation, wherever possible, rather than continuing to use the traditional larger units.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> I should like, again, to express the country's gratitude to the religious orders and voluntary bodies and to the health boards who provide the backbone for these services.  Without their active participation we would not have achieved the advances we have made in providing accommodation, care and training of our mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure by the State and health boards on the maintenance of the mentally handicapped, excluding capital expenditure, is now running between £4½ million and £5 million a year.  The current programme for building is estimated to cost up to £4,000,000, excluding the cost of schools which is the concern of the Department of Education.  It is estimated that the maintenance costs of mentally handicapped patients will increase by over £1 million a year when the present building programme is completed.  This is an indication of the extent to which the State is prepared to go to ameliorate this tragic human problem.</P>
    <P>A new child health service, which aims at identifying physical and mental ailments of children at the earliest possible stage and at referring them for appropriate treatment was introduced in the larger cities in October, 1970. This service will provide three detailed medical examinations for children while they are under 2 years of age. Initially it is confined to towns with populations of 5,000 and over.  It is intended that, as part of a four-year programme, the service will be extended to children in other areas.</P>
    <P>Detailed statistics from health boards relating to the operation of the new child health service will be available soon.  An initial review of the operation of the scheme was undertaken, in conjunction with chief medical officers, about five months after its inception. It emerged from this review that, of these children entitled to be examined at the age of six months in this period, 84 per cent had been given appointments and 83 per cent of those given appointments had attended for examination. In general, the appointments system operated well and the response of parents to the scheme was excellent. My Department is continuing, in consultation <Col N="964" /> with the health boards, to review the progress of the scheme.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned last year, I established a working group to design new pre-school and school medical record cards on which a child's progress could be systematically recorded.  Those records systematically record and track the health progress of the child and greatly facilitate the supervision of his or her health particularly in regard to early diagnosis of health defects and their correction.  In 1970, 41 per cent of the national schools were visited by the school health team and almost 139,000 children were given school medical examinations.</P>
    <P>Revised procedures for the school health service were introduced during 1971.  A comprehensive initial screening examination for six-year-olds attending national schools has been introduced in a number of areas and also a selective health examination of some nine-year-old pupils.  Other children may be examined in any year at the request of the parent, or, with the parent's consent, at the request of the teacher or the nurse.  I have recommended to health boards that they should retain the routine medical examinations of school leavers for the next few years to ensure that there will be no break in the service to children because of the introduction of the revised procedures.  It is my intention to develop the concept of the school health team comprising doctors, teachers, nurses and parents, pooling their knowledge to ensure that each child will obtain the greatest benefit from the services being provided.</P>
