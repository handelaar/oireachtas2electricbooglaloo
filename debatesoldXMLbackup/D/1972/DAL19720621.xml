      <P>There are 425 patients awaiting ENT treatment at this hospital as compared with 543 a year ago. These are mainly tonsil and adenoid cases.  In view of the fact that urgent cases receive immediate attention and children are called in groups of 50 at a time, I do not regard the waiting list as unduly high.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether any extended programme of modernisation of mental hospital buildings and services is under consideration and whether any plan exists to close down buildings which are over 100 years old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1956" />
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The modernisation of mental hospital buildings is a continuing process and the improvements needed may vary from minor schemes to complete replacement.  Since becoming Minister for Health I have, each year, devoted an appreciable proportion of the capital building programme towards the modernisation and improvement of our mental hospitals.</P>
      <P>In connection with the current debate on the Estmiates for my Department I have circulated, for the information of all Deputies, a statement showing all hospital building projects, including those at mental hospitals, which have been recently completed or which are at the building tender, or planning stage.  No less than 44 mental hospital projects are mentioned in this statement and these included nine projects completed since May, 1971, 20 projects currently under construction, four projects at tender stage and 11 projects at an advanced stage of planning.</P>
      <P>In the course of my speech on the Estimates I announced that, as a further step towards bringing psychiatry more effectively into the community, I had recently directed that in the capital building programme greater emphasis should be placed on the provision of short stay psychiatric units in general hospitals, staffed by specially qualified nurses, which was one of the principal recommendations of the Commission on Mental Illness.  Six such units had already been provided and no less than 15 further units will now be provided.  Two of these are mentioned in the statement circulated to Deputies while provision for 13 further units has been made but siting and other details have to be investigated before positive decisions can be taken in the case of some of these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1958 when the patient population totalled 20,046 there has been a successive reduction in the patient population of our psychiatric hospitals until at the end of 1971 the total was 14,922.  I am confident that the provision of short-stay units will ensure the continuance of this downward trend.  This should enable some of the older buildings which it would be uneconomic to modernise to be demolished. <Col N="1957" /> In the meantime, I will continue, in so far as capital resources can be allocated for the purpose, my policy of up-grading buildings which are suitable for retention.</P>
    <P>Modern buildings will, no doubt, help to improve services but I feel I should record my view that, despite the necessarily slow process of modernisation, which is largely determined by availability of capital resources, great strides have been made in the modernisation of our services for the psychiatrically ill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell me what proportion of the 14,000 patients at present in mental hospitals are in buildings which are over 100 years old?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very hard to say because there have been units added to old buildings; some of the old buildings have been thoroughly modernised and brought up to date and others have been improved but still left very antique.  It would be impossible to give an analysis of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that quite a large proportion of these mental patients are housed in buildings which are over 100 years old?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a considerable number are housed in buildings which are over 100 years old.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister promise any improvement in this situation in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the priority in this matter is to do what we can with these old buildings but to develop the short stay units.  That really is the priority in so far as hospitalisation is concerned in regard to institutional treatment: the provision of 15 more short stay units.  This will be best for the growing generation of younger people who need psychiatric help and who are most likely to be assisted by going to a short stay unit and further by industrial therapy.  I would prefer to spend a good deal of money on industrial therapy units in the 100-year-old hospitals than to rebuild the hospitals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The documentation which I circulated for the information of Deputies in connection with the debate on the Estimates for my Department for the year 1971-72 contained a table showing attendances at psychiatric out-patient clinics during the years 1959, 1969 and 1970.  This table showed that attendances had increased from 14,612 during the calendar year 1959 to 150,244 during the year ending 31st March, 1970.  The number of patients concerned in the 1970 figure quoted was over 41,000 persons.  Admissions to psychiatric hospitals during the year 1970, including re-admissions, totalled 20,342 and of these 7,696 were first admissions. Comparing the number attending out-patient clinics and the admission figures it is evident that a great deal of success is attending the policy of endeavouring to treat patients outside hospital.</P>
      <P>The development of out-patient psychiatric clinics has been in accordance with recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness.  The commission also recommended that provision be made for domiciliary consultations but recognised, however, that such consultations were wasteful of limited staff resources and could be undertaken only at the expense of out-patient and hospital services.</P>
      <P>The commission also recommended that every health board should employ sufficient psychiatric social workers and social workers to meet the needs of its area.  In recent years, employment of such workers has increased despite recruitment difficulties.  At present, there are 21 psychiatric social workers, including six in training, and 23 social workers employed in the psychiatric services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Psychiatric social workers are scarce.  They are very scarce in Britain and very difficult to get.  Apparently, people who like to do social work do not want to take on that particular type of psychiatric social work.  We have discussed the question as to whether, in fact, there should not be a grading between social workers and psychiatric social workers.</P>

      <P>In view of the marked increase in the numbers attending out-patient clinics, has the Minister considered examining into the proportion suffering from minor mental illnesses which could be treated by the family doctor?

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, in view of the high rate of unemployment in Wexford, he will reconsider the application by the Wexford Harbour Commissioners for a grant in order to determine the possibility of opening the port so that Wexford town could be made attractive to potential industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Wexford harbour has been closed to traffic since 1962 due to silting and the inability of the harbour commissioners to undertake dredging.  Since then the commissioners have sought financial assistance from time to time to meet the cost of various schemes with the objective of reopening the harbour.  None of the schemes in question was found to have sufficient technical merit to warrant the grant of State assistance.</P>
      <P>In 1969 the harbour commissioners sought a grant of £3,000 to meet the cost of a survey and rudimentary model of the harbour.  It was the view of my technical advisers that a survey and full-scale model, at an estimated cost of £40,000, would be an essential preliminary to any scheme for reopening the harbour and that the cost of a satisfactory scheme was likely to be in excess of £1 million.</P>
      <P>The very low volume of traffic formerly handled at Wexford is now being handled at other ports including Rosslare and New Ross and there is no indication that the expenditure of substantial sums on the reopening of Wexford would attract any significant new business.  In these circumstances, a review of the decision to refuse State assistance would not be warranted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following arrangements apply:</P>
      <P>(a) Disability benefit&mdash;if the patient is married or has dependent children payment is made to the spouse or to the person responsible for the children. In other cases, such as in the case of a single man, benefit is paid to the resident medical superintendant to administer on the patient's behalf.</P>
      <P>(b) Occupational injuries benefit&mdash; the arrangements are the same as those for disability benefit.</P>
      <P>(c) Contributory old age pension&mdash; if a committee has been appointed to deal with the pensioner's affairs the committee is appointed as agent.  In other cases either the next of kin or an officer of the hospital authority is appointed depending on the circumstances of the particular case.  Where there are dependants and the spouse has not been appointed agent a proportion of the pension may be paid separately to the dependants, or on their behalf, the remainder being paid to the hospital authority on the pensioner's behalf.</P>
      <P>(d) Non-contributory old age pension&mdash;in the case of pensioners who are detained patients in mental hospitals the resident medical superintendant of the hospital, or a person nominated by him, is appointed agent and the money is appropriated towards the cost of maintenance.  The hospital authorities may however use part of the pension for the patient's own benefit.  Pensioners who are not detained patients may appoint an agent of their own choice.  If however the pensioner is so incapacitated mentally as to be unable to give expression to his wishes and a committee has not been appointed to deal with his affairs an agent may be appointed by the local old age pension committee.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the arrangement does not appear to be a very satisfactory one, <Col N="1973" /> particularly at the RMS in each hospital is far too busy to personally administer the fund?  It means that somebody else must get the job of handling what can be a very substantial amount of money if there are a large number of patients there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the money which it is proposed to spend will not give the return hoped for by the Minister and his Department. Would he, even now, disregard his answer of 1971, revert to the promise of 1968 and go back and ask the fishermen, who are the people concerned in this matter, whether they believe that the money now being spent in the manner proposed by the Department will largely be a waste and will not in any way improve the anchorage safety of the boats there?  These fishermen have long been seeking some sort of safe anchorage.  I would ask the Minister if he would consult the fishermen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, of course, being bound in this matter by the reply I gave previously.  I am being guided by the technical advice available to me and, as the Deputy is aware, I in fact met the fishermen in, I think, March, 1971, and discussed the matter with them.  I am satisfied on the basis of the information available to me that the work that is being done is the kind of work and the only kind of work that is justified in all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister&mdash;if it has not already occurred to him, as it probably has&mdash;to query how it is that the technical advice he would now rely on would have emanated from the same source as the technical advice on which I relied in 1968 and to ask why the change in technical advice, if change there has been?  Finally, in regard to the deputation received&mdash;I am quite well aware the Minister received the deputation even though I did not know it was being received&mdash;I ask the Minister if an ultimatum was put to these people: &ldquo;Do we spend on behalf of the Department and the Government so many thousands doing this job, useless or otherwise&rdquo;&mdash;I think useless&mdash;&ldquo;or do you want no job done at all?&rdquo;  In those circumstances what do we expect the fishermen to say?  Do we expect them to say: &ldquo;No you can take the money away&rdquo;?  In so far as the money is concerned, take it from me that it is absolutely, totally wasted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, first of all, that I am not aware of any difference in the technical advice that is being given now to that which was given some years ago.  Indeed, I think Deputy Blaney is aware of the fact that on the basis of that advice my predecessor took the same view as I have taken of it and I do not think any Minister for Finance could take any other view of it in the light of the evidence, the information and the advice available to him.  In regard to the question of the views of the fishermen on this matter the fact is that when I met that deputation I had the distinct impression that what they wanted above all was a decision, because they felt this matter had been going on for far too long. They got a decision and they got action, action, I believe, on the lines most suited to the requirements of this area having regard to all the circumstances concerned.</P>

      <P>With due respect, that is a lot of rot.  Is the Minister telling us that the advice given to Deputy Blaney when he was Minister and about which he made a statement, was false?  Is Deputy Blaney now telling the House that the advisers who gave him this information have either <Col N="1977" /> changed their minds or that they have been replaced?  Whatever the position is, there is a bit of cat and mouse politics between the present Minister and Cabinet and the former member of the Cabinet, and the people who are the victims are the fishermen whose livelihood is at stake.  Is the Minister saying that the fishermen who gave Deputy Blaney and me the information that they are grossly dissatisfied with the present arrangements went into the Minister's office and said: &ldquo;Yes, we want action&rdquo;?

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that the vocational school and the boys' and girls' secondary schools in Kanturk, County Cork have agreed in principle to co-operate in respect of enrolments and the provision of courses, <i>et cetera</i>; and if his Department will assist in every way possible to ensure the availability of a wide curriculum and facilities such as a library, sport facilities, <i>et cetera</i>; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>My Department has been informed by the three post-primary school principals that they have agreed to draw up a common time-table at senior cycle level for the school year 1972-73.  The practical implementation of this agreement in principle would be a welcome development and my Department will assist in any way possible.  The provision of additional permanent accommodation in the centre will, however, have to be considered in the <Col N="1994" /> context of the Department's view that one strong post-primary school would eventually best serve the educational needs of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the suggested amalgamation was dictated by his Department, and is he further aware that, in view of the proposed provision of a comprehensive school at Boherbue six miles away and the proposed provision of a community school six miles further than that in Millstreet, there is a grave danger that Kanturk will be phased out as a leaving examination centre, and that it is a matter of great concern in the locality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been discussed between the Department and the interests concerned, but it is important to recognise that the development of a comprehensive school in the area, far from being a retrograde step, is a positive advance, and if it has effected any change in the provisions I would have thought it was not a matter of concern but one of advantage to the people in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1996" /> for Education the amount of State aid for primary education being made available in fulfilment of the provisions of Article 42.4 of the Constitution under the headings (a) the acquisition of sites and the development of schools and recreational and sporting facilities and (b) the maintenance and upkeep of schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £4 million has been provided for the erection and improvement of national school buildings in the current financial year, and a further amount of £550,000 has been provided in respect of grants towards the cost of heating, cleaning and painting national schools.</P>
      <P>National schools are State-aided but not State schools, and the great majority of them are vested in local trustees.  The system of State aid does not allow of grants being made towards the cost of acquiring school sites which is a local responsibility undertaken by the school manager on behalf of the local community which the particular school serves.  The cost of laying out portion of the school site for suitable recreational facilitiesis, however, included in the figure of cost for building or improving a national school on which the State grant is based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the cost of acquiring sites for national schools is creating a heavy burden in many areas?  Will he not agree that under the Constitution the State should now help school managers to acquire sites if hardship is caused because of the valuation of the sites being acquired?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied to a question on this matter from Deputy Clinton not so very long ago.  I indicated that when it comes to fixing the local contribution the money paid for the site is a factor which is taken into account.  The Deputy will be aware of the fact that the Constitution does not state that we should provide State schools.  It does state that we should provide free primary education and endeavour to supplement and give reasonable aid to private and corporate educational initiatives.  That is certainly being done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 18, to delete &ldquo;twenty-one&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;eighteen&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be agreed that the age of 21 in respect of elections is not regarded as sacrosanct in any part of the world. We seek to avail of this opportunity to <Col N="2037" /> have &ldquo;twenty-one&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;eighteen&rdquo; substituted.  While it is appreciated that an amendment of the Constitution is required to provide for votes at 18 in respect of Dáil elections and referenda, it is clear from the Minister's statement yesterday that a referendum is not required in respect of providing votes at 18 for local election purposes.  It was, therefore, a matter of astonishment to us when this Bill was being drafted and having regard to the assurance given in the House by the Minister for Local Government that he was making arrangements to bring in votes at 18, that he should inform us that a referendum will be held on this issue in the autumn. We think it appropriate, right and proper that the Bill be amended to provide for votes at 18, especially as the Bill refers to local elections.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the Bill provides for the postponement of the local elections to June of next year, there are many in the House who feel that the local elections may not take place at that time, for a variety of reasons which I need not go into now, the basic one being that the massive work of restructuring local authorities will preclude the possibility.  There is also the fact that other important elections are pending&mdash;a referendum, a presidential election and a general election.  This is all the more reason why we want votes at 18 provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us yesterday in a statement on local government that the voting age for local elections can be changed by ordinary legislation, that there is no need for a referendum.  This is the appropriate Bill, in so far as the Labour Party is concerned.  We are now asking the Government to show good faith in this matter by agreeing to our reasonable request to delete &ldquo;twenty-one&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;eighteen&rdquo;. This is a matter which could not be regarded as controversial.  It is a pity that a referendum must be fought on such an issue which is non-contentious and non-vexatious.  Our suggestion would have the accord of the vast majority of the people.  I know of no good reason why our wishes in this matter should not be granted.</P>
    <P>In almost all the countries of Europe <Col N="2038" /> which we are about to join, the voting age is 18, Eighteen is also the voting age in Britain, Belgium, Germany and the USA.  The voting age in Sweden is 19.  This is the time, if the Government are sincere, to provide votes at 18 and we ask that this be done.</P>
    <P>It is most desirable that the younger generation should be involved in the democratic process.  So many of them are accused of going outside the democratic process that it is desirable to involve them, to give them an effective say in the running of the affairs of our country, in the election of their public representatives and to allow them to participate fully in the whole process.</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, then, to seize this opportunity of accepting the simple amendment we propose and so give an assurance that, whenever the local elections take place, the voting age will be 18 and that will be guaranteed.  We are also very conscious of the fact that there is a further amendment in the names of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party which seeks earlier local elections.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It has been Fine Gael policy since 1965 to give votes in parliamentary elections and local government elections to citizens who have attained the age of 18 years.  We considered the matter very carefully at that time and came to the conclusion that it was in the interests of democracy that votes should be given at 18.  Everything that <Col N="2039" /> has happened in the world and in this country since then has proved that the decision of Fine Gael in 1965 was correct. Since then, young people seem to be maturing earlier in life.  They certainly take a more active part in national affairs and they express their interest in the running of the country and in the future of the country.</P>
      <P>I always think young people who can look forward to a life of 60 years are much more entitled to have a say in the running of the country than older people, because they have a much greater and a much longer stake in the country.  That does not mean we should hand over the entire Government of the country to people of 18 years but it does mean that people of 18 years should have a voice in the running of the country, that they should be able to make their views felt and that they should be able to influence decisions being made which will affect them as citizens for, with a bit of luck, 60 years.</P>
      <P>That was the reason that prompted Fine Gael to call for votes at 18 as long ago as 1965, and we have been doing it since.  Developments in the world since have proved us right.  We have entered an era in which youth, if not given the right to do so in the ballot boxes, will express their feelings by public protests, by marches, by taking to the streets, by sit-in strikes and other demonstrations of one sort or another.  I am firmly convinced that if teenagers felt they had the right to go into a polling both to express their views on national and local matters they would be much less inclined to resort to those other less desirable methods of making their views felt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I think there is an unanswerable case to be made for giving votes at 18 and for giving them at once.  The argument which undoubtedly the Parliamentary Secretary will put forward, and indeed I think he did put it forward on the Second Stage, against the amendment standing in the name of the Labour Party is that a national referendum is necessary to give votes to people under 21 years of age in general elections, presidential elections and referenda.  I do not accept <Col N="2040" /> that as a vital argument for not availing of this opportunity to give votes at 18.  I think the fact that the Government, who claim the right to lead public opinion, have made up their minds to hold a referendum and apparently to recommend to the people that citizens of 18 years and older should have votes in a general election, a presidential election, <i>et cetera,</i> is the best argument why they should now give the lead and confer votes on people at 18.</P>
    <P>It is no argument to say that be cause a constitutional referendum is necessary to give votes at 18 in national elections, votes should be denied to citizens at 18 in local government elections.  The reason behind the statement I have just made is that the Constitution was very careful in 1937 to differentiate between local elections and parliamentary elections. It is spelled out carefully and clearly that only by a national referendum could votes be given to citizens younger than 21 years in general and presidential elections and referenda, but the Constitution equally carefully excluded local government elections, thereby conferring on this House and on the elected representatives of the people the right to decide at any time that votes should be given in local government elections to people younger than 21 years.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the argument put by the Parliamentary Secretary as being up-to-date is not a valid one.  A recent argument which the Parliamentary Secretary put up was that at any rate the local elections have been postponed and the referendum will be held in the autumn&mdash;that by the time the next local elections come around an Act will have been passed conferring on teenagers the right to vote in local elections.  In my opinion that is not a valid argument because if this House believes&mdash;and I believe all parties in it so believe&mdash;that people should have the vote at 18, the sooner that is spelled out in black and white and conveyed to people of 18 years the better for the society in which we live, because by conveying that decision to them we will be saying: &ldquo;We regard you as responsible citizens of this <Col N="2041" /> State.  We regard you as of now as being entitled to take an active part in the local administration of this country and we hope your elders will endorse our decision in regard to parliamentary elections when given the opportunity to do so in the referendum soon to be held.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is my thinking on this subject as of now and I believe it to be a line of thought that must recommend itself to all people who believe in an ordered society here, in a society operated through the ballot box rather than from the streets.  I believe the Minister and the Government have nothing to lose by accepting this amendment at this time.  We are now entering the school holiday period when young people have not a lot to do and it would be a nice thing to say to them before we go into recess: &ldquo;We recognise you as citizens entitled to exercise the local franchise and we have so decided by an Act of Dáil Éireann.  It will be only a matter of months until, we hope, the people of the country in a national referendum will recognise you as citizens entitled at the age of 18 years to play your part in electing the Parliament of this country, in electing the President of this country and in deciding when and why the Constitution should be amended.&rdquo; I find it difficult to understand the reluctance to date of the Government to accept this amendment&mdash;may be they will change their mind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that 12 months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the Parliamentary Secretary makes that remark.  It proves that he is even more dense than I think he is.  If the Minister made this statement 12 months ago, why did he not do something about it?  There has not been so much business in the House during that time.  The House has been messing around with things but has achieved very little.  We are going to have a plethora of elections in the next 12 months, causing general confusion, but where we could grant votes at 18 in local elections by means of a simple Act the Government will not do it. Local elections are not in the first division of elections in this country and I think that will be accepted by everybody.  I assume the first division is in respect of Dáil elections; presumably the second is the Seanad elections; referenda and presidential elections come somewhere along the line, and local elections are still more remote from the first division.</P>
      <P>As my colleagues have pointed out, when the Constitution was passed it rightly provided for votes at 21 years but the method of approach was wrong. The Constitution should have stated that any citizen over 21 years could vote; nowadays most citizens are 24 years or 25 years before they get a vote.  Generally speaking, no person will vote until they are 20 or 21 years if this amendment is accepted; in fact, they may be 22 years if we accept the six-year system of local elections. Apparently this is the desire of the Government now since they will not have even a five-year election in Dublin city.  All of us know that this Government have not a shred of decency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, it is clear that the Government are not in earnest about this.  It is also clear that the age of 21 for parliamentary elections was deliberately put into the Constitution.  If I know anything about our present respected President, it is clear he did not miss this point when the Constitution was under consideration. Whatever we might think about his effect on this country from time to time, certainly he would not miss an arithmetical point of this kind.  I do <Col N="2044" /> not know what the Government have in mind when they bring in this Bill to postpone local elections and do not at the same time provide for votes at 18.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Treacy and Deputy Fitzpatrick that it is good training for young people to vote in local elections when they are 18 years. We do not know whether votes at 18 for parliamentary elections will be passed in the referendum.  That is all the more reason why young people should get votes in local elections when they are 18 years.  Many a young person is paying a large amount of income tax.  Even where the income of the father is small and where the son or daughter is earning a sizeable amount, they cannot assign part of their income to a younger brother or sister, even if the family is large.  Of course, this it typical of the Government's attitude to large families and to young people.  They have no regard for young people.</P>
    <P>It is specious to suggest, as the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have done, that the referendum will decide this matter in the autumn. Why was it not put into this Bill?  It is an outrage for a Government to pretend they are concerned and then behave in this manner.  As I have said before, the motto of the Government is: &ldquo;Do not do as I do, do as I say.&rdquo; Any Government that would come in place of this Fianna Fáil Government would be very unwise to do as they have been doing in the past few years.</P>
    <P>We will await the Parliamentary Secretary's reply.  I strongly recommend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Government are concerned there will be elections in June, 1973.  As announced by the Minister for Local Government on the 9th March, 1971, it is the policy of the Government to ensure that an opportunity will be given to people of 18 to vote at all elections, at general elections, presidential elections, local government elections and referenda.  The referendum will take place in the autumn to enable a change to be made in the Constitution whereby people of 18 will be able to vote in national elections.  It is logical not to make the change suggested by this amendment until after the people have decided on this issue.  The Bill that will be required before the holding of the referendum will pass through this House.  I do not know what amendments the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies will table in respect of that Bill.  Deputy O'Donovan speaking, as he says, on behalf of a united Labour Party, is glad to note the unanimity of the Fine Gael Party on this issue.  However, Deputy Esmonde is on record as having said that it was accepted that all Deputies were in favour of giving votes to people at 18.  He continued that in his considered opinion and knowing the inherent conservatism in the Irish race and the lack of desire for change, it is by no means certain that this would go through in a referendum. That is the summing up of what one Fine Gael Deputy thinks the people might do.</P>

From a list I have here I can tell the Deputy at what age votes are given in the various countries: France, 21 years; Germany, 18 years; Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands, 21 years; Luxembourg and the UK, 18 years; Norway and Denmark, 20 years.

Clearly, he does not see that the Constitution differentiates between parliamentary franchise and local government franchise.  The Constitution spells out clearly that in parliamentary elections, presidential elections and referenda a person must have attained the age of 21 years before he can vote.  It was equally clear and careful to leave the question of local government franchise to the elected representatives of this House.  Therefore, the Government would find themselves in no difficulty.  I would have thought that Deputy Haughey would wish that everybody would be entitled to express his views.  There will be various elections within the next 12 <Col N="2048" /> months in which I am sure Deputy Haughey will have as much interest, if not more, than anyone else.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> If the only question that is going to be put to the people in the referendum <Col N="2050" /> in the autumn is whether or not young people should have votes at 18, there is no reason whatever why that question could not have been put to them in conjunction with the EEC referendum. The question could have been put on a separate ballot paper, as was done in 1968.  Two ballot papers on complicated matters were put to the people separately then and the people answered them separately.  The Parliamentary Secretary said something about spoiled votes.  How many votes were spoiled in 1968?  The number was small.  The people showed very well that they could manage two ballot papers.  Substantially the same number of people voted in the 1968 referendum as voted this year.</P>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary telling us that in 1972 the people are so stupid that they cannot distinguish between a question asking them should the Constitution be amended to let us go into the EEC on the one hand and a question on a separate ballot paper asking should people have votes at 18?  There could be a white ballot paper and a green ballot paper.  The Minister for Finance has told us that the referendum held on the 10th May cost £140,000.  It would be a waste of public money to have an unnecessary repeat performance.  I would not be in favour of having any sort of package deal with the EEC referendum or associating any controversial subject with it, but surely there is nothing controversial about this?

From the recent referendum it could be assumed that all parties could anticipate a referendum result that would be heavily in favour of votes at 18.  This opportunity which presents itself now to make this decision should be availed of by the Parliamentary Secretary.

      <P>Many of us will remember that in 1965 the Government was dissolved.  Elections were held on the 7th April, 1965, so as to prevent young people who were on the register for the first time and who would have had votes on the 14th April, 1965, from voting in the subsequent general election.  As a result, people aged 26 and 27 years cast their first votes in a general election in 1969.  I was one of those who was in my middle twenties before I got an opportunity of casting my first vote. This opportunity should be taken so that in September next people aged 18 would have their names on the register.</P>
      <P>There is no guarantee that local elections will be held next year although the Parliamentary Secretary has said that legally we are supposed to have them.  Legally, we were supposed to hold them this year but they were postponed.  The number of elections due to take place may make it necessary once again to postpone the local elections next year.  In many areas there has been no local democracy for many years.  I am speaking about the Bray area and the corporation area of Dublin.  The Fianna Fáil Government have looked at recent opinion polls once again and have seen that young people will not vote for them in the same numbers as they will vote for other parties.  They have said: &ldquo;We cannot obviously be against votes at 18 but we will take the necessary steps to see that the decision is delayed as long as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an opportunity here for the Parliamentary Secretary to write this provision into the Bill and he is refusing this opportunity.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that people should be allowed to express their opinions.  We are passing a Bill here which will stop the people expressing their opinions at local elections for another year.  This may be done again next year.  All the indications are that Fianna Fáil are preventing young people from expressing their opinions.  Yesterday the Minister talked about the substitution of community councils for local councils.

      <P>The one thing that surprises me in this is the choice the Parliamentary Secretary says he is giving in the form of a referendum to the people some time in the autumn. He will not give them any choice; he will merely state that people at 18 years of age shall have votes.  He says we can table amendments to make it 18, 19 or 20 years.  This is not true.  The Constitution makes no reference whatever to local electors having to attain the age of 21 years.  Because of that, we support this amendment fully.  There is no reason why a person who is old enough to carry arms for his country, to pay income tax, to hold a driving licence, should not have a say in electing representatives to run this country. This can be included in the Bill.  The referendum will refer simply to general elections.  The Parliamentary Secretary is confused on this issue.  After the referendum he will have to come back here with a further local government elections Bill and we shall have to discuss once again what we are now discussing, something on which we are all agreed in principle, that a person of 18 years of age should be entitled to elect local authority representatives.</P>
      <P>I congratulate those who moved this amendment and caused the Government to initiate activity in this regard. I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to see reason.  There is no indication that the referendum on votes at 18 will be defeated.  The referendum will refer simply to a change in the Constitution which refers to those who are entitled to vote in a general election.</P>

He has given no valid reason as to why this amendment should not be included in this measure now.  To talk about the necessity for the referendum and to presume that it will be a contentious issue and challenged in a large way by the people and to go on to infer that amendments may be tabled in this House is absurd. The Parliamentary Secretary knows full well that all parties in this House are agreed on votes at 18 and the probability of amendments to any other age is out of the question.  I am sorry that he should quote a Deputy of this House out of context in his inference that there was likely to be objections by certain sectors of the people by reason of their alleged conservatism. This is simply the old stone-walling attitude of the Government party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However valid, cogent, urgent or important it may be, it will not be accepted but they will copy our proposals months, sometimes years, afterwards and implement them.  The <Col N="2054" /> Labour Party attempted in February of this year to get the Government to accept legislation on this matter. Again, it was rejected by the Minister for Local Government.  We have persistently endeavoured to convince the Government of the necessity for granting votes at 18 and we find ourselves stone-walled, fobbed-off, all the time on this issue.  Like my colleagues, I have doubts about the local elections next year.  I shall not go into that now. The Parliamentary Secretary also inferred that I was guilty of virtual untruth or misleading the House in respect of certain information I gave. I mentioned specifically certain countries in Europe where the franchise has been conceded under 21 years.  I mentioned Belgium.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned Belgium.</P>

He does particular injury and insult to 140,000 young people who could come on the electoral register today if votes were conceded at 18.  Some 140,000 people can be disfranchised by this reluctance to concede votes at 18.  I regret there is the refusal to seize the opportunity; I regret that so many spurious arguments have been raised against it.  Our young people are as intelligent as any teenage group in the world.  They are very well educated. They are mature physically and educationally at 17 or 18.  As has been said, they may bear arms for their country at 17, they may marry and found a family, they may be taxpayers and ratepayers.  They may take on all the responsibility and the full status of citizens and we still deny them the <Col N="2055" /> right to be actively involved in the political affairs of their country.</P>
      <P>One could go on for a long time but one would only be wasting one's sweetness on the desert air trying to convince an intransigent Parliamentary Secretary and a hostile Government of the rightness of proposals made by this side of the House.  I hope the young people will realise how they are being duped and deceived and, when the time comes when they can avail of the franchise, I hope they will give vent to their feelings and take the necessary steps to put out of office a Government which treats them with such disdain.</P>

      <P>The Opposition pattern is beginning to emerge.  One sets up something which is false and tries to give the impression across that it is a fact.  It sounds very good, if the Opposition can get away with it, to argue that the Fianna Fáil Government are depriving people of 18 of votes in local elections.  There is the statement made by Deputy Treacy that we could put the 18's on the register today.

      <P>It is the intention of the Government to bring in the Constitution Amendment Bill in this session to enable the referendum to be held in the autumn.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am going on the premise that these amendments will be passed and, if they are, there is no reason why people of 18 should not participate in these elections. It would not be outside the bounds of possibility to invite these people of 18 years to apply forthwith to the County Registrar for a vote and get themselves on the supplemental register if the Parliamentary Secretary is serious.  The more I hear of the arguments on the other side of the House the more convinced I am that the Government are not sincere about giving votes at 18.  They were not convincing in 1965 and they have not done anything since.  They deprived those of 18 of votes in the 1969 election. They deprived them of votes in all the by-elections.  They deprived them of votes in the 1968 referendum.  They deprived them of votes in the referendum earlier this year.</P>
      <P>I believe this is a deathbed repentance by this Government.  I do not believe they are really serious.  If they were serious this is the place and now is the time to state that they are giving votes as of now to people of 18 years in local elections and that, subject only to the say of the people, they will give them votes in the June elections.  If the Minister for Justice were sitting where the Parliamentary Secretary is sitting now and he believed, as the Parliamentary Secretary says he believes, in giving votes at 18, then the Minister for Justice would accept this amendment because he has given evidence here of that sort of thinking in the past month. I do not accept&mdash;I regret to have to say this&mdash;the genuineness of the Government in this matter.  There is no use trying to confuse the issue or to say that the referendum on national elections has some bearing on local elections because it has not.  If you want to carry this argument to its logical conclusion you could argue that local elections are something less important than national elections and have been so treated by the Constitution because the Constitution did not deal with them : it left them to the elected representatives of the people to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use trying to confuse <Col N="2059" /> the issue by saying that votes in a national election have something to do with this.  As Members of the Labour Party have said, the Government were given an opportunity earlier this year and, I think, in time, to have these people on the register of electors in April last if they chose to avail of the opportunity.  But they came here and voted down that proposal by voting against a private Bill introduced by the Labour Party to give votes at 18.  How can the people accept the Parliamentary Secretary as being really sincere and genuine?  Either he is not serious or genuine about it or it is the case that because they introduced the Bill it would be a blow to their prestige if they accepted an amendment.  I am glad to say that the Minister for Justice seems to think otherwise and that when he brings in a Bill here he believes it is not beyond amendment and he will accept amendments. Apparently the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government is either not enthusiastic about votes at 18 or he belongs to the old school which says that once a Bill is introduced it cannot be altered one iota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Section 57 of the Local Government Act, 1941, is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 57 of the Local Government Act, 1941, reads:</P>
      <P>Where, at the expiration of any local financial year, any rate made by a local authority in respect of that year is unpaid, to the extent of an amount either equal to the whole or part of such rate or would be unpaid to that extent but for the fact that such amount has been advanced and paid to such local authority by a rate collector, the following provisions shall apply and have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) if the person liable to pay such amount to such local authority or such rate collector (as the case may be) is a member of any local authority at the expiration of such financial year, he shall be disqualified from continuing to be such member,</P>
      <P>(b) such person shall be disqualified from being elected or chosen to be a member of any local authority until he has paid the whole of such amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In seeking to have this section deleted we are not condoning the non-payment of rates.  Indeed, public representatives should be the first to give good example in the matter of providing the finances for the maintenance of the essential services of their local community. There is not, therefore, inherent in our proposal any suggestion <Col N="2063" /> of a let-out for public representatives in that regard.  The amendment is designed to ensure that members of local authorities would not be disqualified from membership without just cause, would not be disqualified except for very grave and compelling reasons.</P>
    <P>In this instance, I understand that if a member of a local authority has not paid his full rate demand within the period prescribed, by the end of the appropriate financial year, he is automatically disqualified.  We believe that this is a penal clause.  There may well be good and compelling reasons why one was unable to pay the rate demand. It may well be that one entrusted&mdash;a member of one's family, one's agent or one's solicitor&mdash;with that responsibility did not fulfil it without one's knowledge. It may be due to illness or adversity or any other good reason. It may well be that the rate demand was not supplied to the aggrieved person. We are merely asking the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government to concede to representatives of local authorities the same privilege as other citizens in our society have in regard to the payment of their rates, that they would be given adequate warning and a reasonable opportunity of paying.  I am concerned here about the public representative who, through no fault of his own, has not met his financial commitments within the prescribed time.</P>
    <P>It is admittedly very difficult to be elected to public life.  Much confidence is reposed in those of us who attain to such positions, and we feel it is wrong that any Minister, county manager or other public official, should have the right to take action against him because he has not paid on the nail; indeed, if he comes along with the full payment an hour later than the time prescribed he will be disqualified.  I understand from my colleagues that there is evidence to show that some representatives have been so disqualified by reason of simply being late in the presentation of the cheque for the amount of money due.  This is a situation in which a public representative could be discriminated against and could be served for ulterior motives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2064" /> We have already acknowledged that a bankrupt may now continue in public life.  There is an amendment in this Bill to ensure that those unfortunate people in public life who are obliged to avail of home assistance are safeguarded and may continue in public life.  We are concerned about what I consider to be automatic disqualification without any consideration. This seems to me to be harsh and unjust.  There are instances, too, where many people pay their rates when they are afforded the opportunity of doing so and, depending on the nature of the business, this may involve the disposal or sale of goods, crops or animal stock, particularly in rural Ireland.  The rates are paid on that basis annually and county managers and rate collectors are aware of this.</P>
    <P>There is no right of appeal, as far as I know.  If you are late you are late; you are disqualified and you lose your public office.  There comes with that virtual disgrace and, I might say, political ruin, and it is very difficult to make a comeback in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>This amendment may not be the most appropriate device to achieve the aims I have in mind, and I hope I have made these aims reasonably clear to the Parliamentary Secretary.  However, it was the best advice we could secure in relation to the appropriate Act.  If there is any other way that the Parliamentary Secretary can come to our rescue in this matter, I should be grateful for it.  If either himself or his Minister or the county manager or, indeed, the members of the local authority could be given some discretion in this matter, it would be welcome&mdash; some discretion in dealing with a situation of this kind where a man is disqualified from continuing in public life through no fault of his own in respect of the non-payment of rates. That is the only reason why we thought in terms of deleting the section. If there is another way in which the Parliamentary Secretary can meet our wishes I would be grateful so that in the event of such a thing happening&mdash; there have been many cases in the past &mdash;it will be dealt with on a realistic and humane basis and in an understanding fashion, as has been done in <Col N="2065" /> respect of a bankrupt who got into difficulties through no fault of his own, or the public representative who got into difficulties and had to avail of home assistance.</P>
    <P>These are the sentiments I wish to express at this time.  I hope some <i>modus operandi</i> may be found to implement our wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly appreciate what is in the mind of the Deputy and the others who have put down the amendment.  It is an effort, first of all, to widen the choice of the people and, secondly, to prevent a person being penalised for various reasons. As the Deputy has said, the Bill has provision to cover cases of bankrupts and persons in receipt of public assistance. The category mentioned in the amendment is slightly different.  In the case of persons elected to a local authority charged with the expenditure of large sums of money and with the duty of collecting rates as part of the revenue of the local authority in order to enable the work for which the authority was elected to be carried out, it would be wrong that he should set a bad example by not contributing his just share to the smooth running of the local authority.  There can be cases such as the Deputy has mentioned where the person is not able to pay rates but most local authorities operate a waiver of rates system and if the person can show to the local authority that he is in the same boat as others who are getting the advantage of waiver of rates, he would not be debarred from continuing as a member of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point mentioned by the Deputy was that he could inadvertently forget to send in his rates or that the rate collector could forget to make the demand in time and that the person is vulnerable in these circumstances.  I know from my experience as a member of the Donegal County Council that the county manager or one of the officials would certainly bring it to the notice of an elected member that he was in arrears with his rates.  I do not know how this is done but it is certainly brought to the notice of the person concerned, either directly or indirectly. <Col N="2066" /> The local authority ensures that the person who is in danger of being expelled or of losing his seat is well and truly warned in advance and given an opportunity to put the matter right if it is his intention to do so. Most local authorities do that and they should be encouraged to do it.</P>
    <P>There is legislation under consideration to up-date and consolidate the law relating to qualifications for membership of the Oireachtas and membership of local authorities.  It is a consolidation Bill dealing with disqualifications as they exist at the moment.  I would suggest that it might be better to try to deal with this matter, if the House felt it were desirable to do anything about it, when that Bill is before the House.  I would suggest that the Deputy might consider that.</P>

If a councillor were to become ill and be liable for heavy medical expenses, he would have to fall into a special subsection before he would take a lot waiver of rates and it would take a lot of time.  Deputy Treacy suggests leniency when the demand is due, provision whereby he could go over the due date.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that the position now is that a bankrupt who may owe thousands of pounds to the citizens of the country and to the Inspector of Taxes and various other people can still remain a member of a local authority provided only that he pays his rates in full and prefers the council to all his other creditors.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that that is the position, that a member of a local authority may become a bankrupt and owe endless thousands of pounds and still remain a member of the council provided that he pays his rates <Col N="2068" /> in full?

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On Second Reading I spoke against the provision to remove the bankruptcy disqualification in respect of members of local authorities.  I still think it is unwise to declare that a bankrupt shall be a fit and proper person to sit on a local authority and vote on decisions regarding the striking of a rate and the sale and purchase of property.  The argument has been put forward that if the people want to select him they should be entitled to select him.  There is a certain amount of force in that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person could have been elected <Col N="2069" /> to a local authority in 1967&mdash;I think the last local elections were held then. He might have appeared to the electorate to be a solvent and perfectly responsible citizen.  A year afterwards he might have defaulted and not met his liabilities and he might have been declared a bankrupt.  If the present proposal had been the law then, he would have continued to be a member of the local authority to this day, notwithstanding the fact that, if the people had known he was insolvent they would not have elected him.</P>
    <P>I have serious doubts about this matter.  I do not believe it is correct that a bankrupt should be elected to a local authority.  I certainly do not believe that a man who is elected to a local authority while he is solvent, and who subsequently becomes a bankrupt, should continue to be eligible to sit on that body.  He is not eligible for membership of this House and, in my opinion, he should not be eligible for membership of a local authority.  The Parliamentary Secretary should consider this matter between now and Report Stage and he should consider it seriously between now and bringing the Bill into the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We must preserve a certain amount of balance in what we are doing.  We cannot overlook the fact that people who are elected to local authorities are charged with striking the rate and, in certain respects, they are charged with the expenditure of large sums of money.  They are charged with coming to decisions about the sale of valuable property.  That is a reserved function. The county manager cannot dispose of land without putting down a resolution and getting the approval of the council for the sale.  These are the type of things that strike me.  I do not want to be taken as a person who wants to restrict the choice of the electorate.  I do not want to be taken as a person who does not believe that there can be hard luck cases such as those outlined by Deputy Treacy in regard to the payment of rates.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that a citizen could find himself in a road accident.  He could have overlooked paying his insurance premium or he could have been using his car for a purpose other <Col N="2070" /> than that for which, it was insured.  He could find himself having judgment given against him for thousands of pounds which he did not have and, in order to get at the motor insurance bureau, it might be necessary to have him declared a bankrupt.  I understand and quite appreciate that there are such cases but those are not the sort of cases I have in mind.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the person who becomes reckless for one reason or another and, through his own reckless behaviour, finds himself a bankrupt and then presumes to sit on a local authority and discharge the serious responsibilities involved in membership of that body.  The Parliamentary Secretary should think seriously about this. Strange to say, I would put the receipt of public assistance disqualification in quite a different category.  I would not hesitate for one moment to remove that disqualification.  I have serious doubts &mdash;and I expressed them on Second Reading&mdash;about removing the bankruptcy disqualification.</P>
    <P>I know that on Second Reading Deputy Treacy spoke eloquently about men who, through no fault of their own, had become bankrupt and notwithstanding that had proved to be distinguished public representatives, men who had a big contribution to make to the debates in Parliament. I am thinking about the principle of the thing.  There might be something to be said for removing a disqualification in respect of Parliament, where you have 144 Deputies, and at the same time speak against removing disqualification in respect of membership of a small local authority where you have as few as nine members and where one vote could be vital on a particular issue.</P>
    <P>There is certainly food for thought here and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to think about it seriously between now and Report Stage or the time the Bill goes to the Seanad.  If we are to make this amendment in the law, we should do so with our eyes open and I am against the proposal to remove the bankruptcy disqualification for the reasons stated.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 3, line 4, before &ldquo;An election&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;An election of members of Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban District Council shall be held in July, 1972, and&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ask the House to avail of the introduction of this Bill to restore the city council of this city and Bray UDC.  For the purposes of my argument on this amendment it is unnecessary to go into the merits or demerits of the sealed order made by the former Minister for Local Government which dissolved Dublin City Council and Bray UDC. The merits and demerits of that matter have been gone into in this House on previous occasions, as late as yesterday, and I do not consider that they are relevant to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, Dublin Corporation and Bray UDC were dissolved in 1969 and since then the capital city has been left without a city council or a lord mayor and Bray has been deprived of an urban district council.  I believe that when a decision is made to remove an elected council, the area served by that council should not be deprived of the council for one moment longer than necessary.  I would always argue that proposition.  I believe that in the age in which we live it is simply courting trouble to deprive an area of a council, to deprive a city or a town of its elected representatives.  It is inviting street politics, unsavory protests of one type or another, and whether we like or do not like to admit it, we are living in an age in which people will express their thoughts, in <Col N="2073" /> which they will protest about things with which they disagree.</P>
    <P>I believe in the ballot box and my party have always believed in the supremacy of the ballot box.  I believe the vote is a great weapon and that citizens of this country feel they have the right to approach their local representatives about things that are troubling them, about grievances they have whether individual or communal grievances.  I believe that when a citizen goes to his local representative, puts his case and hears that case put in the local council, he feels he has let off steam and he will find it no longer necessary to pursue his protest.</P>
    <P>At the moment, this large city of nearly one milion people has no city council.  At a time when we have controversies about rents and rates, about a differential rents system, we have no city council to come between the county and city manager and the tenants.  The result is, in my opinion, that we have strikes, the witholding of rents and other things of that nature. If Dublin Corporation were in existence they would provide a forum for an exchange of views on these matters. The citizens of Dublin could lobby their city councillors; they could hand in letters of protest and in that way they would be exercising in a peaceful way what they consider to be their democratic right.  It is disastrous and not in the public interest that Dublin city should be deprived of a corporation for one moment longer than is necessary.  Now is the opportune time to restore the corporation.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the reasoning behind the dissolution of the corporation. According to the Minister for Local Government, he dissolved Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban Council because he thought the elected representatives on those bodies were not discharging their statutory functions.  If that is so, the people with whom he had fault to find were those who elected the corporation and urban council.  Who is the Minister punishing now?  On whom is he casting a reflection? It is not the elected representatives with whom he did not agree; it is the citizens of this city and the people of Bray.  He is depriving them of <Col N="2074" /> a right to replace the representatives he removed from office.  I suggest he is not entitled to do that.</P>
    <P>In the past the practice has been that when a local authority is dissolved it stands dissolved until the next local election.  Here the Minister is inviting the House to postpone the holding of local elections for the entire country, including Dublin city and Bray Urban Council.  In this way he is extending the penalty imposed on these areas by depriving them of the right to elect representatives for another year.  I do not believe this House should stand for that.  We should avail of this opportunity to ensure that local elections will be held in Dublin and in Bray next month.  There is no problem about that.  All the Parliamentary Secretary has to do is to accept my amendment and instruct the returning officer to get busy.  That will not prejudice any plans the Minister may have with regard to the re-organisation of local government.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that I do not believe we will have local elections in June, 1973, if it is to be a condition precedent to the holding of those elections that legislation to re-organise the entire local government structure is passed.  We are now entering the concluding days of this session.  The Dáil will go into recess when the programme of work outlined by the Taoiseach has been completed and probably it will not resume until the end of October.  The Local Government Bill will be lengthy and controversial; it will be gone through with a fine comb in this House and in the Seanad on all stages.  I do not know how it will be possible to deal with that and hold elections in June, 1973, either simultaneously with the presidential election or within weeks of it.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me how this can be done.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know at what stage is the drafting of legislation to re-organise local government.  Have the headings been agreed in principle by the Minister and the Government? Has the measure yet gone to the Parliamentary draftsman?  I doubt if it has been agreed to in principle by the Minister.  I imagine that the Minister <Col N="2075" /> and his Department will prepare draft headings or proposals for the re-organisation of local government administration and that they will bring it before the Government for approval. When the Government clear it, I presume it will go to the Parliamentary draftsman.  I venture to suggest we have not yet cleared stage 1 and, if this is so, there is little hope that the Parliamentary draftsman will get it before the end of this year.  Consequently, there is little hope that he will deal with the matter within 12 months.</P>
    <P>We have an example of the Landlord and Tenant Bill which was drafted by the predecessor of the Minister for Justice.  We have been told that when the present Minister came into office on that fateful day of 7th May, 1970, he did not like the look of the Bill; he thought the sections were too long and would be difficult to interpret.  He invited the Parliamentary draftsman to redraft it but we have not seen it yet.</P>
    <P>It is farcical for the Minister for Local Government to tell us he will reorganise local government by statute and have it done within the next 12 months.  I do not believe it.  Does that mean that Dublin Corporation or Bray Urban District Council will not be restored until the next local elections are held?  If that is so, if the Minister and the Government have their way, I am satisfied we will not have a city council, a lord mayor or an urban district council for Bray for the next two years at least.</P>
    <P>We would be failing in our duty if we did not do our best to ensure that the city council and Bray Urban Council will be restored now.  That is what this amendment proposes to do.  If members of the city council had defaulted, I could understand the Minister punishing them and saying that they are not yet cleansed, that they might do the same again, but that is not the position.  What we are asking here is that the citizens of this city be given an opportunity to elect a brand new city council of their own choice and that the same would apply in respect of Bray UDC.  I should like to hear any <Col N="2076" /> reason that the Parliamentary Secretary has for refusing this amendment. In the interests of this country, as a tourist centre, it is not right that the capital city should be deprived of its mayor.  It is one of the hallmarks of a city that it has a lord mayor who would be available to preside on ceremonial occasions, who would receive distinguished foreign visitors and who would be available to accept invitations abroad.  A lord mayor can be the best ambassador that a country can have so far as tourism is concerned, that is, if he is doing his job well and most of the mayors in the past have done a good job.</P>
    <P>The dissolution of the city council was a piece of viciousness on the part of the Minister and the Government. They became indignant with the council and decided to teach them a lesson.  However, it is not the 45 members of the dissolved city council that the Government are chastising or on whom they are casting a reflection.  The citizens of this city and the people of the country as a whole are being deprived by not having a city council or a first citizen.  The Government should think seriously about this point. Dublin is, perhaps, the only capital in the world that is deprived of a mayor. I could say much more at this stage but I would like to hear first what valid argument the Parliamentary Secretary can put forward for refusing to accept the amendment.  When he is replying, I should like him to distinguish between the 45 members of the dissolved city council and the 75,000 citizens of Dublin, to put them into different compartments and talk about them in a different sense.  Unless he does so, we will not be treating the amendment seriously.  I could discuss at length the rights and wrongs of dissolving the city council but that is not relevant. The point at issue is the election of another council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Our amendment, which is to add to the section a new subsection, reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this section or in any other Act, an election of members to Dublin Corporation and to Bray Urban District <Col N="2077" /> Council shall take place on such date during the month of July, 1972, as may be fixed by order of the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is more or less the same as the amendment moved by Deputy Fitzpatrick. I have always contended that Dublin City Council and Bray UDC were dissolved in a fit of pique by the then Minister for Local Government. Indeed, there may have been a much greater ulterior motive in destroying Dublin City Council which was known to comprise a minority of Fianna Fáil members and a majority of others.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the rash decision of the then Minister and the indecent haste with which the city council was abolished.  We know of many other councils and corporations throughout the country who have taken similar strong stands on the striking of rates, who refused to strike rates but there was no attempt by the Minister of the day to abolish such councils or corporations.  There were discussions, there was compromise and there were assurances given to these authorities that certain steps would be taken to cushion the impact of the rates on the community.  Certain grants were provided in order to ease the situation and as a result of the extending of the hand of friendship by the Minister of the day there was stepping back from the brink of dissolution.  However, there was no such attempt to compromise in respect of Dublin City Council.  It is wrong that the capital city should be without its mayor and council members for so long.  It is wrong in particular that one man should control the destiny of almost a million people, a man entrenched in the city hall with vast dictatorial powers and with no one to say &ldquo;yea or nay&rdquo; to him.  It is no wonder that there is this estrangement between large sections of the people of this city and its executive.  That gulf has widened in recent times.  The reason for this has been that there were no public representatives to put the views of the people to the city manager.</P>
    <P>There is now the opportunity to restore democracy to this city and to Bray also.  All the signs are there of anxiety, estrangement and protestation by various sections of the community. <Col N="2078" /> I do not wish to refer at any length to the rent strike or the evictions that have taken place except to say that this sorry state of affairs would never have reached such serious dimensions if there had existed during the past few years a Dublin City Council and a Bray Urban District Council.  Knowing the calibre of the public representatives involved who could represent the hopes, the needs, the fears and the aspirations of the people, this rift would never have taken place.</P>
    <P>We all know that democracy ordains that the voice of the people shall be heard.  Public representatives are the liaison between the people and the Executive and there will be, I fear, a worsening of relationship as long as this void is unfilled, until the corporation is restored to its full vigour.  We have in this measure an opportunity to restore the democratic process.  I do not think the situation is such that we can wait until June, 1973, or, perhaps, later to hold these elections in Dublin and Bray.  We have the opportunity now to do so and the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government should grasp it with both hands.</P>
    <P>There was undoubtedly disappointment throughout the country that the local elections were postponed and this disappointment was expressed in areas where local authorities have been operating fully, actively, enthusiastically, on behalf of their people.  There must surely be a feeling of despair among the people of Dublin and Bray that they should be without a corporation and an urban district council for a longer period.  The postponement must surely have been a great disappointment to them in particular.  We are asking now that this wrong should be redressed.  I know that the members of the Dublin Corporation of that day have been maligned for what they did. It has been said that it was their own fault, that they were responsible for their own abolition.  We have experienced scant sympathy from the Fianna Fáil benches for any excuses we put up or our claim for the restoration of these bodies.  I believe that the Labour, Fine Gael and other members of Dublin Corporation took a noble and honourable stand on that occasion.  The stand was to expose the scandal of the spiralling <Col N="2079" /> of rates and to impress on the Government the urgency and importance of doing something positive to cushion the impact of rates on the people.  It was their way of protesting in the strongest possible terms. It was the only thing they could do to bring to the notice of the Government the urgency of reform in respect of rates generally.  We all know the extent of public indignation concerning the spiralling of rates, the growing hardship that is on all our people, not merely in this city but throughout the length and breadth of the land.  We all know how much people desire a change in the rating system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and many other local authorities have taken a similar stand.  The Dublin Corporation of the day were not given the opportunity of taking a deep breath.  As soon as they made their decision the axe fell, dissolution took place, and it may well have been for the ulterior motive of smashing the effectiveness of this very excellent democratic institution on which there was a majority of members who did not conform to the diktat of the then Minister for Local Governement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2080" /> I know there are men more capable than I of speaking on this matter which appertains primarily to Dublin and Bray but I felt resentful yesterday when our very right to refer to this matter was challenged by other Deputies. From what I have heard from the Government benches on this issue in recent times, it seems to me that there is no inclination whatever on the part of the ex-members of Dublin Corporation in the Fianna Fáil Party for the restoration of this body, no anxiety, no desire, no great enthusiasm for the reconvening of that assembly or the holding of elections to give the people a say in who should represent them.  It is difficult to understand why we should have what seems to me to be an element of gloating in the downfall of Dublin Corporation and an outright intimation to us that it would not be reconvened, that we would be stymied, obstructed, in any attempt to carry out local elections for that purpose.  The gauntlet has been thrown down here this evening.</P>
    <P>We are now asking that whatever about the postponement of local elections throughout the country this capital city and Bray must not be included, the elections must take place here, the corporation restored, the mayoral office which has been referred to as one of status, dignity and importance restored. As one who was mayor of my native town, I understand the intrinsic worth of a mayor.  I understand the continuity of the mayoral office and the great historical pride involved.  It will be a matter of wonderment to future generations that in these years there was no mayor of this city, there were no aldermen, there were no councillors, because the Minister, Caoimhghín Uasal Ó Beóláin, decided to abolish them in such disdainful fashion.  I believe the city has lost much in prestige, in the matter of local democracy and all that word implies, and I believe it has lost much in the obvious worsening situation between sections of its citizens and the Executive.  The virtual dictator in the City Hall controls in his hand the destiny of nigh on a million people. In that kind of situation where democracy is set at nought there is bound to be a worsening situation.  We have seen the evidence of that in Coolock <Col N="2081" /> when the old evil British days of eviction and terrorism were brought back again by the presence of the sheriff, the bailiff, the bums, the battering rams.  This is the extent to which the situation has deteriorated because of lack of liaison between the people and the Executive.  For these reasons we are asking that the opportunity be availed of to hold elections in this city and in Bray thereby restoring democracy to this very important part of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of Deputy Treacy about their being no Dublin City Council.  Perhaps I can speak with a little more authority on this being an ex-member of that council. In the interests of historical accuracy I should like now to go over the acts which led to the downfall of that city council.  In April or May of 1969 Dublin City Council in committee adopted the estimate.  For some years the Fine Gael Party in that council had played at brinkmanship by threatening not to strike a rate and always, at the last moment, changing their minds.  In 1969 the Labour Party played the same game of brinkmanship, hoping Fine Gael would again change their minds, and they would have a majority to adopt a rate.  On this occasion, having gone too far over the brink, and despite the efforts of the Fianna Fáil group to bring some sanity into the council, the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, by deliberate action on their part, left the Minister for Local Government of the day no option but to abolish the city council.  Deputy Treacy suggests this was done by a Fianna Fáil Minister. That is so, but might I remind him that in 1924 a Cumann na nGaedheal Minister took the same action, but not over rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not around at that time, but I have read the records. The Cumann na nGaedheal Minister abolished Dublin City Council because they would not control the number of staff.  In the fifties the Minister in the inter-Party Government threatened that, <Col N="2082" /> if the council did not strike the rate, they would be abolished.  This shows that the Minister did not in 1969 act out of pique or animosity towards the members of the council.  The Fianna Fáil group was the biggest group in the council.  They did not have a majority but they did have a sense of responsibility. It may have looked good to refuse to strike the rate to those people who find it hard to pay rates, and there are such people.</P>

      <P>I did not hear that.  In the interests of historical accuracy might I be allowed some latitude on this point?  There are precedents for the abolition of Dublin City Council and if, in the future, the Council acts in the same way, whatever Minister is in office will have to do the same thing. Dublin City Council is not legally due to be restored until 1974.  If we are to have a proper system of local government then we will have to have in the council men and women who will do their duty even though at times it may not be a pleasant duty.  I cannot agree with Deputy Treacy that there is gloating on this side of the House because we have no city council.</P>

Somehow I do not think the Opposition relish the idea of going before the people.  I have no fear of local elections.  I want to see the city council restored.  This putting down of amendments, without one word of contrition, is just so much gimmickry on the part of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  They should honour their pledge to the people and not back out in a vital decision.  We want a council which will have the courage to do the un-popular thing if that is the right thing to do.  The council should be truly representative.  In the last council Fianna Fáil had one-third of the membership.  In the next council I believe they will have a great many more.  The important thing is to elect a council which will not turn tail, for political reasons, at the first obstacle. I have no intention of supporting these amendments.

I should like to put it on the record that I wholeheartedly support this amendment.  One million people, one-third of the population of this country, are left without any local representation whatsoever because the corporation was dissolved by the Minister for Local Government in 1969.  In this city at the present time fantastic housing developments are taking place.  Many of these housing estates are local authority housing estates and straddle the border between the city and the county.  Because of this there are numerous local complications which the Minister for Local Government and his Parliamentary Secretary appear to fail to understand. One of these is the prohibiting of the serving of free meals to children who live in the city but attend a school in the county.</P>

      <P>I support fully what Deputy Fitzpatrick said earlier on, that the capital city, one of the most historic cities in the country, is without a council and without a Lord Mayor, that, as a result of there being no local authority, there is nobody present to look after the many bureaucratic complications which have developed in the areas where education, housing and other developments are taking place.  This has resulted in children being deprived of school meals.  Were Dublin Corporation in existence at the present time, I am quite sure that this problem would be solved.  The absence of a local authority has also resulted in tenants of Dublin Corporation being deprived of local authority housing grants because, although they are tenants of Dublin Corporation, they live in the Dublin county area.  This is all very complicated.  The Parliamentary Secretary failed to understand this when I mentioned it to him by way of supplementary question.  I should just like to say as regards the rents strike that has gone on, it has finally been agreed by the city manager&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the reasons why the Fine Gael Party wants the city council and lord mayor restored is that they are of the people and are elected by the people and know the views of the people.  The persons in charge of this city, the city commissioner, the city manager and the assistant city manager, very well qualified as they are, might not be as aware of the problems of the people as elected representatives would be.  I find it hard to <Col N="2092" /> see how Deputy Moore, on the one hand, can say that Dublin Corporation is very necessary and that he would be glad to see it restored and, on the other hand, will walk into the division lobby and vote against the amendment proposing that Dublin Corporation be restored in the month of July, 1972.  I happened to see a number of persons who were badly beaten&mdash;14 women and three men&mdash;arising out of an unfortunate strike which lasted for seven months.  The tenant was allowed to build up arrears of rent of £300.</P>

The fact that the cost of building a one-bedroom flat in a high rise tower in Kilbarrack costs £3,957 is an indication of the need to recall Dublin Corporation.  What elected representatives could possibly justify to the electorate a cost of £3,957 for such a flat, 10 storeys up?  That cost was given to me two weeks ago, in reply to a Parliamentary question.  You could build a house for that.  Houses have been built for that cost.  Dublin Corporation built houses for that cost. This is the figure given to me by the Minister for Local Government.</P>

The elected members of the corporation represented the citizens&mdash;one million people.  They embodied the idea of the city.  The individual who, above all others, represented the city was the Lord Mayor. We have had no lord mayor in this city for three or four years.  Of course, the real reason we have no Lord Mayor is the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party had only 17 members on Dublin Corporation out of 45.  An arrangement was made between the other two parties that they would elect the mayor in rotation.  Of course, this did not suit the Fianna Fáil Party.  What Deputy Moore was talking about a while ago was sticking out a mile.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;corporation&rdquo; has its origin in the Latin word &ldquo;corpus&rdquo;, a body.  This is the body which represents the people.  It is much more than a bunch of individuals. In a city which is growing at the rate at which the city of Dublin is growing there are many interests and communities who need to have their voices heard.  It is a great insult to the one million citizens of this city that they have been deprived for years of their traditional representatives.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the corporation was an arrogant and arbitrary act of injustice. No matter what is said from the Government benches, that is a fact. It was a tyrannical and brutal act perpetrated by a Government whose respect for democracy has never been exemplary.  They have not yet learned to honour properly the established institutions of their country.  They pay lip service to them occasionally, when it suits them.  They say that the corporation would not provide the money to pay for the social services, to pay the nurses, or to do this and that.</P>
      <P>In recent years in particular, the double-think of the Government party has been so dubious that it has led the country to a ghastly situation.  There is no better example of that than the position in Dublin.  The result is that there is grave danger to our democratic institutions.  For example, after Bloody Sunday in Derry, this was the only city in the country which was not represented at the funerals.  Of course the Government were represented and they had the occasion to themselves thus proving something they believe: that they are the only people who count.</P>

      <P>I am giving reasons and examples of how this city suffered as a result of having no Lord Mayor and burgesses.  We got an official document the other day which said that the <Col N="2096" /> Lord Mayor and burgesses of the city of Dublin did so and so.  I forget what it was about.</P>

      <P>We all got this document in our post.  It is all imagination. There is no reality.  It is a pretence and a piece of cod.  The document mentioned a non-existent Lord Mayor, alderman and burgesses.</P>
      <P>I want to come back to a very unfortunate occasion in our history recently.  This city was the only city in the country which was not represented at the funerals in Derry.  That had a serious influence on the people of the city.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will know what I am talking about.  Other cities were able to send a wreath or had their Lord Mayor or mayor present but the people of Dublin had no one to send on their behalf.  This is one example where the lack of the symbolic embodiment of the spirit of Dublin had most serious consequences and a most devastating effect.  By denigrating the people of Dublin through the abolition of the corporation, and treating the citizens of Dublin with contempt, the Government have weakened the fabric of our society.  The population of Dublin is one-third of the people in this part of the country.  The Government have, in fact, dealt a dangerous blow to democracy and democracy has been a slow growth in this country since 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fundamentally there is a most important principle at stake here, the principle on which the America colonies fought for their independence: no taxation without representation. There is no representation in this city and at the moment taxation through the rating system is the highest it has ever been.  It went up from £4 in the £ to £6 in the £ since the corporation was abolished.  In other words, it has gone up by 50 per cent in a few years. The officials who are the servants of the people carry out their work to the best of their ability, but they do not represent the citizens.  These officials and, in particular the city manager and the commissioner, decide how much <Col N="2097" /> money is to be levied on the people of the city, a most improper business. There is no use in Deputy Moore talking at length about the time when the Cumann na nGaelheal Government abolished Dublin Corporation.  At that time they abolished many other local authorities and there were serious reasons for it.</P>

The fact is&mdash; and I stand over this&mdash;that the then Minister for Health had promised that the levy for health services would not be increased and the very next year the Government broke their word. They abolished Dublin Corporation because the corporation stood up to them. What is the philosophy obtaining among those authorised by the Government to run this city?  Certainly it is not a democratic philosophy.</P>

      <P>I just want to say a few words on this.  I do not want to be repetitive on the background to the dissolution of the former city council except to say that I think it is a matter of deep regret that the council had to be abolished.  In previous discussions on this, the responsibility for that dissolution was put fairly and squarely on the shoulders of those who are now in this House advocating the holding of elections. The Fine Gael and the Labour members coalesced to bring about the dissolution of the city council.  It was a conscious decision on their part and it was an evasion of their responsibilities with regard to the health charges.  I have been a long-standing member of the council and have given many years service to the citizens of Dublin, as have many Members of this House.  A new council was elected a year prior to the dissolution of the city council and certain people were elected who might be regarded as irresponsible.  I regret the city council was dissolved.  As has been pointed out, I had the honour to be elected Lord Mayor of Dublin, following in the footsteps of many illustrious people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Byrne referred to the fact that in the last few years the city of Dublin has expanded enormously.  It is obvious <Col N="2101" /> that the areas which constitute the boundaries of the city council are completely out-of-date.  If a new council is established it must be on a wider basis and that will take time.  In the north-east area of Dublin there are more than 200,000 people; new families are coming in every week and there is a spillover into the county areas.  The Parliamentary Secretary adverted to this fact when commenting on the White Paper on local government reorganisation.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible to rush in and hold elections for the new council. It will take time, consideration and informed opinion on the structure of a new city council.  For that reason I oppose any move to have an election pending reorganisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support these two motions, both of which urge on the Government the necessity to hold the elections in Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban Council before this year is over.  I am sorry that Deputy Timmons is leaving the House; he was Lord Mayor on two occasions and he filled that high office with distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the actions of the Government three years ago, the city of Dublin has been deprived of a Lord Mayor and a council.  We all know that the officers of the council have carried out their work ably and efficiently in the meantime, but that is not the point.  The important and vital point in this matter is what has happened since then to the image of democracy in this part of Ireland, and God knows we need to fly the flag of democracy as bravely and as proudly as we can.  Many things depend on it&mdash;many things which are more important than 45 men and women meeting in the city council or more important than the presence of a Lord Mayor.  Important as all <Col N="2102" /> that is for this city, there is the more important fact that the Government of this part of Ireland in the eyes of the world, and in the eyes of the inhabitants of the North of Ireland, should not only administer democracy to the best of their ability but, to quote a cliché, should be seen to administer it.</P>
    <P>What has happened in this case?  I have served on Dublin Corporation for more than 30 years.  I have spent a great part of my life dealing with matters of local administration and local government as a member of Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation and of Dublin Corporation.  I was fortunate enough to be chosen Lord Mayor.  The year I spent as Lord Mayor was the happiest and loveliest year of my life. Nothing can ever come up to that again.  Although I was not Lord Mayor for a second time I did not mind because it was such a splendid and fine experience.  To experience the esteem in which the people of Dublin held their Lord Mayor was something that would humble one and leave one in a position where no other office or no repetition of the office of Lord Mayor could ever have the same meaning again.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Deputy Timmons who was Lord Mayor for three years in succession, was almost inaudible to us on this side of the House when he spoke a few moments ago.  However, he made an apologia, as anyone who was ever Lord Mayor must make, for the Government but there can be only an apologia.  There can be no vindication and certainly no justification for what happened.  I speak from the heart when I say that to deprive the citizens of Dublin of a city council and of a Lord Mayor was one of the greatest hurts that the Government ever inflicted on them.  The citizens of this city always loved their Lord Mayor and, God knows, down through the years there were times when they had to tolerate strange individuals in that office.  They were delighted to have a Lord Mayor to preside at various functions.  He was their first citizen and, with the exception of the President, he had precedence over everyone.  I regret to say that there were occasions on which Ministers of State attempted to filch that position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2103" /> The Lord Mayor is not concerned in any way with political matters but, yet, he represents a father figure to the people.  He is one who does not assume the role of a leader but he has great antiquity going back into the mists of time.  Long before the EEC were ever heard of we were part of Europe.  We shared the heritage of Europe and, far back, shared in the heritage of the great Roman Empire which had the wand of office of Lord Mayor.  The red robes worn by Lord Mayors are a symbol of authority.  In Dublin the office of Lord Mayor moved far beyond the position of authority.  As I have said, he represented a father figure to the almost one million citizens.  For as far back as I can remember the people of Dublin have believed that this figure could stand between them and certain dangers.  We have had very many fine Lord Mayors.  The late Alfie Byrne, for instance, was elected to office on about ten successive occasions.</P>

He can be likened to an ambassador.  The hurt that has been caused to the people of this city must be righted as soon as possible. It is nonsense to say that various <Col N="2104" /> changes must take place.  The Corporation of Dublin and the office of Lord Mayor were not abolished because the boundaries were not right. They were abolished because of a personality clash between the Minister of the day and the corporation and the Government should have been big enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Therefore, it is high time and overdue that Dublin Corporation should come back again, perhaps with all the embarrassments it brings to a Government, but that is democracy. It is a democratic body of 45 people and different from Dáil Éireann in not accepting the governmental whip and not answering to the tempo set by any Government.</P>

      <P>It is a point that has to be made and must be made. I have made a brief intervention in this debate but I could talk for a month, having spent so many years on this body and loving it so dearly. I saw what it could do for the city, notwithstanding what the officials can do.  They do a good job but they cannot do what the Corporation of Dublin has done.  In the speech of the previous Deputy who also was Lord Mayor, I see raising its rather slimy head the idea that changes must be brought about.  The abolition of the Corporation of Dublin and of the office of Lord Mayor had nothing to do with changes to be brought about.  It had to do with the ill-temper of a Minister who afterwards vented it on his own Government.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the proposers of the amendments have so indicated.  It is not necessary to put an amendment in the Bill to enable local elections to take place in Dublin and Bray.  This is possible under the 1941 Act and the Minister at any time up to five years, which is 1974, can by order cause elections to be held. It is not proposed to do this in the context or against the background of discussions, talks and proposals for the reorganisation of local government in which the city and county will be involved.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's colleague, Deputy Byrne, complained about what is happening, due to the spread and expansion of the city into the county and this point which he mentioned is one of the very good reasons why some reorganisation in local government should take place. What I am saying is that a Bill will be introduced based on the White Paper on local government reorganisation&mdash;I do not know what the contents of that Bill will be&mdash;which will put forward certain proposals to the House which may or may not be acceptable but from which will emerge at least a certain reorganisation of local government.</P>

      <P>In view of that it is not proposed to have local elections to deal specifically with these two areas where local bodies have been abolished.  Any Minister would do this. It is a pity the Fine Gael Shadow <Col N="2107" /> Minister is not here.  He would have done exactly the same thing if he were Minister.  So would the Labour Shadow Minister for Local Government.  It was done by Ministers of all parties.  A large number of local authorities have been abolished for this and other reasons.  It is nothing new.  To say that the rates in Dublin have gone up because there were no elected members of the corporation and no Lord Mayor is just not true.  Rates in every local authority have increased for various reasons.  The people demand better services and are getting them; they demand more houses and are getting them; they demand all the various other services and to have these services, which are provided in small part by the rates contribution, we must have rates and we have all over the country increases in rates.  This has happened irrespective of whether there are or are not elected councils or corporations. Take the rent strike at the moment, the NATO thing which was referred to.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into the whole background of what caused this but it was referred to by every speaker, I think.  It must be remembered that we had a situation where a rate for the ensuing year was proposed based on calculations or estimates of expenditure for the coming year and also, as far as I remember, part of that rate was required to cover over-expenditure the previous year.  In other words, we had a council who were prepared not alone to spend the money which was provided for in the rate of the previous year but who ate into next year's loaf also and then refused to strike the rate for the coming year which included estimates for <Col N="2108" /> actual expenditure and for over-expenditure the previous year.</P>

But to get back to Dublin Corporation, which it is proposed in this amendment to reinstate following a proposed election next month, the cause of the abolition was the notice they put up: &ldquo;<i>Non Serviam</i>, we will not serve, we will not do what we were elected to do&rdquo;&mdash;that is, provide for the ensuing year enough money to run the services together with any balance of unpaid debts which were left over from the previous year.

      <P>There was a public inquiry held and it was reported to the Minister from that public inquiry that the rate the members proposed to strike was not adequate.  As a result the Minister, having given a further 14 days, had to prorogue the corporation.  This is the picture.  If the people of Dublin are without that beautiful father figure Deputy Dockrell has mentioned, place the blame fairly and squarely on the grand coalition. It is a pity that father figure did not take the councillors aside and say: &ldquo;This is what is going to happen if you do not do your duty.&rdquo;  It happened before in Dublin Corporation, and not under a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

    <P>It is argued here that the abolition of the council was brought about by the Fine Gael and Labour members of the council.  When the health charge was first introduced, Deputy Ryan, Minister for Health, said it <Col N="2112" /> would cost only 2s 6d in the £.  It increased and, in 1964, we were told there would be no further increase and that it would be kept at that particular level.  But each year it went up and the Labour and Fine Gael representatives watched it going up, contrary to the Minister's promise, and eventually they decided they would vote against it because they could not possibly let it go any higher.  In the same way Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Justice, promised that the Forcible Entry Act would not be used unless people were squatting.  It was used the other day in Cromcastle against a tenant.</P>
    <P>A council acts as a buffer.  Representatives can be approached for assistance in various matters or to have grievances remedied.  Now the people have no buffer because one man makes the decisions and no one can change them.</P>
    <P>Members of the corporation are elected in the same way as Members are elected to this House.  Constituents can approach Members of this House and ask them to do something for them.  They could do the same with the members of the corporation.  There is no approach open to them now where the corporation is concerned. There is no one to meet deputations and no one to make representations. Residents' associations have now no one to approach if certain amenities are not provided.  At the moment in Dublin North-East there is a specific problem; builders got permission to build subject to leaving enough space for schools.  These builders are now asking an exorbitant price for this land. The people there have no representation on Dublin Corporation because Dublin Corporation has been abolished and they have no one to approach to solve this problem for them.  They could see the city manager but it usually takes a long time to see the city manager.  Residents' associations are anxious to get open spaces.  Here, again, it is through the decision of the manager that permission is granted but it still has to come before the council of the corporation where it will be discussed.  If he is overruled or if there is a lot of opposition, he will <Col N="2113" /> think twice before taking a decision the next time.  I can see the city manager making good decisions and making bad decisions, but when there are 45 members in the council there will be fewer bad decisions and less of a dictatorial attitude.</P>
    <P>This is the biggest city in the Thirty-two Counties and when people visit the city there is no Lord Mayor to meet them.  They are entertained by a Minister who, of course, represents the Government.  I shall not go into the question of the mayoralty because Deputy Dockrell spoke about it very eloquently, but I think the people of Dublin would like to have a Lord Mayor to meet the people, and this has gone with the abolition of the council.</P>
    <P>There are various other matters in which Deputy Moore is interested. There is pollution around our coast. The corporation officials are too busy to deal with this.  How often have Deputies who were also members of the corporation got in touch with the Department concerned and had the appropriate action taken?</P>

      <P>Reference was made to tenants' associations.  These people are looking for what might be called a negotiating licence.  They have objected to the manager not meeting them.  When there was a council there they were representative of three parties and some Independents and these associations could try to put their point across.  These points could then be put across at a council meeting, but now you either meet the manager or you meet nobody.  If there is a meeting with the manager at which certain proposals are agreed upon and if subsequently there has to be a slight variation, he has not time to meet them again.  The council member acts as a liaison between the residents and the corporation itself.  Until the council comes back, the city has no image. The officials are doing their job as <Col N="2114" /> well as they can, but there is no substitute for elected members of the council.</P>
      <P>In Northern Ireland they have a corporation.  One wonders which part of the country is for democracy.  It looks as if they have democracy there, but they have not; we have it here but we are trying to get rid of it as we go along.  When these people were put out of their houses in Cromcastle Court it is amazing the number of people who would have thought&mdash;I am not saying this happened&mdash;that the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Justice and the manager had a hand in putting them out under the Forcible Entry legislation.  Until the council is re-established this image will not disappear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the upholders of democracy, particularly people like Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick of Cavan, Deputy Mark Clinton, Deputy Seán Treacy, Deputy Maurice Dockrell, people who never condoned the irresponsible action taken by certain members of Dublin Corporation, people who always fully accepted their responsibilities, people who struck the rates for their local authority, indeed, struck the rate during that particular year, notwithstanding the fact that indications had been given that a promise was made.  If it was made to one local authority it was made to all local authorities.  All these men, whose real concern is for democracy, have spoken.  They would not condoned the irresponsible action of a group of people, members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, who neglected their duty and deprived Dublin of a city council.  On that occasion I was the one who proposed the adopting of the rate because I felt that I, with other members of my party, had a duty to strike the rate.  The members of Fine Gael and Labour had no thought for the aged people, for the recipients of home assistance, for the home helps, for medical card holders, for old age pensioners, for widows and orphans and other social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before Deputy Belton goes I want to say a word about pollution.  He spoke about pollution, but I want to <Col N="2115" /> speak about the political pollution of this city which was evident in the lifetime of that council and which is so obvious to the Members who are here today.  It is remarkable that the Fine Gael and Labour Parties have not brought a single speaker who was a member of the council at that time to defend their actions.  The reason they are not coming forward is that they know how irresponsible they were. They know the section of the community who would be hurt most if their resolution was carried.  If there was a lay-off of personnel because of the lack of finance to meet the cost of the various services there would be another story.</P>
    <P>I have absolute sympathy for Deputy Mark Clinton, Deputy Seán Treacy, Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick and Deputy Maurice Dockrell and for all the other Deputies who spoke from the Fine Gael and Labour benches because they do not know what happened at that council meeting.  They do not know what happened in committee or what happened at the party meetings of the particular groups.  The fact is that the Fine Gael and Labour hatchet men at the time were concerned about eliminating members of their own party so that they would not be an election opposition for them.  They succeeded, at the expense of the city council.  We know the type of meetings that were held, where they were held and what happened.  Certain members of the Labour Party and of the Fine Gael Party were concerned about their own members, about budding politicians in their party.  They are the people they wanted to put out of public life and they succeeded in doing that.</P>

This was typical of them.  They do one thing behind closed doors and another thing in public.  This was not the only occasion on which one decision was taken behind closed doors <Col N="2118" /> and another decision was taken in public.  We know quite well the reason.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely making the point that the reorganisation of local authorities is very important in order to ensure that we will have responsible local government, responsible local councils and that they will be brought in a realistic way into focus in the cities and in the development areas of this city, that requires largescale adjustment in order to cater for the new needs.</P>
      <P>I hope the reorganisation will take place at an early stage and so enable the Dublin electorate once again to express forcefully their opinion as to who should represent them.  I am quite certain that, when the time comes, the people will do that in no uncertain terms.  We will make the position quite clear, that it is a responsible council that is required, a council that will not endeavour to deprive the weaker section of the community of the services to which they are justly entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to congratulate all the responsible public representatives of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party who have so ably contributed here today, who, in their own local authorities, accepted their responsibilities in full and adopted the rate on every single occasion.  I hope they will not condone the irresponsible action of the political opportunists, who sought the opportunity to have the city council abolished in order to get someout of the way.  Now that that somebody is out of the way, they are quite prepared to go back.  I hope the Minister will expedite this reorganisation as far as possible and that in due course there will be a reorganised local authority in Dublin.  When that <Col N="2119" /> day comes we will have a council that will meet its responsibilities in full.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the members of Fine Gael and Labour who have spoken, who know nothing at all about the mechanics of the Dublin Corporation, because it was a peculiar set-up.  We know where meetings were held and how they were held, the pressures that were exerted right along the line.  I sympathise with them for the second-hand information they got from the people in their parties who have not shown up here today.  Not one single member of the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party who was a member of Dublin Corporation at that time has come in here to defend their irresponsible and disgraceful action in depriving Dublin of the city council, which was abolished as a result of their irresponsible and scandalous action.</P>
    <P>Once again, I would ask the Minister to ensure that when the reorganisation of the local authority takes place we will have at the earliest possible moment a council elected to Dublin city that will do justice.  I am quite certain that it will have a Fianna Fáil majority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>These two amendments give an opportunity to both Deputy Moore and Deputy Dowling to put their words into practice, to allow the corporation to be re-elected in the month of July.  The professions of their belief in local democracy will ring very hollow to the people of Dublin if they do not support the amendments.  We are calling on anybody here who believes in local democracy to vote for the return of the corporation and of the Bray Urban Council in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sentence meted out to both the Bray and Dublin councils was for five years and, apparently, there is to be no remission of that sentence by any period of time.  We are asking that the people now, in retrospect, will look at the situation and say that both of these areas have suffered enough from the lack of democracy.  Indeed, we have heard a great deal of talk about Dublin Corporation, in particular. <Col N="2120" /> This obviously is so since there are so many people in this House who are returned for the Dublin Corporation area.  There is nobody from the Bray urban area in this House so I intend to dwell a little longer on the problems confronting the people in Bray because of a lack of democracy in that area.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has been in Bray recently knows that you have the greatest difficulty in getting up or down the main street because of the chaotic situation there.  In the past two years attempts were made to provide traffic lights at one busy intersection.  Because of lack of consultation with the local people and local representatives, the lights were set up but they were never switched on.  It was quite obvious that they could not operate because of the way they were fixed. The town of Bray was held up to ridicule in a television programme because these lights which were erected at something like £2,000 were never switched on.  They were removed some time later and the chaos still remains.</P>
    <P>Last year during the height of the summer, during a particularly warm spell, raw sewage spewed up from the sewers in a street near the sea front for a full week without any action being taken.  Had there been 12 elected councillors, action would have been taken on the day the problem arose. Many people in the area make their living in the tourist industry.  Yet, the offence to eyes and nose was allowed to continue for a week, despite the protests of former public representatives and the protests of ratepayers to the Town Hall.  How could any elected councillor permit that situation to continue if he had to face an electorate?</P>
    <P>How can a man who closes the door at 5 o'clock and goes off to somewhere in County Dublin and forgets about the problems and the worries of the people of Bray have the same interest as councillors who represent the community in Bray?  Two months ago I had to protest to the Bray town clerk because one morning word was sent out that the water would be turned off in Bray for 48 hours.  Three hours notice were given that there would be <Col N="2121" /> no water in Bray for two days.  I protested that had there been a fire there would have been a serious hazard to life and property.  People had not time to fill containers.  They had not time to do the washing early in the week and make other arrangements.  In one area where there is a water problem they had to go outside the urban area altogether for water.</P>
    <P>These are the type of problems that any councillor faces every day of the week and brings to the Town Hall. Another problem is that Bray is the fastest growing town in the country. It is growing at a faster rate than parts of Dublin.  The housing situation is serious.  Overcrowding is a huge problem. Flats are commanding fantastic rents.  Yet the people are not being represented adequately.</P>
    <P>These two amendments propose that the Minister should allow local elections to be held in July.  We are sure that local elections will be held next year anyway.  There is no reason to deprive the people of Dublin and Bray of councillors for a further 12 months. In the White Paper on local government reorganisation, if it is carried through in its present form, it is intended to abolish the two urban councils in Wicklow which are working to reinstate the council which is not operating.  We are faced with a ridiculous situation in County Wicklow. Even if we get back the Bray Urban Council the two other councils will probably be abolished.  Let us at least have the Bray Urban Council back before the other two are abolished.</P>
    <P>In the amendments we ask for the elections in July.  People who mentioned the history of Dublin Corporation, which has absolutely nothing to do with these amendments, and who profess to believe in democracy, are once again getting an opportunity to put their profession of belief in democracy into effect.  If the Parliamentary Secretary persists in not allowing the elections to be held in July, he is doing a grave disservice to the people of this city and also to the people of Bray.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had great sympathy for the obvious embarrassment of the Parliamentary Secretary here this evening. <Col N="2122" /> One could sense it when he tried to explain away or talk away the Minister's attitude to this whole problem. The history of the abolition of the corporation has been gone over and over.  The Ceann Comhairle has rightly said that it is really quite irrelevant to the amendments.  They are not concerned with history but with the present time and with the serious situation that has existed for far too long.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to restate the fact that the members at the corporation at the time were driven to take the action they took because of the frustration they felt.  They saw the transfer of more and more taxation onto the backs of the ratepayers.  They were fighting this helplessly, and getting no results.  They were not being listened to and they felt they had to sacrifice themselves in order to focus full attention on the situation which they opposed so strongly and so helplessly, unfortunately.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has stated rightly that the Minister has the power to right the situation, but he is not doing it.  Why?  Because the Government are not interested in democracy. They are interested in dictatorship. That is why they are not exercising the power and authority they have to cause the elections to be held at any time between this and 1974.  When will the members of the corporation&mdash;if they say they have done wrong&mdash;have purged themselves of their guilt in the eyes of the Government?  Surely it is not a capital sin to try to make a case for overburdened ratepayers, which they were trying to do at the time.  They were also trying to make a case, for a more equitable distribution of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;They have not yet purged themselves.  We have the power to do it and we will keep them out.&rdquo;  He said there was no point in bringing back the corporation while the White Paper on the reorganisation of local government was being prepared. If there was ever a time to ensure that we had a corporation surely it was when drastic changes in local government were being contemplated &mdash;the most drastic changes that have even been thought of in the history of this country, changes with which most <Col N="2123" /> of us who have been in local government for a long number of years oppose very strongly.</P>
    <P>As far as one can gather, the idea is to draw a big circle around Dublin city and county and to have people representing a segment of that area from the centre to the perimeter.  It is crazy.  The elected representatives are not to be allowed to have any say in this and the Minister knows that if they were allowed it would never happen. They want simply to have a yes man representing the corporation instead of the 45 members who had a voice, who could express the opinions of the people strongly.  They know there would be opposition created through the views of the people being expressed by those representatives.</P>
    <P>But the Government are not interested in democracy.  They could not care less about the concerns of the people.  They talk freely about the devolution of authority and we have had the Minister for Health talking about this devolution of authority.  All the provisions in the 1970 Health Act, now fully explained, indicate a concentration of more and more power in the Government and in bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>This is a deplorable time in which to have the citizens of Dublin not represented by elected representatives. There was nothing whatever, as the Parliamentary Secretary admits, to prohibit the Government from having an election at any time from the date on which the corporation were abolished, but in the Government's eyes the citizens have not yet purged themselves. If the Government are afraid to face the electorate&mdash;it is quite obvious they do not want an election of any description, national or local&mdash; I have suggested in the House a means by which the citizens of Dublin could have a sort of representation without an election.  I have suggested that instead of one commissioner the Minister would put in 45 commissioners&mdash; let the 45 members back into their seats and let them talk for the citizens. If he can employ one commissioner, surely he could employ 45.</P>
    <P>Various population figures have been mentioned but it cannot be contradicted <Col N="2124" /> that at the moment there is no local government for a quarter of the Irish people.  There has not been since 1969 in an area where there is more rapid development than in any other area in the country, because of enormous planning changes and because of transportation studies, all carried out by bureaucrats without the possibility of any comment from elected representatives of the people.  There was never a time when it was more important to have the citizens of Dublin represented by those elected to speak for them. Of course, if that situation obtained the Government could not carry on their dictatorship, their bureaucracy. They could not any longer carry on telling the people what they think is good for them, in spite of the people.</P>
    <P>Since I came into the Dáil I have represented quite large slices of Dublin city.  I represented Ballyfermot for eight years and I now have the honour to represent a large area of Ballymun.  For as long as I have been in public life I have never known the housing situation to be worse.  You write to the corporation about a case of six people living in one room and you will be lucky if you get a reply in two or three months telling you that there are larger families due for consideration and that the case you represented may be considered at some future time.  It is a deplorable situation and is it any wonder that we have violence starting throughout this city and undemocratic movements getting up all over the place?  When people see there is no fair play or any democratic way for them to have their grievances aired and attended to&mdash;that they are simply being sat on by bureaucrats who have not to face them&mdash;the people are driven into acts they would never otherwise contemplate.  There is frustration and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates this.</P>
    <P>It beats me how in the face of what amounts to lawlessness the Government cannot see the wisdom of bringing back into existence democratic representation for those people.  One had only to listen to Deputy Maurice Dockrell, one of the finest Lord Mayors the city has had, to appreciate the sincerity with which the people of <Col N="2125" /> Dublin whom he represents feel this loss of democratic representation, and the embarrassment they feel at having no lord mayor to speak for and to represent their city.  It must also be an embarrassment to the Department of Foreign Affairs and to the Government when other cities get in touch with them and ask to have the lord mayor visit them on some occasion or another.</P>
    <P>No good or sound explanation can be offered.  That is obvious because when Fianna Fáil speakers rise in the House they have nothing to fall back on but a history of squabble in which they took part.  They cannot make any case why the corporation should be kept out of existence.  They have made the foolish statement that there is no point in bringing them back as long as this serious White Paper is under consideration.  If they wanted to they could not make a better case for bringing back the corporation.</P>
    <P>I do not know how those Deputies can go out and face the people in the constituencies they represent and tell them: &ldquo;We voted and argued against amendments the effect of which would be to bring back the corporation in July.&rdquo;  What will the news media have to say who condemned this from the start and who always wanted the people to be represented democratically? They will expose those public representatives for what they are, people who will back the Government regardless, who will troop into the lobby even though they know they have a responsibility to their people.</P>
    <P>I have never listened to more irresponsible utterances than those by Deputies Dowling and Moore, the latter a former lord mayor, and Timmons. They came in here to say they will vote against these amendments because they think the corporation should not be brought back into existence now, because they can see no case for it.  Their reason is, of course, that they cannot contemplate the Government carrying out their dictatorial activities, telling the people what is good for them in the matter of reorganising local government in the region, if the corporation were in existence.  How they can come <Col N="2126" /> here and say it and face the people afterwards beats me.</P>
    <P>That is the deplorable situation that exists and that is what is driving the people of this city to resort to what amounts to lawlessness in an attempt to get justice for the people from the Government.  It is because of these injustices that they act in this manner. We would not have trouble about rents if there were reasonable, democratically elected members who would talk to the people.  On one occasion I went to a meeting in an area I represent and I was appalled that people did not know about their entitlements.  There was a breakdown in public relations and there was no contact with the City Hall.  It was only a question of talking to them for an hour and convincing them that there was another way out besides parading and upsetting others.  This would not have arisen if the people had local representatives doing their job for them.</P>
    <P>There are irresponsible Fianna Fáil Deputies who say that they do not want a city council, that the city can do without a council until the Minister for Local Government decides that the council that was in existence have purged themselves of the great guilt of fighting against local taxation.  It is the attitude of these irresponsible people that the citizens of Dublin cannot be trusted to elect the right people and that is a dreadful thing to say to the citizens.  It is a horrible thing for a public representative to say this in an effort to make a case against these two reasonable amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton made the case that at the moment a commissioner and a city manager are doing the entire job of the city council and that millions of pounds are being spent in the name of the citizens.  The Deputy said that the Minister for Local Government can sack either of these men and the remark was made that this would not be any trouble for a Fianna Fáil Minister&mdash; in fact, one succeeded in sacking himself. The people who are acting are under the Minister's thumb and they recognise that fact.  They are not speaking on behalf of the citizens, there is <Col N="2127" /> nobody to come between the citizens and the bureaucrats, and this is a serious situation.</P>
    <P>As a local representative for many years, I have had the experience of intervening between officials in the local authority and citizens who were deprived of services.  Sometimes it was due to misunderstanding, carelessness or inefficiency but a public representative had the right to intervene.  It is the job of a public representative to know about local matters; very often people are unable to make a case for themselves but they can explain their grievances to the public representative. Citizens cannot get to the people in the local authorities; this drives them to acts of lawlessness and it is a major factor in a situation which is getting ugly in Dublin city.  It is a situation about which the Minister for Local Government should be concerned and anxious to rectify at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had that opportunity since 1969.  The Parliamentary Secretary admits he can take this action at any time he likes but he will not because there are major changes which the Government wish to make in a dictatorial fashion without consulting the people.  It suits the Government not to have public representatives in the Dublin city area in order that they may impose their will on the people, as they have done in so many instances.</P>

      <P>In this matter a couple of points come to mind.  First, of the number who were members of the corporation and who abolished themselves, some of them subsequently offered themselves for election by the people of Dublin and they were defeated in a general election.  It is <Col N="2128" /> no coincidence that the corporation abolished themselves on 6th June and a general election was held on 18th June.  Were the two parties opposite playing party politics with the welfare and well-being of the citizens of this city?  Is this a logical conclusion to draw from the action they took?  They took this action after a public inquiry was held, an inquiry which advised the Minister that the rate struck was inadequate; such an inquiry would have advised any Minister for Local Government in any other country on the same lines.  The Deputies opposite are complaining about the services provided under a rate with which they violently disagreed and which they say would not be the rate for the city if the members of the corporation were in action.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton has suggested the appointment of 45 ex-councillors as commissioners without any statement from them that they would or would not operate under the present rate. If they would not operate under the present rate, would they reduce it?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> One would not know what some of the Deputies on that side of the House would expect.  In moving this amendment before 6 o'clock this evening I pointed out that in my opinion the cause of the making of the sealed order to dissolve Dublin Corporation was not relevant.  I admitted that we could have had a very interesting discussion on that and that I was convinced that if we had such discussion, this side of the House would come out on top.  I pointed out that for the purposes of this amendment, the causes which led to the abolition of the corporation and of Bray UDC are not relevant.  Since then we have had a couple of contributions from the Parliamentary Secretary and we have had contributions from a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies who represent Dublin city.  Every one of these contributions took the form of an inquest into the cause of the sealed order.  There was no attempt by any of these people to justify the attitude of the Government in continuing to deprive the citizens of Dublin of their council and their Lord Mayor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an amendment which <Col N="2131" /> seeks to condemn the then Minister for Local Government for having abolished the corporation.  It is not an amendment which seeks to justify the members of a dissolved council in refusing to strike the rate.  It is an amendment which calls on the Government to restore Dublin Corporation and Bray UDC so that this capital city can have a city council and a lord mayor whereby in this age of protest, of street politics, of violence and at this time when people are only too anxious to take to the streets to put across their views, we may have in this city a safety valve in the form of a corporation at meetings of which the duly elected representatives of the citizens can speak and be reported in the mass media so as to ensure that the citizens in general and the younger generation in particular will not be forced into acts of violence in order to get across their point.  This is not an amendment to restore the 45 members who were sacked by the Minister although the Parliamentary Secretary was very keen to grasp at that straw. This is an amendment which seeks to give to the citizens of Dublin and Bray the right to elect members of their own choice whom they think are best fitted to represent them.  What is wrong with that?  From listening to the contributions of the Parliamentary Secretary and of the Fianna Fáil Deputies one would think that, by continuing to deprive this city of a representative body and a ceremonial head, in some way the 45 members who were sacked were being punished or chastised.  Such is not the case.</P>
    <P>It is the three-quarters of a million citizens, or thereabouts, of this city whom he is punishing.  There is far too much of this attitude in the debate that has gone on here, that these people misbehaved themselves and must be punished.  You are not punishing them; you are not casting a reflection on them; but you are saying to the citizens of this city that you do not trust them to elect a council.  I am convinced that this debate spells out one message clearly, that is, that the Fianna Fáil representatives in this House have no confidence in their <Col N="2132" /> capacity to get the majority of the citizens of Dublin city to vote in their favour.  That message is spelled out clearly and beyond any doubt because if they had that confidence in themselves or in their party they would hold the elections now.  On radio on one occasion the Parliamentary Secretary opened the bag&mdash;I do not know whether he let the cat out&mdash;when he said that one of the reasons for postponing the local elections was that a reorganisation of local government was necessary, that the boundaries had to be arranged and that sort of thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;I admit that he mended his hand but the cat let a squeak out&mdash;it nearly got out.  Is that what Deputy Timmons means when he says he wants a responsible council, that he wants local government reorganised so that we may get a proper council?  Is that another name for gerrymandering this city into certain wards which Fianna Fáil think will suit them to get a majority on the corporation which they have not enjoyed since the foundation of the State, I believe.  We hear enough talk in this House, and especially from the Fianna Fáil side, deprecating the lack of democracy in Northern Ireland and we have a lot of bellyaching, of double talk and double thinking from the Fianna Fáil benches about this.  What sort of an example is it to the rest of the country to abolish two important elected bodies here and take no steps to replace them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary rightly says that neither of these amendments is necessary and we admit that they are not necessary.  If the Minister were prepared to discharge his duties, to act in <Col N="2133" /> a democratic manner, he could at any time since he made the sealed order in June, 1969, have held elections by making another order.  He must do it in five years, not later than 1974, but if somebody on the Gallery were to listen to Deputy Moore today, he would think that 1974 was the earliest it could be done.  It is the latest.</P>

I agree that these amendments would not be necessary if the Government were to behave reasonably and hold the elections.  We are drifting, as I have said on previous occasions, dangerously towards bureaucracy in this country and I believe that this Government lean towards democracy. They talk in terms of community councils.  The Minister yesterday suggested that I did not believe in community councils.  They talk democracy, but given every opportunity, they act in a bureaucratic manner and against the principles of democracy.  I want to bring this debate back to reality if I can and to bring the House back to the substance of these amendments.  I did not open up and inquest on the abolition of the corporation or the urban council of Bray.  I repeat that it is not necessary.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> There is one party in this House who should keep away from history, the Fianna Fáil Party, because we could go back and have a discussion on the British market being gone and gone forever and about every ship being blasted to the bottom of the sea.  If you want that sort of discussion, you can have it, but I want any speakers who speak from the Fianna Fáil benches before the debate concludes to put the arguments against restoring the city council, giving this city its ceremonial head, a lord mayor, and restoring the urban district council of <Col N="2134" /> Bray and doing that now.  What is the argument against that?  I have not heard it.  The proposal is not to restore the 45 members with whom the former Minister for Local Government disagreed. The proposal is to give the citizens of this city their democratic right to elect freely a council of 45 members who will elect from among their number a lord mayor so that the citizens of the city will have somebody to stand between them and the establishment, to stand between them and the Custom House, because I have always believed that if local democracy as we understand it is to work, it can work only if you have a smooth operation between the Custom House, the city manager and the elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What have we here now?  We have the Custom House on the top; we have the city manager in the centre; and we have the Custom House on the bottom, replacing the corporation, because the commissioner appointed by the Minister is a man who has served in the Custom House practically all his life, a man who has been secretary of the Department of Local Government for many years and a man who can only see the working of local government through Custom House eyes.  That is not good for the administration of this city, but that is what we have and that is the situation which this amendment proposes to remedy.  I venture to suggest that if local elections were being held this year, the citizens would have been allowed to elect a new corporation and it is because the local elections are being postponed that I think this amendment should be accepted and that the Minister should proceed to hold elections for the city of Dublin and Bray Urban Council.  I concede that the amendment is not necessary and if I get an asurance from the Minister, through his Parliamentary Secretary, that he will proceed to hold elections in this city and for Bray Urban District Council next month or early in August, I will withdraw the amendment because I will then have achieved what I set out to achieve, the restoration of local democracy in Dublin and Bray. It must be extraordinary for Americans and Europeans to come here and find out that in this city of Dublin we have <Col N="2135" /> no lord mayor.  I wonder what reasonable explanation will be given to people from the European Community when they ask: &ldquo;Why have you not got a lord mayor in Dublin?&rdquo;</P>

    <P>I want to conclude by appealing to the Fianna Fáil Deputies to make a case, if a case can be made, for continuing to deprive the citizens of this city of a city council and a lord mayor and for continuing to run the risk of driving the people on to the streets in <Col N="2137" /> order to get their message across to the Government.  That is the appalling risk we are running.  It is a risk we have run for too long because we have these explosions in the form of strikes. I know that a detailed discussion on the rent strike would be irrelevant and I do not propose to go into it, but surely there is nothing more calculated to lead to a rent strike than the absence of public representatives to discuss with the tenants the problems of the day, the major one of which at the moment is differential rents.

    <P>I know Fianna Fáil are very good at sending in here people like Deputy Dowling who can be very serious sometimes when he has a good case to make, who is a great man at raising red herrings and being amusing when he has a bad case to make.  He adopted the latter role this evening.  Deputy Moore, who is usually serious, came in here and made no effort to justify the continuance of depriving the people of this city of a city council.  Deputy <Col N="2138" /> Timmons was more eloquent yesterday when this was not on the agenda at all. I expected him to come in today and make an unanswerable case for the attitude of the Government in continuing to deprive the city of a council and a lord mayor, but we have not heard him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Byrne knows quite well that the citizens are <Col N="2140" /> not penalised.  Dublin Corporation is responsible for much more than merely the city of Dublin.  Under local government legislation Dublin Corporation performs work which applies to the whole country and not merely to the city of Dublin.  The ramifications of the administration of the city council are as important as the ramifications of any Government Department.  It is a local government department.  The functions it performs extend all over the country.  I refer to public health and so forth.  It is not fair for the Deputy to insinuate that the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party are preventing any local authority from operating. This argument demonstrates the splitting of hairs which occurs so often on the benches opposite.  You have one Deputy advocating the replacement of the commissioner by 45 corporation members and another arguing that we should have an election next month.</P>

It is no gratification to any Minister to have to take the action the then Minister for Local Government took, and he duly took the action following two inquiries into the case.  It was a matter of members elected saying in effect: &ldquo;I refuse to serve.&rdquo;  What would my constituents say if I, elected as a Member of the Dáil, said to them: &ldquo;I refuse to serve&rdquo;?  I know the summary decision the electorate would give in such a case.  My submission is that the Bill is fair enough.  The amendment seeks to do something in the Bill which in present circumstances should not be done, as there will be a time and place to accomplish the aims expressed in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I have listened to inquest after inquest here this evening on how the people of the city of Dublin were denied the right of having their voice heard.  Although I have waited here some considerable time to get in on this debate, I was glad that Deputy Fitzpatrick made some attempt to bring sense into the debate.  Despite your efforts, Sir, we have heard from the Fianna Fáil benches many a story, indeed, many a conflicting story, as to how the Dublin Corporation went out of existence.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary said earlier&mdash;and he is probably right&mdash;that these two amendments are not really necessary.  I would say they should not be necessary because the Minister has the power&mdash; he could do it in the morning at his own desk&mdash;to make an order whereby <Col N="2142" /> the people of the city of Dublin would once more be given a voice at local level.  I have listened with interest to the remarks of Deputy Carter.  I do not know for what part of the country he is elected, but I can safely say it is far removed from the city of Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is looking for any special treatment if the people of the city of Dublin are now crying out for an election and the bringing back of their local council.  I do not think they are overstepping their democratic right, after an election in 1967, to expect another in 1972.  I am quite sure that the people whom Deputy Carter represents are every bit as anxious for an election as the people of the city of Dublin, although they have less reason to look for it because they have their local authority and their local representatives.</P>
      <P>The voice of the city of Dublin has been silenced since June, 1969.  As a public representative representing an area adjacent to the city, which runs into the city, I have found ever-increasing frustration, and I believe that where this exists the ballot box can be a safety valve.  I would hate to think that the situation was allowed to deteriorate to the extent that we would learn this lesson in the city of Dublin; and I would hate to think that any words of any Member of this House would bring nearer the day when the people could no longer hold back their frustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the experience only last week of being host to quite a large body of foreign visitors.  These people were anxious to visit many worthwhile centres in this city and to meet the people whom they would expect to meet.  I was quite embarrassed when I had to tell these people that we had no lord mayor.  They had come a long way and the news had not reached their land that our lord mayor had been sacked.  I am quite sure that the Government have at times been embarrassed when invitations arrive at the Mansion House addressed to the Lord Mayor of Dublin, as undoubtedly <Col N="2143" /> happens, and there is no one to open them.  It must also be embarrassing to the Government at this time when we are entering the EEC and when we have coming to our capital city visitors from Europe.  It is embarrassing for them to find there is no city council and no lord mayor in a society that is supposed to be on the side of democracy and at a time when we should be showing a good example to our Northern brethren.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter said not a tear was shed.  I can tell him that tears were shed at my doorstep.  I am sorry that Deputy Dowling and Deputy Moore were not present to hear Deputy Carter say that because they, too, know the reaction of the people of the city of Dublin to the abolition of the corporation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has boasted recently that in his efforts to reorganise local government he has gone out of his way to meet representatives of the people.  He is forgetting about the most important and largest section that should be represented by a local authority, the citizens of Dublin, who have no local representatives to meet the Minister. Increasing numbers of citizens come to me as their public representative. If I make representations on behalf of applicants for housing or for other amenities I find that it is not unusual to have to wait three months for a reply.  I am particularly concerned in cases where I have made representations on behalf of persons working in the new industrial estate at Tallaght and who live on the other side of the city and who want a transfer of tenancy.  I have waited up to three months for a reply to these representations only to be told that there are others on the housing list in far greater need of a transfer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>How would the corporation members have dealt with that problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the corporation were in existence I am sure the problem would not be brought to me, in the first place.  The point I am making is that the citizens of Dublin have <Col N="2144" /> nowhere to turn.  Even though they have representation at national level, they believe that a member of the local authority can be of greater assistance to them, and they may be right.</P>
      <P>Local organisations, tenants associations and residents associations come to me with their problems.  I have told Deputy Carter that many a tear is shed. We are now treading on dangerous ground.  To leave a large number of persons without representation at local level for any period longer than is necessary is a dangerous thing.</P>
      <P>The suggestion made by Deputy Clinton that 45 commissioners could replace the 45 public representatives and might give a better measure of democracy is worthy of consideration. Deputy Clinton made this suggestion, not for the first time, this evening. I remember his making it a long time ago and I was surprised to hear him saying this evening that it has not been replied to by the Government.</P>
      <P>I do not think the citizens are looking for 45 commissioners; I believe they are looking for 45 councillors and they do not have to be members of the Dublin City Council that was abolished by the former Minister for Local Government.  All that is asked for in the amendments is that local elections be held.  Any democratic party worthy of the name should not be afraid to face the electorate and to allow them their democratic right to elect a new city council.</P>

When Deputy McMahon commenced to speak I thought he was making the case for the restoration of Dublin Corporation.  In his concluding remarks he made a new proposition, that there should be a local election.  If there is any merit in either suggestion it is in the suggestion that the people of Dublin should be given an opportunity to elect a new council.</P>

In short, he told me that the Fine Gael members of the corporation that does not exist did not accept the invitation of the city manager at the point of dissolution to every one of us to continue to make representations, to continue to enjoy the rights he would give us in the matter of negotiating on behalf of our constituents.  I would say, and I am sure this can be said for other former councillors, that apart from the fact that I do not attend meetings I continue to be as active in local matters <Col N="2151" /> as I was when the corporation were in existence.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to make is that any councillor who is anxious for work is entitled to operate as diligently and with the same industry as he did when the corporation were in existence and it is only an excuse to say differently. As far as I am concerned it is a lie to say that apart from disability to express himself at public meetings any former member of the corporation is in any way stopped or inhibited from working on behalf of his constituents in local matters.</P>
      <P>I am hoping that when Deputy Clinton speaks again he will be able to convince me that if we were to have a local election tomorrow, confined to the city of Dublin, we would be able to generate sufficient interest and enthusiasm in it to bring to the polls a sufficient number of people to elect a representative Dublin Corporation. If the election were to be held and the circumstances were accepted that Fianna Fáil have a better organisation, perhaps, than other political parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is probably already aware, this matter deals with the lack of harbour and anchorage facilities in the small fishing port in the most northerly part of this country, namely, Glengad or Portaleen. Approximately 100 families derive their livelihood directly or indirectly from fishing.  Because of the lack of facilities many of the boats have been smashed at anchorage and it is difficult to know how these people have maintained their fishing tradition.  During the years they have made many efforts to try to get the governments of this country to do a job for them so that they could continue in the fishing industry and encourage their families to remain in the industry also, with the hope of some security and prosperity in this remote part of the coast.</P>
      <P>My earliest recollection in public life regarding this matter goes back to the early fifties.  At that time, through the operations of the Donegal County Council, we tried to secure a grantaided scheme that would do justice to the needs of the people.  We succeeded to the extent that there was a full-scale survey and research carried out into the problem.  As the marine section of the Office of Public Works saw the matter, it would cost approximately £400,000 and even then they were not prepared to guarantee that such a job would stand up to the very heavy seas with the north-easterly gales to which the port is exposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time we had the good fortune to have in the county council a county engineer who was most concerned with and who took a personal interest in the case.  With his knowledge and wisdom, and as a result of the information obtained from the research carried out by the marine section of the Office of Public Works, the county engineer put forward an alternative which would cost much less money and which would <Col N="2154" /> guarantee to safeguard the boats at anchorage in Glengad port.  It was a simple formula and one which has been operated in many other parts of the world and in several parts of this country; it was the creation of a basin with lock gates into which the boats would be put.  When the gates were closed the boats would be safe regardless of the storm outside.</P>
    <P>This matter was pursued by the experts in the marine section but they had their way and nothing was done.  In their view&mdash;and I am not blaming them on this matter&mdash;the great danger was that in a storm if all the boats except one were safely at anchorage, if the fishermen opened the gates to let in the last boat the boats inside would be smashed.  During the years since then we have continually argued that the fishermen are nobody's fools in so far as handling their craft is concerned. The north-easterly gales do considerable damage along this coast and they make it impossible to approach the tiny slipway in the port and indeed, would make it impossible to approach the basin that might be created.  The idea that the fishermen would open the gates to allow in the foolhardy fisherman who would approach the coast in a storm was never on.  It could not be got across to the Department that this would not happen unless there was insanity in the fishermen on shore and greater insanity in the man who was approaching the coast.</P>
    <P>Because of this argument we did not get anywhere with the matter for many years.  I should add that no boat approaches Glengad if there is a north-easterly gale; the boats head for Lough Foyle or Lough Swilly.  They run before the storm on either side of Malin Head.  There is no question that they would ever get the mad idea of trying to get in at Glengad; in fact, it is a physical impossibility because they would be smashed to pieces a considerable distance from the shore.</P>
    <P>We tried to get this point across. Perhaps if we had had a sympathetic outlook from the Department from the early fifties to the sixties we would have got them to see that this was not a valid argument against the only feasible, safe anchorage that could be <Col N="2155" /> created on this stretch of coast.  When I was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries I renewed my efforts regarding this matter.  I did not do this lightly or without due consideration. I did it after the fullest investigation and discussion with the technical people not only in the Department but also with the marine section of the Office of Public Works and with the best engineers they have got there.  I might add that they have exceedingly good engineers.</P>
    <P>A coastal survey had been carried out over a number of years.  I was enabled with the permission of the Government in June, 1968, to announce, among other small harbour improvements, the construction of an anchorage basin at Glengad for the benefit of the fishermen.  This was the decision and it was not taken by me alone.  It was taken with the knowledge and consent of the assembled Government and announced in the House by me.  There can be no denying that this commitment was made; there can be no justification for any suggestion or innuendo that the promise in this regard was made by me as an individual, without any thought, or consultation, or without anything to back it up.</P>
    <P>In the event, the result has been that nothing was done in Glengad until recently.  In the meantime, the promise made in 1968 has been raised time and again, not only by me in this House but by the interested people in Glengad who have made approaches to the Department. The outcome of these approaches has been that they were finally received in a deputation.  I did not know of the deputation until after the meeting had taken place.  As a result of that deputation we were given to understand that a new concept had been put forward with which the fishermen were in agreement.  The new idea was that there would be a widening, a raising and an extension out to sea to the north-east of the existing slip but with no effort whatever being made to provide facilities for the safeguarding of any of the craft that might be at anchorage in heavy weather.  No shelter whatever is being contemplated and the general impression seems to be that <Col N="2156" /> this is a place where one can do nothing.  I refute that idea.  I refute also the spending of money as it is now proposed to spend it.</P>
    <P>In all sincerity I say to the Minister that, whatever impression he may have got during the discussions with the deputation, on leaving the discussions they understood that they had two choices: (1) that nothing would be done or (2) that they agree to the Minister's proposals.  The advice was to put the jetty further out to sea.  The fishermen were faced with Hobson's choice.  Not only will the money being spent there be wasted but its spending may result in tragedy because my information from the local fishermen is that the work being carried out may cause danger instead of improving the anchorage facilities.  It is not merely the question of landing in fair weather that is at issue in this case.  It is a question of where the fishermen can anchor their boats safely in the knowledge that the boats will be there when they return for them.  That is why the basin is necessary.  At the discussions that took place we emphasised the risk of the basin being opened at a time when it would be full of boats in order to allow in latecomers.  To open the basin at such a time could never be a reality.</P>
    <P>The cost for a deep water inside basin was estimated at £72,000.  That is not a huge amount when one has regard to the fact that almost 100 families in the area derive their livelihood from fishing, families who by their persistence down through the years have shown that fishing is and must be their way of life.  So determined are these families to derive their livelihood from the sea that in the 1950's they started something which is now acclaimed throughout the country.  I refer to a housing project started by them for the purpose of replacing the hovels that many of them were then living in.  With the active co-operation of the vocational education committee's manual instructors in those days and with the aid of now deceased colleagues on that committee who provided the materials on credit, the houses were built.  These people were the initiators of what are now known as the building construction <Col N="2157" /> courses in the vocational system in all rural parts of this country. Surely if people are prepared to help themselves in that way and if they were prepared to accept the loss of four or six boats in a night during stormy weather, State money should be spent in helping them.  The availability of harbour facilities at Green-castle, which is one and a half hours steaming from Glengad is not the answer.  Surely the close proximity of the second best prime white fishing ground in Europe to Glengad must be sufficient incentive to any Government to spend money usefully in helping people who are prepared to grapple with existing and natural difficulties.  If proper facilities are not provided these people cannot be expected to pursue fishing any longer.</P>
    <P>I had long discussions on the situation with the technical people who were well qualified to show the fallacy or otherwise of what was contemplated. What was proposed by the county engineer in Donegal some years ago is the only answer to the problem in Glengad.  The conclusion reached was backed by the Government at the time and an authorised statement by the Government was made by me in this House.  The proposals included not only the work at Glengad but improvements also at Moville, at Fanny's Bay, at Burton-port, Killala and some other places, including some further down the west coast.  The only one of those jobs that was proceeded with with any speed was at Killala.  The wall at Moville has been relegated to the other side of the headland&mdash;at whose decision I do not know.  That harbour should be considered again also because since it is on the wrong side it may not serve the purpose which it was intended to serve.</P>
    <P>To get back to the Glengad pier&mdash; the Minister for Finance of the day was reluctant to sanction the project in the year that followed but he was constrained to do so in the following year. That following year saw the departure not only of him but of myself also and the departure of the prospect of the basin at Glengad.  Without endeavouring in any way to make any sort of <Col N="2158" /> personal issue of this matter, I ask the Minister whether it is fair to say that if I were still in Fisheries, the work at Glengad would have been completed as was promised in 1968?  Is it not really a matter of turning back the clock and making it appear that what I said in 1968 was untrue, that if the job had been proceeded with the credit would have gone to me for it and that, therefore, it was decided to delay it for a while, re-introduce it later and give somebody else the credit for it?  I could not care less who gets the credit for it. I do not want any credit for it.  I have many good friends in the area.  I get votes there but if I never got a vote there I would still maintain that this is a job that should be done.  I have often compared it with Valentia Island in respect of which I had the pleasure of doing something.</P>
    <P>Unless this job is executed in the manner in which it was proposed it will not serve the purpose for which it was intended and the money that the Minister has now embarked on spending there will be wasted.  I appeal to the Minister to stop at this stage and reconsider the matter.  The real problem here is the smashing of boats when at anchor.  It should be remembered that no Glengad boat has ever been lost at sea.  It is while they were anchored at night that they were smashed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of matters raised by Deputy Blaney with which I should like to deal.  It seemed to me from what was said by Deputy Blaney at Question Time today that there was an implication that there may have been a difference in the technical advice which was available to him when he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the technical advice which was available to me when I became Minister for Finance.  I said today that I was not aware of any change in the technical advice and <Col N="2159" /> since then I have checked the position and I have found that this is so, that the technical advice which was available, prepared by the Office of Public Works in 1962, referred to the basin idea which Deputy Blaney has explained and said:</P>
      <P>The basin would be a positive danger.  It should, therefore, be recognised that if the extension and excavation are carried out the fishermen will probably be disappointed to find that shelter has not been improved and may well condemn the work as a failure.  Moreover, there is a danger that if the improved flotation and berthage in time attract more boats to Portaleen the results of a sudden severe storm could be proportionately more disastrous than in the past.</P>
      <P>That was the advice in 1962.  That was the advice available to Deputy Blaney when he became Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  He has confirmed that, I think, in what he said here today, that the technical advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>1962.  He has confirmed that he found that the technical advice available to him was against this proposition.  He went on to describe then the efforts which he made to convince the technical people concerned that this advice was wrong.  I listened carefully to what Deputy Blaney said and one might have the impression that he was saying that subsequently the technical advice was changed but, in fact, he did not say that.  I noted that very carefully.  He did not say it and he was correct not to say it because the technical advice was not changed and as late as July, 1971, it was confirmed by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries that the advice available was still the same, against this idea of a basin.  It was also against this idea of a turn on the proposed extension.  That is still the advice. I think it is important to grasp the fact that the technical advice over all the years did not change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just say one <Col N="2160" /> thing?  I do not want to name names here but that is not the advice that I finally had and I got the agreement of the technical people with whom I had these long discussions that what was proposed by way of basin was a feasible proposition and worth doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can find no record on the files of any change in the technical advice and, as I said, it was confirmed as late as July, 1971.  Deputy Blaney did not say, until now, that there had been a change in the technical advice. I can find no record of it and it was confirmed last year.  He did say that there had been a Government decision which he announced in the House.  I think he is mistaken, to some degree, in his recollection of that Government decision because I think he will find, if he goes back over the matter, that the Government decision related to the expenditure of a sum of £1 million over a period of five years in small harbour work on the western coast.  He is also mistaken in thinking that my predecessor at some stage sanctioned the work which he has described in Portaleen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say he sanctioned it.  All I said was that he was constrained to sanction it and I might even put it more strongly if I had the time to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I asumed from what the Deputy said that whether he was constrained to do it or otherwise that what he meant was that he had sanctioned it.  The fact of the matter is that he did not sanction it.  On two occasions, previous to the announcement to which Deputy Blaney referred, he refused to sanction it and subsequent to that announcement he did not sanction it. The position in this regard that I found when I came into office was that the technical advice was totally against this proposition.  I found that the scheme in general had been sanctioned but that no sanction in fact, had been issued for the detailed work in regard to the various ports which had been mentioned in the announcement and I proceeded to sanction, speaking from recollection, I think, eight of them straight away and the work has been going on on them since.  In regard to <Col N="2161" /> Portaleen or Glengad, the position was that I could not, in all conscience, on the basis of the technical advice available to me, a little of which I have quoted, sanction this expenditure because not alone was it likely, as indicated in the technical report, to cause a danger to the fishermen but, from the economic point of view, the position is approximately this: the total landings in that port in 1970 amounted to about £20,000 in value and that includes an estimated £7,000 for salmon landings. The total cost of the scheme was estimated in 1970 at £100,000.  I think we could probably have overcome the financial difficulties involved, though they are formidable having regard to those figures, but for the absolutely flat-footed technical advice available. Faced with that situation, I was asked to receive a deputation of the fishermen from Glengad which I did.  It is true, as Deputy Blaney says, that I made it clear that the major job which he has described would not be sanctioned for the reasons I have indicated.  That is quite true but it is also true that I asked the fishermen for their suggestion short of that and the suggestion they made was one which we examined and, with some changes, have been carrying out since last April.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney may remember that he was asked a question about this matter by Deputy Harte on 4th March, 1969, and his reply at that time as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was:</P>
      <P>A scheme of improvements was prepared by the Office of Public Works but the estimated cost was found to be very high.  I am asking for a fresh appraisal of the project.</P>
      <P>The fresh appraisal of the project resulted in an even higher cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2162" /> I do not wish to attribute any ulterior motive to Deputy Blaney as I do not think he wishes to ascribe such motives to me.  He did, however, suggest that there may have been an element in what happened of trying to deprive him of credit, or certainly that there was some political motive involved in the way this matter was approached.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that it would be reasonable for the fishermen of Glengad to ask the question and, in fact, I know they are asking the question, if there was Government sanction for this scheme, as claimed by Deputy Blaney, why was it that during the remainder of the time that he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries nothing happened to implement the scheme?  Nothing happened, in fact, in regard to this whole matter until I met the deputation of fishermen and went ahead with the reduced scheme and I could not and would not sanction the major scheme for the reasons I have given and for the same reasons that my predecessor found himself on a number of occasions obliged to refuse sanction to that scheme.</P>

      <i>(b)</i> and <i>(c).</i></P>
    <P>On the purely mathematical basis a contribution rate of 3 per cent should yield a net employee contribution to the fund of £94,246 (£131,944 x 30/42) which would yield a saving of £37,698 p.a. to Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>However, these figures are purely notional since they relate to a scheme in which the overall cost is 8.4 per cent of the members wages and where, <Col N="2036" /> statutorily, such costs must be shared equally between the members and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>It is understood that further amendments to the scheme are being negotiated between the board and the trade unions and that a contribution rate equivalent to 3 per cent has been suggested by the actuary, together with a redefinition of &ldquo;contributing wages&rdquo; and &ldquo;retirement wages&rdquo;.  The proposed contribution rate equivalent to 3 per cent cannot be related either to &ldquo;contributing wages&rdquo; or &ldquo;retirement wages&rdquo; as they are defined in the draft amending superannuation scheme in operation since 4th June, 1970.  The financial information given relates to &ldquo;contributing wages&rdquo; and &ldquo;retirement wages&rdquo; as they have been defined in the scheme operating since 4th June, 1970.</P>
