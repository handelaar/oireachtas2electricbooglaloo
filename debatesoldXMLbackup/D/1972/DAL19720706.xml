    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I had been dealing with the Planning Act and the necessity for controlled development of national primary and national secondary roads.  This is very important if we are to preserve the beauty spots that are tourist attractions.  Therefore, I fully support the Planning Act but I do so with some reservations.</P>
      <P>The position is, of course, that there is some opposition.  There is nothing uniform about it.  There are variations from county to county.  As a member of a local authority, I have found that decisions on planning applications are too long delayed.  In cases where newly-weds or couples intending to marry wish to build their own houses they may get refusal of an application after two months.  This is unfair.  The Minister should direct local authorities to exhibit a map indicating whether or not planning approval would be forthcoming in certain areas.  This would avoid a great deal of frustration.</P>
      <P>We discussed this matter yesterday evening in the course of Deputy Esmonde's speech.  There seemed to be some confusion.  The planning authority must give a decision within two months but there is a back-log of work and if they are not in a position to complete their investigations within the statutory period it is a very simple matter for them to issue a query to the applicant seeking further information and this gives them extra time to deal with the application.  It would be well worthwhile expediting planning decisions. Delay causes frustration to developers.</P>
      <P>In the planning committee in Cork there is a great difference of opinion as to whether or not national primary roads should be opened up for development. I believe that this would be a very dangerous step.  I do not accept that building should be restricted on the outskirts of towns and villages.  On the contrary we should encourage expansion in this direction rather than have uncontrolled, indiscriminate development along national primary roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Development should be opened up on the outskirts of towns and villages. If that were done and the speed limit were extended there would be no additional <Col N="896" /> hazards created on the roads. There are miles and miles of road along which people are not allowed to build.  Ordinary house-building usually follows industrial development.  Where industries are located it is essential that land should be available in the same area for building purposes.  The industry will provide the jobs and the people working in the industry will be housed.</P>
    <P>As I suggested to the planning committee, there should be settlement areas along our primary roads.  We are now realigning and widening our roads and, as a result of that, they are becoming speedways.  It would be wrong to allow people in these circumstances to go ahead and build wherever they wanted to build along main roads but there is an easy way out.  It is the way I have suggested; let us open up settlement areas and in those areas apply a speed limit.  This would result in meeting a great many of the complaints made in regard to planning.</P>
    <P>I am in favour, as I said, of controlled development.  Unfortunately some of our semi-State bodies are the greatest offenders from the point of view of planning.  In the area in which I live the ESB have harnessed the River Lee and, when the water subsides in the upper reservoir, there is nothing but desert, with roots of trees, old fences and old bridges clearly visible.  It is an eyesore.  When one moves further over to Geara on the main Macroom/Inchigeela road&mdash;a very important tourist area, this&mdash; exactly the same thing happens and local development committees try, when the water is low, to remove these eyesores.  The ESB should be compelled to do this.  What happens now interferes with the beauty of the area and spoils its attraction.</P>
    <P>With regard to planning appeals, I was amused, to say the least of it, at the attitude of both the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary when our spokesman for Local Government, Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i>, referred to decisions given on a political basis.  Neither the Minister nor his Parliamentary Secretary would accept that.  I am not saying that the Minister is in any way culpable, but there is always the possibility of the successful <Col N="897" /> applicant making a contribution to the local cumann.  I have had experience over the past four or five years of people appealing against a planning decision of the local authority.  The first question is: &ldquo;How can you get to the Minister?&rdquo; Representations to the Minister will start at the local cumann secretary, pass to the Fianna Fáil TD and go right on to the Minister.  People have gone to Galway from my constituency in an effort to contact the Minister.</P>
    <P>There must be appeals.  The Minister and the Government were very foolish not to accept the Fine Gael amending legislation designed to remove from appeals any suspicion of malpractice.  Up to 95 per cent of those involved in any kind of development, who have to appeal against a decision of the planning authority, are convinced that, if they have a line to the Minister, and sufficient pull, they will get favourable decisions on planning appeals.  This is a sorry state of affairs and the sooner responsibility for appeals is taken away from the Minister the better it will be.</P>
    <P>I will cite one case by way of example.  A builder was selling well-equipped modern houses for as much as £12,000 in a certain area.  This was not too far from Cork city and, if the Minister looks up the case, he will know that what I am saying is correct. Across the road, a narrow country road, a powerful businessman in the south made application for the development of a sand and gravel pit.  Now everyone knows the muck and filth generated by this kind of activity.  The planning committee rejected the application. The applicant appealed and, on appeal, permission was given.  There are 19 members of the Minister's party on the Cork Planning Committee and, when they learned that this decision had been given, some of them described it as disgraceful.  Indeed, there was complete unanimity on the committee and, as a result of representations made, the Minister then decided to grant an oral hearing.  This has not yet been finalised.  All over the country there are protests and demonstrations about this, that and the other.  I warn the Minister that, if this <Col N="898" /> permission is given, there will be demonstrations and protests in that area.</P>
    <P>The sooner the Minister hands over his responsibility in the matter of planning appeals to some committee the better it will be for himself and for the country.  The people are losing confidence because they believe that, if you have sufficient pull and sufficient influence, you will get a favourable decision and, as a result of my experience, I am inclined to agree with them.</P>
    <P>I said that planning is necessary.  Unfortunately people are not aware of what planning really is and, if they were made aware, I believe you would have the co-operation of the general public and planning could be seen to work to the advantage of the people. As a member of a planning committee I support controlled development.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the most important aspect of the Estimate&mdash;housing&mdash; I have something to say in respect of group water schemes.  Deputy Esmonde said last night in the course of his contribution that there was a long delay in going ahead with a group water scheme in Wexford.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not accept that and took a note of the scheme concerned.  I know that there are long delays in these schemes but I cannot understand why there should be such delays.  I am not sure as to where lies the responsibility for this situation but I have my suspicions.  It is my opinion that the Department of Local Government are on a deliberate go-slow policy in so far as these schemes are concerned.  If work on the schemes was speeded up many people would be supplied with water who, otherwise, would never get it under regional schemes.  The local authorities should encourage groups concerned to get water from the mains. In my area people are so frustrated because of delays in group water schemes that they would not become involved now in any such schemes.  I know of one particular case where there has been a delay of ten years. The money was paid long ago but no work whatsoever has begun there yet. What happens in such cases is that some individuals, in desperation, provide <Col N="899" /> their own supplies.  This means that the group will then be rendered uneconomic.</P>
    <P>We, in Cork County Council, have made representations on many occasions both to the Minister and to his predecessor, particularly to his predecessor, to allow into Cork County Council representatives of the group water schemes in Cork so that there could be discussion between both interests of schemes which would be of concern to both.  We were refused that permission on each occasion.  There is no co-operation between the local authorities and the Minister's officials particularly in so far as group water schemes are concerned.  If both parties worked hand-in-hand, the people would benefit but while there is this alienation, the people will suffer.  It is obvious in Cork that there is disagreement. If the Minister ordered one of his officials to attend a meeting of the housing and sanitary authority in Cork on only one day each year, all this disagreement could be sorted out.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I would like him to tell us whether, after a group water scheme has been completed, the local authority, under an Act of this House, are compelled to take it over.  It is my opinion that once a group scheme has been completed, not only are the local authority obliged to assume responsibility for it from then on but that it can be sold to the local authority.  One scheme in particular was carried out in Cork for which a two-inch water main was laid by the Department.  It was not possible for any of us to bring together first the Department officials and members of the housing and sanitary authority. The scheme was in operation within about 12 months and when the question of taking it over arose the sanitary engineer claimed that the main should have been a four-inch one.  I am inclined to believe he was right.  Now there is further development on that road.  The group consisted of about ten cottiers who put up a booster pump at a cost of £800.  The local authority will not take over the scheme now because they claim it is not up to their standards.  The contribution paid by <Col N="900" /> each member of the group to get the scheme off the ground was £35.  These people paid this money in the belief that, on completion, the scheme would be taken over by the local authority but now this crux has arisen as a result of the Minister's refusal to allow his officials to discuss schemes in detail with council engineers.</P>
    <P>In his reply, too, perhaps the Minister will let me know whether in this instance Cork County Council are obliged to take over this scheme.  The householders concerned are responsible for collecting water rents and ESB charges and this can prove difficult for them in respect of assessing what each person should pay.  I hope the Minister will take note of what I have said and that he will ensure that group water schemes generally will be expedited.  In fairness to the Department officials in Cork, they have always been very helpful but they have a problem of inadequate staff.  It is not good enough that people should have to wait many years for water supplies. It is necessary to have a water supply in every home and this could be achieved through the group schemes.  I hope the matter will be taken up now and that week after week it will not be necessary for Deputies to table Questions seeking information on various schemes.  I could supply the Minister with a list of schemes in my constituency in respect of which there have been delays of from three to ten years. It is very difficult for public representatives to explain these delays to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>In dealing with housing I shall be as brief as possible because much has been said already on this subject during the debate.  From what I have heard here it would appear that there are similar problems in respect of housing in almost every constituency. I welcome the raising of the ceiling in relation to loans and also the increases in grants.  This was long overdue.  The cost of houses had risen to such an extent that the grants had no relation to the cost.  This increase is very welcome to people who have to pay the bills for building or reconstructing houses and I am pleased it is coming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> The Minister made a very long speech.  I fully sympathise with his objective that every family in the country would be properly housed at a rent they could afford.  This is very desirable and is easy to say but to achieve it may be another matter.  The Minister gave details of the number of houses built, the amount of money allocated to private and local authority housing.  This looks well on paper but in order to measure the problem and what progress we are making towards its solution it is also necessary to look at the numbers still on the waiting list for rehousing, the number of people or families living in hovels.  Without that, there is no point in the Minister saying that we have built so many houses since last year, provided so much money for local authorities and paid so much in grants.  We must examine the way we are tackling the enormous waiting list for housing.  It is not sensible to expect the Minister to provide a solution overnight, as some people expect, but I believe his priorities are completely wrong.  The Department's priorities have been wrong for years because provision of adequate housing should get first priority for our people.</P>
    <P>I have visited anybody in my area who wrote to me about housing and I have been appalled to find families living where cattle would not be housed.  If the Minister has any doubts I can give him a list of cases, particularly in the Douglas area of Cork, where people are still waiting ten or 12 years for houses.  It is bad enough when old people or single people are living in bad houses but where there are young children living, sleeping and eating in houses that are unfit for animals it is a great reflection on the authorities and the Department of Local Government.  We should put our priorities in order and tackle the housing problem immediately.  When families grow up in bad housing conditions it creates a feeling that they are outcasts of society or second-class citizens.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not unlimited resources for housing but last night we were talking about swimming pools and saying it costs as much as £50,000 <Col N="902" /> to provide one.  A swimming pool is desirable but it would not be my top priority.  The housing of people living in hovels, particularly if children are involved, should take precedence over the provision of swimming pools.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to this kind of development but I oppose the spending of public money on it when houses are required in the area.  We also have a directive from the Department regarding the provision of public conveniences in quite a number of villages in County Cork.  Those buildings cost about as much as would build a house, £2,600 last year or the year before.  It is little comfort to the mother of a young family living in a bad house where, perhaps, as in one case which I saw recently, the beds have to be covered with oilcloth at night to prevent the children getting wet if it rains, to be told that there is a swimming pool down in the village or that there is a public convenience across the road. In one case a public convenience was erected and was locked by mistake for three months with the light lighting inside it but nobody complained.  That indicates the use that was made of it after the expenditure of what I think would build a decent house for an unfortunate family on the waiting list. If the Minister said to-morrow: &ldquo;I shall discontinue this and devote all my resources to providing houses&rdquo; I would say he was right.  A decent house is a basic essential for any married couple wishing to rear a family.</P>
    <P>At the present time, as in the past few years, we are realigning and providing diversions on our national primary and secondary roads.  I was amazed to find that a mile of a national primary road can cost as much as from £70,000 to £120,000.  This figure came from the Cork county engineer and I believe it is correct.  It is more essential to provide speed tracks, adding, in my opinion, to the massacre on the roads, than it is to divert that money towards the provision of houses for families living in bad houses?  If the Minister said tomorrow that he would not spend any more money on national primary roads but would provide money for houses instead, I would think that was right.  I think it would remove much <Col N="903" /> of the unrest and the protest we have at present.  As a Deputy stated the other day&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;a bad house can be responsible for broken homes and marriages; it can turn the head of the house to drink. We should realise this and whatever about roads or swimming pools or public conveniences, the first consideration should be to provide decent houses for our people.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the Minister when he says our aim should be to ensure that every family would own a house. We should aim at ensuring that each family will own and take pride in their own house.  I have often seen somebody get a council house and, perhaps, because he is transferred to another job, after keeping that house for years, decorating it and keeping it well and laying out its garden, he just walks out as if he had never done anything there. I was responsible for the passing of a resolution at a meeting of the housing and sanitary committee in Cork to encourage people waiting for houses for years.  We should tell them: &ldquo;We will make a loan available to you interest free or at a reduced rate of interest to enable you to build your own house.&rdquo; I think people are worried about their commitments in regard to the repayment of loans and because they cannot provide their own houses you have married couples being exploited by landlords who let flats or flatlets for exorbitant rents.  If they paid the amount they are paying in rent as repayments, they would provide themselves with a house which would be their own property after a number of years.</P>
    <P>We must give people the incentive to do this by providing them with interest-free loans.  Those who qualify for rehousing under a local authority survey should qualify for interest-free loans.  This would be a worthwhile development.  A survey is carried out in an area at present and a housing superintendent reports that so many have qualified for rehousing.  The system is so cumbersome, the local authority is strangled so much by the Department of Local Government, that every step they take has to get the <Col N="904" /> OK.  I am glad the Minister has made an effort to give more power to local authorities because as in the case of group water schemes there is no justification for a situation where somebody qualifies under a rural survey and it takes as long as six or eight years to provide him with a house. Circumstances will change so much in the meantime that this delay is not justifiable.  If the local authorities had full power and got a block allocation of money so that each year they could go ahead and provide houses it would save much of the frustration and delay that occurs at present.</P>
    <P>Every month at a meeting of the housing and sanitary committee we get a housing report.  Our officials say: &ldquo;This was submitted to the Department for sanction six or 12 months ago.  There was another reminder since then.&rdquo; Officials in the Department and officials in the county council should not be engaged in that type of communication just to achieve what should be done by the local authority.  I am glad the Minister has seen this and that this is to be tackled.  If the local authority gets full control, I think houses can be provided more quickly. This could make the job of public representatives much easier.  At least one would be in a position to say what progress was being made.  Between the local authority and the Department of Local Government it is very difficult to know.  The Department are responsible for most of the delays.</P>
    <P>One finds a situation where a scheme of houses is built by a local authority, the cases of applicants are investigated and tenants appointed. Very often you find that there are people such as an old age pensioner and his wife or a brother and sister who have gone beyond marriageable age.  These people will not succeed in getting houses because there will be more deserving applicants on the list. Families with young children rightly get priority but we should provide some kind of smaller conventional type houses or prefabs that would accommodate people who because they are living alone are committed to living in hovels for the remainder of their lives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> There is something wrong with a system under which you find in some council houses single people who are still in possession and whose family have gone away and a man, his wife and young family living in a caravan. There should be something more flexible so that the authority could say to the person who has a council house and probably paying a high rent: &ldquo;We will give you a smaller house at a reduced rent&rdquo; in order to make available the council house for a young family.  This would be very desirable. Members of local authorities who are Members of this House are well aware of the difficulties that exist in relation to housing.  Every one of us is inundated with requests from people who are looking for houses.  I hope the Minister in his reply will give us some indication of the number of people who have qualified for rehousing and are still not housed so that we will know in what direction we are going and what progress we have made.</P>
    <P>I believe every local authority should have some kind of emergency housing scheme because where there are two families living in one house, people living with in-laws&mdash;I have come across many such cases&mdash;there can be a very sudden eviction, a very sudden breakup, and young couples can find themselves out on the street.  There is no place to put them except into the county home in Midleton or St. Finbar's. This is not good enough.  There should be an emergency housing scheme for people who become homeless overnight.</P>
    <P>The provision of houses is a big charge on the Exchequer.  There are big industrialists coming into this country and setting up industry, not for love of the Irish people but for the profit they can make.  They are very welcome but I often wonder whether they should not make some contribution to housing because when there is an industry in a town which gives employment it automatically creates a demand for houses.  When an industrialist comes in and employs, perhaps, 100 people in a town, houses and flats become very scarce.  I think industrialists should make some contribution to housing.  I should not like to go back <Col N="906" /> to the olden days where the employer provided a house for the workman and when the workman lost his job he lost the house but the Minister should consider whether some contribution could not be made to housing by industrialists.</P>
    <P>We seem to be departing from the old idea of the rural cottage.  The local authorities are inclined to build housing schemes and to say to somebody who has qualified under a rural survey: &ldquo;We have a house for you in the next village or the next town.&rdquo; The authorities should continue to build rural cottages where there is employment for people.  We should not be too anxious to push people into towns and villages.  The movement away from the land is rapid enough without being encouraged by us.  We should try to decentralise industry and keep people living in rural Ireland because, without people and without houses, the rural areas will decay.  The rural cottage can be a very nice home.  If somebody is anxious to live in the country, and he has qualified for a house under a survey, he should not be compelled to go and live in a terrace of houses. That is not the correct approach.</P>
    <P>When houses are being built by local authorities it is essential that they should provide a playground or a park where the children can play.  It is deplorable to see big housing schemes where the children have to play on the footpaths and on the roads.  This is not a healthy sign and we should not condone it.  When a scheme is finished we should at least have an acre of ground where the children can play games in the evening.  If we force them to play on the streets we are courting trouble.</P>
    <P>I welcome the special grant for the physically disabled.  The least we can do for these people is to try to make their lives more pleasant, even by bringing the switches nearer to the floor, or providing a bathroom on the ground floor, or making provision so that they will not have to climb a flight of stairs.  These are all very desirable.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the amenity grants made available to the local authorities.  The problem is that, like everything else, they only scratch the <Col N="907" /> surface.  I would ask the Minister if at all possible to increase the grant to Cork County Council under this heading. The allocation we get would not cover 100th part of the work which the local authority have in mind.  This money could be spent in areas which would attract tourists and which would be of benefit to the local people.  If we had more money we could tackle the problem of derelict areas.</P>
    <P>To give credit where credit is due, the Minister has done more than any of his predecessors in regard to the housing of itinerants.  This is very desirable. They are human beings just as we are.  They have their rights and they are entitled to be housed.  Progress is being made, but it is difficult to get some of them to accept houses and to keep them properly.  This should not deter us.  If we house these people we have an opportunity of educating their children, and this is where the problem should be tackled. I should like to see them integrated more into society.  We should not house them all together.  In Cork local people objected to the housing of some itinerants because the local authority wanted to house many of them in the one area.  This defeats the whole purpose.  If you house them in different areas there is a better chance of integrating them with other people and they then become a part of society.  If you house them all together you do not achieve that.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the amount of money made available to the Cork County Council for rural improvement schemes.  We have a colossal amount of work waiting to be done.  In fact, we stopped accepting application forms because we had a backlog which it will take five years to clear because of the amount of money made available to Cork County Council for this purpose.  I was amazed to find that the amount made available to the Minister's own county is far more than made available to us, even though the problem in Cork is far greater than the problem in Galway.</P>
    <P>In my area there are bulk tank collections of milk and therefore we must have roads on which this heavy traffic <Col N="908" /> can travel.  There are many areas in the constituency of mid-Cork where you could not drive a combine harvester, or machinery, or even a lorry to collect milk.  We have a huge number of people waiting to improve the laneways and roadways leading to their houses but we have not sufficient money to do this work.  I appeal to the Minister to try to give us more money so that we can tackle this job in an effective way.</P>
    <P>There are villages and towns in my area which have been awaiting the erection of speed limit signs for years. Why does it take so long before the powers-that-be decide to erect speed limit signs?  What causes the delay? Surely it is not a big job to erect two little signs showing the speed limit that has been fixed?  There is no excuse for this.  Time and time again we have referred to this in Cork County Council and we have criticised the Government and the Minister for the long delays.  There are villages in which there are creameries or industries through which traffic is flying at 70 or 80 mph.  The Minister has not tackled this problem.  People make representations continually to public representatives in their areas.  The Minister should examine this problem and expedite the erection of speed limit signs in villages and towns in Cork generally.  The delay is inexcusable.</P>
    <P>I wish also to refer to the question of rates.  Rates are becoming a terrible burden.  There is a relief of rates scheme.  A similar scheme was operated by the local authority of which I am a member long before legislation was introduced for this purpose.  Officials are helpful and considerate, particularly to people who are qualified for relief from rates, namely, old age pensioners and people who have not got the money to pay.  There are increases in rates each year.  These place a burden on the small shopkeeper in a town or village whose business has been lessening because of the introduction of supermarkets.  That small shopkeeper is still expected to pay rates which may be even higher than those he paid when he was doing good business.  When will we see the promised report on rates?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> The rating system bears no relationship whatever to the ability of the ratepayer to pay.  In some cases a small rate is payable, even though three or four people in the house are earning. In other cases small shopkeepers whose businesses have been destroyed by supermarkets are still expected to pay high rates.  Only one-third of the people whose names appear on the register of electors pay rates.  The whole rating system should be examined. It is out-of-date.  It is creating much hardship.  Any member of a local authority will realise the truth of what I am saying.  Last year I had very many demand notes in my office. Some people were looking for time to pay, and others were informing me that they could not pay.  Some demand notes were in respect of people whom I considered should not be asked to pay, but under the system they had to pay.  We are all waiting for the report of the examination.  We have been promised it for a long time.</P>
    <P>Now I want to deal with the reorganisation of local government.  This is an effort by the Minister, the Government and the bureaucrats to centralise control and to have everything controlled from the Custom House, Dublin.  I should warn the Minister that if there are problems and difficulties in local authorities they cannot be eliminated by amalgamation or the abolition of some of those authorities.  A case may be made for the abolition of some of our small town councils.  They have given good service.  They know the local problems and are aware of what is required locally in their functional areas.  The Minister should proceed slowly on this point.  The same point applies to urban councils.  I have known some councils in my area where members have attended meetings and discussed problems with the local people, and where some of those problems have been aired at council meetings.  It would be wrong if the Minister wiped out these councils by a stroke of his pen.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer also to the proposed amalgamation between Cork city and county.  I should warn the Minister that that proposal will never be accepted.  The members of the Minister's <Col N="910" /> own party in the county council will not accept it.  No case can be made for this proposed amalgamation. The members rejected the Minister's proposal to have a joint manager. What would happen if there was a joint manager?  There would be a man who would be known as the city manager.  This will not be accepted. An extension of the borough boundary will not be accepted either.  The whole thing is crazy.  The Minister should be interested in building up and strengthening satellite towns like Ballincollig, Carrigaline, Blarney and other places.  Cork city is about containable at the moment.  The traffic problems, as well as other problems, which arise will not be overcome by having a unified authority.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to mention the sewerage facilities in the area.  Is it not hard to believe that in this day and age there are 45 houses within a quarter-of-a-mile of each other in Millstreet which are still without sewerage facilities?  Proposals for sewerage schemes for this area have been sent to the Department time and time again.  Parliamentary questions have been asked about this point, but 45 houses are still left without essential services.  The position is the same in other areas.  The Minister should examine this point carefully.  The Minister should look at his priorities. I hope that he will refer to some of the points I have made because I am convinced that the Minister's priorities are completely wrong.  The Minister should devote more of the resources available to him to the provision of houses for our people.</P>

      <P>The houses in County Dublin were built quickly.  We appreciate that.  I would like the work to continue in that manner.  I was invited by the chairman of the county council to go to see some of these houses.  The Minister was present when the building of the first houses was started.  The scheme is nearly finished now because the houses were built quickly.  If the work is carried out quickly our people will be housed quicker than they would have been by the use of the old traditional methods. On behalf of the few friends I have left in County Dublin, I wish to thank the Minister publicly.</P>

      <P>He has tried to.  I do not know what action the Minister can take other than to bring in amending legislation.  Somebody has to pay.  I mention the matter and will not dwell on it.</P>
      <P>Reasonable progress has been made with sewerage and water schemes in County Dublin.  The price of land is high and the best way to bring down the price of land is to increase the supply of serviced land.  Dublin County Council is trying to do in a few years what should have been done 20 years ago.  Rates have risen steeply as a result but we had to face our responsibility. We are doing the work to the best of our ability.  It is costing the Department, the taxpayers and the ratepayers millions of pounds.  Sewerage and water works throughout County Dublin are proceeding at a great rate. There are a number of schemes in operation and quite a few in the pipeline. This work should be proceeded with at all possible speed so as to bring down the price of land for house building. If there is only a small amount of land available private contractors should be allowed to develop it.  Private builders have contributed a good deal to the housing output in the city and county of Dublin.  They have built more houses than the local authority have built.  Everything within reason must be done to ensure that land is made available in the city and county. Pools of serviced land have been made available and we hope to continue along these lines.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation have moved out into County Dublin.  It is impossible to build a wall around the city.  The city has been extended many times before. The corporation have bought land and serviced it and have made it available to contractors, especially to small contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for increasing the loans and grants for houses.  That will be very welcome in County <Col N="913" /> Dublin.  We must bring the Minister to County Dublin and I am sure Deputy Clinton will have a special welcome for him.  The Minister will be welcome in County Dublin because we appreciate what he is doing for us.  Many people will benefit from the increase in loans and grants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed suggested that all the money should be spent on housing.  In the city and county of Dublin a great deal of money has been and is being spent on housing.  Half the houses in Dublin are local authority houses.  That is no mean achievement.  I remember the slums that existed in Dublin.  There is still some over-crowding in the city. I am anxious that everybody should be housed properly.  Deputy Creed suggested that money should be switched to housing from roads.  I am paying £50 a year tax and, therefore, I want a decent road to travel on.  I am ashamed of the roads in County Dublin.  The roads out of the city of Dublin are a disgrace.  Some of them are narrow. They are over-crowded.  I have been agitating about the Santry by-pass for years.  I understand that amending legislation is required to deal with it.  I would ask the Minister to deal with this matter.  There is a bridge 17 feet wide on the main road.  I have to visit friends in north County Dublin and a journey that should take ten minutes takes half an hour.</P>

      <P>Dublin county should be assessed differently from any other county because of the great explosion of population in the county. Higher grants for the maintenance of main roads should be given in County Dublin.  Grants are given but more is required for the roads leading out of the city of Dublin.  The roads in County Dublin are poor.  I refer especially to the north road.  Part of the Belfast road is the most over-crowded road in Ireland.  There is over-crowding also on the road going through <Col N="914" /> Blanchardstown and Ballymun.  There are two cities there&mdash;Finglas and Ballymun.  Reconstruction work is being carried out on the road and a very good job is being done.  We would be grateful if the Minister were to reassess some of the county roads.</P>

The people there are fearful of damage to their personal property.  Surely this could be developed on the same lines as St. Michael's in Inchicore and the Tyrone Street development.  That would certainly help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a great many things we would like to do in County Dublin if we had the money.  If the money is <Col N="916" /> available, I appeal to the Minister not to forget us.  We want sanction for the Santry by-pass and other things like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech makes a voluminous document.  I am not being critical of it.  He went to a great deal of trouble.  He went into a lot of detail, which is very useful for anyone who has the time to study it.</P>
      <P>One of the things for which the Minister must be given credit is the fact that he has taken what I describe as the first faltering steps on the road to the devolution of authority for housing to the housing authorities. This has been a long time on the stocks as far as my party is concerned.  When the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was shadow Minister for Local Government we strongly recommended the block grant system.  Local authorities can now go ahead, build these houses, if they have the money, up to a maximum of six houses, without having to seek sanction.  The to-ing and fro-ing between the local authorities and the Department went on for far too long. I criticised the system on many occasions and I pointed out the unnecessary expense involved and the unnecessary delays occasioned.  Other Ministers talk about the devolution of authority but they do not put their theories into practice.  They do not really mean what they are saying. What the Minister has done is a welcome indication of a step in the direction of devolution.</P>
      <P>When I had responsibility on this side of the House for Agriculture and Fisheries I strongly proposed&mdash;it was incorporated in our policy&mdash;the setting up of rural development authorities which would take into consideration the entire potential of an area.  A short time afterwards, Deputy Blaney, then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, started talking about mini-government Departments.  I also recommended the amalgamation of two Government Departments, Lands and Agriculture and Fisheries, and later the Minister for Lands, Deputy Seán Flanagan, proposed to scuttle himself so that this could be done.  It might be described as taking part of the policy of the Opposition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> If this is admitted, it is to be admired because it takes a good Minister to acknowledge that all the wisdom is not on the Government side of the House.  I see no reason why this devolution of authority in so far as it concerns a maximum block of six houses cannot be extended to the entire work of local authorities.  Why not say to local authorities: &ldquo;Here is your allocation of money.  Use it in the best interests of your area.&rdquo; This would make for greater participation and would rule out all the unnecessary overlapping and bickering that has gone on between the Department and the local authorities for many years among people who are equally qualified to do the same work.  It is one of the most welcome developments that I have ever witnessed in relation to the Department.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government has become enormous and any Minister who carries out the work of the Department properly will be a very busy man.</P>
    <P>All those who contributed to the debate emphasised the problems arising in housing&mdash;house purchase, rents and so on.  Housing is the big problem in the Dublin region.  I appeal to the Minister to come to grips with the difficulty that arises under the 1966 Act and the 1967 regulations in respect of the purchase scheme.  That was a bad scheme and, worse still, it followed an exceedingly good scheme, one that might be described as a give-away scheme.  The shock of the new scheme was too great for the people.  Deputy Burke is correct when he says that the ordinary working man cannot pay £8 or £9 a week on the purchase of his house.  It is bad value in any case and there is also the fact that he can purchase a better house from a private builder for the same amount of money.</P>
    <P>In County Dublin there are cases where sites were purchased as far back as 1950 but where every estimate of the local authority in respect of the number of houses required was halved. In this way the schemes were delayed for many years.  The houses were built four or six years ago.  The delays were caused by the length of time it took to <Col N="918" /> prepare schemes.  The reason for this was that there was a lot of building in progress and it was not possible to have the schemes valued because of the requirement to sell at market value. There is now the situation where not one house in all of Dublin has been purchased under this scheme and where public representatives are being harassed all the time but the Minister refuses to meet the people concerned. The problems are not solved by refusing to meet people.  There is now a deadlock.  I, in common with most people here would be anxious that the maximum number of people would purchase their own houses.  The tenants I meet wish to own their own houses. They are willing to purchase them at a figure that is within their capacity to pay but they are not being given that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Some time age I tabled a Private Member's motion which has not been reached yet but it would be no harm to be put on the record of the House what we were looking for.  I asked that the regulation be so amended that we would have provision whereby the purchase price would be based on the market value of a house in the year in which building was commenced.  This is now accepted in the Department as being fair and reasonable.  Dublin County Council put forward a scheme recently to the Department which embodies everything that I sought in this motion.  The Department have accepted that but they will not accept it retrospectively. This is where the difficulty arises.  In the motion I asked also that the remission of rates under the Housing Acts, allowed in the case of the purchase of private houses, be extended to the purchase of local authority housing and that a discount of 2½ per cent be allowed for each year's rent paid from the date of occupation subject to a maximum discount of 50 per cent and that a sum equivalent to the State grant plus a supplementary grant on private housing be deducted from the purchase price of local authority houses.  Surely none of us would deny a local authority house purchaser the same concessions to which every other house purchaser is entitled.  Finally, I ask that the provisions be expressed so as to come into <Col N="919" /> operation as and from the date of the operation of the original regulations.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to try to find a solution to this problem because if the problem is not solved people will have to continue renting houses.  If people own their own houses they will maintain them in good order.  I am thinking in particular of schemes such as those at Lucan, Tallaght and Santry where people have been hit very badly. All that is needed is a small amendment to deal with the problem.  The Minister has accepted everything that is asked for in the Private Member's motion to which I referred.  These provisions were operated in the last two schemes in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been congratulated by Deputy Burke and others on the number of houses that are being built. I admit that there has been an increase in the number of houses built but, despite that, the housing situation in the whole of the corporation area has not been improved.  I have never experienced a worse time than the present in this respect.  I represent, as a Deputy, a large corporation area and I have cases on hands of families who are living six in a room and who cannot be housed by the corporation.  The corporation tell me that there are larger families awaiting accommodation and that these other families will be considered for whatever accommodation becomes available in various areas.  It is sad that the corporation have to admit that they are not in a position to offer immediate housing to families who are living six in a room.</P>
    <P>Another problem arises in respect of Ballymun in that when tenants go there there is no hope of their being rehoused elsewhere.  Many people object to living in these high-rise flats and in many cases the type of central heating in operation there affects their health but there is very little hope of their being rehoused elsewhere.  It is not fair that people, having had to take accommodation in areas in which they do not wish to live and under circumstances which they do not consider natural for them, find that there is no way out.  A way must be found for providing <Col N="920" /> these people with alternative accommodation where they feel it is the cause of ill-health for them.  I condemned this scheme many times before and shall continue to do so.  I hope there will never be a repetition of it.  It is a shocking admission for the Minister to have to make that we still have more than 5,000 people on the Dublin Corporation waiting list in spite of the increased number of houses being built.  In certain parts of County Dublin we are catching up on housing; the position is not nearly as bad as it was.  We are building more houses there than were built at any other period, I think.  This is due to what has been described as the few schemes of so called low-cost housing and guaranteed order schemes.  It is not low-cost housing; it is normal cost housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is above normal cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, it is somewhat above normal but, as members of the council, we felt this was an acceptable scheme for two reasons, one because it was allowed over and above our normal housing finance allocation and in this way we were able to get more houses, and two, there was the promise of very speedy building.  We also had an arrangement with the builders that lots of 10 or 20 per week would be handed over after a certain date.  The builders have not done this and this was disappointing.  They still maintain they are keeping within the time schedule for completion which they promised but they have not delivered the goods as they promised and the council are in no position to compel them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are objectionable features of the scheme as I suppose there are in every scheme.  I shall not go into them now.  The National Building Agency are dealing with these contractors and I think this is not satisfactory because there is some blundering to and fro.  I think it was only necessary to bring the National Building Agency into the provision of local authority housing because the Department failed to recognise that professional and technical people in local authorities were completely underpaid.  They could not be <Col N="921" /> recruited because the money was not sufficiently attractive.  The NBA were entitled to employ them at a sufficiently attractive salary and this is the only reason they were more successful than the local authorities.  The local authorities were not allowed to pay the professional people by the Department.  If the local authority staffs were enlarged and if the Department made that possible, I see no reason why they could not carry out this job even more efficiently than the NBA.  Let the NBA be there for special schemes, if necessary, for industrial development and the normal building they did before they entered into the local authority area.  There is an immense amount of unacceptable planning that must be revised when it comes back to the local authority and this is not a very welcome position.</P>
    <P>The planning of the whole of the Dublin region was an enormous job, particularly County Dublin, where tremendous developments are contemplated and it is outrageous that after years of work when the council finally adopt a plan a couple of weeks later they get the result of the Dublin transportation study and are told by the planners that the lines indicating roads throughout the county can only be regarded as diagrammatic, that the scene is now completely changed and that a man's holding which was zoned for housing development or industrial development or other intensive development may now be entirely taken up&mdash;as much as 40 acres&mdash;with one of these large road intersections.  That must be purchased at the price of development land for housing or industry or office blocks.</P>
    <P>This deplorable timing is to be condemned because it will cost local authorities a vast sum as well as giving endless trouble to everybody when they thought they at last had a plan.  In fact, they have no plan because there was no road network.  For years we have been agitating here to have an authority set up at a very high level to go into the question of a road and rail network all around Dublin city.  This was fobbed off by successive Ministers for Local Government as unnecessary. The Department of Finance also came into it because there is no point in <Col N="922" /> having plans and programmes unless there is a commitment on the part of the Government and the Department of Finance to spend £x on this type of development over a period.  It is only frustration and a waste of planners' time to decide what will be the shape of things to come without a Government guarantee that the development will take place over a certain period.</P>
    <P>The Department are not accepting sufficient responsibility for the provision of school and church sites.  The Minister should be aware of the enormous problems arising all over County Dublin regarding the acquisition of school sites, mainly for primary schools, in the first instance.  School managers are now being asked for £100,000 for a six-acre or seven-acre site in most parts of the county.  A way out of this must be found.  They have the difficulty of locating a site.  When this is done they can in time persuade the local authority to make a compulsory purchase order for it, but nobody has the money to pay for it.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the enormous cost being imposed on County Dublin ratepayers by a decision to build three cities and provide the necessary services, at Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown.  No consideration has been given by any Government Department to the difficulties we face here.  I predict that, unless somebody steps in, the County Dublin rate will be £10 in the £ in a few years.  It cannot be kept from rising to that extent if we are to get on with the job we are told to do.  If this was happening in any other country, the State would pay for this development. They are not paying for it here&mdash;they are paying a share&mdash;and the ratepayers are being asked to carry an intolerable burden and school managers are being asked to carry an intolerable burden.  Because of the value of land they cannot purchase.  Where there is rapid development, there is an enormous number of new families coming in.  They are &ldquo;up to their tonsils&rdquo; trying to find the necessary money to pay for their houses.  They simply have not got the sort of money that perhaps old residents, established over <Col N="923" /> a number of years, could afford to contribute to the purchase of school and church sites.  The day for this has gone.  There will have to be a new look at it because it cannot be met in the way that people are trying to meet it at present.</P>
    <P>There has been discussion here about the improvements in grants and loans for the purchase of houses.  There is something I cannot understand and perhaps the Minister could explain it. Recently the loan has been increased in the Dublin area by £500, from a maximum of £3,300 to a minimum of £3,800.  In addition to this scheme the Minister is prepared to guarantee a scheme where one goes to the building societies for an additional 25 per cent. This leaves the position that if one now borrows through the Local Loans Fund in County Dublin one can get a maximum of £3,800 but if one does it through this guarantee scheme and through the building societies one can get £4,750.  As I see it, this will only have the effect of syphoning money away from the building societies into doing this local authority type of building. What will be the advantage of it? Will it in any way increase the stock of houses?  Why can the Minister not make this maximum loan the same whether it is coming through the Local Loans Fund or coming through the building societies?  There was a great need to raise the loan maximum to £4,750 because the problem of finding the deposit was beyond the capacity of many people requiring houses.  The Minister should level this up because there will now be many people clamouring at the building societies.  The building societies will not be able to provide the money because they have not got it.  Even within the previous limitations and without this sort of competition they were not able to supply anything like the full need. Now this special attraction has been brought to borrowing in this way and the building societies will not be able to supply the money.  It is a gimmick. It should be possible to offer the same terms whether a person is purchasing through the Local Loans Fund or a building society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> The Minister referred to the enormous increase in the amount of money provided by building societies in recent years.  One of the reasons for this was that builders would not accept a loan from the local authority because it took so long to get it.  They refused to sell to people who were borrowing through the Local Loans Fund because of the long delays.  Most people I know would much prefer a local authority loan if it was forthcoming quickly.  One of the things they like most about a local authority loan is that they know what the rate of interest will be.  From the day they borrow until the day they finish it is the same but it is a fluctuating rate of interest in the case of building societies.  I recognise that the building societies have made a very good contribution to housing finance.  We should pay them every tribute that is due to them.  However, I do not think there is anything in this and I hope the Minister will change it.  I do not think it will increase the stock of houses.  If people are not enabled to get a loan in the region of £4,750 the deposit will be beyond them.  I would like to see that recognised.</P>
    <P>I do not think the land bank scheme is working satisfactorily or having the effect the Minister intended.  It is true that quite a substantial bank of land has been built up in the Dublin region. It is all wrong that when a developer is purchasing land, when he is in there negotiating, the local authority should come in and compete.  I think it is also completely wrong when a builder has purchased land and is ready to build that the local authority should come in and say: &ldquo;No, you will not.  We will apply a compulsory purchase order.&rdquo; This has happened.  This is not adding to the number of houses we could get built, it is taking from it.  This competition, as far as possible, should be eliminated because, in fact, it is putting up the price of land and not reducing it.  There never has been such competition as was started between the local authorities and the normal builders and developers in the Dublin region.  There is nobody more opposed to speculation in building land than I am but if a man buys land to build houses and if he is an active builder <Col N="925" /> he should have no opposition from the local authority.  This is all wrong.</P>
    <P>I also have some doubt as to whether it is a wise policy for a local authority to have a land bank of a size that they will not require for many years ahead.  The cost of this borrowing will have its effect and though it may seem to be cheap land initially at the end it will work out to be very expensive land.  The redistribution of this land to smaller builders is not easy and it is not inexpensive. It is a very long drawnout business where you have legal men coming in and spending 12 months or more parcelling it out at enormous cost.  It is by no means cheap land and it has by no means eased the burden of the small builder, as it was intended to do.  I would ask the Minister to have another hard look at the whole business because there are certain officials who imagine they are doing a wonderful job, who want to create the impression that they are doing a wonderful job in this land purchase arrangement, and of being the bureaucrats who can decide for every small, hardworking builder: you build so many houses and no more and you only build in a certain area and you only build a certain type of house.  This sort of dictation is not good, right or proper.  It is only harassing people who want to make a living out of building houses and who want to give employment.</P>
    <P>Many people talk about the rates. I have referred to them only in a passing way in relation to the Dublin region and its rapid development in three areas.  It will come to the point where the ratepayers will not be able to bear the rates.  There is no attempt being made to take the burden of the health services off the rates.  This is long overdue.  We have this rapid development with all its problems and its cost, and the cost of the health services is rocketing all the time and is still being left on the rates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke spoke about the roads situation in County Dublin and I am in full agreement with him. The planning of the motorway towards <Col N="926" /> the north has taken far too long.  Everybody is sick and tired of it.  I should like the Minister to tell the House why it has been held up for so long.  At certain times it is very difficult to get out of the city in any direction.</P>
    <P>I raised with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has responsibility for it, the difficulty of getting insurance cover mainly for lorries but for cars as well, and he said that if I had any difficulty I should refer it to the Department of Local Government and that they had the answer, that they would guarantee cover under a scheme they have. I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question and I want an answer.  When the application is made to the Department of Local Government it takes three months to get a reply.  If I am making my living by driving a lorry and doing haulage work, is my lorry covered during those three months?  If it is not, this is a very serious situation for everybody concerned.  I have an assurance from the brokers that it takes three months to get this dealt with by the Department.  The Parliamentary Secretary says it does not.</P>

      <P>This will have to be raised again with the responsible Minister to show him that the scheme is not working through the Department of Local Government.  Why it was hived off to the Department beats me. There may be some reason why that was done and why it is not handled by the Department of Industry and Commerce, but I think it is wrong to have it dealt with in this way.  When there is divided responsibility nothing works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Creed spoke about speed limits and I could not agree with him more.  I do not know what the system is.  At one stage three people were dealing <Col N="927" /> with speed limits for the whole country.  I do not know how many are dealing with them now.  The need for speed limits has rocketed because of the increased traffic and because the development of roads has not kept pace with the volume of traffic.  The number of people deciding on the speed limits should be increased.  Sometimes it takes years to get a decision and, in the meantime, we are building up an accident history.  There must be some way of dealing with this matter more expeditiously.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see in the Minister's statement that planning appeals are being cleared at a faster rate and that the backlog is being reduced.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary spends a lot of his time on this work, and I know there is a lot of drudgery attached to it, but it is a pity that appeals are kept in the Minister's Department for so long before a decision is reached.  This holds up planning development all over the country and gives headaches to all of us.  There should be some way of spreading responsibility around to a few more people rather than having everything dealt with by the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>We in this party are not satisfied with the system and we have not been satisfied with it for a long time.  We have made certain recommendations to the Minister.  Our recommendations may not be entirely satisfactory either from the point of view of the speed at which appeals could be considered. That is the one defect I see in our proposal. At least appeals would be given impartial consideration and all of us would like to see that.</P>

      <P>I believe that if the Minister put sufficient pressure on the local authorities not to send cases up to him which should obviously be approved at local level, he would reduce the backlog.  Local authority officials respond to whatever the Department want them to do in this regard.  Some people are more of a nuisance than anything else by being far too malicious.</P>
      <P>One of the things that has created endless difficulty for us all over County Dublin&mdash;and I wish the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister would apply themselves to this&mdash;is that they sent out a circular a couple of years ago about not building on and not giving access to certain roads.  No matter where anybody proposes to build in County Dublin, whether it is a single house or two or three houses, we are told there is a traffic hazard.  By now I do not know what is not a traffic hazard.  We have made a farce out of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the most remote areas of County Dublin applications are turned down at local authority level because an engineer decides that in order to comply with the Minister's wishes he must say it is a traffic hazard.  Once he says it is a traffic hazard he becomes the planner, because the attitude of the planning manager is: &ldquo;The engineer is a professional man.  I have to ask his advice.  If he tells me this is a traffic hazard.  I have no option but to accept what he tells me and turn down this application.&rdquo; This must be clarified. The Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary have responsibility to clarify it.  It is causing endless trouble all over County Dublin.  The circular should be explained.  It should be explained that only in obvious circumstances where it would create a serious traffic hazard that an objection would be raised.  What are the roads for if not <Col N="930" /> to give access?  I do not know how the Department have not done something about this long ago.</P>
    <P>We come now to the question of building houses in rural environments. I have known of cases in my own constituency where the building of a house on a ten-acre site has been turned down because the land was zoned as agricultural.  Did anyone ever hear anything as crazy as that?  We had a limitation of five acres where a septic tank was involved.  Now people with ten-acre sites are being refused permission to build houses because the Minister has turned down a few cases on appeal.  I should like to show the Parliamentary Secretary details of such cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the local authority.  The local authority draw up the development plan which arranges the zoning. If an area is zoned &ldquo;agricultural&rdquo;, then one cannot build houses there.</P>

It would look as if one cannot build a house in rural Ireland and as if anybody with a wish to do so will not be allowed to build.  I want to live in rural Ireland.  Many other people also want to live in the country.  They do not want to live in towns or cities. The Parliamentary Secretary should take up this point with the Minister. We are all harassed by complaints of this kind.  I understand the difficulties of the people involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by what I see throughout my own constituency a change for the better is coming. Sanction is now being given for the erection of small numbers of houses in various villages.  That is a step in the right direction.  I wish to thank the Minister for it.  The Minister is a young man and he and his Parliamentary Secretary have a very difficult job to do.</P>
      <P>In the past I was present at many county council meetings where the question of housing was raised.  The county manager and his staff would get out leaflets and would say that they would have to advertise in order to see what the demand was for houses in a particular area.  At that particular time there might not have been much demand because people, although they might be urgently in need of houses, might not put down their names because they were unprepared financially to take on the payments for a house.  They did not know what their rent would be or where they would be by the time the houses would have been built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now reached a stage where the Department and the local authorities are using common sense and where they say &ldquo;We will build four houses in Drumshanbo so that there will be family houses available there.&rdquo; I welcome that move.  We are tired of being told that the local authority will have to wait to see what demand exists in a particular area.  That was no way to solve the problem.  It has happened also that an official might arrive at a place like Kiltyclogher only to discover <Col N="932" /> that there was no house there for him. The county council might have done a survey of the area and have decided that there was no application for a house in that area, but they had no idea that a teacher or a superintendent was about to move into that area from another place and would be looking for a house.</P>
    <P>The housing situation is still somewhat unsatisfactory.  Many people have been on waiting lists for a very long time.  The Department of Local Government know that a big change has taken place in this country.  If our entry to the EEC brings about the changes we hope for, more money and more employment should be available and there will be a greater demand for housing.</P>
    <P>The trend today is for young people to seek employment wherever it may be and to get married younger.  This results in a greater demand for housing. I hope that our entry to the EEC will make more money and more employment available.  The Department of Local Government should be prepared to provide more houses in this country. Housing is very important.  As other Deputies have mentioned, better housing is vitally necessary.  In the villages and towns which I have mentioned there are many people still without homes.  We have eight houses on the list for Ballinamore, County Leitrim. These houses have not yet been commenced. People are counting the weeks and months until those houses will be completed.  The Minister should check on this point.  There may be some undue delay which could easily be rectified.</P>
    <P>Sligo town has been a progressive town over the past five or six years.  It has made great strides.  The number of people employed there and the greater number of marriages mean that there is greater demand for houses.  I go there every Saturday to meet my constituents. It is often hard to convince those people that housing will be provided for them in the near future. Very fine housing schemes have been carried out but the demand for housing continues to grow.  Housing schemes have been carried out by Sligo Corporation and Sligo County Council who <Col N="933" /> have given Trojan service but money must be provided and sanction given for the construction of a greater number of houses.</P>
    <P>This morning I received information about 12 sites for which certificates are awaited from the Land Registry.  The certificates should be issued as quickly as possible so that Sligo County Council can proceed with the provision of Houses.  The provision of these houses would contribute to the contentment of families who are now badly housed.  I do not have to tell the Parliamentary Secretary, who represents a constituency like my own, of the suffering entailed in having to live in bad conditions.</P>
    <P>There has been difficulty in regard to contracts for local authority houses in Leitrim and also in Sligo due to the fact that the contract price is not sufficiently attractive.  A few years ago the contract price for a four-bedroom county council house was in the region of £2,250.  The Department must be brought to a realisation of the fact that costs have increased within the past 18 months, that if we are to increase the housing output there must be an increase in the contract price. I have had queries from persons residing in Kinlough, Ballinamore and throughout the constituency as to when houses will be provided for them so that they can move out of the terribly bad houses in which they now have to live.  The cost of providing a house for a man and wife and family is £5,000, without any extras.  Contractors cannot work for nothing.  Wages have increased.  The working week has been reduced.  Output is not as high as it was.  For all these reasons there has been a slowing down while so many people in rural areas wait to be housed.</P>
    <P>About a week ago homes for the aged were officially opened in a County Leitrim village.  Each home consists of two apartments, a kitchen and a bedroom. In my view it would be better to provide three apartment homes.  You may have a husband and wife living in such a home.  In the event of a home becoming vacant, it could be used to house a family if there were sufficient space.  The concept of two apartment homes should be abandoned.  Eventually, if the homes consisted of at least <Col N="934" /> three apartments they could be used to house a family who urgently needed to be housed.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we were glad to get money to carry out essential repairs under section 5.  The scheme that we had in progress is almost completed and now we have another type of scheme for houses for aged persons. It was very useful, where aged persons were in remote areas and wanted to move in nearer the town, to have small prefabricated houses for individuals or larger prefabricated houses for husbands and wives.  These provided a real answer to a problem.  However, I should not like to see a proliferation of prefabricated houses which might spoil the landscape.  When the houses are no longer required in an area, their usefulness is at an end because the cost of removing them to another area is prohibitive. At a vocational committee meeting recently an estimate was produced for the removal of two prefabricated houses from Manorhamilton. The estimated cost was as high as the cost originally paid for the structure. The question of the provision of homes for the aged should be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If homes for the aged were being provided on a fairly large scale the difference in cost between providing a two apartment house and a three apartment house would not be very great.  Recently I met a man in Sligo town who told me that he had a two room house but now has his two daughters living with him and there is not sufficient accommodation.  He requires a maisonette or other type of house.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Department on sanctioning schemes of homes for the aged and I must thank the local authorities for carrying out the work. The people who have got the homes are proud of them.  I am not finding fault with the homes when I suggest that an extra apartment would make all the difference.</P>
    <P>Throughout the constituency problems arise in connection with planning. If planning regulations were not so rigid more houses would be built.  There is a proposal to build 12 new houses on the main Bundoran road and, if this <Col N="935" /> proposal is sanctioned, the housing problem will be alleviated to a great extent.  These houses would be a great boon in the area and the Department can lay down whatever regulations they think necessary.</P>
    <P>Tourism is alleged to be a great industry.  It has not been a very healthy industry since 1969, mainly because of the crisis in the North.  This year, because of the crisis and the bad weather, the season will be a very poor one. Hotels are empty.</P>
    <P>With regard to sites, I know of six sites which were sold and suddenly the Department changed their mind and said that the sites would have to be half acre instead of quarter acre sites.  These were on the Sligo/Manor-hamilton road and would have provided no hazard of any kind to traffic. As a result of the Department's decision, no houses are now being built there.  This kind of thing will not solve the housing problem.  These people were prepared to build their own houses and, in that way, they would have relieved the burden on the local authority.  I know many people who are disappointed when they are told they cannot build wherever it is they want to build.  In the case of the houses I have mentioned, the reason given for refusal was interference with scenic amenities.  The Department should be slow to refuse planning permission.  For a long time the complaint has been that so many homes were closing in the west.  Yet, when it is proposed to provide more homes, planning permission is refused.  I know a man who was prepared to build 80 houses; he ran into a bit of trouble, but I think the problem will be solved by his building about 60 houses.</P>
    <P>Where reconstruction is concerned certain difficulties arise.  Plans have to be prepared and a great deal of delay is suffered before things are finalised. I cannot understand the reason for the delay.  This is merely reconstruction work.  Why should there be all this red tape?  These people should be told they can go ahead.  Reconstruction will certainly not interfere with traffic.</P>
    <P>Awaiting sanction is a headache. <Col N="936" /> There are long delays.  Surely the Minister could shorten the period.  The county manager and the county engineer should be quite capable of reporting to the Department that everything is O.K.  That would help to avoid delay.</P>

      <P>The average farmer has to get sanction.  There are times when people have suspicions regarding planning permissions that are granted on appeals.  In my constituency an application made to the Department was turned down because of the proximity of the main road to the proposed building.  Afterwards, however, the applicant was able to tell us that he got permission on appeal because of political influence.  I can understand permission being refused but it annoys me to find that, despite what was said in the first instance, permission can then be granted because, as this person alleged, political influence was used.  Such practice does not augur well either for the Minister or for Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to vested cottages I understand that under existing law the holder can only retain his rights if he spends not longer than a specified length of time away from the dwelling. In practice what is happening is that the holders of these cottages are away in England and only return very <Col N="937" /> occasionally.  This situation should not be allowed to continue because of the shortage of housing accommodation. There may be married couples with young children who would be only too glad of these cottages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct.  In order to retain the rights to a vested cottage, a person must sleep there on at least one night in 18 months.  The Parliamentary Secretary should know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not good enough that a cottage is left idle except for one night in 18 months while there are people who are badly in need of housing.  I have the case of a young married couple who have been in touch with me in relation to a vacant cottage in their area.  Court proceedings are pending but these are very slow.  This whole question should be examined.  At least, the time limit should be shorter.  Perhaps, it might be reduced to 12 months.</P>
      <P>Regarding the £17 allowance against an employee on a farm I would ask the Department to consider increasing that sum.  It has not been increased during the past 30 years.  It should be at least £30 today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rates are a major problem.  As I said on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works, there will come a day when the ratepayers will organise in protest against the increasing burden of rates.  With the exception of one <Col N="938" /> occasion in the past 23 years I have not known a year in which the rates were not increased and each year the increase is greater than in the previous year.  When we remember that only one-fifth of the community pay rates we realise how heavy is the burden on those people.  The Government must try to find some other way of collecting money.  A few years ago we had the sad experience of the farming community creating trouble. At that stage the Government came to the rescue to the extent of providing about £2 million to ease the situation. However, the same sort of problem could arise again.  Small farmers in the west of Ireland find that, after the reviser has visited them, their valuation is increased substantially.  Of course, that is done in order to compensate for the derating of those whose valuation is less than £20.  The rate in my county is now more than £6 in the £.</P>
    <P>I have been saying here for a number of years that some of the road schemes that have been carried out could very well have been left until some more pressing problems had been dealt with. Throughout the country there are still many miles of road to be rolled and tarred.  On some of the main roads the Department are tackling schemes that may cost over £100,000.  I have used some of those roads for 20 years.  They are solid, firm roads that have not changed.  They may not be very straight but they bore well the traffic they carried.  Now we see a scheme being carried out which may cost over £100,000 and the old road is being bypassed. It may be said the road was dangerous but our experience is that the better type of road is the one on which the more serious accidents occur.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday morning at a crossroads outside Drumsna there was a traffic accident in which a young woman and a ten-year old boy were killed.  That was a crossing at which you could turn a train.  This shows that it is not at the most dangerous places that accidents occur.  Only a week earlier six people were killed between Kilcullen and Newbridge on an excellent road.  Some of these very elaborate schemes should be left undone <Col N="939" /> and we should deal with the lesser roads serving the needs of the small farming community and the money saved could be channelled into housing or some other purpose for which it is needed more.</P>
    <P>There is a reduction in the local improvements schemes grant from almost £100,000 to £43,000 in the case of County Leitrim this year.  It will be very difficult to attempt to deal with the demand for such schemes.  At all times we have had about 650 applications. Now Leitrim County Council must attempt to deal with them but I suggest it would be better for the council to cease accepting applications until the backlog is cleared.  Otherwise, we are only fooling people.  A sum of £43,000 in County Leitrim is small but the position is still worse in Sligo.  Last year, County Sligo got £35,000 which dropped to £9,000 this year.  That is very serious from the point of employment and getting schemes carried out. Very useful work was being done under this scheme.  Progress was being made. This is, I think, the third year of the scheme to have local improvements carried out by local authorities. Hitherto, these were dealt with by Earlsfort Terrace.  The present scheme took more than a year to get properly launched but it was proving satisfactory. Now we are going backwards because in Sligo's case £9,000 is insignificant because in that county there are so many by-roads in great need of repair and, as in the case of Leitrim, much drainage work needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Those are the only schemes between the arterial drainage scheme and the small farmer.  There is no other scheme available to them.  Some other scheme should be introduced to relieve the situation created as a result of the drop in grants received.  There is a middle-type drainage scheme that cannot be dealt with under the local improvements scheme and which is too small for an arterial drainage scheme.  I have said before that something should be done in this area to deal with the middle type of river that causes greater destruction, perhaps, than any other.</P>
    <P>Only a week ago I mentioned the need for some type of schemes similar <Col N="940" /> to the bog development scheme which has gone and has not been replaced except by the local improvements scheme.  I believe the mountain roads will become impassable because the lowland people will not contribute to a scheme three, four or five miles away from them, knowing that one big flood would undo the work again.  I hope the Department will in the near future introduce some scheme to deal with the middle type of river and with mountain roads.</P>
    <P>Fuel has become very costly and people are inclined to go back to the bogs for turf.  A short time ago one could buy 1 cwt of coal for 10s, 11s, or 12s.  Now for a good type of coal it costs £1 and if people possibly can, they will try to get fuel from the bogs. Two or three cases have been brought to my notice and that is why I mention the matter.  I ask the Department to give urgent consideration to helping such cases.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about swimming pools, and a swimming pool is a great asset to any community, but I believe that good housing and good roads should get priority over swimming pools.  I am proud to say that we have a swimming pool in Drumshanbo, which is giving excellent results.  We have, or hope to have before long&mdash;because it has been sanctioned by the council&mdash;a swimming pool in Carrick-on-Shannon but, against that, I am all in favour of putting housing first.  The family with bad housing will certainly have no interest in a swimming pool.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to the Parliamentary Secretary last week and he told me about the increase of £200 for a three, four or five-roomed house from the Department and in most cases £200 from the local authority.  I welcome that increase which should encourage many people to reconstruct their homes.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see an increase in the new house grant.  This is badly needed because everything has increased in price and only with a bit of economy will the key be turned in a five-roomed bungalow now at £5,000.  The country is calling out for an increase in house grants.  A great <Col N="941" /> number of people are anxious to avail of the higher rate of grant which shows that they require all the money they can possibly get from the local authority and from the Department because costs are so very high.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to water and sewerage schemes.  The machinery for dealing with these schemes is very slow.  A sewerage scheme for my local village went before the court three weeks ago.  The powers of compulsory acquisition had to be invoked in order to get a place for a septic tank. Time and again I have asked about this matter.  Only last week I asked a question of the Minister and he told me that sanction has gone out.  I hope this work will soon be carried out because the people of this village are tired waiting for this scheme.  It is a village of great tourist attraction but we have not got the facilities.</P>
    <P>There is a village called Ballintogher in County Sligo which has only got a local sewerage scheme.  The answer we get when we inquire about this is that when the regional water supply scheme for Sligo is completed Ballintogher will get a supply.  It is a case of live horse and you will get grass.  There is an excellent water supply convenient to the town if the Department and the local authority would only tackle the job.  There may be a problem there about a park but that could be got over instead of leaving villages without water and sewerage. I would ask the Department to get those things speeded up.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to people who acted as organisers and subscribers to group schemes.  The people who acted as organisers did Trojan work.  It was a tough job and the Department owes a lot to those people.  At one stage we were told that regional schemes would be provided throughout the length and breadth of the country and that everybody would have a water supply.  While grass grows that could not be done in some areas.  The group scheme is the answer.  There is a complete breakdown in the water scheme in Kinlough. The water caused corrosion and the machinery broke down.  I was in touch with the Department about <Col N="942" /> this about 18 months ago.  At that time the Department were not prepared to incur further expenditure on it but I am again asking that it should be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I have to say about this Estimate is quite simple.  With an expenditure of £15,575,000 there is a decrease of £450,000.  Are Fianna Fáil interested in housing?  Are Fianna Fáil interested in putting water and sewerage pipes under the roads?  The answer is that they are not because you cannot calculate these things in relation to the last election.  I think of the time when I was defeated for the Dáil but came back.  There was the Korean War or the Suez crisis and it was impossible to borrow money.  Of the £15 million that we are now discussing I would say that most of that money is borrowed.  These people were prepared at that time to cure that crisis by an expedient that the people of Ireland should never forget.  It is true that some of them have forgotten. That expedient was to build not 12,000 or 13,000 houses per year but to build 4,500 houses per year for at least five years.  Deputy Declan Costello at the time asked a series of questions here.  On his first questioning he was rebutted.  They produced some sort of an expedient whereby he did not get his answer but eventually he got the answer.  The figure at the moment is about 15,000 or 16,000 houses per year as per a Department circular we discussed at Drogheda Corporation last Tuesday night. Eventually, Deputy Declan Costello succeeded in producing the facts and the facts were that the way of curing that financial crisis was simple, a rotten Fianna Fáil administration, who had achieved government on a trick, reduced the number of houses being built per year from 13,000 or 14,000 to about 4,500 per year for five years.  That means, if you take it over four or five years, that whatever way they have done their job since, however they are involved financially&mdash; and Taca still exists&mdash;however they were involved in the building of offices, they have now reached the stage where they are building the <Col N="943" /> number of houses that should be built, in other words, 15,000 to 17,000 houses.  They can never catch up on their sins of the past.  We all live with our sins.  Unfortunately, in politics and finance you cannot live with your sins.  It is impossible.  You have got to realise that your mistakes of the past &mdash;and &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; is a kindly word&mdash; live with you.  I now charge Fianna Fáil with not building 40,000 houses and that means 40,000 young married couples are not housed.</P>
      <P>I would love to get my hands on the Department of Local Government and to have in the Cabinet somebody &mdash;not the gentleman from Cork&mdash;who was prepared to say: &ldquo;There is a priority on housing.&rdquo; At this moment in time there is no priority on housing. Let the House ring with that.  There is no priority on housing and the reason is very simple.  The Government are deeply involved in the provision of offices&mdash;and this is a political charge&mdash; and in the building of things that make money and they are not interested in housing.  Let the papers produce this fact.  They are very lax at present in looking at the facts and producing the true news.  That does not help me.  It means I will get &ldquo;damn all&rdquo; publicity for the next six months if things go the way they normally go but I do not care twopence.</P>
      <P>Local government means housing; it means sewerage; it means water. When you put your hand in your pocket now your mind thinks your hand is mad because the price of everything has gone up and up.  Here is the Book of Estimates and the net decrease on £15 million expenditure is £450,000. Let that be recorded.  Forget about whether I am making a good contribution today.  Forget about whether I said the right or the wrong thing.  Let somebody put that in print.  On housing and water and sewerage schemes, Fianna Fáil have decided they will spend £500,000 less than they spent last year.  Let that be recorded.  Let those who are here accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, by the Grace of God, by 13 solid Fine Gael votes and one decent Labour vote, chairman of Louth County Council for the sixth time.  I <Col N="944" /> am frustrated to the degree that if I were to take the advice that is given to me I would resign and walk away.  In every village in County Louth I have a housing scheme running for me and I cannot get sanction for them.  We play ping-pong, a marvellous game I understand, played slowly.  I do not like playing that sort of game slowly. Because of the meanness of the Fianna Fáil administration and their dereliction of duty and their responsibility for the housing of people, that administration must be changed.  I see no way of changing it except by a getting together of the people who are really interested, and that means Fine Gael and Labour.  Why should they not be interested?</P>
    <P>We are talking of a figure of around £500 million of Government expenditure. Private housing grants have increased by £200,000.  I am sure there are people here who could work that out as a percentage but I will not bother my head because it is not their fault.  It is the fault of the politicians. We are now moving to the stage where more private houses are being built than in years gone by.  People want to build their own houses and why should they not?  That being so, we have got an increase of £200,000 on £4,500,000. Consider the increase in the cost of a house.  Look at the figures.  I am a businessman, and I do not profess to be a good one, but I profess to look at figures and know the way they talk back to me.  I am quite convinced that an increase of £200,000 on £4,500,000 for private housing grants is a joke.  To meet the increase in the cost of materials as distinct from the increase in the cost of labour it would take at least three times that amount.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Blaney were Minister for Local Government this would not happen. He would be in there doing his job at Cabinet meetings and he would make very certain that, instead of there being a net decrease of £450,000&mdash; which means that Fianna Fáil do not want houses, do not want water schemes, and do not want sewerage schemes&mdash;there would be an increase of at least £2 million.  Maybe I am wrong.</P>
    <P>Imagine the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="945" /> to the Minister for Local Government not knowing that if a man sleeps in a vested cottage once every 18 months he can keep it.  Imagine him saying that across the House to me.  This will be recorded, and although I never read what I say I will read it this time.  A note was passed over, as Deputy McLaughlin was speaking, and I said what I know, which is that once every 18 months is enough, and yet the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government did not know that.</P>

      <Col N="946" /> The infrastructure of this country is highly important.  Planning should be done.  We must decide at some stage that we are going to spend money.  Fianna Fáil have always regulated a stage like that to suit an election.  That is the way they play and will continue to do so as long as they are in office.  There is a point at which a decision must be made whether it is about water and sewerage or about a main arterial road. People have to make decisions which may sometimes be wrong.  The Fianna Fáil Government have never been prepared to take those decisions.  They were always prepared to prostitute themselves politically and take decisions that might, perhaps, in one constituency or another get &ldquo;another fellow home&rdquo;.  They are the worst of the worst.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I come now to the question of water supply and sewerage. As chairman of Louth County Council, I know that in a field belonging to Mr. Paddy Byrne in Castlebellingham there is a pumping station. If we could increase the capacity of that pumping station, we would then be able to supply the village of Blackrock, which is a suburb of Dundalk, and all around Dundalk with water. At the same time the Department of Local Government have received plans for six or seven housing schemes from us.  If I die tonight&mdash;which God forbid, and God forbid that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or the Parliamentary Secretary should die tonight either&mdash;I would say that my contribution to my fellowmen was not anything except that I produced plans for housing schemes in every village in County Louth.  I know that the Minister for Local Government must wait until sanction comes from the Minister for Finance.  Sanction has not come quickly enough from the Minister for Finance.  The policy of Fianna Fáil is not to spend money on houses or on water or sewerage schemes. Such expenditure does not buy votes.</P>
    <P>I have given certain percentages, which others have worked out.  I have clearly indicated that in relation to the national purse our expenditure on local government schemes is insignificant. The increase that would make a spectacular <Col N="947" /> improvement in the situation in so far as young people are concerned would not cost large sums of money. In this 19th Dáil Fianna Fáil have failed quite specifically to pinpoint the situation.  The Department of Local Government have not acknowledged the problems.  They have no answers. The Minister will talk about something else.  In relation to the amount of money being spent at this moment in time, the expenditure on housing, water and sewerage schemes is minimal. In fact, if one were to think about what would happen and a situation where, perhaps, one might become a Minister of State, one would regard Local Government as an easy Ministry. It is wide open.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government does not even know the law.  A figure of £15 million in relation to £500 million is stupid.</P>
    <P>We must look at the individual decreases. That is an easy task.  If ever I stood up in Dáil Éireann with an easy task to do, it was today.  I do not have to work or to do homework.  The whole situation is spread out in front of me. There is a decrease of £600,000 on local improvement scheme grants. About 15 years ago the late Senator William Woods was chairman of Louth County Council.  He had a report prepared in County Louth, the smallest county in Ireland.  It is an easy county to deal with and one which has theoretically no problems. The late Senator Woods had costs prepared in regard to providing county council service on lanes with two or more people living on them.  The figure at that time was £212,000.  The costs nowadays would be at least £400,000.  These ratepayers must now face the fact that there is a reduction of £600,000 in the provision for local improvements schemes.  The position is quite simple in County Louth.  There is a queue. If the Parliamentary Secretary lived up a lane in County Louth he would have the right to apply for a local improvements scheme grant and to go into the queue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is capital. Do not worry about that.  There is a decrease in the local improvements scheme grants at a time when there is greater need than ever under this subhead.  There is the point to be considered that those who pay heavy rates should get something back and one of the things they can get back, individually, is an improvement of a local lane. In County Louth there may be 1,000 persons on a road who may be quite content with the access they have to the road but there are always five or ten substantial ratepayers who have a lane of half a mile or a quarter of a mile leading to their houses and that lane is in a very bad condition.  Naturally these people are disgruntled.  They want to be put in the same position as their neighbours.  It may be suggested that they should not have bought a house in such a situation. One usually finds that they have been there for generations.  People who pay high rates should have the lanes leading to their homes taken in charge by the county council within a reasonable period so that the lanes can be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Louth County Council is the best county council in Ireland, even including Donegal.  They had to face the capital cost of £400,000 of taking in charge all these lanes.  If one penny in the £ represents £1,300 or £1,400, there could not possibly be a capital expenditure of £400,000.  Therefore, we had to use the local improvements scheme vote.  We had to ensure that each year we would get the Government grant and the county council unanimously decided that each lane that was brought up to county council standard under a local improvements <Col N="950" /> scheme grant would be taken over by the county council and would become a county council road.</P>
    <P>This year there is a reduction of £600,000.  The situation in Louth is that last year we got the first grant of £6,000 and two supplementary grants, making a total grant of £11,000.  The number of lanes improved is related in some degree to the grant.  If there are large ratepayers on a lane, the local contribution is higher and the amount of the grant is reduced.  Where there are small ratepayers on the lane, the local contribution is lower and the grant is increased.  This means that Mayo, for instance, which gets a grant of £40,000 under this heading, is very much better off than we are.  Other factors arise where you have a large ratepayer on a lane.  I am thinking, in fact, of the Nunnery land lane in Termonfeckin, County Louth.  The house is at the top of the lane.  The land adjoins the lane on both sides. There is no reason why the person should pay towards the repair of the lane.  He goes down in his rubber boots to look at his cattle or his nephew may drive him down on the tractor. He looks at his cattle and at his land. He has no reason at all for paying any money towards the upkeep of that lane.  At the other end there is a very decent man who has a problem of sight; that is the kindest way to put it. Both these gentlemen have high valuations. The only way in which the LIS could be done was if these two gentlemen provided a large sum towards the scheme, making it possible for the cottagers along the lane to contribute £7 or £7.50 towards the scheme.  These two gentlemen provided £125 each.  The lane is now in the care of the county council.</P>
    <P>There are two points.  The first is that the scheme is utterly wrong. Secondly, the amount of money voted is wholly inadequate.  Why there should be a decrease of £600,000 passes my comprehension.  The figure 15 years ago was £212,000; <i>pro rata</i> it should surely be at least £400,000 today. If you take 1p in the £ for rates, there are people paying this rate who will never reap any benefit from this road.  The reduction is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>With regard to differential rents, <Col N="951" /> there are several problems.  On the Continent it is said that one pays more for one's house and less for one's living than one does here.  I do not propose to discuss the correctness or otherwise of that statement.  There is a case to be made for the differential renting system, but the present system does not work properly.  The scale of charges is not right and it needs to be revised. At the moment there are very poor people in local authority houses and there are also very rich people in these houses.  Tenants who have occupied these houses for 20 or 25 years and who now have children earning are in a much better position than the young couple starting out on married life.  The former should pay a higher rent.  That is only fair.</P>
    <P>The only way in which the system could be changed would be by having a tenant purchase scheme under which the tenant would accept all liabilities, leaking roofs, cracked walls, the lot. I am all for such a system.  Mark you, NATO have not asked for a change in the system.  They have been highly critical, but they have not asked that the differential renting system should be done away with.  What is needed is a change in the scale of charges.  I have been 17 years a member of the joint employer/labour committee in the milling industry and I know that, at the beginning of negotiations, the position is that this, that and the other is impossible.  There is a bargain that can be made.  It is a matter of getting through to the NATO people who would be prepared to bargain. Perhaps at this point in time the making of such a bargain would seem difficult from the State's point of view but as a businessman I shall put forward a certain philosophy.  I would suggest that the Government would make a bargain now in respect of differential rents.  While this may seem a little generous now I am confident that in a few years time, because of the fall in the value of money, it would prove to have been a good bargain.</P>
    <P>The employment allowance of £17 on rates should be scrapped.  The political line that has been taken in respect of the west of Ireland was that when <Col N="952" /> holdings were derated, the people would be given an employment allowance also through the Department of Social Welfare, but there is a case for a higher employment allowance through the good areas of Ireland. Would any farmer decide to employ or not to employ a man on the basis of £17?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Either it should be discontinued altogether or the amount of money should be increased considerably. This is another aspect of the vote that indicates the laxity of the Government. This laxity is obvious right through the Vote, first, in its size and, secondly on the various items in it.  In relation to agricultural work anybody who suggests that £17 would be the decisive factor in employing a person, not for one week in the year but for 52 weeks, is being unrealistic.  That is the reason why both Deputy Tully and I wish for a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the confines of the Estimate we are not allowed discuss the other reasons.  However, there is another reason that can be raised here.  In an expenditure of £500 million the allocation for water supply and sewerage is only £2,854,000.  In the village of Castlebellingham, for instance, there is an archaic sewerage system that was installed about 100 years ago by the Bellinghams.  These sewerage works smell at this time of the year but we have no money to provide a proper system.  On Monday last we refused unanimously to allow 18 houses to be connected to the system because we knew that an outlet for sewerage from 18 houses could not be provided.  This Government are not prepared to take certain steps that are necessary.  Everything in this country has been prostituted to the Fianna Fáil situation.  At all times they are prepared to relate everything to votes. One of our problems in, perhaps between three to 12 months time, will be to sell to the people the fact that there is to be, not a programme for economic expansion, but that there will be <Col N="953" /> during five years a plan of capital expenditure that will involve the ordinary people of the villages of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The value of approximately two-thirds <Col N="960" /> of our merchandise exports, which go to the United Kingdom, remains unaffected by the floating of the £ sterling with which we are maintaining parity. As regards the remaining one-third it is not possible to assess the average percentage price effect.  Since floating, the value of the £ sterling in terms of other currencies is determined by the state of supply and demand in foreign exchange markets and rates of exchange have tended to fluctuate widely and continually.  It can be said, however, that floating is most unlikely to have had any effect as yet on these exports because of the delayed impact of changes in exchange rates on the terms of trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst salmon may find it difficult, due to pollution and consequent low oxygen content of the water of the River Liffey, to move up river from the estuary at times of low tide, they are able to do so in suitable flow conditions.  There is no conclusive evidence that they are otherwise affected by pollution.  The Dublin Board of Conservators is responsible for the protection of salmon stocks in the Liffey and it takes suitable action under the provisions of the Fisheries Acts regarding pollution whenever the necessary evidence can be adduced.</P>
      <P>The planning and taking of remedial measures are, of course, matters for agencies, other than my Department, with responsibility for securing a due standard of water quality in the river. It is understood that certain of these agencies are at present engaged in conducting a survey of the River Liffey and Dublin Bay with such purposes in view.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware from the opening speech of my colleague, the Minister for Local Government on the Estimates for his Department that a number of local authority drainage projects, <i>et cetera</i>, will also make a major contribution towards the elimination of pollution in the Liffey and other Dublin rivers.

      <P>I am aware that the company in question have incorporated cover for personal effects as a compulsory element in all their motor insurance policies.  As I have said on many occasions before, I am not satisfied with the present position in the motor insurance market generally, and I propose to look closely at the whole position when I receive the interim report of the Committee on Insurance, which I hope to do shortly. While I hope that it may be possible to remove or modify some of the undesirable practices which have grown up in motor insurance in recent years, it is only right to add that because of the high incidence of road accidents the prospect of a reduction in the overall cost of insurance does not seem at this stage to be good.</P>

      <P>There is no question of the high rate of accidents.  Does the Minister consider that this company are justified in including compulsorily a certain amount for personal effects when the insurer has stated deliberately that he does not want them covered? The company are insisting that £3 or £4 must be included in the premium for personal effects.  Otherwise they will not cover the person.</P>

The insurance company of which the Deputy speaks are linked in with a private motorists protection association of which all who insure with this company are members.

      <P>I understand that there was an increase, operative from 1st May, 1972, in the import price of Scotch whiskey to this country equivalent to 1.625p per glass.  It will be seen, therefore, that the reduction in the duty on imported spirits of UK origin which is equivalent to 1.617p per glass is counterbalanced by the import price increase.  It is unlikely, therefore, that there will be any resulting change in retail prices as far as whiskey imported from the UK is concerned.  With regard to other spirits, such as gin and vodka, I am asking the National Prices Commission to have regard to the reduction in customs duty when they are considering their recommendation on the application for an increase in drink prices generally which is at present before the commission.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy has in mind inquiries relating to the establishment of new industries. Generally such inquiries are not related <Col N="973" /> to specific areas and are not recorded statistically by reference to regions.  The information required is not therefore readily available in the Industrial Development Authority but it can be stated that the number of projects approved for the midland region since its establishment is 12.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his <Col N="977" /> Department were consulted by the Industrial Development Authority with regard to the decision taken by the authority to use the services of a foreign concern to make a promotional film for Irish industry; whether any Irish concerns were approached to do this; and, if not, why.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department were not consulted with regard to the production of this promotional film.  This, as the Deputy will appreciate, is a matter of day-to-day administration of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may have seen the statement made by the authority and referred to in the Irish newspapers of 29th June which indicated that the IDA are producing a film to be used in their overseas promotional programmes, particularly in the United States.  The objective of the film is to portray Ireland as an attractive location in which to establish manufacturing industry. The IDA consulted with and had advice from many people involved in the Irish film industry before deciding to employ a director with first-hand knowledge of the specialist needs of its principal market.  The IDA emphasise that in contracting out the making of the film to Mr. Robert Ginna, on the recommendation of their New York office, they insisted that he recruit Irish personnel for all production work.  The film is currently being shot by an all-Irish crew.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is not every day in the week the IDA decide on having film promotional material?  In that sense, it is not an everyday routine decision.  Is the Minister aware that by using a foreign producer, when competent Irish producers were available to do this work, we are advertising internationally our incapacity to produce adequate film work of this kind?  A committee is sitting on the possible creation of an Irish film industry.  It seems paradoxical that a semi-State agency should be advertising internationally our total incompetence in this area and that the Minister should be standing idly by processing his decision, and that in the meantime the IDA have prevailed on Mr. Ginna to change <Col N="978" /> his citizenship.  The Minister should hurry up his processing.  Realistic objections have been made by Irish film-makers of international repute who were not adequately consulted before this very important decision of the IDA was taken.</P>

      <P>The total pension varies according to individual circumstances but, generally speaking, these widows receive a pension of £260 a year.  In addition, an <i>ex-gratia</i> pension is payable.

Is it not a fact, and do the Minister's records not prove this, that it was as a result of the incident which took place in Westport, County Mayo, on 18th July, and which I raised by way of Parliamentary question on 5th August, that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána in general have instituted files in practically every Garda station in the country?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The method by which records of persons convicted of offences or cautioned under the juvenile liaison officer scheme are compiled and retained is a matter of internal Garda administration and it is not the practice to disclose information about it.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to disclose what information, if any, may be supplied by the Garda in relation to persons who are candidates for posts in the public service and who have come to the notice of the Garda in connection with crime.

      <P>I must protest very strongly against this appallingly ambiguous and equivocal reply. Before giving notice of my desire to raise the matter on the Adjournment, I must ask the Minister does he seriously think, where a juvenile under 17 years of age gets a caution, that that is a crime record as such.  The Minister has used the terms &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; and &ldquo;caution&rdquo; as if they were equal.  Surely the Minister realises that where a garda or juvenile liaison officer administers a caution, and there is no conviction, and where the person is under 17 years of age, there should not be a public crime record of that.  Any child or any parent must be alarmed at the Minister's reply.  At this rate there must be hundreds of children with crime records and when they apply at 18 or 20 years of age for a job as postman, they will be faced with this crime record of the fact that at 16 years of age they were caught taking a few sweets in a shop and received a caution from a garda.  Such crime records will affect their future lives. It is an absolutely appalling plight.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is in the public interest that there should be a clear-cut differentiation in the Garda recording system of convictions and cautions administered by gardaí and juvenile liaison officers?  There should be no circumstances in which children under 17 years of age, who have never been before a court and who have received only a single caution, should be publicly pilloried later on in life.  This could apply to any child, including the Minister's, if he got a caution.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Would the Minister not agree that it should be public policy, as well as Government policy, to try to rehabilitate youths who have fallen foul of the law by getting them suitable employment, where possible, rather than pursuing the policy which Deputy Desmond's question would indicate is being pursued?  These little breaches of the law, if they are breaches, are held against them indefinitely.

      <P>If a similar number of firearm certificates in each of those categories were issued during the year commencing 1st August, 1972, an increase of £95,322 in revenue would accrue.

      <P>The woman in question had not sought or obtained an Irish visa and she was refused leave to land on arrival.</P>
      <P>This is related to the known problems that can arise with <i>au pair</i> or similar arrangements coupled with the fact that, in the case of certain countries, there are currency restrictions which would make it difficult or impossible for persons stranded here to secure financial support from their home country.  Moreover, in these cases repatriation, if it becomes necessary, would present special difficulties.</P>
      <P>I regret that the young woman concerned was apparently misled by the sponsors of her projected visit.  These sponsors, it should be made clear, are acting in their own commercial interests and it is obvious that they were well aware of the policy as can be seen from the fact that they advised her to travel through London rather than to come here direct, and also advised her as to what to say&mdash;or rather, what not to say.</P>

I presume Deputy O'Leary was not.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated earlier today to the Deputy that certain negotiations <Col N="993" /> are taking place at the moment which may result in the reciprocal abolition of visa requirements between Ireland and Yugoslavia and, as all such requirements are dealt with on a reciprocal basis, this is the possible outcome of the negotiations, but I cannot foretell what the outcome will be.</P>

      <P>I have received representations in this matter.  The position is that the new pension arrangements for widows of public servants aim at providing similar treatment for the widows of the different categories of public servant.  However, the fact that the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and the Civil Service had different pensions structures makes it difficult to have expressly identical terms for their widows.  For instance, Garda Síochána widows have not hitherto been eligible for contributory social welfare widows pensions.  The Social Welfare Bill at present before the House will bring members of the Garda Síochána within the scope of the social welfare insurance code, like other public servants.</P>

      <P>With regard to build ing proposals I would refer the Deputy <Col N="999" /> to my reply to Question No. 63 of the 22nd June, 1972.  An additional proposal to accept a tender for 11 houses at Kilmainhamwood was received on the 3rd inst. and is being examined. Proposals for the raising of loans to finance schemes at Lobinstown, Donore, Castletown and Kilmainhamwood are under consideration in my Department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unusual to have proposals in the Department awaiting sanction.  I do not think the Deputy would expect that as proposals came in they are sanctioned automatically. First, they must be examined carefully and, secondly, the financial resources available to me determine the number of sanctions that can be released at any particular time.  These proposals are usually dealt with in blocks so that there is a time lag between the release of each block.  It is usual to have a time lag between the release of each block.  I am anxious to have the matter dealt with as quickly as possible.  Sanctions for housing schemes are given at a fairly steady pace.  This is evident from the number of houses under construction at the moment which is an all time record.  It is evident also from the number of houses that were completed last year, which also was an all time <Col N="1000" /> record, and indications are that completions in the present financial year will exceed last year's record.</P>

Surely the Minister knows that his Department have vetted this scheme from the time it was first mooted until now and sanctioned the contractor several months ago, knowing very well that he could not start without the money?  Would the Minister not agree that this has gone far enough and that he should issue permission to borrow for the purpose of starting the job?  Or could he say when he proposes to do that?</P>

      <P>In July, 1970, it was decided that the possibility of a group scheme should be re-examined because of the high cost of the public scheme and its low rating on the authority's priority list.  My Department's local inspector paid many visits to the area and eventually succeeded in reviving some local interest in a group scheme in June, 1971.  A canvass of the area, carried out in November, 1971, indicated that the only interest came from the Ballyhasty area.  In the course of subsequent discussions with the authority's technical staff, they maintained their objection to the group scheme, mainly because of difficulties associated with allowing the group to place a pump in the council's pump-house.  In a letter of 29th June, 1972, the authority sought approval to the public scheme as originally proposed by them.  This request is at present being examined in my Department.</P>

In making these allocations several factors were taken into consideration.  The maximum grant from my Department under the scheme is 50 per cent of the cost <Col N="1014" /> of any project.  In a number of cases the amount allocated represents 50 per cent of the total cost of all eligible projects submitted by a local authority. In other cases the size of the authority, its past activity under the old scheme of amenity grants, the number of projects for which grants were allocated under the old scheme of amenity grants which still remain to be completed, the nature and extent of the scheme submitted and the special needs of certain areas such as, for example, the western seaboard counties and designated areas, were all taken into account in making these allocations.</P>

However, before the equipment is ordered such matters as availability of accommodation to house the equipment, provision of ancillary plant in other exchanges and availability of capital must be cleared. Site and building problems in connection with the extension of existing exchanges or provision of new ones can take years to resolve because most sizeable exchanges are sited or need to be sited in built-up areas.  In short, arrangements to ensure the availability of exchange plant involve, in many cases, planning and entering into commitments years before the actual requirements arise.  In the case of the Ballsbridge exchange building, for example, the site inquiries were initiated in 1963.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies who spoke on this Estimate. As usual the number of subjects covered was quite extensive.  I found the debate quite useful.  These debates are usually helpful to a Minister.  Many Deputies raised specific questions and asked me to deal with them when I was replying.  Considering the number of hours during which the debate has gone on, it would be a bit impractical for me to attempt to deal with each point raised by each Deputy.  I should like, however, to assure the House that, where a specific question was asked about some special scheme or some special incident, I will have the matter investigated and I will communicate with the Deputy letting him have the information he requested or clearing up some doubt that was in the Deputy's mind during the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>My introductory speech was rather lengthy and I do not know whether I was blamed or thanked for it.  There was a mixed reaction to the length of time it took me to read my introductory remarks.  I should like to apologise to the House, but I was suffering under a medical handicap in that I had recently had a slight operation on my mouth and I had to speak rather slowly.  That is why I was an hour longer than I normally would have been.  I felt I should like to clear that up.</P>
      <P>I want to deal mainly with housing as it is really my main concern in the Department.  It occupies most of the time of the Minister and the Department and it is, of course, the Government's top priority.  When I was introducing the Estimate I referred to the satisfactory way in which the housing programme has been built up on a planned basis with due regard to the needs and to the availability of the resources without which no expansion could have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be the last to claim that everything is fine in relation to housing and that we still have not got a long road to travel before we reach our goal of a decent home for every family at a cost that the family can afford.  I would claim that we are making progress on a sound basis and <Col N="1019" /> that we are building up the housing programme on a smoothly rising gradient without causing disruption in employment or in the building industry. This is very important.</P>
    <P>It is not often fully understood by those who speak about the need for more houses, and who make requests from time to time for what they call a crash programme or a special programme, that if there is too much acceleration in any industry, and in the building industry in particular, untold damage can be caused, from which that industry may take years to recover. We suffered something similar to that in the past during the period of office of a Coalition Government. We have to be very careful to maintain a steady upward growth in the output and expansion and the employment in the industry, rather than to have peaks and valleys which can bring such pain and hurt to so many families when the valley period comes and which, as we know, in the past caused such mass emigration.</P>
    <P>In the ultimate this is the only way in which we can accomplish what we are trying to do in housing.  Let there be no doubt about it.  There are no overnight solutions to the housing problem, no more than there are in any other country whether it is a socialist country or a capitalist country. My primary concern now is to keep up the momentum of growth which the housing programme developed during the sixties and to see, at the same time, that we do not just build houses but that we also get them, as far as is practicable, to the people who are most in need of them.</P>
    <P>I want to give an assurance to the House that housing has been and will continue to be a first priority with the Government.  I see proper housing as the foundation stone on which social progress in the broad sense is based. I do not see any point in pouring money into improved health services or better educational opportunities, if the people we are trying to help have not got the basic requirement of a good home.  I am satisfied that the Government cannot solve the housing problem on their own.  I am not the <Col N="1020" /> first to say that.  Housing is a community responsibility.  The rate at which we are able to move ahead in housing is dictated largely by the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>In this country, for example, it is a fact that, compared with other countries we spend rather than invest a very high proportion of our total income. This is something which holds back the level of capital resources which can be put into housing without imposing pressures that are self-defeating in the long run.  The country must accept that the provision of proper housing is by its nature expensive. The Government cannot cloak that fact by pouring in more and more subsidies.  They must also accept that, if we are to house the poor at rents they can afford, the inescapable result is that those who are better off must also pay for their housing in proportion to their means.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the high priority which we attach to housing.  I should like to take this opportunity, while replying to this Estimate, to illustrate this very point.  To do that, I propose to outline briefly some of the initiatives and improvements in housing which have been introduced since I became Minister in 1970.  These developments have enabled the output of new houses to grow from 13,644 in 1969-70 to 15,921 in 1971-72.  The latter figure is an all-time record.  It is likely to be surpassed in 1972-73.  It is my confident hope that in this year we will be able to achieve a housing output touching on 17,000 houses.</P>
    <P>On the private housing side, the measures taken by the Government have facilitated a very rapid growth in the rate of output in the last two years. They included, within the last few days, the fairly substantial increase in the limits applicable to local authority house purchase loans and supplementary grants.  The maximum loan which local authorities may advance has been increased from £3,000 to £3,400 generally, and from £3,300 to £3,800 in the county boroughs of Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford and the boroughts of Dún Laoghaire and Galway, and in the county of Dublin. The yearly income limit for supplementary <Col N="1021" /> grants has been increased from £1,250 to £1,500 and the usual allowance of £100 for each dependant up to a limit of £400.  This gives a maximum limit of £1,900 income for supplementary grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to houses commenced on that date, or after that date.  I am also confident that these changes which I have announced this week will be of considerable help to the middle-income group who want to provide their own houses.  The question of the availability of adequate mortgage facilities is a fundamental requirement in the whole field of private housing.  I initiated discussions with the Building Societies' Association with a view to introducing arrangements under which local authorities could guarantee loans made by the building societies.  Following these discussions I asked local authorities to draw up schemes under section 42 of the 1966 Act enabling them to guarantee loans made by building societies, insurance companies, banks and other organisations.  A model scheme and form of guarantee were drawn up on the basis of discussions.  These were sent out to each local authority.  This is a matter which was raised by Deputy Clinton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these arrangements is to ensure that prospective house purchasers in all areas throughout the country have adequate mortgage facilities available to them.  They can be particularly useful to persons living in areas in which building societies or other commercial agencies do not normally operate and also to persons in the lower and middle-income groups who require loans greater in amount than they would normally be advanced by these agencies.  The principal types of loans for which guarantees may be considered are set out in the letter which I sent to the local authorities. <Col N="1022" /> The amount of loan guaranteed may not be more than 25 per cent in excess of the maximum loan available from the local authority concerned.  This proved very useful in recent months. I am anxious to see widespread use being made of the guarantee arrangements. I will keep that operation under review.</P>
    <P>Another initiative I have taken to secure progress in the private housing field has been the development of an active site-releasing programme in the Dublin area.  I have introduced arrangements to expedite planning appeals involving fairly large-scale housing developments.  The promotion of the co-operative system of providing houses is another initiative which was taken, and also the widening of the range of owner-occupation by giving potential tenants of local authority houses the alternative of buying their houses from the local authorities rather than renting them.  They can do this with the help of the usual grants and the other aids which are applicable to private houses.  I am strongly in favour of this activity and grateful to the Dublin authorities for making a start on it.  I hope to see it spread to local authorities all over the country.</P>
    <P>Developments have not been confined to the private sector.  From listening to contributions made by Opposition speakers, it would seem that they are anxious to convey the impression that the Government have a fairly successful record in recent times in private housing construction and policies seem to have been implemented successfully.  They tried, however, to give the impression that we were not doing anything at all in regard to local authority houses.  This is utter nonsense.  I have been pressing ahead to the greatest extent possible. I have pressed ahead with the expansion of the local authority housing programme and introduced new methods of tendering and contracting which are designed to promote efficiency and rationalisation and at the same time obtain the maximum output from the available moneys.  I am referring now to the guaranteed order project.  It already involves a programme of about 5,000 dwellings, of <Col N="1023" /> which about 1,800 are already in progress. This project has already established its worth.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the so-called progressives and radicals in the Opposition, particularly Labour Deputies, who are now proving to me by criticising the guaranteed order project that they are the most conservative people in Dáil Éireann.  I made some radical changes in the system of tendering and contracting for local authority houses with one purpose in mind and that is to provide more houses for the people who are badly in need of them.  For the amount of money available to me I have been able to increase the output substantially over the level of output from the same amount of money in years gone by.  The savings which have been achieved under the guaranteed order project are remarkable when one considers that we are living in an age of spiralling prices.  This is to be seen more clearly in the housing field than in any other activity.  It is truly remarkable to be able to record that in the housing field, despite all the pressures which exist in the industry, we have had success in effecting economies in the cost of construction and that these economies are going directly to the benefit of the taxpayer and ratepayer.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with Opposition Deputies who are so conservative, who want to stick to the same old methods that have been used since the State was founded and are not prepared to accept the new ideas even when it is shown clearly to them that these new ideas are redounding to the great benefit of the community and, in particular, of course, to that section of the community that they claim is their special concern, and which is my special concern, the weaker section of the community.  They are the people who are benefiting from the fact that I have been able substantially to increase local authority housing output, houses built for renting for people who cannot afford, even with assistance by way of grant, to buy houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>Building activity is only one aspect of the Government's involvement in <Col N="1024" /> housing.  If our approach is to be sufficiently comprehensive we must operate policies that will serve and promote the best use of the total housing stock. For that reason I have recently launched a sample survey of the condition of the housing stock and will use the results of that survey as a basis for conserving the stock.  The means of doing this will include a revised reconstruction grants scheme.  Pending completion of this scheme, I have recently increased on an interim basis the maximum State grant available for reconstruction work from £140 to £200. This grant may be supplemented by a grant of an equal amount from the local authority, making a total of £400 available for reconstruction work.  I am grateful for the warm reception given to the announcement of the increased grants.</P>
    <P>In February last I introduced a special scheme of grants to encourage the provision of proper accommodation for physically disabled persons.  The special grant is payable for work started on or after 1st February of this year, where an extra room or other structural work is necessary for the accommodation of a physically disabled person in an existing house.</P>
    <P>In the case of a non-vested local authority house the local authority may pay a grant of up to the full approved cost of the work and in other cases they may grant two-thirds of the cost. Half of the cost of the grant is being recouped to the local authority by my Department subject to a maximum recoupment in any case of £400.  These grants, I am sure, will relieve hardship in cases where up to now a disabled person with limited means had no effective means of adapting a house to meet his requirements.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the main aim of the Irish Wheelchair Association which was formed to promote the wellbeing of persons who are confined to wheelchairs and who are restricted in the use of their limbs. The main aim is to work towards the situation where persons confined to wheelchairs can live a normal life.  If they are unable to get access to public buildings, if they are confronted by steps everywhere they go, if the authorities <Col N="1025" /> have not provided ramps to allow them to gain easy access without seeking assistance from a number of persons to lift them up the steps, they certainly cannot be said to be living a normal life.  Many of these people have shown courage and determination and they are a shining example to the whole community in the way in which they have faced the difficulties that confront them.  Many of them drive cars which have been specially adapted to allow them to drive and they can put the wheelchair in the motorcar and, in fact, they are completely mobile until confronted with steps or some other obstacle which will not allow them to move freely without assistance from some other member of the community.</P>
    <P>Their main problem was in the houses where they live, not being able to go upstairs, not being in a financial position to convert the house for ground-floor living.  Many of them were suffering some hardship and much inconvenience and their relatives also were suffering inconvenience.  Certainly, the ambition of the Wheelchair Association was not being achieved if these people were not getting an opportunity to live a normal life.</P>
    <P>One of my hopes and aims is to play a very full part in helping persons confined to wheelchairs to lead a normal life.  I hope that the arrangements I have brought into force and the assistance by way of grants I have introduced so far and the legislation which I propose to introduce in the future will place this country in the position of leading the way for other countries throughout the world and showing countries how public authorities, States and governments should deal with those members of their community who are not free to move around as ordinary members of the community do, because they are confined to a wheelchair.  I hope with the publication of the new building regulations to include a provision stipulating that all new buildings being designed and constructed must make provision for adequate access for persons confined to wheelchairs.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of housing that I am anxious to encourage is the provision <Col N="1026" /> of houses by philanthropic bodies because up to now voluntary bodies have not contributed much to the total housing effort.  Their main contribution has been in the provision of small dwellings for elderly persons, with the aid of the special grants available for that purpose. They have met a very great need and those who have involved themselves in this work deserve the highest praise and thanks of the community. The experience of other countries shows that there is also scope for voluntary activity in relation to other kinds of housing needs, such as those of families of single office workers, of students, and so on, because there are a number of groups like these that are in need of assistance and there is no means of helping them over and above the ordinary.  These are needs which exist in our community and which are growing but they may not at any one time merit the highest priority in the allocation of the resources available for housing.  Because of that, voluntary bodies can be very useful by identifying and catering for this type of need and in that way supplement the housing efforts of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to emphasise that I am using the word &ldquo;supplement&rdquo; because I should not like anybody to think that I am suggesting that they should substitute.  I do not look to voluntary bodies as a substitute or, indeed, as anything other than a supplement to local authority housing.</P>
    <P>In terms of the number of dwellings provided, I do not expect that voluntary activity will ever account for more than a small proportion of the total housing effort or a small proportion of the local authority housing programme but in terms of the benefits that such groups can confer and of the pressing human problems they can relieve, their contribution can be very significant.  It is my aim to see that contribution grow and, in fact, to create the financial and other conditions that will enable them to grow.  I have, therefore, been reviewing on a general basis the aids which are available for voluntary housing projects and I have asked the local authorities, by way of circular letter, to consider making greater use of the powers they already have to assist <Col N="1027" /> voluntary housing bodies and I have given them specific guidelines as to the ways in which they could and should assist them.  I have also made some suggestions as to the scale of assistance they might make available.  In addition, I intend announcing a new State subsidy to voluntary groups.  This will be directed to the purchase, and subsequent conversion up to a good standard, of houses suitable for small families.  I am hopeful this subsidy will give a new stimulus to the provision of this kind of housing; the provision of this type of housing is regarded as particularly suited to voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of housing&mdash;I referred to it recently and I should like to take this opportunity of emphasising it&mdash;is the question of standards in private enterprise rented accommodation. This matter has been causing me some concern.  I am concerned about the need for an improvement in standards here, especially in bedsitters and flatlet type accommodation, which are, in the main, features of our cities and larger towns.</P>
    <P>My functions in regard to this accommodation do not extend to rent levels. I want to make that clear.  Rents are a function of the Minister for Justice. Many groups are apparently under the impression that, because housing is one of my functions, rents are also a function of mine and I am continually directing groups, which make representations, over to the Minister for Justice.  I am, of course, involved in standards.</P>
    <P>I am far from satisfied with the standard, the quality and the facilities provided in many small flats and bedsitters. Definite measures are needed to secure an improvement in standards and I have prepared draft bye-laws to apply to rented accommodation.  On 28th June last I invited the public to give me their views on these bye-laws. They cover drainage, ventilation, lighting, the execution of repairs and the provision of essential facilities.  The bye-laws are not by any means what I would regard as optimum ideal standards but are aimed rather at minimum <Col N="1028" /> reasonable standards which can later be improved in the light of experience in operating the bye-laws.  What I seek to achieve is a gradual and progressive improvement in standards so that there will be no adverse effect on rent levels or on the supply of private enterprise rented accommodation.  Following my consideration of the views of the public and representative groups on these draft bye-laws, I will issue to local authorities a model based on the draft, together with the results of my consideration of the suggestions and comments, and I will take up with them the need to ensure that they are effectively geared to administer these bye-laws. There would be no point in going through the whole exercise of devising bye-laws unless we have the means of enforcing them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I did.  I sent them to some organisations which had been writing to me about these matters.  The Flat Dwellers' Association was one.  If the Deputy would like a copy I will send him one.  In fact, I will send a copy to every Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, where bye-laws are concerned, the task of enforcing them may present some difficulty because, if enforcement is too rigorous, it can, as Deputies will appreciate, create more problems than it will, in fact, solve.  On the other hand, inadequate enforcement would allow a situation to continue which may be quite intolerable in some instances and we certainly could not allow that.  It will not, as I say, be easy and it will provide no overnight solution, but it will be a start.  Local authority involvement in this kind of housing is essential and I will be looking to local authorities for their full co-operation in what I am trying to do in this area.  The day is past when local authorities could be regarded as being confined in their housing functions to the building of houses for certain sections of the community, the management of their own housing estates and to the making of loans and grants towards private enterprise housing.  In my view, local authorities <Col N="1029" /> must henceforth see themselves as having both a particular and a general responsibility in relation to all the housing problems in their areas; they must, in other words, be housing authorities in a real sense.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on local government reorganisation clearly sets out my intention to delegate as many responsibilities as possible to local authorities but, before doing so, I am anxious to ensure that the local government structure at that lower level is a viable structure capable of adequately and efficiently carrying out the functions I will be delegating.  This is the thinking behind the abolition of small authorities.  At some point in the future I shall be coming to the House with a Bill designed to implement some of the suggestions in the White Paper. The Bill will be available early in the next session.</P>

      <P>I do not think one can make a fair comparison with Sweden because there the population is very scattered.  It would be generally accepted, I think, that we are not short of public bodies of one kind or another and there is, I believe, general acceptance that many of them must go.  I have to decide which.  The moment I announce which everyone will be for those which are going.  That is life.  I am quite determined, however, to reform our local government structure.</P>
      <P>There is another function which I am anxious to delegate to local authorities but I have not made any decision yet.  In my introductory remarks I hinted that I was aware of the delays in dealing with group water schemes. In the course of the debate some Deputies opposite suggested that the delays were deliberate on the part of the Department as a method of slowing down the payment of grants because of some lack of money.  Obviously, that cannot be true because if it were the case, there would be no point in the grant being increased recently from £60 to £100.  I appreciate that there is a genuine need for an improvement in the group water scheme system of operation but what I hope to do is to withdraw the Department out of these operations as much as possible and to involve to a greater extent the local authorities both in the design stage and in the operation of the schemes.</P>

My predecessor was not in favour of that practice and neither am I.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give a run-down on sanitary services.  This is an essential field of operation in the whole housing programme.  Much work is being done and the amount of money being invested in the sanitary services programme is being increased substantially year by year.  The capital provided for 1971-72 was £6.25 million, which was an increase of £1.4 million on the previous year.  This year the provision was again increased by £400,000 so that the total amount provided was £6.64 million.  As an example of the positive and important work being done under the sanitary services programme, I shall give some examples of major water and sewerage <Col N="1032" /> schemes which were approved during the past three years.</P>
    <P>I am going to the trouble of giving these because at Question Time I am asked questions regularly as to why various schemes have not been sanctioned. There is a large number of applications in the Department and it is a matter for the local authority to let us know which is their No. 1 priority and to help us in that way. Deputies are inclined to table questions about the local authority No. 12 priority and demand to know why the Minister has not sanctioned them when, in fact, the Deputies' county councils would not wish the Minister to sanction No. 12 ahead of No. 1 In the Dublin area, which is a critical area now because of the population explosion and the increasing demand for houses, there will be needed many thousands of acres of serviced land during the next ten years.  This land will be required if only to implement the plans that have been drawn up by Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area there are sections 3 and 4 of the Dodder Valley sewerage which is being provided at a total cost. for the two sections, of about £2 million. Section 3 is almost completed and section 4 is well under way.  These are final sections of the main sewer which in the Tallaght area, will drain up to 6,300 acres of new land.  Section 1 of the new treatment works at Ringsend which will treat the flows coming through the Dodder Valley sewer will cost £2.2 million.  I recently sanctioned a tender for the tunnel section of the greater Dublin sewer, which was known as the Grand Canal tunnel.  It will cost approximately £3.5 million. That is an essential part of the scheme to open up 11,000 acres to the northwest of the city.  The work there will commence soon.</P>
    <P>Regarding the provision of water, the duplication works at Leixlip will double the capacity of the water treatment works there from 9 million gallons to 18 million gallons per day. The estimated cost of that scheme is £266,000.  Work is already in progress on it.  The Ballymore Eustace treatment works extension is costing £500,000 <Col N="1033" /> and will extend output from 20 million gallons to 27 million gallons per day. These, then, are some of the very heavy capital works that are under way in the Dublin area at present.</P>
    <P>In the Cork area the combined effects of the scheme, including further extensions of the preliminary drainage scheme, that is, the trunk sewer No. 3, Knockahinny sewer and the Beaumont sewer, will be to provide some 10,000 new sites within the city boundary and about 21,000 sites in the adjoining county areas.  The total cost involved is more than £1 million.  A number of these works have been completed already and others are in progress.</P>
    <P>In Limerick the first section of a major scheme to increase the city's water supply from 5 million gallons to 12 million gallons per day at an overall cost of £1.4 million, will cost £240,000.  There is a major scheme in Dundalk which will provide a main drainage for the town.  Stage one will open up considerable land for housing and industry.</P>
    <P>A modern main drainage system is required for Sligo town, the estimated cost of which is £130,000.  This will provide land for further housing and industrial development.  In Drogheda there is in progress a further major stage of the water supply augmentation scheme.  This scheme will provide headworks for an extra three million gallons per day for the town plus one million gallons per day for the east Meath area.  The cost there is £370,000. The total cost of the scheme is £800,000.</P>
    <P>In Ennis, too, major work is going ahead.  Section one of the main drainage will cost £70,000 while the total cost will be £900,000.  In Kildare tenders have been approved for a reservoir at Old Kilcullen as part of a system for the distribution of piped water to Naas, Newbridge and Kilcullen. The cost there will be £180,000. There is a big water supply scheme in Ballina costing £190,000.  Tenders have been invited for that scheme and it will commence soon.  Tenders have been approved for a £94,000 water mains distribution improvement scheme for the town of Ballina.  At Arranmore in County Donegal there is <Col N="1034" /> a water supply scheme in progress to cater for the island's needs.  The cost will be £112,000.  I could give many more examples.  However, I am only giving Deputies an idea of the amount of capital that is involved and the investment we are making in providing these facilities which, as the House knows, will contribute substantially towards reducing pollution where pollution is being caused by the discharge of untreated effluents from public sewers into rivers.</P>
    <P>This heavy capital investment, especially in the Dublin area, will contribute substantially towards a reduction of the level of pollution in the rivers especially in the Liffey and, eventually, in Dublin Bay.  I am assured by my technical advisers that when these schemes are in operation&mdash;it will probably be at least four or five years before they are in full operation&mdash; there will be a remarkable improvement in the quality of the waters in the Dublin rivers.  That is my hope.  The Camac is an open sewer.  It is a disgusting sight but there is very little that we can do to improve it until such time as these major schemes are in operation. By then, too, Dublin Bay should be restored to its former glory.  It is a particular ambition of mine to have restored these waters which, unfortunately, have been allowed to fall into a state which is less than satisfactory. The community will have to accept that no remarkable improvement can be brought about overnight.</P>
    <P>I am tempted to reply to the various points brought up but I think I had better avoid that and assure Deputies who raised matters of particular concern to them that I shall have these matters fully considered and I shall communicate with them where I feel the matters warrant communication.</P>

      <P>At Question Time I asked the Minister for Justice:</P>
      <P>...whether, as a result of a recent court decision involving a five-year-old singer (name supplied), it is now proposed to prosecute in the case of all children under the age prescribed by law who appear on stage or other public places to participate in pantomimes and concerts in Dublin theatres and other similar places of entertainment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>From the Minister's reply I understand this was a matter entirely for the Garda authorities and did not concern him as Minister for Justice. There appears to be a very high degree of injustice in regard to this boy, Michael Landers.  This five-year-old boy is a very talented singer, extremely well-known throughout the country and also extremely well-known on radio and on records and he is very much sought after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Michael Landers, the five-year-old wonder boy from Kilcullen, County Kildare.  I understand that the Minister will have further information if he looks up Parliamentary Question No. 49 on <Col N="1036" /> Thursday, 5th August, 1971, at column 3524 of the Official Report, where I raised a question in connection with an engagement in Westport, County Mayo.  This boy, and the showband with which he was associated, appeared for an engagement in a hotel.  Some difficulty arose in regard to the payment of fees.  The hotel owner hesitated in meeting his obligations with the result that the guards were called.  An incident followed.  At that time I asked the Minister for Justice to hold an inquiry and I understand some type of inquiry was held but that the evidence of eight witnesses, who were available and brought forward by the manager of Michael Landers, was not seriously considered.  The result of the showband manager pressing the case in connection with the Westport incident was that it provoked widespread activity by the entire Garda force.  I object seriously, now that we have such a wave of crime, a number of unsolved murders and great public uneasiness regarding the implementation of law and order, that the time of the Garda Síochána, from the commissioner down, should be occupied in following a five-year-old boy around the country.</P>
      <P>When this boy became associated with a showband his manager got in touch with the Department of Justice and informed them that the showband in question had the named artist appearing on an average of three nights a week.  The Department of Justice informed the showband that they could find no law to prevent this boy from appearing.  The showband were extremely worried at the time lest they might be breaking the law.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but the question is if it is now proposed to prosecute in the case of all children.

The question is: does the Minister propose to prosecute all other children of the same age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point and I agree completely with <Col N="1037" /> the Chair.  Is there to be a law for Michael Landers alone or is the law to be impartially administered to all others in a similar age group?  This is a very serious matter because the Garda authorities have gone out of their way to pick on this boy.  I feel I am within the Rules of Order in asking the Minister for Justice why has this boy been singled out, apart from other young people who participate in concerts, stage shows or in street shows or in Christmas pantomimes? This boy was picked out. I want to accuse the Minister of saying that the law is not being administered impartially in this case, first, because of the Westport incident and, secondly, because the Garda superintendent in my own area, in reference to an appearance on Sunday, 7th May, 1972, in Abbeyleix, caused the local Macra na Feirme to be informed on that day that unless this boy artiste was taken from the list of artistes in the musical event that was to take place in the hall, the hall committee of Macra na Feirme would be prosecuted under the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act, 1904.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister for Justice what authority the Garda authorities had to warn Macra na Feirme in Abbeyleix that if this boy appeared the Macra na Feirme organisation would be prosecuted. This was a form of intimidation. There is no provision under which Macra na Feirme could have been prosecuted in the Cruelty to Children Act, 1904.  The Minister must know that.  Every Member of this House knows it.  It was intimidation to prevent this boy from appearing thus causing considerable embarrassment to his parents and family, damaging him in his career as a singer and record maker, and damaging the reputation of the recording firm that was producing his records for radio purposes.  It has been a great worry to his manager, to his parents, friends and admirers.  Why is he singled out as Public Enemy No. 1 in the country and why should there be a file in every superintendent's office in this State asking the Garda <Col N="1038" /> authorities to look out for a showband with which this five-year-old artiste appears?  The same precautions seem to have been taken as would have been taken in the United States against Dillinger during his wild days.</P>
    <P>I accuse the Department of Justice of treating this boy in a disgraceful manner.  It should be the subject of a serious inquiry.  I am not satisfied, more particularly as this showband and this young artiste had just returned from an English tour and, bad and all as the English laws are, the 1904 Act was not rigidly implemented in Britain in so far as his appearances were concerned.  It would not have been implemented by any of the Garda superintendents if it were not for the fact that a garda was reported and an inquiry held in Wesport, County Mayo. This has been responsible for it.  If we are to have respect for the Garda force there must not be victimisation. This has been a clear case of victimisation.</P>
    <P>Now that the 1904 Act has been invoked against Michael Landers does it mean that every other young person appearing in pantomime or shows, in theatres&mdash;the Gaiety Theatre or any other&mdash;will be forbidden to appear or is the law to be rigidly enforced only against Michael Landers simply because his manager saw fit, in justice and fairness, to ask for an inquiry into the conduct of certain members of the Garda Síochána who, it was felt, were overstepping their duty.</P>
    <P>This has caused widespread uneasiness among the general public.  One would imagine the Garda authorities have, at present, sufficient matters of great national importance on their hands such as unsolved murders and serious crimes of larceny, theft, treason <i>et cetera</i> to engage their attention instead of devoting all their energies to assembling the highest power at their disposal to trace a five-year-old boy around the country and rake up an Act of Parliament under which he can be prosecuted.  This is wrong, unreasonable and very unfair.  It is time the Minister for Justice told the Garda authorities to lay-off this five year old boy.  There is no sense or reason in it. <Col N="1039" /> This five-year-old boy is singing and providing entertainment, amusement, merriment, joy and happiness.  He is providing excellent records and a fund of great amusement for music-lovers and song-lovers.  The Garda authorities are going in full force to every hall in every part of Ireland in which this showband is billed.</P>
    <P>I did not raise this for the purpose of causing embarrassment to the commissioner of the Garda Síochána but I do say that he would be better occupied dealing with serious crime and leaving this boy alone.  If the Minister says in his reply that this is a matter which is completely in the hands of the Garda authorities he should intervene and tell them that it is very unfair to dig up a 1904 Act to embarrass the parents of a most promising young boy and to prevent his attendance at functions with the showband with which he is associated.  The Minister for Local Government will be replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice.  I hope he will make it clear to us that if the Cruelty to Children Act, 1904 is to be invoked in the case of Michael Landers it will be invoked against all other and that he will not be picked out because of the dispute that took place with the Garda authorities in Westport.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also bear in mind that the parents of this boy are extremely well-known and popular.  He is a member of a most talented and musical family and they are extremely embarrassed about the manner in in which they have been hunted from place to place by the Garda authorities. When the prosecution took place under section 2 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act, 1904, recently the most amusing thing was that the function which the boy was attending was being held for the purpose of raising funds for the prevention of cruelty to children. Despite that the gardaí took legal action.  It is most unreasonable that the commissioner of the Garda should circulate a memo to certain Garda stations.  I know one was circulated to the superintendent in Castlebar, County Mayo.  There was a query raised in it which I quoted at Question Time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> A letter was sent from the commissioner's office to the superintendent in Castlebar.  The Garda authorities in Dublin wrote that the writer noted from the files relating to the manager of this showband that the showband in question had a five-year-old singer.  The commissioner asked: &ldquo;Do you think we have a case here?&rdquo; They were looking for a case.  They were trying to bolster up a case against a five-year-old boy.  The Garda should not be asked to waste their time in this way.  Their job is&mdash;and they are highly respected for it&mdash;to safeguard life and property. They should not have to waste time answering memos and watching newspapers to see if Michael Landers is appearing in some district.</P>
    <P>The Garda should carry out their duties impartially and there is nothing impartial about this.  Why should this boy be singled out?  It is wrong, unfair, unjust and unreasonable.  The Minister should take the necessary steps with the Garda authorities to see to it that serious embarrassment is not caused to this little boy, to his parents, his manager and others.  I hope the Minister will investigate this matter and consult with the Garda authorities to find why the Garda stations throughout the country have been alterted to watch out for a five-year-old boy.  One would imagine that he was one of the most outrageous criminals this country has ever known.  I am sure any broad-minded man would agree that it is wrong to have files in every Garda station in the country on a five-year-old boy because of his appearance at a musical event to sing a song.  May we take it that from now on, since a court decision has been given in Bagnelstown, County Carlow, in relation to Michael Landers, that similar action will be taken in the case of all pantomimes and concerts?</P>

I got no notice that this matter was coming up but I can assure the Deputy that all he said will be brought to the notice of the Minister for Justice.  At the same time, following on what the Deputy said, I should like to put on the record again the reply which the Minister for Finance gave today on behalf of the Minister for Justice.  The reply reads:</P>
      <P>As I have previously explained to the House on many occasions, the institution of criminal proceedings is a matter for the Garda Síochána acting where necessary in consultation with or on the directions of the law officers, and I have no responsibility in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy can be absolutely assured that the gardaí got no direction from either the Minister or the Department to prosecute this boy.  Indeed, it would have been quite improper for the Department <Col N="1042" /> or the Minister to give such a direction.  The gardaí sought the directions of the law officers and they acted on the directions they got and, from what I know of the case, and from what Deputy Flanagan has said I do not think the gardaí have any apology to make.  Obviously there is a great difference between a young child singing in a commercial dance band, in the atmosphere of a dancehall, at a very late hour, and the appearance of children in pantomime or in a performance on a stage or in a theatre; their appearance on the stage is on a noncommercial or amateur basis, while this boy appeared professionally.  I understand he was advertised as Michael Landers.  the five-year-old wonder boy, and his band.  I do not think I need say any more.  I assure Deputy Flanagan that what he has said will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice.</P>
