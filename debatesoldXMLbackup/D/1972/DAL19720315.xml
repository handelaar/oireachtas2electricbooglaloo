      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the &ldquo;Fund to Assist Those Deprived of Human and Civil Rights in Northern Ireland&rdquo; recently instituted by the Assembly of the Northern Irish people.  The aims of this fund are humanitarian and a contribution to it would not warrant representations from the British Government and none have been received.</P>
      <P>I recommend that persons interested should make their contributions either to the fund I have mentioned or to the appropriate fund of the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that some health boards are refusing to pay hospital bills for eligible persons if the bills are incurred outside the health board region, even though (a) the hospital concerned was the only one with a bed available and (b) the charge is no greater than that for similar treatment within the region.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should appreciate that an issue such as this involving the detailed administration of the health services is one that should be taken up with the health board concerned.  If, having done so, he is satisfied that the health board have acted contrary to the statutes or in an arbitrary or unreasonable way, he might bring the specific case to my notice and I will pursue it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his advice but I am sure he will appreciate that the week before last I had occasion to bring two cases of another nature to his attention with the result that the matter was remedied immediately. Would the Minister agree that if what I asked in the question is being done it is contrary to at least the spirit of the Health Act and would he see to it that it is not continued?  If he has the same effect in this case as he had in the previous case I will be very grateful to him.</P>

If the Deputy will inquire with the health board he will find that this negotiation is in process.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the average bed occupancy costings per week of the three largest voluntary teaching hospitals as estimated (a) on a revenue basis and (b) comprehensively to cover capital and revenue expenditure and valuation changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The average weekly cost of maintaining and treating an inpatient in the larger teaching hospitals in Dublin based on total revenue expenditure is estimated to be in the range of £70 to £95 in the present financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accounting procedures of the hospitals do not include the production of depreciation figures.  Expenditure of a capital nature incurred in the running of the hospitals is met as it arises and is normally covered by specific grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund. As these requirements vary considerably <Col N="1552" /> from year to year, it would be misleading to express the costs as an annual average figure but during the last three years the amount expended by an individual hospital in any year has been as high as £100,000 and as low as £3,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the date on which an agreement was first entered into by a Government Department or Hospital Commission with the authorities of Saint Vincent's Hospital, Stephen's Green, concerning the proposed disposal of that hospital on the completion of the new hospital at Elm Park, Dublin 9; whether representations were made about such an agreement asking for its reconsideration in the period February, 1948, to February, 1951, and, if so, whether a decision was taken at that time altering fundamentally the provisions of that agreement; if not, whether at any time since then the original agreement was altered and, if so, in what respect and by whose authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal agreement entered into by the then Minister for Health with the Irish Sisters of Charity concerning the conditions on which a grant was provided from the Hospitals Trust Fund towards the cost of the new St. Vincent's Hospital at Elm Park was dated the 12th of May, 1954.  One of these conditions was that, if the old St. Vincent's Hospital was not continued in use as a public charitable hospital, the market value or proceeds of an actual sale of those buildings would be paid into the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
      <P>Representations were made in the period February, 1948-February, 1951, mentioned in the question, to have certain revisions made in the draft of an agreement which was then under consideration. One of these proposed revisions sought the retention by the Sisters of the old hospital buildings. This revision was not agreed to, and the draft was eventually finalised and executed in 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1965 the then Minister for Health, the late Donogh O'Malley, had discussions with the Sisters and it was agreed <Col N="1553" /> that in consideration of the handing over by the Sisters to the State of certain properties in the Lower Leeson Street-Leeson Lane area, which had not figured in previous discussions, as well as the granting by the Sisters earlier of the site at Elm Park, the Sisters would be released from the requirement of the 1954 agreement relating to the repayment to the Hospitals Trust Fund of the market value of proceeds of the sale of the old hospital. An indenture amending the 1954 agreement accordingly is in final stages of drafting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Sisters were satisfied with the arrangements, arrived at in 1948 and 1951, why was it found necessary, or what additional arguments were advanced by the authorities, to deprive the Sweep funds or the State of the moneys coming from the sale of this hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Sisters offered the site for the new hospital and until 1965 the disposal of the property at Leeson Street and Leeson Lane had never entered into the picture and so, because of the offering of the site and because they were willing to give the funds arising from the sale of the Leeson Street-Leeson Lane property, the then Minister for Health decided that they should be allowed to dispose of the value of the property of the St. Stephen's Green hospital in their own right and I understand that the moneys will be used, as in the case of the Sisters of Charity, for hospital purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, this is an extraordinary principle to permit, that an organisation&mdash;I do not care who they are, whether they are religious orders or others&mdash;lay people do just as good work in hospital services&mdash;should be allowed to sell off property, keep the money, and then be given a 100 per cent grant to build a new hospital? Why was it adopted by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason why we should not adopt it.  The Sisters of Charity control and operate 1,000 beds in this city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the Hospitals Sweep Fund, according to the Minister, is bankrupt to the extent of about £8 million which has to be paid from the taxpayers' pockets?  In these circumstances, why should special conditions be made in respect of this hospital and not in respect of the many other hospitals that are in just as great need and, indeed, in much greater need, of money than this hospital, because this happens to be a very wealthy Order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking into account the disposal of the Hospitals Trust Fund, it is true that the Hospitals Trust Fund, because of the very large deficits in the operation of the voluntary hospitals, became unable by itself to subsidise the capital development required for other hospitals but I am still satisfied that the funds available to the Sisters of Charity will be used to good effect.  I have no reason to suppose the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of proposals similar to that referred to by the Deputy have been received from or are expected shortly from other health boards.  The proposal from the North-Eastern Health Board cannot be considered without regard to the other boards.  I will convey my decision on the proposals generally as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that he told me about four months ago that, in fact, this matter was receiving active consideration? Does the Minister recollect making that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  There are a number of proposals of a similar kind coming from health boards and they have to be reconciled before the final determination can be made. As the Deputy knows, these matters can take more time than I would imagine.  It is simply a matter of negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must agree that it is unfair that people should be asked to do extra work, and be required to do it over a period of almost 12 months, without receiving remuneration which they understood they would get as a matter of course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy presumably has in mind the passenger service charge which is still levied by a number of municipally owned airports in Britain.  The retention of the charge at these airports is a matter of British domestic administration in which I could not intervene.</P>
      <P>The arrangement under which the passenger service charge ceased to be levied directly by a majority of European airports and was instead incorporated in air fares derives from a recommendation of the European Civil Aviation conference; this recommendation is not mandatory and was not adopted by a few European countries.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that men who were employed as auxiliary postmen for many years and were fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts have recently been appointed as established postmen; that they are now insurable only for widows' and orphans' pensions with a consequent loss of contributory old age pension when they retire, although their job pensions will be negligible because of their late appointment; and what action he proposes to take to protect the interests of these men.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that an auxiliary postman who, after many years service as such, is appointed as an established postman, must necessarily lose old age&mdash;contributory&mdash; pension when he retires.  If his appointment comes so late in life that his pension as established postman is very small, his social insurance contributions as auxiliary postman should be sufficient to qualify him for retirement pension or old age&mdash;contributory&mdash; pension at age 70.</P>
      <P>I do not contemplate any change in the conditions.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister has not got the facts correctly?  Is he not aware that if a man is stamping an insurance card from the time he is 17 years of age until he is almost 60 years of age and if he then is appointed and is no longer insurable under the Social Welfare Acts until he reaches 70 years of age, he cannot qualify for a contributory old age pension or retirement pension and will receive a very small pension from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs?  Would the Minister have another look at the facts because I have checked them within the last few days because an officer of this House is in the same position.  There is a break.</P>

There is one man in this House, who is not a Post Office employee, who is an employee of this House, who is in exactly the same position because he was a short time non-pensionable and, therefore, he is not entitled to a pension.

      <P>A claim to non-contributory old age pension received from this claimant on 9th December, 1971, was investigated by the social welfare officer who forwarded it to the local old age pension committee on 12th January, 1972.  The committee have been asked to expedite the matter and in the meantime a pension order book at the rate of £4.40 per week as recommended by the officer has been issued.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that when a person satisfied the conditions for a widow's pension she could be deemed to qualify for an old age pension, pending investigation?

With regard to old age pension committees, while they are not relevant to this question I should like to say that they are voluntary committees and they do very good work.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>When a decision was taken, in December, 1970, to locate the National College of Physical Education at Plassy, Limerick, a time schedule was drawn up which allowed for the opening of the first section of the college in January, 1973.</P>
      <P>Since then, planning has proceeded uninterruptedly, the various planning deadlines have been met and there has been no change in the opening date of the college.  Recent newspaper reports, which indicated that the college would not open in time, showed no familiarity with the facts of the situation.</P>
      <P>When female students were being recruited in April, 1971, for the 1971-72 school year, they were informed that the new college would open in January, 1973, and that, after they had spent their initial year in St. Raphael's or Ling Colleges, Dublin, bridging arrangements would be made for the period September-December, 1973. These arrangements have now been made.  Students being recruited this year are being informed that their course will commence in Limerick in January, 1973.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the National College of Physical Education will present a four-year course, leading to a degree. The course will provide physical education at specialist level, teacher training related to the theory and practice of education as well as a qualification to teach in the case of each trainee a subject other than physical education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in thinking the Parliamentary Secretary said in his reply that applications were being taken and were advertised accordingly but that the school would not open until January, 1973 and that in the <Col N="1570" /> meantime there would be a bridging course?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary give more details regarding this course?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that on 23rd January an advertisement appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> advertising for students for the School of Physical Education in Limerick, and said that preliminary interviews would be held regularly from February, 1972 and that a number of suitable candidates would be called for final evaluation when the results of the leaving certificate, 1972 were available?  It went on to give what the evaluation would consist of.  In the meantime, students who have applied to the principal of the School of Higher and Physical Education in Limerick have been informed that the advertisements which appeared in the papers were placed by the Youth and Physical Recreation section, Development Branch, Department of Education. The planning board of the institute has not been authorised by the Minister to deal with arrangements for the physical education programme and so I cannot say whether it will be possible to admit students in September or not.  I understand that construction work on the college&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to know where the bridging course is being taken and does the curriculum in the bridging course agree with the curriculum that will be undertaken in Limerick?  My information is that it does not.</P>

I do not think that even the director ever assumed that that was the case.  I do not know where the Deputy got his information.</P>

      <P>I do not think he ever assumed that he would be principal of the new PT college.  Secondly, as regards the bridging arrangement, the Deputy has given me an opportunity of at least clarifying this much. The bridging arrangement applies to the second year pupils.  Those recruited last year at St. Raphael's and Ling College were informed at that time that the college would open in January, 1973 and this has been common notice all along as I said in my reply.  Nothing has changed.  It rather surprises me that suggestions have been made that it has changed.  The bridging arrangements apply for them between September and January, 1973.  They were informed at the time of their recruitment that this would be done and the arrangements that have been made have been discussed with the parents of the children concerned in my Department and with the principals of both schools who, I am glad to say, have been fully consulted at all times in all of this and who, in fact, have given me every consideration.  Far from there being an objection, I think it is fair to say that they appreciate that the bridging arrangements that have been made for the second year pupils are in their best interests.</P>

The second stage interviews will take place about September and the successful candidates will then be notified as to an appropriate course of interim study for themselves.  I do not think there is any confusion.  I wish that newspaper reports and suggestions such as the Deputy is making would not attempt to confuse what, in fact, is a very clear situation.</P>

Two special brands of cheese have been mentioned and it appeared to me that this represented a gap which was not adequately explained. That is why I put down the question.  Have we been left at a disadvantage in respect of our export of cheese afterwards in the negotiations? Is the position for British cheese any better than for cheese produced here?</P>

The second part of the question does not, therefore, arise at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  At present the home market for onions is protected.  The Deputy has said that growers are experiencing difficulties now.  When we are members of the EEC and have reached the end of the transitional period, I cannot see any reason why home produced onions should not be able to stand up to the competition of imported onions.  I am referring now to home grown onions of good quality.  I would not say that the growers have anything to fear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the future for the onion industry?  I am very interested in the answer because there are at least 230 acres devoted to onion growing in my constituency.  The crop yields a production of about 3,000 tons and there are about 300 families involved.  Since the onion industry was established in Kerry, growers have had protection for their market from mid-May each year until the crop had been sold in the following March or April.  Now we are told that when we join EEC there will be no future for this industry because the embargo will be removed.  We want a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary on this matter.  The growers want to know what the future holds for them.  There will be a free-for-all situation after January of 1973 and we are told that the tariffs will be reduced by 20 per cent until 1978.  How will our people compete with foreign producers?</P>

      <P>As I announced on 7th March the Government approved of the making available of a loan of up to £750,000 to the carcase beef export industry.  The purpose of the loan is to enable the meat factories to secure a better turnover of cattle supplies in the present circumstances of the trade and to avoid staff redundancies in the factories over the next few months during which it is likely that the present trade circumstances may continue. The loan arrangements will be operated through the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Society with whom negotiations are proceeding on the conditions to be applied.  The loan arrangement will be terminable at the end of July next when the overall situation in the industry will be reviewed.</P>

The IDA has maintained contact with all the firms concerned, and is confident that, if there is no further worsening of the Northern situation, the majority of them will proceed with their projects in Ireland.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In subsection (j), page 3, to delete &ldquo;Counterfoil No&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; from form of ballot paper.  &mdash;(Deputy Hogan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete from voting papers the <Col N="1590" /> number on the back of the voting paper and the corresponding number on the counterfoil.  I have no very strong views about the number on the counterfoil.  The crucial matter is continuing to show a number on the back of the voting paper.  That number can be connected with a voter and that proves that the secrecy of the ballot box is not absolute.  The Minister has given us no indication as to what his views are on this and I am at a loss to know what purpose this number on the back of the ballot paper serves. Has there been any case before our courts in which this number was of vital importance?  Has there been any discussion on any count or recount in which this number was used to good purpose?  Has it helped to resolve a dispute with regard to an election?</P>
      <P>I put down some questions to the Minister but they were disallowed by the Ceann Comhairle on the ground that this was a matter that could best be raised during the discussion on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  Has the Minister any information as to whether this numbering system is used in other countries?  The position in the USA is different.  They have some kind of punching system.</P>
      <P>In the Bill there is, in my view, a very inaccurate method of laying down what this numbering on the back of the ballot paper should be: it is provided that it should be in the smallest characters compatible with legibility.</P>
      <P>The back of each ballot paper shall be numbered consecutively and the back of the counterfoil attached to it is to bear the same number.  The number on the back of the ballot paper shall be printed in the smallest characters compatible with legibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I produced a specimen of a ballot paper here.  Not alone was there a number on it but the number was quite large.  Anyone with average sight could read it from 20 feet away. There was also on the ballot paper the name of the constituency.  There is no provision providing that the name of the constituency should appear on the ballot paper.  This numbering on the back of ballot papers first appeared <Col N="1591" /> in 1923.  Not content with numbering they then went on to stick in the name of the constituency.  The provision has been deliberately flouted.  I do not know to what extent it has been flouted, but it was certainly flouted in the case in Monaghan.  There is a method of measuring type.  It is a points system.  You have six-point, eight-point, ten-point, 12-point; I do not know what the lowest point is. Surely in the drafting of the original provision the specific point should have been mentioned.</P>

      <P>It was left quite vague &mdash;the smallest characters compatible with legibility.  Apparently, the idea was that someone with a magnifying glass would be able to read it, if the necessity arose, but the fellow on the far side of the room could not read it. I put it to the Minister that there is no purpose in having this number on the back of the ballot paper.  As far as I know, it has never been used to any particular purpose.  I could be wrong in that.  If the Minister can tell me that it has been used to good purpose I shall be glad to hear from him on the point.  I would be interested to know if it is absolutely essential to have this number on the back of the ballot paper.  We have had it now for 50 years.  I do not know if it has ever been used to any purpose.  It certainly sows suspicion that it can be used for the purpose of intimidation.  If it serves no useful purpose it should be removed.  So long as it remains people will always be suspicious and there will always be the possibility of intimidation. I showed the number on the specimen voting paper I produced here last week.</P>

      <P>The amendments deal with the numbering on the ballot paper and I shall refer briefly to the size of the numbers.  I think I gave good reasons the last night why we should retain the serial number on the back of ballot papers.  I do not know whether Deputy Hogan wants me to repeat the points I made then but I think I should emphasise that the most important reason for having numbers on the back of ballot papers is for the security of the ballot and to ensure that no false ballot papers are allowed into the count.</P>
      <P>I should like to repeat that in the electoral case which was decided by the Supreme Court the plaintiff sought a declaration that certain sections of and rules in the Electoral Act, 1923 and Direction No. 5 contained in the Second Schedule to the 1963 Act, were inconsistent with and contrary to the provisions of Article 16 of the Constitution and were repugnant thereto and invalid.  Direction No. 5 contains the requirement that serial numbers be printed on the ballot papers and counterfoils.  The court accepted the plaintiff's plea in relation to some of these provisions but it did not rule that Direction No. 5 was unconstitutional. To me this would indicate that the court considered that the serial numbers do not endanger the secrecy of the ballot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all that, a case is still being made by Deputy Hogan and some others that the serial numbers constitute a danger to secrecy.  When this was being discussed here last week it was alleged that a personation agent at a polling station might be able to get the particular serial number on a ballot paper given to an elector by some method of counting the votes from the very beginning when the polling booth opened at 9 o'clock, if <Col N="1593" /> he wanted to find out how a particular person voted.  I think this is stretching the imagination a bit far.</P>

Then we were asked to accept that this particular personating agent is present at the count and while there he manages to identify this particular paper from among the 30,000 or 40,000 ballot papers which relate to that constituency.</P>

It would indeed be quite a coincidence if a person was able to determine an exact voting paper and then find out how the voting went on it even if by mistake the vote was placed upside down.  The instructions state quite specifically that they are to be placed face upwards but if this mistake occurred all you would see is the number and hundreds of other votes would come down on top of that ballot paper.  Then if they had been placed upside down, which is wrong, when the time came to count them they would be faced upwards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot put it any plainer than that.  Deputy Hogan raised the question of the position in other countries.  I tried to get some information about this.  It seems clear that every country provides safeguards to ensure that only legitimate votes are taken into account and that the results of elections are not distorted by fraudulent votes.  In Britain the system is <Col N="1595" /> identical to that which existed here prior to the Supreme Court ruling.  The ballot papers and the counterfoils bear serial numbers and the elector's registration number is written on the counterfoil.</P>
      <P>In the United States the tendency is towards voting machines but ballot papers are still used in some of the states.  The practice in relation to serial numbers varies.  In New Jersey and Nevada ballot papers and counterfoils are numbered consecutively, just as ours are, while in Pennsylvania the serial number is printed on a tear-off slip.  There are, in addition, strict arrangements for establishing the identity of an elector coming to vote.  In Pennsylvania an elector must sign a document in the polling station and his signature is compared with the sample signature already in the possession of election officials.  In France there is a separate ballot paper for each candidate and an elector votes by putting the ballot paper containing the name of the candidate of his choice into a special election envelope and he must show this envelope to the presiding officer before it goes into the ballot box.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how much more the Deputies want me to say on this.  They know that any person who is entitled to vote is also entitled subsequent to an election, to bring a petition before the court against the result of an election, against the manner in which it was carried out or about the way in which the election was run.  For example a petition could be brought following an election where five votes had been in dispute.  There could be a dispute for various reasons.  The embossing of the ballot paper might not have been very clear and a decision would have to be made by the returning officer as to whether this paper was valid or otherwise.  If, in such a case, the returning officer decided that five such doubtful papers were valid and subsequently the election results were announced and a particular candidate lost his seat by four votes which is not unusual&mdash;we have had examples of this happening in recent elections here and it is not impossible to <Col N="1596" /> imagine that it might happen again&mdash; the candidate defeated by four votes might decide to bring a petition before the courts on the question of the validity of the five votes which the returning officer had stated were valid and which were counted in and they would have a very important bearing on the outcome of that election.  I cannot see how a justice deciding this case could possibly give a decision unless he could identify the ballot papers which were in doubt and I would suggest to the House that the only way in which any person judging a case of that kind could make a decision would be to have clearly indicated to him the exact five ballot papers which were in doubt.  He would have to be absolutely sure that the five papers which came before him as evidence in such a case were in fact the five papers which were originally in dispute.  The only way in which he could be satisfied on that would be by an identifying mark on each of the papers, that mark, of course, being the serial number.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is to prevent a returning officer putting a mark on each of these ballot papers the same as in the case of documents handed into court?  Use your imagination for a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>To be absolutely sure, the justice would require some specific method of identifying each ballot paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>So what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The simplest and the most obvious way of doing that would be to have a serial number on it.  Also, you could take the case that you have no numbers on the ballot paper or counterfoil and you could have a presiding officer tearing off the ballot paper from the block and by accident tearing four or five together and he would not know that until the very end of the day because if there were no numbers he would have no means of checking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that there are amendments down suggesting the removal of these numbers from the ballot paper <Col N="1597" /> because they are there as a protection towards the security necessary in holding elections and also as a protection against fraud and false papers being introduced into ballot boxes.  I would suggest that the Deputies might withdraw the amendment.  It is not of very major consequence to them.  There is no great conflict between us here.  I have shown the need for the numbers and once that has been shown I hope it is understood and accepted in that sense by the Deputies who put down the amendment.</P>
    <P>Another point came up that I would like to refer to briefly in regard to the number on the back of the ballot papers and their size.  The law states that they shall be of a size compatible with legibility.  This has been questioned and Deputy Hogan produced a ballot paper.  I did not see it but I understand that the number on the back of it is not in his opinion compatible with legibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too compatible with legibility.  That is the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem here and I would like to get a chance to explain it to the House.  Since 1963 the law has required that the number on the back of each ballot paper shall be printed in the smallest characters compatible with legibility.  The Stationery Office place contracts for the printing of ballot papers on behalf of the returning officers and these contracts run for a number of years.  This is for Dáil elections.  The last contracts which were placed by the Stationery Office for Dáil election ballot papers commenced on 1st April, 1970, and continues until 31st March, 1977.  There are 22 printing firms with whom contracts have been made to do this work when required.  I have inquired today from one of these firms who do most of the printing as they do all of the Dublin constituencies.  This firm has been using 14-point type for the serial numbers on the back of ballot papers, I think similar in size to the one Deputy Hogan has in front of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantially smaller.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that there may be small differences in the size of the characters used by other printers but basically I understand that they are of the same dimensions.  I understand also that machines that will print a smaller size of character can, in fact, be obtained but the cost of adapting the present machines would be very high.  There are no firm figures available to me and I made this rough check this morning as I understood Deputies wanted some information on this.  The estimates that I have been given are that it would cost approximately £2,000 to adapt the machines to print a smaller size number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>What size?  Will the Minister be precise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying, but to get any size smaller than that, you can take it that it would cost approximately £2,000 to adapt a machine to print a smaller size number.  There are 22 printers and to continue with contracts with all of these printers we would be involved in quite a substantial expenditure.  Of course, as the contracts have already been placed I would expect that the State would possibly be expected to carry this increased expenditure of over £40,000.</P>
      <P>In view of the cost of adapting these machines and the fact that we will be faced with a referendum in the very near future, I would suggest to the Deputies that in order to try to meet the point they are making I will request the Stationery Office to look fully into this whole matter with a view to establishing what can be done during the course of the present contracts and in future contracts to facilitate the use of a smaller size number than that which has been used up to now.</P>

      <P>To hear the Minister talking one would imagine that this was some kind of mumbo jumbo story that we have been putting here in the House.  It was put as plain as plain could be by the three of us who spoke here on the last occasion. Deputy Keating hit the nail on the head when he said it was the suggestion that was made that was so important. The Minister in that long statement of his has not been able to give a single instance in 50 years where the number on the back of the ballot paper was counted, although, indeed, we had the long counts in the 1965 election; one went on for 11 days and another for nine days.  They were in North-East Dublin and Longford/Westmeath.  In neither case did the matter of the numbers on the back of the ballot papers enter into it.  A Deputy remarked to me privately a few nights ago that there were too many ballot papers in one <Col N="1600" /> box; in other words, the box had been stuffed with ballot papers or the certificate of the presiding officer was wrong, but I am not saying which was the case.  The Deputy told me that another person in the discussion said to him: &ldquo;Why not do something about it?&rdquo;  He replied that this would mean the people would be put to the expense of another election and nobody wanted that.  Even if someone puts some extra ballot papers into the polling boxes, an individual candidate will not bring an election petition.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary says I have not correctly repeated what the Minister said, would he mind telling me what the Minister did say because he was present also? I heard the Minister say that and I am sure Deputy Hogan did also.  This whole business is a storm in a teacup and it is simply that the Government <Col N="1602" /> will never take any amendments from the Opposition.  I am not going to accept the Minister's statement that he talked to printers.  On one occasion in this House since I returned I accepted the word of a Minister that he would do something about a matter in the Seanad but he never even mentioned it, never mind doing anything about it. I will not take this kind of nonsense from any Minister.  Furthermore, we will not give the Report Stage today as well as other Stages unless some reasonable accommodation is provided for us by the Minister; I am sure the Minister knows what I mean by &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As regards the ridiculous story about the contract being placed until 1977, nobody will swallow that.  What relevance has such a contract?  All that is involved, if the contractors maintain we have changed the terms of the contract, is that they are entitled to some compensation.  At one time the Minister said it would cost £2,000 for the city of Dublin and then he said it would cost 20 times that amount.  Will the Minister make up his mind what it will cost?  The truth is that he does not know; in other words, he is stretching his imagination, as he has accused us of doing.  We want to ensure that there is nothing on the ballot paper except the name of the candidate with such description as is proper.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan was quite right regarding the phraseology that has been used.  It is stated that &ldquo;the number on the back of the ballot paper shall be printed in the smallest type as is compatible with legibility&rdquo;.  Of course, that is not law; it is merely a piece of writing.  It is impossible to define the smallest size of type compatible with legibility.  Material I could read when I was 30 I would find very difficult to read now.  If I were as young as Deputy Andrews I could read very different type from what I read now.  Who is to judge in this matter?</P>

      <P>It is completely illegible.  One of the reasons is that it is printed in a kind of dark yellow on off-white paper, with the result that one would need a magnifying glass to read it.  The Minister made a point which appeared to have some relevance, namely, that if this type is used the ink would blot and the numbers would not come out.  If that is the case it is a reflection on the type of paper that is used and in that event it is only suitable for another purpose.</P>

      <P>Do not mind what is on the card; we are only talking about the size of the print which runs from six-point to 12-point.  Anybody could read it.  The fact is we did not make this suggestion out of a desire to create difficulties.  It is the Minister who is creating difficulties in the sense that he talks about the referendum coming up.  I do not give twopence whether the referendum is coming up or not.  If the ballot papers are going to be printed for the referendum in a way in which they should not be printed, I am all against it.  I do not mind, personally, how long we wait for the referendum: I think it runs a fair chance of being thrown out anyway.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that with the case decided in the courts he had no option but to bring in this Bill&mdash;he has hung certain things on to it&mdash;and instead of listening to us with care and making some effort to meet us, he gives out a lot of polite language but at the same time shows no sign of having listened to the arguments made here on the last occasion.  He said he did give good reasons.  I do not believe he gave any reasons at all on the last day.  I think he was surprised that the matter came up at all.  He says the purpose of the numbers is for the security of the ballot.  How does that give protection?  I know what the Parliamentary Secretary's view is but that is a different matter&mdash;to secure that no false ballots are allowed into the count&mdash;but numbering will not secure that false ballots do not come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not blind and we have all seen small polling booths in the country where 98 or 99 per cent of the people vote, but does anybody believe that is correct when a good percentage of them would have emigrated and some of them would be dead? The business of voting for dead people is well known.  There is this pretence that having the number on the ballot papers does something.  The purpose of having the registration number of the voter on the counterfoil was to try to prevent that very thing.  But that is what the courts ruled out.  There is <Col N="1605" /> now no method of cross-checking between the voter, the dead voter, and whether his vote is in the box or not. There will be no benefit.  Granted that on the register of voters when a man votes, a stroke is drawn through his name by the presiding officer and the personating agent, meaning that he has voted.  If somebody else comes in and says: &ldquo;I am Tom Sullivan&rdquo; he is told &ldquo;Sorry, but Tom Sullivan's vote is gone.&rdquo;  This is what he is told even though they might well know that the man who had voted was the wrong person.  Sometimes they give a special colour of ballot paper.</P>
    <P>The Minister also talks about the breach of secrecy.  How many actions have been taken in the courts, not alone for breaches of secrecy, but for personation?  Was there any action taken for personation in the whole country after the last election or the one before that?</P>

      <P>I am leading up to the untenable nature of the Minister's case and the arguments he is making.  He gives the example of five votes between two candidates and says that, in fact, if a petition was made on the basis of one candidate being elected rather than another it might be decided on the basis of the numbers on the back of the ballot papers and that the votes in dispute could only be identified by the returning officer indicating what the numbers were. There are various other methods of <Col N="1606" /> identifying votes.  A, B, C, D and E could be written on the front of them in ink.  These are the five notes.  This is just nonsense.  It is absolutely infantile to say you could not identify the votes in dispute without having a number on the back.</P>

The Heavens will not fall if the Minister is foolish enough to dig his heels in and make a stand on a matter of this sort but he will have to wait a while for his Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a purely hypothetical defence in respect of the necessity to have these numbers on the backs of the ballot papers.  He mentioned that if a petition went to court there would be no means of identifying a particular vote unless there was a number on the back and if five votes were questioned as regards their embossing it would be necessary to identify them.  That situation does not arise.  Votes are accepted or rejected on the basis of their embossing, if it is good or bad and if the assessors are satisfied or are not and no notice is taken of the number on the back.  In the case of every vote questioned by the assessors&mdash;and there are four sitting around a table&mdash;do they refer to the number on the back? They look at the embossing and ask: Is that right or wrong?  What would a reasonable person think of it?  Is it a fair job?  They agree among themselves: &ldquo;We will let that one through and we will reject this one&rdquo;.  That is how it is done in practice.  There is this hypothetical court case which the Minister envisages but he has not given us one example.</P>

      <P>I fail to understand why it is necessary to put the number of the constituency on the back of the papers when the papers are numbered already in accordance with the number of constituents.  Even if we accept that numbers should appear on the back of voting papers I find it difficult to understand <Col N="1608" /> why it is necessary to have the numbers on the side in 14-point print. That is not compatible with what is said in the Schedule to the Bill, which is that the back of each ballot paper shall be numbered consecutively and the back of the counterfoil attached to it shall bear the same number.  It says that the number on the back of the ballot paper shall be printed in the smallest characters compatible with legibility.  They are not to be compatible with the smallest machine that is available.  At column 387 of the Official Report for the 25th January, 1972, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>It requires an extreme stretch of the imagination to imagine that such a system could be applied successfully. The requirement that the number on the ballot paper should be as small as is compatible with legibility would greatly reduce the possibility of anybody being able to read the number easily.</P>
      <P>Although it is laid down in the Bill that the numbers shall be in the smallest characters compatible with legibility we are told by the Minister that this is not technically possible, that the ingenuity of man has not yet devised in this computerised age a system by which we could print a matter to conform to the directions in the Schedule to a Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular proviso has been in legislation here for several years.  I thought it had been there since 1923.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it does not make sense to have that proviso written into Electoral Bills one after another and for the Minister to come to the House in 1972 and say that machines to print in accordance with this are not readily available.  In other words, since 1962 this has not been carried out because the machines presumably are not there now and have not been there since this proviso was introduced into legislation in 1964. This seems to be just a pious hope to write something like this into a Bill.  This numbering has been in operation since the State was founded and has never been utilised. If you go to the trouble of getting this kind of thing placed on voting papers and in 50 years the numbers have never been adverted to on one occasion, what is the point of continuing it, particularly when the objection has been raised?  One can say there is still suspicion as regards the secrecy of the ballot.  It still leaves the matter open to intimidation.  Suppose somebody took this case to court in the morning and said: &ldquo;The marking by the presiding officer of the number of the voter on the counterfoil has been done away with by your High Court ruling, but we contend it is still not a secret ballot and that it is still unconstitutional.&rdquo; Left as it is, its constitutionality could still be challenged in the High Court, as much of our legislation could be challenged if people were so disposed or if people had the money to spare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the arguments the Minister has put up as to the necessity for continuing this numbering on the back of the ballot papers.  I am not so concerned about the numbering on the block.  Deputy O'Donovan has another amendment dealing with the numbering on the back of the ballot paper.  That is the crucial issue.  If that goes all our objections here would be met.  It is pointless for the Minister to introduce <Col N="1612" /> a hypothetical case, saying: &ldquo;If this happened....&rdquo;  Since 1922, something should have happened in the many elections we have had.  If this number is removed from the ballot paper it will allay the fears of the public if we can say to them beyond yea or nay: &ldquo;This is a secret ballot. You cannot be intimidated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this imperfect world of ours no matter what you do you will not prevent some trick being performed in an election booth.  The ingenuity of man will get around numbering or any other such device.  There still have to be the courts and prosecutions for departures from orthodox practice.  It is ridiculous to think that numbering is a safeguard. If a local printing office wants to print bogus ballot papers at the next election there is nothing to prevent them putting a number on the back of the ballot paper.  It will be a question then of which ballot paper is right, the one the presiding officer has opened or the one the person doing the stunt has pushed into the ballot box.  Numbering on the back of the ballot paper will not stop that.  I can, for example, go into an election booth, get my voting paper and on the way out say to somebody &ldquo;My number is so-and-so&rdquo;.  He can watch the next person going in and say his number is so-and-so, and so on down the line.  The papers are given out in sequence.  Once I vote and give my number everybody else's voting number is open to any person in the polling booth.  Therefore they are open to be checked on afterwards at the count, and the secrecy of the ballot box has been breached.  If anyone wants to put in a false voting paper he can get the agent to print it.  I can take the number on the back of the ballot paper and say: &ldquo;This is 25.  I voted early.  From 25 on you will be quite safe.  They will be duplicated in the ballot box but you can pass them in.&rdquo;  Nobody ever looks at them afterwards.  Under proportional representation it is difficult enough to count the votes.  I do not think the sequence of numbers is ever checked in a serious fashion in any part of the country.  Unless there was some mechanised method it would be simply impossible to go over the numbers on the back of the ballot papers.  Therefore I <Col N="1613" /> do not see any purpose in continuing that numbering.</P>
    <P>As I say, the numbers on the counterfoils of the voting paper could be left.  It might be of some use to the presiding officer in checking the number of papers he has given out.  If the Minister is so anxious to ensure the validity of votes I can see nothing objectionable in getting the presiding officer to put a signature on every vote he hands out.  In the polling booth from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. perhaps he hands out 200 voting papers.  Surely it is not asking too much that he would put a careful signature on every voting paper he hands out.  That would be a good method of identification and as near as you could get to having everything in order in a polling booth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Hogan.  There should be no ambiguity about this.  The vote should be secret and the people should be let know it is secret.  If the numbers are left on the back of the ballot paper a person's vote can be traced. Any personation agent or tally clerk can sit down beside the presiding officer, as he does, at an election and can take and mark on his register the first person that comes in and votes No. 6.  If the block starts at the No. 500 all he has to do with every person that comes in after that is to number them according to how they voted.  It can be traced and it has been traced in the past.  The Minister knows that as well as everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past unscrupulous canvassers went around the country and called on voters at the dead of night.  They told them: &ldquo;We can trace how you vote and if you do not vote the way we want you to vote you will lose your work on the road; you will lose your social welfare benefit; you will lose your blind pension; you will lose your disablility allowance.&rdquo;  This has happened throughout the length and breadth of the country.  This has been done by unscrupulous politicians and their agents and it is time an end was put to it.  We want to ensure that the secrecy of the ballot box is absolute and that no one can find out how any constituent voted.  Voters are entitled to that.  There must be some reason <Col N="1614" /> why the Government are insistent on maintaining this practice of having numbers on the backs of ballot papers. As Deputy Hogan said, none of us would have any objection to numbers on counterfoils.</P>
    <P>On the point of counterfeit ballot papers, the fact is no one can get hold of the stamp used by the presiding officer.  Last week the point was made that very often the stamp does not mark the papers properly and, as a result of that, arguments took place at the counts.  I have known arguments to go on for hours, arguments as to whether or not a ballot paper was properly stamped.  Now the Minister promised he would introduce a machine to have ballot papers perforated. Even if it were possible for a counterfeiter to get hold of the presiding officer's stamp, surely there could be a secret stamp issued on the morning of the election to every presiding officer.  That would meet the objections to the present system.  To stop the intimidation it is imperative that the number should be taken off the back of the ballot paper.</P>

      <P>Listening to some speakers one would imagine that voting takes place in a church-like atmosphere. Nothing of the sort happens. You go along to the polling station and you have there the presiding officer and the personation agents. You are handed a ballot paper with a number on it.  I cannot understand why the court held that the registration number on the counterfoil was a violation of secrecy; it is easy enough to put the two together, the number on the back of the ballot paper and the number on the counterfoil.  That is why the court insisted that the number should be written on the front.  Actually it is entirely against the spirit of the secrecy of voting that there should be any number at all and I cannot understand why the court did not hold that the entire thing should be scrapped. However, that is for the court to explain, not for me.  I had nothing whatever to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's whole approach is quite illogical.  If there is a number on the back it does not matter whether the votes are counted face upwards or face downwards.  The votes are put together in bundles and they are then counted face upwards.  At the counts there is a good deal of confrontation. It is only someone from Kerry, with a smile in his eyes, who would maintain that no trouble arises.  Of course <Col N="1616" /> it does.  Anyone with any experience knows what happens and the kind of thing that goes on.

If a voter goes in and says he is Tom O'Donnell, he is then challenged and the personation agent puts him the question.  Putting the question means making him swear that he is the man he says he is.  If he is personating he turns on his heel and walks out.  He is not arrested.  He just walks out and this is the proof that he was trying to personate.</P>

Of course, the real reason is that the Civil Service must prevail, the administration must never be held to be wrong.

The Executive predominates but there are certain sanctions open to Deputies and one of them is that on Committee Stage of a Bill we can speak as often as we like and for as long as we like.  No man ever gave a better example of that than the former Deputy MacEntee on the Greyhound Bill in 1955 when he talked at length and read out huge chunks of <Col N="1619" /> stuff.  On these amendments I could read the 1923 Electoral Act from start to finish if I wished to filibuster.  I am not doing that but we can prevent the Minister from getting this Bill today and that is what we will do if the Minister does not behave reasonably.

Neither is the Minister, but he is assuming that mantle.  He explained to us with great pretensions the last day that it was impossible to provide any form of marking other than the embossing which we were inclined to criticise.  This side of the House was quite open to any new suggestion that could be made as to any method of marking voting papers which would be pretty foolproof and could not be imitated easily.  The Minister has made the point that the embossing is quite satisfactory if the presiding officer will use it.  The same could be said of any system introduced. No matter how perfect it is, if the presiding officer will not use it, it falls down.  When we suggested to the Minister that perhaps some other system might be useful or might be an improvement on the embossing, he immediately came back on us and said that he had made inquiries into this, that it would cost so many thousands of pounds and that it would take a year to introduce a system of perforating the ballot paper.

I am not convinced.  These are all spurious objections.  They seem to me to be red herrings.</P>
      <P>We have no amendment here suggesting that the smallest possible number compatible with legibility should be introduced.  It is not necessary to put in an amendment to that effect. That is in the Act.  That is laid down. Yet we are told that this is not physically possible, that it costs too much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told that by the Minister.  I do not know who told the Minister.  He has not produced an affidavit.  He has not given us any evidence except that he had made a phone call and that phone call is something that we must accept, we must not question.  The Minister made a phone call, God knows to where, and he tells the House that in this country, in present circumstances, we cannot produce this type of printing on the back of ballot papers.  In other words, in reference to a legal direction laid down first in 1964 and incorporated in any Electoral Bill we have passed since then, and in operation in all our polling booths, he tells us today that not alone has this never been acceded to&mdash;and I showed a ballot paper here that was rejected and which was not acceded to on the last occasion&mdash;but that it is impossible to do so, that the necessary machine is not available in this country.  Apparently, since 1964, no effort has been made to fulfil the direction of the legislation passed by this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister is charged, and his predecessors were charged, with the responsibility of laying down proper conditions for elections.  Yet, this Minister has failed and his predecessors have failed to fulfil the terms of the legislation.  They have not made a reasonable effort to provide the necessary marking on the back of the ballot papers compatible with legislation which we have passed.  Yet he had the effrontery to come in here and direct Deputy O'Donovan as to how he is to address him, that he is not to speak directly to him, that he is a man apart. He has failed in this respect to see that the marking on the back of the ballot papers has been carried out in accordance with the legislation that he has presented to us today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a Minister comes in here and has that affirmation on a Bill, he should either take it out or else it should be something that can be carried into effect.  Otherwise, it makes nonsense.  I would ask the Minister to repeal the section rather than leave <Col N="1622" /> it in the Bill if the position is that the next election must be carried out with that affirmation at the bottom of the Bill which cannot be carried out in the polling booths.  I would ask him what is the constitutional position arising if elections are carried out and the numbers are not on the ballot papers in large sizes such as 12-point or 14-point, or whatever the size may be, such as appeared on the ballot paper which I produced here on the last occasion?</P>

    <P Just="Center">APPENDIX.</P>
    <P>1.  The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1971, proposes to add the subsection here following to Article 29.4 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>3º The State may become a member of the European Coal and Steel Community (established by Treaty signed at Paris on the 18th day of April, 1951), the European Economic Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957) and the European Atomic Energy Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957).  No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the proposal is to allow the State to become a member of the communities commonly known as the European Communities.</P>
    <P>2.  If you APPROVE of the State's becoming a member of the European Communities, mark X opposite the word YES on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>3.  If you DO NOT APPROVE of the State's becoming a member of the European Communities, mark X opposite the word NO on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>4.  A copy of the Bill can be inspected free of charge and purchased for two and a half pence at any Post Office.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to assist voters at the referendum on the Third Amendment <Col N="1631" /> of the Constitution Bill, 1971, by providing that a special polling card containing a statement relating to the proposal for amendment of the Constitution would be sent to each elector, including postal voters.  The statement will also be displayed in and in the the precincts of polling stations, and presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters by reading out the statement to them and asking them whether they wish to vote in favour of or against the proposal and then marking the ballot paper in accordance with the voter's answers.</P>
      <P>These arrangements are similar to those made by the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1968, in relation to the referenda on the Third and Fourth Amendment to the Constitution Bills, 1968.  Similar arrangements had previously been made by the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1959, in relation to the 1959 referendum.  Under existing law the proposal which is the subject of the referendum must be stated on the ballot paper by citing by its Short Title the Bill containing the proposal passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Our legal advice is that there is no alternative to this.  It would be impracticable to set out the proposal itself on the ballot paper.  It would be extremely undesirable that the ballot paper should contain a summary or a paraphrase of the proposal because of the possibility of litigation to restrain the President from signing the Bill, even after a referendum, on the grounds that the proposal as stated on the ballot paper and, accordingly, as approved by the people was not identical in its legal effect to that contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I think the House will agree that it is desirable that a statement relating to the proposal for amendment of the Constitution should be circulated for the information of voters as was done in 1959 and in 1968.  Copies of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1971, will be available for inspection free of charge and can be purchased at all post offices at a cost of 2½p.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Deputies on both sides who contributed most constructively to the debate.  First of all, I had better deal with the questions that were raised in relation to the cost of health services.  Deputy Barry and some other Deputies suggested that the Exchequer should assume full liability.  To do what has been suggested would in the coming financial year involve the transfer of about £25 million from local to central taxation.  This would have to be considered by the Government as a matter of major financial policy.  I myself believe that whatever the arguments may be for the division of health expenditure as between the rating authorities and the Central Government, the rating authorities should always have some responsibility for raising money because, if the whole of the amount were subscribed by the State, they would lose all the independence they have in establishing health policy and establishing priorities in health policy.</P>
      <P>To raise this additional amount from taxation would require an extra 2½ per cent on turnover tax or an extra 6p in the £ in income tax or crippling increases in the duties on such items as drink and petrol.  The whole of this matter is coming up for consideration by the Minister for Local Government.  There have been many reports on ways and means of changing the rating structure.  The Minister for Local Government can speak far more ably on this subject than I can.  There is the question of the possible need for a re-valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to repeat what I said in the course of my speech on the Estimate that about 75 per cent of the total health services are paid for from central taxation.  The £9 million a year coming from agricultural rating relief is quite rightly included because the agricultural rate relief, which is a subvention from the State to relieve rates on agricultural land, is applied in proportion to the total expenditure of local authorities.  It is applied in proportion to the health expenditure in each county area and it is, therefore, perfectly fair to include the agricultural rate relief.  That being the case, <Col N="1635" /> the State is paying for 75 per cent of the health services.</P>
    <P>I admit that in the urban areas that rate relief does not apply and health rates bear very heavily on ratepayers. Although the paper I issued to Deputies and to health board members, analysing the breakdown of the increased expenditure by health authorities this year, does not apply to the 1971-72 accounts, as Deputies freely went beyond the 1971-72 period in their speeches and referred to current health policy and even to such items as choice of doctor, which only begins on April 1st, no one will, I think, object if I repeat what I wrote to Deputies: of the increased expenditure for health in the coming year £9.55 million represents increases entirely related to remuneration, the increased cost of commodities, the increased cost of drugs, food and maintenance, the effect of reducing the hours of working to 40 with a consequent introduction of new staff, and a very tiny element, which it was impossible to separate from the accounts, for increased numbers of patients.  For new services and for extensions to and improvements in existing services the total increase this year is £3 million. That means that there will be in the coming year a volume increase of 4 per cent on the cost of the health services as compared with last year.</P>
    <P>I understand that in even wealthier countries than ours a volume increase of anything between 3 and 5 per cent is considered acceptable.  On the basis of compound interest this means, of course, that the volume of health services in constant money terms doubles in 15 years.  In fact, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the volume of health services at constant money terms, disregarding increases in remuneration, not only in the last decade but for a longer period, the total value of production went up by about 50 to 60 per cent which means that, in order to improve the health services, after disallowing the heavy costs of remuneration increases, the people have willed a very great increase in expenditure.  Now this is absolutely essential if the services provided are to keep us in the group with the ten top countries in the world in <Col N="1636" /> which, according to the WHO statistics, we belong at this moment; the statistical tables provided by that organisation indicate in general the state of the health services and the state of the health of the nation.  I do not think I need say any more on that subject.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to be able to keep the increase in the rates at an average of 30p for this year.  We are constantly examining this question of the rating structure.  There are many problems in connection with it.  We have passed a law which enables an additional rate to be levied to relieve rates on necessitous persons.  That law has been applied in different measure in different counties by the different rating authorities. It serves a very useful purpose. Again, people can now pay rates by instalments if the respective authorities provide the necessary machinery.  I agree that rates bear very heavily on the community but I notice that the increase in rates in relation to the growth in production shows that production has grown to the extent where it measures up against the growth in rates.</P>
    <P>We are, admittedly, a fairly heavily taxed country; 30 per cent of the total value of production and of all services is taken in taxes and rates.  Again, that places us amongst the respectable top ten countries in all of which there is a common feature of high taxation. While rates may bear very heavily on people with fixed incomes, part of the unpopularity of rates lies in the payment of two moieties.  Now, if a person has to pay £60 in rates in two moieties over 12 months, that is about the same as he would pay by way of tax on petrol for a car of medium size over a distance of 10,000 miles or about the same as smoking 20 cigarettes every day.  I am not now trying to excuse the heavy impact of the rates.  I am merely indicating that the unpopularity lies in the money payment as distinct from the subtraction of tax by PAYE or as distinct from the excise tax automatically paid when one purchases a pint of stout, a packet of cigarettes or a gallon of petrol.  I merely mention that in passing.  That is all I can say on the subject of the difficulty of transferring the whole <Col N="1637" /> burden of rates to central taxation.  I believe an additional 2½ per cent on turnover tax would not be very popular.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of supplementary grants to limit rate increases. He said there was an apparent inequality of treatment in their application to different areas.  Some areas get more supplementary grants than others in order to confine the health rate increase within the specified limits. I could not explain this without going into very great detail, but I can assure the Deputy and those others who raised the point that the differences which exist are not caused by either extravagant spending or bad estimation.</P>
    <P>An example may illustrate the point.  For instance, because of the big difference in valuation it would take almost as much special grant to give County Meath the equivalent of 14 pence in the £ relief as it would to give County Monaghan the equivalent of nearly 30 pence in the £ relief.  Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that areas which utilise the services of the voluntary hospitals to any appreciable extent are already getting considerable relief through the medium of the grant-in-aid of the Hospitals Trust Fund as compared with those areas which provide the necessary services in their own hospitals.  Therefore, there is nothing we can do about the matter which he raised.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the health contributions under the Health Contributions Act.  I have given a very clear description to Deputies of the circumstances in which the Health Contributions Act was started.  Some Deputies suggested that we could extend the family doctor service to persons in the limited eligibility class and finance it by an increase in the health contributions.  The health contribution brings us in £5 million gross, £4.3 million net.  The cost of extending the family doctor service to the limited eligibility class cannot be easily calculated accurately, but I would say it would be between £20 million and £25 million.  It will immediately be seen that a very heavy contribution would have to be levied for this purpose.  The question of what the <Col N="1638" /> level of the health contribution in future would be depends on the total Exchequer position in relation to health policy, but the Government have decided that if one was to levy more than £7 a year and to do it because people are demanding better and better health services and they are going to become more expensive as the years go by it would only be fair to do it if you could have a payrelated form of contribution.  I understand that the Minister for Finance is preparing a computerised system enabling pay related social welfare benefits to be introduced as indicated as a long-term promise by the Minister for Social Welfare.  When we can have pay related social welfare benefits we will also be able to have pay related health contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may say that but the fact is that the Deputy is way out on this subject of being able to provide a full insured policy for health.  I am sorry to tell the Deputy that if you take countries like Denmark and the Netherlands, where because of their history as free nations and their belief in the co-operative system, they started very early to establish co-operative insurance and where they were accustomed to the co-operative principle, accustomed to sharing the benefits and costs of co-operative enterprise, in every single one of those States the insurance principle has completely broken down because of the high cost of hospitalisation.  In every single one of them either the municipalities or the State Government largely subsidise the hospital service for the insured groups and this for reasons that relate to the psychology of taxation.  We cannot discuss that this evening but apparently every Government in the world has a hunch that you cannot increase an insurance contribution by more than X per cent per year and if you do it you either lose your seats in Parliament or there is a protest and, therefore, you substitute for that general taxation or, alternatively, you try to have as a substitute for general taxation an insurance amount and then, again, the <Col N="1639" /> amount you can have for insurance is limited.  Deputy Barry will find, if he studies the health services of Europe, that in every case this element of subsidisation is compulsorily enforced because of the psychological impact effect of a total insurance contribution on the people who have to pay.  If he studies it he will find that I am right in saying this.</P>
      <P>The British are the best example. They began with a total service from the cradle to the grave under the wonderful Sir William Beveridge.  He will always be revered for what he did in 1944.  He could never predict what the costs of health or social welfare would be.  He thought it was going to be a total insurance operation and now, as Deputy Hogan will know from my answer to his question, the total proportion of health expenditure met in Great Britain from social insurance was something between 2½ and 4 per cent of the total cost.  There is an example where the insurance principle completely collapsed and you now have in England a huge sum levied on the ordinary taxpayer for the health services. This is a very difficult question.</P>
      <P>Next is the question of standards of eligibility for medical cards.  As indicated by some Deputies, there were about 20 different standards being used for medical cards&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in some counties there was not even a written standard.  A written standard was kept in a drawer, not in any deceiving way, but it was never openly applied.  It was simply used as a private guideline by the county manager and by the superintendent assistance officer.  I want to make it quite clear also that there were some counties where the Health Act, 1953 provision that every medical card must be constantly revised was not being obeyed or followed.  When the new chief executive officers came into office before they decided to examine medical card standards they did at least begin to revise medical cards where the incomes of the people had clearly surpassed the medical card upper limit.  What we have asked the <Col N="1640" /> CEOs to do is to try to get uniformity for medical cards within their health boards areas.  Then we are going to see whether through their own collaboration on an informal basis they have managed to establish a medical card standard that is fairly uniform over the whole country.  That is what is being done.  The only direction I gave was that I did not see that it was necessary to increase the number of medical card holders all over the country.  I was aware of the fact that there were going to be minuses and pluses.  There were going to be people who went to a private doctor and who did not have much hospital experience or need to go to hospital and who consequently did not take out a medical card because they wanted to go to a private doctor whom they had to pay. Those people, now that there is the choice of doctor system, are liable to take medical cards if they are within the statutory limits.  That would be a plus.</P>
      <P>There would be minuses in the case of people who never should have had medical cards.  I just gave a general instruction to try to keep the number at 30 per cent of the total which I think is reasonable and I have not had many complaints in this House that the medical card standard based on 30 per cent of the population is unreasonable. I have asked the CEOs to complete this task so that at most we will have eight standards in operation and that there will be a very considerable degree of similarity between the standards. This time the standards will be published so that everybody will know that the hardship rule at the upper end of the medical card limit of income will still operate and the person who normally would not get a medical card because his income came just above the top limit, if he has the continuing and very often harrowing experience of the need for general practitioner service and the need for drug service, will continue to get the medical card either temporarily over an emergency period in the life of his family and himself or permanently if he has to go constantly to a doctor.  The hardship clause will remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked about the comparison with Northern Ireland health services.  I <Col N="1641" /> want to be followed very carefully and accurately by our good friends in the Press when I speak of this because I do not want to have my words misapplied.</P>

      <P>Having said that, if the day of reunification should come, we would obviously have to harmonise our health services with those of Northern Ireland.  I do not think there would be any harm if we negotiated this.  If the system we adopt here proved acceptable to the people in Northern Ireland, with a very much lower rate of taxation, then we could agree on our system or a compromise system.  I recognise that in our position we would have to do everything to secure the consent of the people of Northern Ireland to reunification and <Col N="1642" /> we could not stand back on the proposition of whether there should be our triple system of the upper income group, the limited eligibility group and the medical card group.  We could not stand back on it.  I am only saying that it would cost an extra £30 million, as I have already indicated in reply to a question that was asked of me some months ago.  We would have to find the money and we would do it but I want to say that I am not in the least ashamed of the services performed in our hospitals by our consultants in this country as compared with those in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>There has been much criticism, irresponsible criticism, by Deputy Coughlan, but not by many Deputies, of the operations of the health boards.  I do not think I need repeat that the extra cost of headquarters staff amounts to one new halfpenny in the £.  That is the total cost of the headquarters staff.  I am not in the least ashamed of this amount.  That amount of money can be very well spent in the organisation of the health services.  Do I need to <Col N="1643" /> repeat to the House the main reasons for establishing the health boards? Quite simply, they are, the growing specialisation in hospitals and the fact that there is hardly a single county where all the patients go to the hospitals within that county and none of them go to the hospitals in an adjacent county and none of them go to Dublin for special treatment.  Therefore, there was already a regionalisation of health board hospital services and in view of the growing specialisation it was at least essential to combine a number of counties, as was already the case in connection with the Dublin, Limerick and Waterford Health Authorities, before the Health Board Act was passed.  It is essential to combine these counties in order to make the best use of bed accommodation, the best use of specialists and outpatient clinics.  There is not a modern consultant in this country who would dispute that statement and, indeed, it is fully accepted by the vast majority of the elected members to the health boards that such an overall administration covering a number of counties is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>The second reason was the very great need for establishing far more community services, for establishing a wide range of social service councils. For this it is absolutely essential to offer a headquarters staff to the social workers, to the public health nurses, to everyone concerned in community health, a headquarters staff which would produce people with real expertise and ambition and, secondly, would offer promotion to those who join the service and in order to have better decentralised services it was absolutely essential to organise from larger areas.</P>
      <P>The whole basis of the McKinsey Report was that the structure of the health board administration must be fully decentralised wherever this is required, that there must be local offices, there must be assistance officers to whom people can appeal over the question of medical cards and everything else.  That kind of organisation is being established and making progress.</P>

      <Col N="1644" /> The last thing I wanted to say about the health boards is that they have been in operation only for less than a year in the full sense and in the case of some of them because of the rules we have for the appointment of staff, programme managers are not yet appointed and there have been a second group of advertisements and calls for examinations by the Local Appointments Commission.  We have had difficulty in getting Volume 4 of the McKinsey Report, providing for the support staff of the health boards, accepted by some health boards. Others accepted it with alacrity or in a modified form.  When we have the health boards operating properly they will be able to do something that was never done by the old county health authorities.  First of all, they will be able to do multi-annual budgeting. They will have the national general health policy as declared by myself and supported by this House if it chooses to pass the Estimate for Health each year and chooses to keep my Government in office.  They will have some concept of the volume of increase of money they can spend on matters other than increased remuneration and costs for existing services. They will have a report of the past performance of the health board services, on the efficiency of the services. They will have a proper management system for the health board hospitals, either a single administrator or a joint administrator, and they will have hospital committees.</P>
    <P>Having these reports, they will be able to ensure efficiency.  Then they will have a list of all the hospital projects, geriatric projects and other projects, that are required in the area, prepared for them partly through the advice of the country advisory health committees who maintain communication from individual counties with the health boards, partly through the submissions of the health board members themselves and partly through the officers.  They will have a list of proposals for future expansion, for future capital expenditure and, based on the general national policy, they will then be able to make a meaningful choice of which of the items should be in priority.  This will be a decision taken <Col N="1645" /> by the health board every year.  This arrangement can only be completed when the whole of the health board structure is in operation and when the inevitable paper work and inevitable administrative arrangements are completed, so that the information can be provided in this kind of way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I might look into it. I do not think I need go into the question of the regional hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal.  The House will have ample time to examine these matters when they come before the House in July.  They are part of the recommendations made in the White Paper and they will be brought in the form of a single resolution before the Dáil and the Seanad when they can be discussed.  I gave a great deal of information in this House at the time of the Health Bill and in relation to the White Paper on the general character of these bodies and there is no need to discuss the matter now.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of domiciliary care of the aged.  It is the duty of the programme community manager to develop domiciliary care for the aged as much as possible.  As those people who follow the health services in detail know, the care of the aged involves the establishment of rehabilitation and assessment services; it involves providing the right kind of accommodation for the chronic sick; and it involves providing the right kind of accommodation in pleasant surroundings for ambulant old people who are homeless.  I am glad to say there are propositions for at least 20 hostels, each of 40 rooms, for the aged.  Some of these hostels are in the course of construction, five or seven more will be built this year out of about 25 that are proposed for various parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These hostels for the aged will be a great improvement on the county homes, even the improved county homes.  However, if they are to succeed <Col N="1647" /> there will have to be voluntary services in the area, people who will visit the aged, who will talk with them and be of assistance to them, to support the small staff that will be appointed to each hostel.  This year we had a small estimate for £150,000 for home help &mdash;one of the provisions of the Health Act, 1970.  I hope this money will largely go to voluntary organisations with the consent of the local health boards.</P>
    <P>In addition there will be an increase of £100,000, making £300,000 in all, as grants from my Department to health boards to help the voluntary organisations concerned with the care of the aged.  We have increased the grant by £100,000.  We did not spend much more than £250,000 last year, largely because although there has been a massive and welcome development of voluntary services for care of the aged we must go a great deal further.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to my observations on the psychiatric nurses strike.  I wish to repeat that no one can tell me I have not intervened when I regarded it as right to do so in aid of those in the health services where there should be an improvement in their conditions, in the case of junior doctors and nurses in particular. Everyone knows I am not against fair conditions and wages but, bearing in mind the fact that an open hearing of the Labour Court was definitely arranged ten days before the strike took place, I regarded the strike as absolutely indefensible.</P>
    <P>I am not going to read the House the list of complaints I received on what happened during the strike in many of the hospitals where the actions taken were far from desirable.  I am not going to say any more about it, but I still say we do not need to be absolutely rigid in this country, that there can be no industry or services where arbitration is not accepted simply because it is the habit of the country to think in this protesting way. Why should we not go a little in the Swedish, the Danish and the Norwegian direction in regard to the acceptance of agreed arbitration for certain essential industries?  If we are <Col N="1648" /> going to start with essential industries one might think of electricity but even more important than that is the care of the sick.  We might all agree that never again will there be a strike where sick people are concerned.  Now that we have the new conciliation system in the Department of Local Government for processing claims made by local authority staffs and health staffs, there should be even less occasion for the strike weapon in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that on this important point it does not help to be too dictatorial?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I said why should we not be a little like the Swedes and other nations regarding acceptance of agreed arbitration.  Some observations were made with regard to the mentally handicapped.  I should like to repeat again that there are 1,400 places, the number required to complete the programme in hands at the moment.  I have obtained the agreement of the Minister for Finance that lack of finance is not a bar to completing this programme. There will be between 350 and 400 places provided in each of the next three years.  The religious organisations are moving as quickly as they can in the provision of these residential places but it takes time.  It requires architectural plans, it requires due consideration, and staffs must be trained.  I can tell the House that there is no financial hold-up for the completion of the 5,600 places suggested in the Report of the Commission on Mental Handicap; we have already provided some 4,250 places.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry inquired about the 13th round of remuneration for ambulance drivers.  I understand that two of the unions agreed to proposals made by the Southern Health Board; the remaining union have objected and discussions are taking place with the local government staff negotiations board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> Deputy Tully raised the matter of Lourdes marriages.  I am doing my best to get agreement about revisions in the Bill.  I have not yet succeeded but I think I am nearing some agreement. A number of Deputies raised questions about when certain improvements were to be made in various hospitals.  If the Deputies inquire from me I will be able to tell them what is happening with regard to each hospital project.  I will not give to the House the list of Mid-Western Health Board projects that are in various stages of development.  In reply to Deputy Coughlan, who seemed to suggest that nothing was being done in Limerick, I would point out that there are a great number of projects at various stages of development.</P>
    <P>Observations were made with regard to short-stay treatment units.  We are developing short-stay psychiatric units and there are about five projects in course of development.  I intend to have as many such units as are required for the whole country.  I regard as a matter of priority for the mental illness service the decentralisation of the present services.  This has taken place steadily in Dublin and I hope it will also take place in other areas.  Another priority is the expansion of out-patient clinics and the development of a psychiatric social workers service.  Psychiatric social workers are rather scarce on the ground and we must try to recruit them.  Another essential is the establishment of industrial therapy in all the mental hospitals.  If Deputies read the projects for this year they will see that there is provision for the establishment of industrial and occupational therapy units in mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>The reason these are regarded as priority measures is that a large number of young people are entering mental hospitals.  We have four to six times the numbers entering mental hospitals in Scotland, Wales and England. We want to reduce the impact of schizophrenia among young people between the ages of 25 and 34 and so we regard industrial therapy, better out-patient clinics and short-stay clinics as the way to deal most effectively with the one group in the community that we want to cure of mental illness and that we want to avoid mental illness, <Col N="1650" /> if possible.  We have approved a short-stay psychiatric unit at the James Connolly Memorial Hospital.  I mentioned that in reply to a question by Deputy Clinton.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked whether mass X-ray is any longer justified.  We are examining this matter and I am inclined to agree that, perhaps, we should have greater selectivity in the cases that are X-rayed, having regard to the present position of TB in the country. This is under examination but we believe in maintaining the BCG vaccination which we think has had a very great effect in eliminating tuberculosis and preventing its onset.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the dental service.  I have been quite frank with the House and I have said that the dental services, bearing in mind the enormous cost of the health services, are a low priority on my list. We have very greatly increased the number of permanent dental officers and sessions for dentists in the last four years and we have allowed for this year quite a considerable sum, £250,000 for improvements in this service.  I hope it can be improved as rapidly as possible but, compared with such matters as the choice of doctor service and the drug assistance plan, I do not regard it as a high priority although I am aware of the problem.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about the treatment of drug abuse.  We are going ahead with this as fast as we can.  We have carried out the greater part of the recommendations of the Drug Abuse Committee and as the last one we have decided to inaugurate seminars for teachers, parents' associations and youth leaders.  One of these seminars has already taken place and two more have been organised.  We are including alcoholism in this project.  In regard to alcoholism I have taken note of what Deputies have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it should be introduced as soon as possible.  In regard to alcoholism I have already asked the health boards to appoint a social worker with a great vocational gift for speaking and talking and understanding the problem of alcoholism so that all the associations and bodies interested in trying to prevent this fearful scourge can be alerted and can work together.  I intend to take this problem from under the carpet by asking the National Council for Alcoholism to make the kind of inquiry into the incidence of excessive drinking which when the report is published will have the same shock effect, I hope, as the report of the working party on drug abuse had in relation to a relatively far less serious problem.  Combating alcoholism is not only a question of dealing with the alcoholic when that alcoholic loses all personal control and willpower.  That is an essential part of the programme but it is even more essential to try to get people to take advice when they still have control over their faculties and when they have not passed beyond the point of no return.</P>
      <P>The point of no return is impossible to classify therapeutically or psychologically; there are differences of opinion on it.  I was told by the experts at the international congress that one of the certain signs that a person is becoming an alcoholic is if he does not remember the next morning what he did the night before.  He should then definitely enter a clinic.  That is only one example of the point of no return. We must get people before they reach that point.</P>
      <P>I think I have answered most of the important questions that have arisen. A great many other questions that were asked have already been answered through supplementaries to questions asked in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a final question?  I spoke at length in regard to the position of Mallow hospital. When concluding, I asked the Minister if he was prepared to receive a <Col N="1652" /> deputation from the councillors in Cork in this regard.  I suggested the Minister might tell us when replying. He has not told us.  Will he tell us now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As I told the Deputy, under no circumstances will I ever go in reverse in regard to the proposals in the Fitzgerald Report.  I made that clear.  I have said that if the health board so wish, the services and facilities as at present constituted in the Mallow Hospital can be continued. In regard to the general operation of the Fitzgerald Report, I have already told the House many times that in regard to the controversial proposals, the report of the Medical and Social Research Board will have to be examined and analysed by the regional health boards and the regional hospital boards.  Before any step was taken I would receive the county advisory committee with such co-options as they desire to put on that committee.  In view of this tremendous agitation in Cork and, as I believe in communication, I have already informed Deputy Cronin, Minister for Defence and the other Fianna Fáil Deputies that if it is any help and they want to discuss this with me I will receive in advance, instead of after all these other deliberations have taken place, a deputation consisting of the new north Cork county advisory health committee.  If they choose to co-opt some representatives of the retention committee.  I am willing to see that committee.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £9,988,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1972, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments <Col N="1654" /> to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>
    <P>When the Estimate for my Department was before the House in November last, I explained that a Supplementary Estimate would be required later in the year to meet the cost of the 1971 Budget increases.  This Supplementary Estimate makes provision accordingly, and, of course, it provides also for any additional amounts required by reason of upward trends in expenditure under different subheads.  The additional amount required is £9,988,000 which brings the total Exchequer expenditure on social security services in the current financial year to almost £85½ million. An additional amount of £282,000 is required under the heading &ldquo;Administration&rdquo;. This covers salary increases, higher travelling and incidental expenses and an increase in the payments to medical certifiers.  Under Subhead E&mdash;payment to the Social Insurance Fund&mdash;almost £5 million extra is required.  Under this subhead is provided the amount which the Exchequer contributes to the social insurance services, that is, the difference between the cost of the benefits and the amount received by way of contributions from employers and employees and from certain other sources.  Expenditure of the fund is now expected to be £6,589,000 more than the original Estimate, but this is offset to the extent of £2,127,000 by additional income mainly due to the increased rates of contribution operative from the 4th October, 1971.  An additional sum of £451,000 has also to be provided by the Exchequer to make good an underdraw of that amount in 1970-71.</P>
    <P>The principal increases in expenditure on the insurance services arose in respect of disability and unemployment benefit.  In the case of disability benefit the excess of £8,601,000 is primarily due to the fact that the transfer from that benefit to invalidity and retirement pensions was lower than expected.  As a consequence substantial savings arise on invalidity and retirement pensions. Taking the three schemes together the net excess comes to £1,817,000.  This is attributable to such factors as increased rates of benefit and higher numbers of claims as a result of the influenza <Col N="1655" /> epidemic since last Christmas.  In the case of unemployment benefit the expected increase of £3,106,000 over the original estimate arises similarly from increased rates and increased numbers claiming benefit.</P>
    <P>On the social assistance side, a total additional amount of £4,992,000 is required.  Of this, almost £3 million is in respect of unemployment assistance, the contributing causes being the increased numbers of claimants.  The increase of £898,000 on Subhead K&mdash; Miscellaneous Grants and Allowances &mdash;is spread over seven of the nine subdivisions, the major proportion relating to free travel and deserted wives' allowances. The extra requirement under the free travel scheme is due to greater use of the scheme and an increase in fares during the year.  The original estimate of the cost of the deserted wives' allowances was prepared before there was any experience of the working of the scheme, and the numbers qualifying have been higher than expected.  The increases in respect of old age and widows' non-contributory pensions are directly attributable to the increased rates of payment operative from August last, while in the case of children's allowances there has been an upward trend in the number of claims as compared with the original estimate.</P>
    <P>These are the main features of this Supplementary Estimate.  As I have explained on previous occasions, we cannot avoid asking the House to vote additional money for social welfare since the original estimate obviously could not make provision for increases and improvements decided on at Budget time.  I am confident that Deputies will be glad to support the provision of the extra amount required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, share the Minister's wish as expressed in the last sentence of his rather short statement. I am confident that Deputies will support gladly the provision of this extra money.  However, it is my opinion that we are not spending nearly enough money on social welfare.  Speaking on another Supplementary Estimate here some months ago, I appealed to the Minister and to the Government to <Col N="1656" /> have greater sympathy for those unfortunate people in our society who must depend entirely on social welfare.  As one who has been dealing with the public for many years, I am convinced that the social welfare services we are providing are not nearly adequate to meet the needs of recipients and their dependants.</P>
      <P>We read much these days of what membership of the EEC will mean for us, but I have not had anything from the Minister for Social Welfare as to what Government policy will be in respect of social welfare after we join the Community.  So far as I know, neither the Minister nor his Parliamentary Secretary nor any senior official from the Department has ever gone to Brussels to study the position in regard to social welfare.</P>

      <P>I am sure you will agree and that the Minister will agree also that this is a very important matter.  We are being asked to vote almost £10 million extra for social welfare. The Minister should have gone to Brussels to ascertain the position relating to the European Social Welfare Fund.  I have read the different pamphlets that were distributed to Deputies but there has been nothing in them relating to social welfare.  Before being asked to vote in the referendum, the people should be told what can be expected in terms of social welfare benefits after we join.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Deputy is getting on to future policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant.  I want the Minister to tell us whether social welfare recipients will be better off within the EEC.  Our spending on social welfare, as a percentage of our national wealth, is smaller than that of any of the EEC countries.  Therefore, while I am glad to support the granting of this £9,900,000 extra to social welfare, I believe the Minister <Col N="1657" /> and the Fianna Fáil Government have lost the confidence of the ordinary people.  Could you blame them when the Minister who sits across from me now decided, while the Dáil was in recess last summer, to take the dole from people who were depending on it?</P>
      <P>As I said before, I believe that pay related social welfare benefits should be introduced.  Before the Minister for Social Welfare arrived the Minister for Health was talking about how the Health services should be financed.  He paid tribute to the Minister for Social Welfare in the belief that he intends to introduce some relief in this regard.  I am happy about this because as spokesman for social welfare over the past few years I have constantly advocated that something like this should be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health expressed annoyance ten minutes ago that it should be suggested that our services are behind those of Northern Ireland. If we are anxious about the unification of the country we have a serious duty here in Leinster House to make vast improvements in our health and social welfare services.  You may tell me, Sir, that this has nothing to do with the Estimate before us, but it is of such great importance that I think it should be restated here, and I shall leave it at that.</P>
      <P>An advisory bureau should be set up to give guidance and advice to those who are unfortunate enough to have to depend on social welfare services. Deputies here will agree with me that one of the greatest annoyances to a public representative is to have social welfare recipients telling him that they applied three or four weeks previously for what they are entitled to and did not receive benefit.  It might be no harm to say here that the setting up of this bureau was proposed five or six years ago as part of Fine Gael policy.  It is not because it is part of Fine Gael policy that I believe it is right, but from meeting people I know there is a greater demand for it now than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While putting forward that proposal let me say that the officers of the Department of Social Welfare, from <Col N="1658" /> the highest to the lowest, do everything they can to expedite the claims of these people.  From dealing with them on the phone and otherwise I must pay tribute to their courtesy and efficiency. I honestly believe that it is not because I am the shadow spokesman for social welfare that they are courteous to me but the same would be the case with any public representative or any other person seeking their advice. Nevertheless, this advisory bureau would enable not only the officials of the Department but also the Minister and everyone else in this House to have the problems dealt with more quickly than they can be dealt with now.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister realise that, although we are providing £10 million extra to provide extra benefit for social welfare recipients, with the continual fall in the value of money, it does not mean that these people will be any better off financially than they were last week?  That is another good reason why I advocate, on behalf of my party, that the social welfare code should be revised and brought up to date, so that it will compare more favourably with the social welfare code in the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>I hope that before the Budget the Minister will consult with the Minister for Finance and that he will do better this time.  I would appeal to him, in heaven's name, to think of the social welfare people, the widows and the other people who constitute the less fortunate section of our community.</P>

      <P>Whether it is a Supplementary Estimate or not, we do not often get opportunities to discuss our social services.  We are privileged, perhaps, once a year to dwell at length on them.  We are certainly not afforded many facilities during Parliamentary Question Time to question the Minister and to get positive answers from him on some of the urgent problems of social welfare that concern us and <Col N="1659" /> which we meet in everyday life.  I believe our social welfare services are the worst in Europe.  At a time when we are talking about the unification of our country&mdash;and I raised this matter in the House before&mdash;I asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his Department has examined how our social services could be put on a par with those in Northern Ireland.  We are at a very important time in our country's history and the question of bringing in an Estimate to put our social services on a par with those in Northern Ireland should engage the attention of the Department of Social Welfare because I go there every two weeks and I talk to the people about re-unification; they tell me our social services are deplorable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling without reservation.  With regard to unemployment assistance, over 20 per cent of our people are living at or below poverty level.  This figure was obtained as a result of an investigation by Mr. Ó Cinnéide of the Institute of Public Administration and, according to his calculation, this represents some 500,000 people.  This is a shocking indictment of the present Government.  It is scandalous that so many people should be living in this day and age in such poverty.  The Minister has not made any really constructive effort to improve our social services.</P>
      <P>On the question of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, a single man dependent on unemployment assistance, living with his family, receives the princely sum of 30p or 40p per week because the incomes of the rest of the family are taken into consideration.  If he wants to qualify for £3 per week he must move out.  I defy anyone with £3 per week unemployment assistance to get accommodation in this city or anywhere else.  It is an absolute disgrace that we should tolerate such a system.  I brought a specific case to the Minister's attention. I doubt if the Minister could argue that the system is adequate or that it is a system of which the Government can be proud.  The record of the present Government where social services are concerned is a disgrace.  They should be ashamed of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widows are also expected to live in deplorable circumstances.  Indeed, there has been an organised outcry <Col N="1661" /> against the conditions under which they are expected to live.  The Minister may say we cannot provide for them all.  It is a shocking indictment of our system and our social policy that 5 per cent of the people should own 71 per cent of the wealth of the country.  I do not believe the same situation obtains in any other European country. In Northern Ireland, with which we find so much fault, 5 per cent of the people own only 47 per cent of the wealth.  Here there is appalling inequity and injustice and we are doing nothing about it.  We should do something about it.  We could introduce the necessary taxation to ensure a more equitable distribution of the wealth of the nation and better social services for those who need them.  No really constructive effort is being made to rectify these shocking social injustices.</P>
    <P>I am opposed in principle to means tests but I believe a means test should be introduced in the case of children's allowances.  I doubt if anyone would disapprove of such a policy.  This would ensure that those who need them most would get better allowances than they are getting at present.  Those allowances would, of course, still be below those obtaining in Britain and Northern Ireland.  This is an important aspect and one we must consider.  By comparison with EEC countries the allowances we offer are ridiculous.  If we could apply a means test to ensure an improvement, or devise some way to give the poorer sections of the community greater children's allowances, it might help to overcome the poverty and misery in which so many are living.</P>
    <P>On the question of unemployment assistance we might, by making a serious effort to provide more jobs&mdash; not just by paying lip service to the idea, making false promises, or producing false figures, or by bringing in fly-by-nights&mdash;be able to take the burden off the taxpayers and at the same time offer proper unemployment assistance to those who are unable to obtain jobs.  The only way is to provide more genuine jobs so that there would be a much fairer distribution of money.</P>
    <P>Non-contributory old age pensions <Col N="1662" /> are mentioned here.  Again the means test applies.  We pay this to people because they are old.  In many cases they are senile, they are worried, they do not understand.  If their income for any reason improves they get a demand note telling them to return their pension books and nasty letters from the Department.  I do not know whether the Minister realises that these letters and demands can have a very upsetting effect on people.  They are expected to be in when an official calls and expected to explain everything. These are people who are lonely and depressed and something which we would cast aside as a circular is very important to them.  I would ask the Minister to see that a much more flexible system is employed, that we are a little more tolerant and a little more sympathetic towards those people.  If they continue to draw the non-contributory old age pension and fail, through forgetfulness or otherwise, to report an improvement in their income we should not intimidate them. We might consider taking the overpayment from them by instalments.  I would ask the Minister to look at this because very often the book is taken from them and they expect prosecution because they did not realise that their income had risen above the limit set by the Department.</P>
    <P>There is mention here of insured persons' medical certificates.  I take it the Minister is referring to the social welfare insurance certificates.  Doctors are expected to sign these certificates and to say they have examined the patient.  The big complaint of doctors is that they do not examine the patient and cannot, in conscience, say: &ldquo;I have examined the patient.&rdquo;  The Department will not pay for the medical examination and if the doctor signs that certificate he is telling a lie. You cannot expect a patient to go for a certificate every week and expect the doctor to examine him or expect the patient to pay the doctor because medical examination are expensive nowadays.  We must clarify this.  We must decide what is to be on these certificates.  Perhaps it could be: &ldquo;I have observed this patient.&rdquo;  To say: &ldquo;I have examined this patient&rdquo; when, in fact, an examination does not take <Col N="1663" /> place is putting the doctor in an awkward situation and putting the patient in an embarrassing situation. The wording should be altered.  Perhaps also these certificates should be issued at less frequent intervals especially in cases of illness of long duration.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for these certificates to be issued without the necessity for examination by the medical referees who are involved in these cases.  A medical referee may decide that a patient is fit for work when the family doctor says he is not fit for work.  This creates a problem.  Once the medical reference says he is fit for work the person ceases to obtain benefit.</P>
    <P>There is a clash of opinion between the medical practitioner and the medical referee.  Here are two doctors who differ.  One is the family doctor, who knows everything about the patient, and the other is the medical referee who, after one examination, decides the patient is fit.  In a case like that the patient should continue to receive his social welfare benefit and the case should be submitted to an independent medical doctor.  The person should not suffer where a medical referee makes up his mind not knowing all the facts of the case.  Very often all the medical facts of a case are not sent to the Department.</P>
    <P>Miscellaneous grants and allowances are mentioned and under that we might bring in the question of home assistance.  The method of application of home assistance is humiliating and degrading.  I think we should abolish the home assistance scheme completely. It does not go any way towards bringing a person above the poverty limit. It is an arbitrary thing.  It depends on the officer.  I have great regard for the officers; I do not say they are not good people but I do not think they are fully trained as sociologists.  I would prefer to see fully trained sociologists who, knowing the circumstances, would be in a better position to help.  The scheme should be replaced by an income supplement scheme to make sure that a person's income is brought above poverty level.  This system operates satisfactorily in Britain. The stigma of the food voucher is <Col N="1664" /> absent.  I feel entitled to discuss this, Sir, under miscellaneous grants and allowances.  To me, it comes under allowances to local authorities to operate home assistance schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This is a Supplementary Estimate to provide £9,988,000 to carry the various services provided for in the subheads outlined in the document which has been circulated, up to the end of March.  The Supplementary Estimate covers non-contributory old age pensions, children's allowances, unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions and miscellaneous grants.  There is involved in the Supplementary Estimate the benefit given to the weakest sections of the community in the form of non-contributory pensions and unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>I gladly support the voting of this money for this very worthy cause but I am convinced that never in the history of the State was the gap so wide between that section of the community who are existing on social welfare payments and the rest of the community. That gap is wide and it is horrifying.</P>
      <P>I know I may be told by the Minister that the services are now better than they were.  It is very easy, indeed, for a Minister for Social Welfare to fall into the trap of claiming that a number of years ago the non-contributory old age pensioner got £3 or less and he now gets £4.65.  I would ask the Minister to direct his attention to the fact that we are living in the midst of a wild inflation and, in an inflationary atmosphere, the rich appear to get richer and the poor always get very much poorer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The non-contributory old age pensioner living alone is in receipt of £4.65 per week, if he has no other means. Even if he is in unfurnished lodgings the amount is reduced.  Having regard to the purchasing power of money, I am convinced that such a man is worse off than he was a few years ago.  In round figures, a pint of stout costs 20 pence, which is one-fifth of £1 or 4/-in old money.  That is one example.  It may be suggested that it is not necessary for him to drink a pint of stout. <Col N="1666" /> He must live and he is entitled to some little luxury.  When he goes to purchase the necessaries of life he finds that his £4.65 goes a very short distance.</P>
    <P>A person of moderate means would not feel comfortable going out for a night to have a few drinks with some friends with only a £5 note in his pocket.  It is generally accepted that a person of moderate means who hands £1 across the counter does not expect to get any change and puts very little weight on the change he does get.  This emphasises the great gap between social welfare recipients and other sections of the community.  It is very easy for a Minister for Social Welfare to fall into the trap of saying that it is £4.65 as against £3 and that he remembers the time when it was 10/-and the time when a shilling was taken off.  That is no argument and it is no answer to the unfortunate person who has to depend on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Government and, indeed, to the taxpayers, the people who provide the money, to do a bit of social thinking and to consent to a fairer distribution of the wealth of the country so that the weakest section of the community may be cushioned against the inflation we are living in and may enjoy some sort of decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>We are coming very near the time of the year when rates are struck.  In many counties persons living in houses with a valuation of £4 or £5 and even up to £7 and living on social welfare are assesed with rates and are expected to pay rates because of the fact that when the enabling provisions were introduced to allow county councils to exempt persons from rates, the burden had to be borne by the rest of the rate-payers and not by the country as a whole.  I ask the Minister, how can a person who is in receipt of £5, or £6 or £7 a week pay up to £30 a year rates?  It is immoral to ask him to do so. In my constituency there is no scheme for exempting such persons from rates because the county council did not adopt it.  My advice to these people living on that sort of income is not to pay rates and I am not indulging in a campaign to encourage people not to pay rates.  I am telling them that they <Col N="1667" /> cannot afford to pay rates and they should say that to the rate collector and let the county manager write them off through the hardship clauses at his disposal.  However, before the amount is written off the person must endure considerable harassment by the rate collector and an investigation by the county manager.</P>
    <P>The same situation does not apply in England.  A lady in Dublin gave me a leaflet which set out details of the scheme in operation in Britain.  This person was nursing in England and she bought a house in Dublin.  Now she is thinking of selling the house and returning to live in England because the rates are a very considerable burden on her.  She will be faced with a rate demand of £120 or £130.  I realise this may not be relevant on this Estimate but I shall try to relate my remarks to it.</P>
    <P>In England those in the lower income group are exempt from rates. The system in that country has regard to the fact that some people cannot pay rates but in this country old age pensioners and those receiving social welfare, people who live on £4.65 per week, are assessed for amounts of £30 per year.  They must endure several visits from the rate collector and they are lucky if the county manager regards them as hardship cases and writes off the amount.  This system is unjust.  Any suggestions made here which will be fair to the underprivileged in our community will have my full support and I shall make no apology to anyone inside or outside this House for advocating and supporting social justice.</P>
    <P>With regard to payment of rates we are not administering social justice. This has become apparent in the last few years because people who are in a position to fend for themselves are getting rapid increases in wages and the self-employed and the farming community are making more money. Admittedly, it is not worth very much but a considerable amount of money is circulating among these people. People receiving social welfare benefit find themselves in the middle of a <Col N="1668" /> whirlpool of spending at a time when they have not enough for the necessaries of life.  In the midst of apparent affluence the poorer sections of the community are barely able to exist.</P>
    <P>I speak strongly about this matter but if any words that I say encourage the Minister and the Government to take steps in the next Budget to help the needy section in our society I shall be satisfied.  Let the Government earmark a specified item of taxation for the purpose of helping this section and I shall vote for it.  Let us not have confusion and smokescreens in the Budget.  I do not think any self-respecting Member of the House would vote against an item of taxation whose purpose was to raise money to support those in need.  If any Member votes against such taxation he should be ashamed of himself.</P>
    <P>I have made the point about the rates exemption scheme in England and I am sure the Department of Social Welfare are aware of this.  I have the leaflet regarding this scheme in my possession but I do not have it with me at the moment.  I strongly recommend the scheme to the Minister for Social Welfare and I would ask him to use his influence with the Government to have the scheme put into operation here.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Department deal with a vast number of people and I know delays are inevitable.  Some people can afford to wait and it does not matter to them if they get a cheque for £20 this week or whether they wait another week.  However, for a person on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance it is a different matter. He is not credit-worthy, he will only get what he pays for.  If he finds that his cheque does not arrive at the local exchange at a certain time it is a serious matter for him; if he expects to get it by post and if it does not come on time it is a great disappointment. I would urge the Minister to cut out the delays that occur; in some cases there are delays of three or four weeks.</P>
    <P>I heard of a case today where a person was getting benefit under the Occupational Injuries Act and the last payment was made on 24th February. Perhaps there has been a change from <Col N="1669" /> benefit under this Act to some other type of benefit but at any rate the person has not received any money.  I spoke to a courteous officer on the phone today and I hope the person concerned will receive the arrears due in the post tomorrow.  There is only £16 involved and I realise that to many people in this House that amount might not matter.  The person concerned in this case is a young girl whose parents are ill and she needs this money urgently.  When we are dealing with the weak section of the community we should do our best to help them.  I know that delays do not always take place but it would be good if they could be eliminated completely.</P>
    <P>I gather that the number of applications received for the deserted wife allowance was greater than had been anticipated.  I am glad that the scheme is not being administered very harshly but I think even more sympathetic consideration could be given.  Sometimes the women are expected to pursue their legal claims against their husbands and this is not easy to do. In my constituency there was an instance of a couple who married about 30 years ago but I do not think they lived together for more than a couple of days.  This scheme came in and the man was still somewhere in the locality.  There was a good deal of coming and going before she was accepted as a deserted wife.  Fairly and squarely, she was, and the Department did not insist on her taking legal proceedings against the husband because it would have been a wasteful exercise; he had nothing.  I urge the Minister to adopt a realistic approach towards deserted wives.</P>
    <P>I know of another case where a deserted wife had one child and when she was 48 the child reached the age of 18.  The mother had enjoyed the deserted wife's allowance for a few years since it came in but when she reached 48 she lost it and will not again qualify for it until she is 50. This woman had been working as a char in a convent which ran a secondary school but the convent stamps were not accepted as industrial stamps, or whatever they are called, but only as domestic stamps. I do not see why this should have <Col N="1670" /> been the case because she was working in a school where a business was carried on and she was engaged in scrubbing floors and tidying up.  She was one of the hard cases, I suppose, that do not make good law.  She lost the deserted wife's allowance at age 48 and will not qualify for another two years.  She did not qualify for unemployment assistance or sickness benefit because her stamps were not regarded as valid.</P>
    <P>Recently at Question Time there was a question about a blind widow who got two pensions until she was 70.  She had £8.80 until then but when she reached 70 she lost the widow's pension. The old age pension and the blind pension were amalgamated with the result that her pension was reduced to £4.40.  That is another of these hard luck cases which I think the Minister should consider.  I know these things cannot be all cleared up in a day but if we could direct ourselves to the proper type of thinking towards the weaker section of the community we would be doing a good job.</P>
    <P>There are two types of employment exchanges in the country, the established social welfare office staffed by full-time, established civil servants and the other type of office run on a part-time basis by contractors, I think they are called.  They are untrained people appointed on a political basis.  There are many of them in every county. I think these offices should be manned by civil servants.  I am only saying that in passing.  I really stood up to express a point of view that I hold and which I believe the people would accept, that there is an appalling gap between the people for whom we are catering this evening and the better off section of the community.  This gap has become more apparent in recent times and must be a source of great distress for these social welfare classes.  If I may be pardoned for repeating what I said, I believe it should not be impossible for the Minister to come here and say: &ldquo;Here is my Budget.  I am putting Xp on this and Yp on that and this will be devoted entirely to the social welfare classes.&rdquo; If he does that he will have the support of the House and I believe that nobody will oppose him on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only a few points I should like to raise on this Supplementary Estimate.  We all subscribe to what has been said before from the Opposition benches as regards the inadequacy of social insurance and social assistance.  This is a problem we must all face up to in the very near future because I think we must agree that they are in many circumstances inadequate.  The circumstances in which they would not be regarded as inadequate, I suppose, would be where there are other people in the family of one drawing social insurance or social assistance who have pretty good incomes.</P>
      <P>When we talk of social welfare here we are mainly concerned about the people who live alone or the old age pensioner couple, people on home assistance or unemployment assistance. I subscribe to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said because I have advocated before now the introduction of a special budget for expenditure on social welfare services.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, we get a package deal in the Budget and I do not think this good enough.  People would gladly subscribe by way of taxation on certain commodities to those in the class we are discussing this evening, old age pensioners and people on unemployment benefit or assistance, particularly the assistance group and the others also. By that method there would be less criticism, not necessarily from those in Opposition now but from taxpayers generally.  I do not see any reason why we should not have a capital budget, a social welfare budget and a public works budget so that money would be known to be devoted to certain types of relief or assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A peculiar thing about social welfare generally in respect of social assistance&mdash;and we have carried this on for quite a long time&mdash;is that the only real means test is applied to poor people.  There is not a means test to any great extent in regard to building a house or getting a grant, whether in agriculture or industry, but when one looks for £4 or £5 from the State one must undergo a very strict means test. This should concern all of us, especially because of the severity with which it <Col N="1672" /> is, and must be, applied according to Acts passed by not only this but other Parliaments here at various times.</P>
    <P>I have raised with the Minister on other occasions the question of home assistance and I want to pursue it further.  I thought there was some light in a speech made by the Minister during the past 12 months when he intimated that he was considering the establishment of a scheme of national assistance.  Let me say for about the fortieth time that if we are to depend on the ratepayers to look after poor people who are not eligible for welfare benefit or assistance, that is a very thin dependence and we can all cite very many examples of it.  I know of a young chap who was self-employed during the past year and now that he is out of employment all he can get is £3.50 per week in home assistance for himself and his wife, and I think, one child.  Out of that he pays £1.50 per week in rent so that he is expected to live on £2 per week.  The regional health board will not give him any more because he is in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I know of a woman who has five illegitimate children and all she gets is £5 per week from the local authority. There are many other such cases with which we are all familiar.  The raising of money for home assistance by the representatives of the ratepayers in the various areas is not very high on the priority list.  The Minister would be doing a service to these people who do not qualify for ordinary benefits of the Department of Social Welfare if he introduced a scheme of national assistance. I would not ask that at first such a scheme would be put entirely on the backs of the taxpayers but I would expect a contribution that would be phased out for the health boards who now administer the home assistance Acts.  I do not wish to pursue that matter in any great detail now but I think the Minister suggested in recent times that he was considering such action.  He will have my support if he does so and he will have the appreciation of the thousands of unfortunate people who must exist on the miserable amounts being given to them by way of home assistance.</P>
    <P>There are regional health boards <Col N="1673" /> who adhere to a maximum figure of £5 per week regardless of how many children or dependants a recipient might have.  This is all that the various councillors have allowed in fixing the estimates and in striking the rates.</P>
    <P>Having been in a position similar to the Minister's at one stage, I know that he must depend on the generosity of the Minister for Finance in obtaining extra money but there are many small things that could be done which would not involve a great deal of expense. These are matters that annoy many people and matters that are not understood. Regarding the means test for unemployment assistance, there is no means test for the man who works for a weekly wage, for example, the man who has not sufficient stamps to qualify for unemployment benefit but there are, perhaps, thousands of people all over the country who, in an effort to get some income for themselves, become self-employed.  In my home town there are those who collect mussels which they sell to the local factory but when they have discontinued that and apply for unemployment assistance, the money earned for the previous year is assessed as means. This is a scandalous situation.  If they had been in insurable employment and had earned even £1,600 during the year, there would be no means test applied, whereas the man who tries to earn an income and occupy himself by cleaning windows or by fishing in particular, finds that a means test is applied strictly to him.  One year elapses before there is any revision.  I have experienced two cases of this. One concerned a woman who is in receipt of a non-contributory widows' and orphans' pension.  She worked a few hours per week as a charwoman but the investigation officer went to each of the places where she had worked and ascertained how much she had received in payment.  Her pension was reduced and the unfortunate woman had to endure 12 months from the time she last worked as a char in order that she might qualify for the full amount of the non-contributory widows' and orphans' pension.  If the Department wish to have details of that particular case, I can supply them.  I can give the details also in respect of <Col N="1674" /> the man who is now receiving £3.50 per week in unemployment assistance and who is refused any assistance by the local authority that administer home assistance.</P>
    <P>There are long delays in deciding on appeals against the disallowing of sickness benefit.  I know it is not possible to have medical referees in every town or village every day of the week but while a person is waiting for the result of an appeal, his benefit is cut off entirely.  It is difficult for such a man to understand why he is cut off for benefit by a doctor of the Department while at the same time his own doctor says he is incapable of work. If the person involved is a single man, he will get no money from anybody and if he is married, he must go to the health board who will give him a miserable few pounds.  A person should be paid until such time as a decision has been reached.  These people are very annoyed to discover, if their appeal is allowed, that what they received from the home assistance authorities is deducted from any arrears they might be paid.  A man should be deemed to be incapable of work until such time as a decision has been reached and in the intervening period he should be paid.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to what Deputy O'Connell said regarding children's allowances.  I am aware that in certain cases children's allowances are subject to assessment for income tax under some of the Finance Acts.  I am not a rich man but I must confess that I have experienced some guilt in receiving allowances for two or three children while knowing that there were other people who deserved it much more.  It is common knowledge that in respect of thousands of children throughout the country, the payment of these allowances is not any real aid.  In many cases where there may be as many as seven children the allowances are deposited in the Post Office or in a bank.  This indicates to me that the money is not necessary in such cases. I do not know how a means test could be applied in respect of children's allowances.  Perhaps it could be applied on the basis of the amount of income tax paid or by some other standard but let us try to device some scheme <Col N="1675" /> whereby, apart from income tax being paid on children's allowances, we could give more to the poor families and particularly to those people who have big families.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister in respect of subheads E and I what amount of the money we are being asked to vote is attributable directly to the big increase in unemployment which ranged from 6,000 to 7,000 during this winter as compared with last winter.  The taxpayers must pay more because of the policy or the lack of policy on the part of the Government in the provision of industry and in the creation of new jobs.</P>
    <P>We have not heard about the unemployment period order, the order that nearly brought down the Government in April last year.  We all remember the furore here in the House about the order that the Minister signed or did not sign or did not know what he was signing, and the attitude of Deputy Chub O'Connor, Deputy Des Foley and Deputy Joe Lenehan, who resigned because of this order.  Are we or are we not going to have a repeat of the employment period order this year? The Minister must now realise that apart from the political support that he may lose in a debate on that order, it has been absolutely unfair to suggest that any single man under 50 should not get any form of assistance, meaning that there is plenty of work in the country.</P>
    <P>There is no such work in the rural areas.  I do not have to expand on that. All I need say is that with the introduction of machinery, work in the rural areas is declining year after year.  It would be grossly unfair if the Government reintroduced this employment period order, particularly at a time when there are so many unemployed and, as I have said, in view of the fact that there is no work for people in the rural areas and, again, having regard to the figures for unemployment and redundancy in the cities and towns, with no prospect of employment there.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the Minister to allay the fears of those people who will be affected by making an announcement now.  As far as I can remember <Col N="1676" /> the order was signed during the recess last year.  If it is going to be done, let us hear about it now; let the order be placed before the Dáil so that those of us on this side of the House and those in the Fianna Fáil Party who oppose it would have an opportunity of debating it and making a decision on it before the House rises for Easter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long.  I wish to say a few words on this very important Estimate, particularly as I come from a constituency in the west of Ireland, Sligo/Leitrim, where so many people live on small farms, where many people who are anxious to get employment cannot get it, and where so many people have been laid off work. Five factories have closed, one at Dowla and I do not think I exaggerate when I say about four have closed one after the other in Sligo town.  I welcome this increase for which the Minister is asking.  It will go into the homes of people who require it urgently.</P>
      <P>When any Member of this House makes an urgent appeal to the Department about a particular case, it should be looked into without delay.  I had one such case before Christmas, a case in which my good friend sought assistance, having a wife in hospital who had lost a baby and having three children for whom he had to provide, and living at home with only the four bare walls of the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put all these facts to the Department, and the Department used rigidly the report they had on his income during the year.  We all handle much bigger money than these people who have to keep a car in order to travel a journey of ten miles to earn a few pounds.  This man's case has not yet been decided.  He was on the phone to the local authority and, fortunately, they have come to the rescue.  He will now get £5 per week and he is able to go out when his children are at school and supplement that by earning another few pounds.  Cases like that should be dealt with without this long, unexplained delay.  The only answer I could get from the Department was that the case was being dealt with.  I was on the phone several times about it and I wrote every time this man approached <Col N="1677" /> me.  I even rang up the Department from home.  I shall give the facts of this case to the Minister, and I hope he will take a particular interest in it.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have already mentioned the case of widows who, having reared their families and having reached the age of 70 years, discover, perhaps, due to the valuation on the farm, that instead of continuing to receive the equivalent of the widow's pension the amount may be reduced by £2.  I realise it may be due to the valuation and that the stock may have something to do with it.  However, I am convinced that the Department's method of calculating the profits from, let us say, four cows and four calves can sometimes result in hardship.  In my part of the country the return on a farm of that sort is very small.  They send their milk to the creamery and get supplies from the creamery and by the time their expenses are deducted there is practically nothing left out of the cheque, and the people are depending on the price to be got for the few calves.  I believe the Department overestimate the profits that are made on this type of farm.  Only the other night I had a constituent severely crippled with arthritis and, because he had four cows and four calves, he was deprived of benefit.</P>
    <P>There is then this delay in the payment of benefit.  If there is any query there is delay.  If there is an appeal there is another delay.  That delay can extend to four or six months.  Payment should be speeded up.  The Minister is amply provided with staff.  I must say his staff are very courteous but there would seem to be no real excuse for these lengthy delays.</P>
    <P>A small businessman or a small farmer may assign his property to a son.  The assignor will get no old age pension until the assignment is completed. This may take as long as 12 months.  He has handed over his property and he has now nothing on which to live.  I would ask the Minister to expedite payment of the pension in such cases.  I have known many people anxiously waiting for payment.  When one calls to the Department one is told the applicants will have to wait until everything is all right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> The Minister will have to measure out this £10 million very carefully. There will certainly be nothing to spare.  We are coming to Budget time and, according to reports in the newspapers, social welfare recipients will get an increase.  I hope old age pensioners will get a substantial increase. In my part of the country we have a great many small farmers dependent on unemployment assistance.  Some are critical of unemployment assistance but, if it were not for unemployment assistance, these people could not carry on.  I am sure the Minister appreciates how important this benefit is.  If it were not there many more homes would be closed.</P>
    <P>Recently we had two young people from Dublin colleges making a survey in my part of the country.  They said they could not understand how the farming community existed on such small farms.  I told them that some benefit of some kind was going into every home and that, if it were not for that, these people would have to close their houses and go.  Today, a hundred-weight of coal costs £1.  Rent has to be paid.  Food has to be bought.  In the light of all this, £4.50 or £5 a week is a very meagre allowance indeed.</P>
    <P>To give the Minister some idea of what the unemployment is like in my area, we have a recently opened factory there, Snia, outside Sligo. There are well over 1,000 people on the waiting list for employment in that factory.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister should ask for extra money and when the next Budget comes around he may rest assured that he will have the wholehearted support of every Deputy in this House if he can provide a generous allowance for recipients of social welfare benefits.  I can tell him sincerely that if it were not for these benefits many homes in my part of the country would be closed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Supplementary Estimate.  I do not think anybody on this side of the House would disagree with the sentiments expressed from the opposite benches. Everybody welcomes extra money for the Department of Social Welfare to improve the standard of living of those in receipt of social benefits.  The Minister <Col N="1679" /> has availed of every opportunity to try to improve benefits such as old age pensions, disability benefit and unemployment benefit.  The Government, down through the years, have made considerable efforts to provide the necessary money for the various social welfare services.</P>
      <P>On this Supplementary Estimate we are confined to a very narrow field but I want to support what was said about the case of a person drawing disability benefit who comes into dispute with the medical referee.  I believe such a person should be paid benefit until finality is reached in his case.  The same should apply to unemployment benefit because very often an employee is wrongly dismissed and after his case has been investigated he is paid by the Department.  The Minister has always adopted a very sympathetic approach to such matters. Nevertheless, there can be hardship involved and it could very easily be the cause of hunger in a home.</P>
      <P>I see that an additional amount of £282,000 is required under the heading of administration.  The Minister should have a look at the whole structure of administration.  I should not like to advocate that additional personnel should be brought into the Department. That would cost money, money which could be very beneficial to the recipients of social welfare benefits. However, I believe there should be an overhaul to bring about more efficiency in the administration of the various services.  Every Deputy will agree that there is a huge volume of work in the Minister's Department and they are to be complimented on their efficiency but nevertheless I believe there could be greater efficiency in administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be other occasions on which we can discuss the Minister's Department in more detail but I want to say that I know from my personal contacts with the Minister that he is doing everything in his power to find the necessary money to improve the various services.  I feel I should stand up here tonight and say this of him lest anybody should think, because there was some misunderstanding about the dole, that the Minister did anything <Col N="1680" /> to cause hardship to people drawing the dole.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister should have a look at the position where a dispute arises between his Department and a person in receipt of unemployment benefit.  Payment should continue to be made until the dispute has ended.</P>
    <P>Non-contributory old age pension books are withdrawn and can be held for some time.  This service could be improved at no extra cost.  It is bad to see an old age pensioner waiting three or four weeks for payment.  Payment should be made to the person until the book is returned and then whatever overpayment has been made could be deducted.  There would not even be extra administration costs involved. This would help to avoid hardship and that is the important thing where the administration of the social services is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had complaints from various people in my constituency, particularly recipients of old age pensions, unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  When an old age pensioner, particularly in a town, owns a large building, the business in which is completely closed down, the valuation on the building may be £14 or £15.  It is dishonest to assess the valuation of that building as income. Where hardship cases of this kind arise the valuation of buildings should not be assessed because it is not income. This is happening throughout the country. There is something else which is dishonest and which happens particularly in the west of Ireland.  You may find a mother or father who is not prepared to sign over the place to a son at an early age.  It would facilitate all concerned if a will could be accepted under which the holding was bequeathed to the son of the applicant for old age pension.  It is a difficult matter for a parent to assign a holding to a son of 18 or 19 years of age.  Hardship is involved in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency and in the west of Ireland generally, unemployment assistance is of great help to the small farmer.  At least one-fourth of those drawing unemployment assistance <Col N="1681" /> would have had to emigrate if this assistance were not available to them. A tragic decision was taken last year by the Government that single men would not be eligible for this form of assistance.  If the Government had wanted to discontinue unemployment assistance, they should have ensured that every man then drawing unemployment assistance would be provided with work for three days a week and would be paid at the rate of £4 a day. The work that would be carried out on this basis would have the effect of relieving ratepayers and Central Government grants could have been reduced. Some Government will have to tackle this problem.  Any able-bodied man who is drawing home assistance should get three days work per week.</P>
    <P>One-half of the roads in County Mayo are untarred.  There are drainage schemes on which people could be employed.  Unemployment assistance should be given to those who work three days a week but it is absolutely essential that the man should be paid well for his work.  A small farmer in the west of Ireland drawing unemployment assistance and getting £12 a week could manage to live on his small farm and would be encouraged to stay there.</P>
    <P>There are certain jealous persons who make reports that their neighbour is drawing home assistance or social welfare benefit.  They make these complaints anonymously.  This entails a heavy burden of extra work for social welfare officers who have to investigate the complaints.  The Minister should instruct social welfare officers and the labour exchanges that complaints made anonymously should not be investigated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allowance for a female relative who is looking after an elderly person, there are several cases where the daughter-in-law who is caring for her husband's parent, who otherwise would be in hospital, is deprived of the allowance on the basis that she is maintained by her husband. The husband may have only five or six acres of land.  A neighbour of mine applied for the allowance in respect of a daughter-in-law whose care of the parent involves taking her out of bed ten times a day.  She cannot get a penny because she is supposed to be maintained <Col N="1682" /> by her husband.  That regulation should be amended.</P>
    <P>A person who has not 78 stamps in a period of three years has his case automatically investigated by the social welfare officer.  If the social welfare officer assesses that the person earned more than 50p a day, the person automatically loses unemployment benefit. This is happening widely in my constituency. Where there is mass unemployment, where a man cannot get work for more than 15 weeks in the year, it is impossible to accumulate 78 stamps over a period of three years. I suggest that the 50p should be raised to £1.  I do not mind where the money is obtained or what government are in power.  If my party were in power I would insist that the earnings allowable should be increased to £1.  This would allow people to benefit.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the social welfare system in operation in Northern Ireland and in Britain as compared with the system in operation here do we seriously expect that the people across the Border will unite with us unless we have the same standards? Do we not know that that will not happen?  On entry into the Common Market, our social welfare services will have to be brought up to European standards.  This is a matter that should be dealt with now.  It is niggardly to deprive a man of unemployment assistance because he earns 50p a day.  That is the regulation, which must be enforced by the social welfare officer. The matter is in the hands of the Minister.  I would ask him to take a note of the points that I have made. These are problems and hardship is caused and that was the reason I wished to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone in the House will be pleased to see that social welfare benefits are increased and in that connection we welcome the Supplementary Estimate, even though we realise that it will affect taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad of this opportunity to deal with a few points with regard to administration of the social welfare code.  By and large, the attitude of the Department is humane but I realise that in having to administer such a <Col N="1683" /> large amount of money there must be regulations and that in the administration of these regulations anomalies will arise which cause hardship.  Hardship may not arise to a tremendous degree in individual cases but it arises in a series of cases.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to what I consider are anomalies which may not have been intended but are an inevitable consequence of the fact that social welfare administration is hidebound by regulations.</P>
    <P>The first anomaly to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is the plight of domestic workers in relation to unemployment benefit.  The cost of the stamp for the domestic worker is somewhat less than that for other female workers; it is £1.50 per week as against the ordinary rate of £1.91. A woman working in agriculture pays £1.40 but we will leave that aside for the moment.</P>
    <P>In the summary of the booklet on social services issued by the Department, there is a footnote on page 13 which states that these rates&mdash;the rates for persons employed mainly in domestic service&mdash;include over for unemployment benefit.  This footnote is misleading because I understand the regulations provide that a person in domestic employment who becomes unemployed cannot qualify for unemployment benefit unless the person has been engaged for ten years in domestic work in insurable employment.  In addition she must have at least two years contributions.  This is discrimination against one particular category of worker.  I fail to see how it can be justified, but I presume that as the regulation exists at some stage there must have been a theoretical basis for this discrimination.  One would like to see it explained, if for no other reason than for arguing the justification.</P>
    <P>This particular category of employment is one that has had a certain imputation about it that made it an undesirable occupation, an occupation to which girls were not attracted.  I do not think the Department are just in their attitude to these people.  If a person in domestic employment becomes unemployed she is entitled to benefit as much as any other worker. <Col N="1684" /> The regulations which requires ten years employment and two years contributions is unjust.</P>
    <P>I am led to believe that one reason for this discrimination is that there is no such thing as unavailability of work for persons in this category.  That may have been the situation in Victorian times but at the moment because wages in domestic employment are beginning to be comparable with wages paid to female workers in other sectors, because of the wages they command, jobs are not as plentiful as they were in the dim and bad old days.  The competition between this sector and industry is loaded in favour of industry and there can be no question of saying that a person could not be unemployed.  That argument does not hold water in 1972 and I would ask the Minister to remove this discrimination.</P>
    <P>When married women apply for unemployment benefit, invariably they are refused and the reason given is that they do not make themselves available for work.  If a female worker marries and, perhaps, changes residence and thereby changes jobs, or if she has to leave her pre-marriage job and cannot get another job in another part of the country, the Department consider she is not available for work and refuse her benefit, presumably because she happens to be married.</P>
    <P>This is not recognising the realities of the situation.  More and more married women, particularly those in the first years of marriage, are anxious to work.  If they cannot get work it is because it is not available.  When this is the case they should be entitled to the benefits received by other workers. It has been mentioned to me that applicants in this category produced documentary evidence of having tried to obtain work but in spite of this evidence the Department refused to pay benefit.</P>
    <P>The next point to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is the working of the occupational injuries benefits arrangements.  When occupational injury claims were taken from the Circuit Court and included as part of the social welfare code it seemed a logical step.  It did not seem right that a person who was injured <Col N="1685" /> at his place of work should be put to the hazard of litigation.  It seemed more reasonable and humane to have these benefits dealt with by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In practice, however, what I would term &ldquo;better&rdquo; justice was available in the Circuit Court.  If a workman under the Workman's Compensation code sustained an injury he proceeded to the Circuit Court and after hearing the evidence the Circuit Court made a finding in relation to incapacity.  This finding was based principally on medical evidence but was also based on the workman's evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understood that in the Minister's speech there was reference to disablement benefits.  Would this not come under the section dealing with occupational injury claims in the Department of Social Welfare?  However, the point I was trying to make was with regard to administration of this benefit and in order to make the point clear I thought I should indicate the previous practice.  What I wished to indicate was that where a person had made a partial recovery the Circuit Court was entitled to make a finding of partial incapacity, which could be treated as total incapacity.  There is no such discretion so far as I can see in the Department.  The result is that an appeal doctor, if presented with medical evidence which on its face shows that a person has recovered from an injury, has no discretion but to deem that person fit for work.  That person may have been suffering from the effects of his injury for anything up to ten or more years and may, in fact, be only fit for light work but, <Col N="1686" /> apparently, there is no discretion to treat that capacity for light work as total incapacity.  The reality of the situation is that nobody could get light work, which is not available to an agricultural labourer in rural Ireland, who has partially recovered from his injury.  This is a serious gap in the administration of occupational injury benefit and is leading to a considerable amount of hardship.</P>
      <P>If a person is a long time out of work due to a genuine injury necessitating a very slow and gradual rehabilitation there is no precise date at which he can be said to be fit for work.  In my opinion, that person should be treated by the Department, and the Department should have power so to treat him, as being partially incapacitated but unfit for any work.  So far as I know, there is no discretion in the Department to make such a finding at the moment.  That is something that should be remedied and could be remedied without undue expense and remedied so as to ease the considerable hardship being caused at present.  I am sure it is caused unwittingly but it is still being caused and it is important that the Department should be kept informed of anomalies such as this because, as I said at the outset, the regulations are by and large administered with humanity and I imagine there is the will and desire to see that they should continue to be so administered.</P>
      <P>The procedure of the examination by medical referees and appeals thereon is something that could be looked at because at present these proceedings can take place without oral hearings and without benefit of submissions on behalf of the injured person.  In effect, the hearing can be in secret and while I have no doubt that it is conducted in an entirely <i>bona fide</i> manner, it would add considerably to the confidence of the public and that of contributors to the social welfare code if they felt their case was fully and adequately heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there are grounds for suggesting that appeals officers should be a body above and beyond and distinct from the other personnel of the Department. They are exercising a semi-judicial function and it does not help <Col N="1687" /> one's confidence in a judge if one knows that he is part of the prosecution case, so to speak.  I think the status of appeals officers should be considered and, perhaps, they would be made independent of the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that there was a saving arising on invalidity and retirement pensions.  I suggest this is because people are not aware of their entitlement to a retirement pension at the age of 65.  This should be publicised more widely.  It is an excellent provision and it is wisely drawn in that it does not completely prevent the retired person from continuing in certain types of non-insurable employment.  I would almost say the person should be allowed to continue in what would be insurable employment and continue to draw his retirement pension without having the benefit of further contributions except, perhaps, contributions to cover occupational injury benefits.  If this could be done and the scheme publicised many more people would avail of it and it would be of considerable social assistance to those in the 65 age bracket who, perhaps, are getting beyond full work but who, because of financial considerations, must continue in full work.  If they had the option of slackening off in their work and drawing benefit it would improve their lot considerably.  I ask the Minister to arrange more publicity for the entitlement and to consider extending the employment which they may continue to have while drawing a retirement pension.</P>
    <P>I was glad, and, indeed, surprised, to see that the demands under the deserted wives' allowances is greater than that estimated.  It is sad that this item should have to appear at all but that is the way of the world and until such time as there can be reciprocal arrangements between the courts here and in Britain to enforce orders under the Married Women (Desertion) Act we shall have to continue to find a considerable sum under this heading.  I was surprised because the investigating procedure in my experience has been unduly cumbersome and somewhat rigid.  I have come across cases where the applicant was refused benefit on the grounds that her husband was <Col N="1688" /> within contactable distance, to put it that way.  The reality of the situation was that the farther he stayed away from his wife the better it was for her and the children.  Where a husband may be in the same town or the same locality but where his conduct has been such that his wife and children have had to leave him, it should clearly be considered a case of descretion.  So should a case where he appears every so often or where contact can be made with him.  At the moment in these cases very often an application is refused.  These are cases that should be covered.  Perhaps this is one of the saddest parts of the administration of the social welfare code and the one part where one would not expect levity or facetious interjections.</P>
    <P>In regard to the increase in unemployment assistance, contributing causes, according to the Minister's speech, are the increased rates of payment and increased number of claimants. It would be interesting to see a breakdown as to which was the greater factor in the increase, whether the increase in the rate was bigger or whether more people are claiming.</P>
    <P>I would guess that it is the latter factor and that we see in this substantial supplementary sum of £3 million the result of our present industrial position.  The numbers unemployed are growing to such an extent that we have to budget for an extra £3 million to pay them assistance.  One can only hope in that context that the number will not become any larger and that wise and benevolent government will be able to ensure this will not happen.  I am apprehensive that if the troubles in Northern Ireland are not settled and our reputation in England does not improve there may be resistance to Irish exports in that country which could have great effects on our economy.  While it is not within the scope of the Department of Social Welfare, nevertheless, it behoves the Minister, as the man who has to fill the purse, as a Member of the Government to ensure that whatever the Government can do to see that problem settled once and for all should be done as a matter of the highest urgency.</P>
    <P>If unemployment assistance must run <Col N="1689" /> at this supplementary level at this time, it is a rather frightening warning sign and if our economy has to be called on to make subventions to this extent towards our unemployed, we could find ourselves in a disastrous situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated, too, that part of this extra requirement was because of increases in transport costs. I wonder whether CIE when they are passing these charges to the Department in respect of persons entitled to free travel, charge the Department at the going rate or give them the benefit of such sales reductions as have been in force during the past three months. I would recommend the Minister to make sure that those who were entitled to travel free participated in &ldquo;The Great Train Robbery&rdquo; because we do not want to have a situation whereby the Department would be subsidising unwittingly &ldquo;The Great Train Robbery&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity of making these points.  We all welcome increases in social welfare payments to the underprivileged and weaker sections of our community. This is what civilisation is all about. It is important that in the administration of these benefits if anomalies or injustices appear, they should be rectified quickly.  It is for that reason that I have made these points here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate and I am sure it will have the support of all sides of the House.  When the annual Budget is before the House in April or May increases in social welfare benefits are announced but these increases are not paid to recipients until the following October or November. Apparently it is normal practice for a Supplementary Estimate to be introduced at this time and I intend to make a few brief points in relation to it.  Increases on foodstuffs or on beer or on cigarettes become effective as soon as they are announced in the Budget and it is in this regard that an anomaly arises in so far as that increase in social welfare benefits are not paid until some months afterwards. While the amount involved in these increases in prices may not be very great over a period of say, six months, <Col N="1690" /> it can mean a lot when a person is on a low income.  I do not know what powers the Minister has to remedy this situation but I would hope that he would discuss the matter with the Minister for Finance with a view to eliminating the anomaly.</P>
      <P>The first item mentioned in this Estimate relates to salaries, wages and allowances in respect of which an additional £201,000 is required.  The staff of the Department come in for much criticism from time to time.  Some time ago one of the trade unions made a strong attack on the Department and other people have done so at different times, myself included.  One of the greatest causes of these complaints against the Department is the length of delays in dealing with various claims.  I understand, of course, that there is a considerable amount of work involved in investigating the various circumstances of any particular case but, at the same time, it is my opinion that much of a delay is unnecessary. I welcome any effort that may be made towards accelerating the work of dealing with inquiries.  Long delays are unfair to those waiting for payment of benefits.  This may not apply to any great extent where children's allowances are concerned but it is very important where unemployment assistance is concerned.  I can only express the hope that there will be an improvement in the situation.</P>
      <P>Regarding the reference to medical certificates, I am not sure as to what is meant specifically here.  I wish to refer to medical referees, a matter which comes under item D of the Supplementary Estimate.  I have known people whose cases went before the medical referee and whose claims were refused.  As far as I was aware these people were certainly not fit for work. There should be some appeal against the decision of the medical referee because it would seem to be unfair that some of these cases should be turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooney dealt with the question of deserted wives who were divorced.  The Minister will recollect that not very long ago Deputy O'Connell raised this by way of Parliamentary question.  I do not know the <Col N="1691" /> full facts of such cases, but I understand that if a deserted wife has been divorced from her husband in England and continues to reside in this country she is not eligible for a deserted wife's allowance.  The wife may not wish to remarry.</P>

      <P>I believe the point I am making is within the ambit of the Supplementary Estimate, but I do not intend to continue on the point at length.  I would just put it to the Minister briefly that if a deserted wife, in the circumstances I have outlined, resides in this country, she may not wish to remarry.  In the eyes of many people in the locality she will be considered married.  As there would not be many such cases and as hardship <Col N="1692" /> can be involved for the people concerned, I would ask the Minister to treat these cases with a certain amount of generosity.</P>
      <P>In regard to Item G, non-contributory pensions, Where a person's stamps have run out and where he has not yet reached the age of 70, there is no relief on which he can call other than home assistance.  If I am incorrect in this, I would ask the Minister to let me know.  The Offaly and Laois County Councils, the local authorities of which I have best knowledge, are quite generous in dealing with people in this group.  They may be in poor health and unfit for work, and I would ask the Minister to let me know if there is some specific provision under which they can qualify for an allowance. They should.  A country like this should make these people some allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that this money is badly required.  Now, when an applicant applies for an old age pension, he or she receives a visit from the pension officer and is recommended on the spot for the maximum pension.  That having been done, it is often three or four months before he or she receives the pension book.  This is due to the fact that an applicant has to wait until the local pension committee meets.  The pension clerk will not call a meeting until he has a number of claims to be decided.  I suggest that when a person qualifies, and is recommended by the local social welfare officer, the latter should send the application direct to the Department and there should be no delay in issuing the book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a case in which an applicant applied in December of last year.  I spent much time on phone calls locally and here in this House trying to get the local clerk to call a meeting of the pension committee.  This woman's husband was in receipt of an old age pension.  He did not receive the maximum pension because he owned his own house and, because he did, his pension was cut by 25p.  The Minister should do something about this.  There should be no delay.  There should be no waiting three or four months for a meeting of the local pension committee. <Col N="1693" /> It is disgraceful that these unfortunate people should be subjected to this kind of treatment.</P>
    <P>In the case to which I referred I called to the Department and I was assured by a young girl there that they would try to send out the book so that the applicant would have it on Friday morning.  I told the applicant to call to the post office on Friday morning for her book.  On Friday morning, having visited the post office, she called on me to tell me that the book was not there. I rang the Department once more on Friday morning and she received the book in the post office the following morning.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to shake up his Department.  If one telephones the Department one gets an assurance but, in my 30 years of dealing with the Department, I can safely say that that assurance is never honoured.  Some officials have no understanding whatsoever of the position of these unfortunate people down the country, dependent solely on these pensions and compelled to wait three or four months for their pension books.  I would appeal to the Minister to examine the whole structure of old age pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a tendency to treat this Supplementary Estimate as if it were the main Estimate.  I did not anticipate that such a wide field would be covered and I do not feel myself obliged to reply to all the detailed points raised here.  I shall, of course, reply to questions which were directly relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is essential because of the increases granted in the Budget last year.  The Budget came after the Estimate was prepared.  From that point of view it is an interesting Supplementary Estimate. It has some interesting features, not the least of which is the increase in the amount paid by way of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit. Deputies alleged that this was due to increased unemployment and redundancies. Approximately half the amount is due to redundancies and approximately half the amount is due to the increases granted in the Budget. <Col N="1694" /> These were substantial increases no matter how Deputies may try to denigrate them.  An interesting feature, too, is the fact that this Supplementary Estimate reflects a slowing down or a virtual stoppage of emigration.  This is the first time we have ever had to cope with that problem. We frequently hear references to the huge numbers but an increase is reflected in this Supplementary Estimate.  Many of these, as can easily be gleaned from the figures, are new applicants, persons who have not held qualification certificates before and this is directly due to the cessation of emigration.  The latest figures available show that the inward movement of passenger traffic was greater than the outward movement. That is the only yardstick that has been used.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies went so far as to say that we should be ashamed of the amounts we are paying.  The insinuation always is that somebody else has a tremendous social conscience while the Minister has none.  I do not think that is the answer.  I believe I have as keen a social conscience as anybody else.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said that the amounts given were immediately eroded by the increase in the cost of living which would suggest that we are barely keeping step with the cost of living.  I do not deny that the consumer price index has been rising for a long time but we have not been just trying to keep step with that.  Between 1957 and 1971 the cost of living increased by approximately 80 per cent, which is a huge increase, but the increase in social welfare benefits over that period was almost 300 per cent. Even in the shorter term, from August, 1969, to August, 1971, the cost of living increased by 18 per cent and the increase in social welfare benefits was 39 per cent.  Each successive increase was considerably more than would have been justified by the increase in the cost of living.  This rate of progress, if maintained and accelerated, would bring us to a reasonably high standard of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>We have a few important changes in the making in social welfare but I should like to point out to those who talked about restructuring the <Col N="1695" /> whole social welfare system and made comparisons with Northern Ireland, with the UK and with countries of the EEC that the number and types of persons covered by the social welfare umbrella at present compares favourably with any country in the world. It is simply a question of rates.  People talk about a major job of restructuring or a new code.  We have this under examination and there is a research unit at the moment dealing with two specific points which I shall come to in a moment.  I shall have an opportunity of discussing this on the debate on the EEC next week.  I hope to have a very positive and definite readjustment of our social welfare benefits to bring them more in line with other countries with which I hope we will be associated in the years ahead.  I welcome the opportunity of doing this.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows well that, irrespective of what our social conscience may demand, there is always the limitation of the resources available to us.  It is all very well to say we should have a social welfare budget.  I would not be against that at all.  However, other people want a housing budget or a budget for roads, education or health. These are all essential services and we know that millions and millions and millions of pounds would be necessary to do the things we would like to do under all these headings.  That money is just not there unless we try to take it from people who already feel they are distributing a very high percentage of their incomes.  It is nonsense to talk about 5 per cent holding 71 per cent of the wealth of the country.  It is a nice argument to trot out but it is just not right.  The redistribution of national wealth at present in relation to the number of people in productive employment is excellent.  It is a question of getting the necessary resources to do the things all of us would like to see done under the heading of social welfare.  We can identify these very easily.  Nowadays you never have an examination; it is always an examination in depth.  One could do an examination in five minutes and say double this, double that and add so much to that.  We know where extra benefits are required.</P>

      <P>That is something on which my Department are working very hard at present.  The old stigma of home assistance lingers on but it has many of the qualities of a good scheme.  One of these is, as I have said before, that it is a fire brigade type of service which rapidly reaches a particular person.  Due to the local knowledge of the officers who investigate the claim, it is possible to make quick disbursements to people under this scheme.  That is an element of the scheme I should like to retain always, irrespective of any wider scope I may give it and any improvements that may be affected in it.  I should also like this scheme to apply in cases where persons already have certain social welfare benefits which are inadequate for a particular time or a longer period to meet their legitimate requirements.</P>

      <P>The question of deserted wives came in for a good deal of discussion.  The figures are interesting. We are paying more than we anticipated. The number is greater than was realised.  Deputy Cooney said that was regrettable, and I agree.  At 11th February, 1972, the number of deserted wife allowances being paid was 1,666. Of 2,553 claims decided, 1,766 were awarded and 787 were rejected and there were some 100 allowances terminated during the period for various reasons&mdash;death&mdash;the deserted wife becoming widowed&mdash;and occasionally the desertion ceases.  We are cautious about the investigation of these cases but it is obvious that we have not been unduly stringent in our examination of these cases, as we are sometimes accused of being.  We have, indeed, in the short time that the scheme has been in operation, granted allowances which had to be withdrawn subsequently. I am not giving that as an excuse.  As I said at the time the Bill came in, we are anxious to err on the side of generosity, because this is a delicate area of investigation, rather than to be unduly strict.  I propose to reduce the age from 50 to 40.</P>

      <P>Deputy Finn referred to the limit of 50p a day.  It is not used as a yardstick in a means test.  It is strictly and solely used as a measure of the extent and significance of temporary or casual employment the claimant may have at a particular time.  The Deputy was critical of the fact that the limit was not increased. The figure used in England for that purpose is less than that used here. There it is 6s 8d.  We have increased it from 5s to 6s 8d and later to 10s. Where a person has casual employment one must ascertain whether that person is available for employment or is entitled to pay insurance contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not used as a means test.  I am trying to wind up in the few minutes left me.  I will come to the matters raised by the Deputy and will answer them.</P>
      <P>The means test for old age pension is a matter that came in for an airing once again.  Those of us who have been members of old age pension committees know that the means test is distasteful in many ways but it is a question of making a certain amount of money go as far as possible and, as I have said so often before, if I had the £9 million or £10 million necessary to remove the means test, I would prefer first to double the amount for those who have the pension rather than to remove the means test.  It is frequently pointed out that there may be two men living side by side, one who has been a ne'er do well all his life, who gets the pension without any trouble, whereas the other man who has been thrifty and hard working and has accumulated money, cannot get the pension. This is a problem that is always with us in Social Welfare.  We must make provision for the weaker people irrespective of how they arrived at that condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a means test for children's allowance, we are at the moment and have been for a long time, examining the question of introducing selectivity into the payment of children's allowance.  I agree with <Col N="1700" /> Deputy Corish that there are many people getting children's allowance who frequently forget to draw it.  It is probably only a nuisance to them in so far as it is subject to income tax. They would prefer not to get it.  However, there are people who do not pay income tax and who are in receipt of children's allowance and who could very well do without it.  It is a very big payment.  In regard to the Supplementary Estimate before the House, one of the most interesting features, to which no Deputy referred, is that the number of children has gone up considerably. We always refer to a figure coming up to a million.  That is what the figure was.  It has now gone well over a million and that has been noticeable in the past year.  The actual number of children at the moment is 1,012,607.  The figure used to be considerably under one million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finn suggested a scheme, in which I have always been interested&mdash; Deputy Michael Pat Murphy used to refer to it&mdash;namely, the provision of some form of well-paid work instead of unemployment assistance.  He suggested three days per week.  I should like to tell him that this is not a new suggestion; in fact, I had it examined before I was appointed Minister for Social Welfare.  When I was in the Office of Public Works I remember a Minister telling me that if I had time to spare I should examine the possibility of providing work instead of the dole.</P>
    <P>I have worked out this to the point where unit cards could be issued with the signing form requiring the person to perform a certain unit of work. However, any such work would have to be in addition to work carried out on any county council or corporation programme.  Otherwise we would only be displacing people who are employed already&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would be necessary to offer suitable employment.  It would be very difficult to get a tailor, for instance, to work on the roads. These are only some of the difficulties in this matter, all of which I have come across when I investigated the problem. However, it is a suggestion that is worth examination.  We must ask the question why we have to pay so many people for being unemployed when so much necessary work requires to be done in the same area.</P>

      <P>There were not so many people involved.  However, one of the things we learned last year was that work was not the answer for many of our people, and this was a useful lesson.  Many people pointed out that if work were available across the road they could not avail of it.</P>
      <P>I should like to reply to the comment of Deputy Spring regarding local committees. I think if I were not Minister for Social Welfare there would not be any local sub-committees because some members of my own party frequently ask me why we do not abolish them. I was a member of such a committee at one time and we did a fair and honest job.  I think such committees are useful because I do not believe that officials throughout the country should always have everything their own way. It is not a bad thing to have local people in a position where they can know what is happening.</P>

      <P>There is another way of looking at the question of the social welfare officer's decision always being accepted.

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether, in view of the environment debate held by the Council of Europe Assembly on 21st and 22nd January 1972, he will indicate the Government's view regarding the division of responsibilities in international co-operation for the preservation of the quality of the environment and, in particular, the role which the Council of Europe should play in this regard.</P>

      <P>It is our view that international organisations should be utilised in accordance with their respective statutory competence by the member governments to solve environmental problems with a view to improving the quality of life for their peoples.  Close co-operation between them in this field is required in the interests of maximum efficiency and the avoidance of duplication.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the statutory role of the Council of Europe in promoting closer European unity, we consider that it has a useful function to perform in encouraging the development, implementation and co-ordination of governmental environmental policy on a wide European scale.</P>
