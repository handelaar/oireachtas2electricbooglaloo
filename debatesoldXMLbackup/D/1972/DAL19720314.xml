      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the procedure whereby staff or advisers of his Department, other Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies are requested or directed to speak at &ldquo;Into Europe&rdquo; conventions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of staff or advisers of Government Departments or State-sponsored bodies being requested or directed to speak at &ldquo;Into Europe&rdquo; conventions.  The Government wish to see a full and comprehensive discussion of the EEC question and to have all of the facts put before the people.  Since some of the points which arise in discussion are of a technical nature, persons, in the categories mentioned, who are qualified to deal with them have been facilitated to do so at such conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach define what he means by such persons being facilitated to appear at Fianna Fáil &ldquo;Into Europe&rdquo; conventions? Presumably somebody asks them to address such conventions, that they do not go gratuitously down the country. I refer to such people as staff members of CTT and so on or of the Taoiseach's Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

Preliminary results of this inquiry were published in the June, 1968, issue of <i>The Irish Statistical Bulletin</i>, and the final report of the inquiry was published in August, 1969. It is hoped to commence fieldwork on a further survey in the autumn of 1972.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether any representations have been made to the US Government concerning the transmission of weapons, explosives or funds from that country to IRA groups in Ireland; and what action, if any, is being taken by the US Government to control activities of this kind directed towards assisting illegal organisations in this country which threaten democratic institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider writing personally to all Irish-American organisations and individual American sympathisers pointing out that such funds being collected by IRA agents are most likely to be used for illegal purposes both North and South?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Provisional IRA and the Official IRA <Col N="1411" /> are going to America and specifically stating they are looking for money for guns and to be used in, for example, the production of bombs, and so on. The Minister should make the Government's view quite clear on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the State authorities in the US will grant a licence to organisations to collect funds only if they are satisfied of the <i>bona fides</i> of the groups concerned.  If the Deputy knows of any groups or organisations whom he wants me to warn, I should like him to name them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if his Department have given any guidance to organisations in America which describe themselves as friendly to Ireland regarding what they should contribute to and what they should not contribute to, and the kind of activities that are useful?  Some of the organisations describing themselves as friendly to Ireland are engaged in activities such as picketing Aer Lingus, which is nationally destructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy knows that certain organisations in America would not be responsive to anything the Government here would say to them.  However, as far as they can, my officers in the United States recommend organisations which can be depended upon from the point of view of this country.  What Deputy Desmond wanted was to warn against certain organisations collecting funds. The state authorities in each state examine the <i>bona fides</i> of the collectors and if they clear them I would want to have a clear name of an organisation which could not be trusted before taking action.  Certainly, the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs advise Irish-Americans and Americans <Col N="1412" /> regarding the organisations they should contact.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that since September, 1971, the board have intensified and expanded their marketing and promotional activities in Europe.  In addition to increasing the level of activity in France and Germany where Bord Fáilte already had offices, the board are extending their activities into a number of areas including Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Italy.</P>
      <P>The level of bookings, particularly in Germany, France and Holland, is reported to be higher than last year and Bord Fáilte forecast a 5 per cent increase in overall traffic from Europe this year.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte have informed me that the present indications are that traffic from North America during 1972 will not differ significantly from last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, while reports from Europe are very encouraging, our promotional effort on the continent is being impeded seriously by a shortage of funds for advertising and publicity and also a shortage of manpower?  Does the Minister propose to make available any additional emergency or special subvention to enable an intensive campaign during the next month to be mounted in Europe, or in the countries to which he has referred?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We started this in September, 1971, with the appointment of a new manager for Europe for Bord Fáilte and since then an area agent has been appointed for Italy.  He will work from Rome and will cover Italy. In addition, we will have personnel in Milan and in the next few weeks we will announce further appointments in other parts of Europe.  They will be based in Amsterdam and will cover <Col N="1414" /> the Benelux countries.  Other efforts are being made to intensify the campaign in Europe which looks very promising.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  All the funds we can make available are being made available for this effort because it is the one area which looks outstandingly promising.  On the continent of Europe there is an understanding of Ireland's position.</P>

      <P>To date, 13 applications have been received from US charter airlines to carry affinity charter groups from the US into Shannon in 1972.  Six of these flights have already been authorised.  Permission for the remaining seven has not been granted because adequate charter capacity to carry these groups can be provided by the scheduled operators on the routes on which the flights are to operate which are routes designated under the Air Agreement with the US.

      <P>My Department maintains liaison with all the transport companies operating to and from Ireland and there have been consultations and exchanges of information with British Rail, both directly and through Bord Fáilte, about the situation on the cross-Channel car ferry routes.</P>
      <P>I understand that British Rail intended to operate four round trips a day on their Fishguard-Rosslare service between mid-May and September, 1972.  They informed me, however, that bookings so far this year are down by 65 per cent as compared with last year. They, therefore, had to review their plans and decided that two rounds trips a day would be adequate to cater for likely traffic demands.  While I am disappointed that the need should arise for a curtailment in tourist transport capacity from Great Britain, I recognise that carriers must take full account of the traffic offering in settling the frequency of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education why his Department is refusing to pay a secondary teacher (name supplied) who has been employed at Hamilton High School, Bandon, County Cork for the past seven months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The teacher in question cannot be paid incremental salary because the registration council, which is a statutory body on which I am represented by only two out of the total of 18 members, has by majority decision refused to register him as a secondary teacher on the qualifications which he holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said but would the Minister not agree that this man has been several months in this country working under the impression that his qualifications were acceptable?  Would he not also agree that this man gave up a job in England and that his wife gave up a job teaching in England and that he sold his house in England and that he now finds he is not eligible to receive the salary he expected? Surely the Minister must do something about this?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on experience over the past few years, it is estimated that the number of new posts created will be around 650.  It is also estimated that there will be about 450 replacements required to fill vacancies in existing posts arising at the end of the school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that last year was the first time that the Department or the Minister exercised control over the number of secondary teachers employed and that he interfered and, in fact, left it so late that arrangements that had been made to bring teachers home from England had to be cancelled because the Minister did not allow various school authorities to employ these teachers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was thrashed out very fully in this House. The fact is that the number of teachers I gave as being likely to be employed during last year was exceeded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1969 agreement the special functions allowances were payable to secondary teachers who had reached the tenth point on the incremental scale.  These allowances ceased under the July, 1970, agreement and were supplanted by the creation of posts of responsibility. There are now 771 teachers who have reached the tenth point on the scale and who are not in receipt of special functions allowances.  Many of these will be appointed to posts of responsibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The marking of candidates' answering in the leaving certificate examination is determined entirely by strict criteria agreed between the Department's chief examiner and representatives of the universities with the panels of examiners.  There is, therefore, no question of leaving any percentage of the marks to be awarded at the discretion of an examiner.  The work of each examiner is carefully monitored throughout the marking period so that a consistent and uniform standard of marking is ensured in the case of the answering of all candidates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that the pupils doing honours Irish in the leaving certificate examination 1972 will be expected to answer six questions on Irish books on the course and two questions on Irish poetry in three hours; whether he considers that this <Col N="1426" /> is sufficient time to deal adequately with all the questions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied, in the light of experience gained in the leaving certificate examination, 1971, that the time allocated to candidates taking Irish, higher level, in the 1972 examination will be sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if the text of the Irish poems on which questions will be based in the honours Irish leaving certificate paper for 1972 will be made available to candidates for this examination; if he will outline the instructions issued to teachers on the matter; and if these instructions differ from those contained in the syllabus issued for the year 1971-72.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Instructions have been issued to school authorities to the effect that the text of the poems contained in the syllabus for Irish, leaving certificate course, may be given in the examination paper in the case of certain questions where the nature of the question makes this desirable.  It has been stressed that this may not be the case in relation to all the questions dealing with the poems.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>While as I have previously stated I am willing to take any steps which might advance the use of Irish, I will have to be fully satisfied, as a result of scientific studies, that such steps as I might recommend to the Government are the correct ones.  The Minister for Finance and the Gaeltacht has commissioned a study to examine all matters relating to attitudes towards the language and <Col N="1427" /> the factors which influence such attitudes. When the results of this study are available the manner and nature of the examinations in Irish held as part of the public examinations generally will be considered.</P>
      <P>I might add that there is no question of the Government departing from its policy of making the study of Irish essential for every pupil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as would appear to be so, the Deputy has in mind the fact that the study of Irish is obligatory in the case of all Irish pupils then I would refer him to my replies to similar questions on the 3rd March, 1971, and 1st December, 1971.  If, on the other hand, he is referring to the methods used in the teaching of Irish these are matters for study by experts in the field of linguistics.  Continuing studies in this regard are in fact being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the present policy creates great difficulty for some children who are deprived of their leaving certificate because they fail Irish in the examination?  Are we not discriminating against these children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that we are discriminating against them.  We want to ascertain whether there are any grounds for the allegations that are being made.  It has been alleged that making a pass in Irish essential for the award of the leaving certificate is hindering rather than helping the restoration of the language. This can be answered only if and when a deep study has been carried out into the pros and cons of the whole situation. That is being done now.</P>

    <P>I have seen recent newspaper reports relating to the Irish agricultural exhibit at the Paris Agricultural Show.  This exhibit was staged by Córas Beostoic agus Feola.  It was not a general agricultural exhibit but was aimed specifically at the French market for Irish lamb.

The question the Minister was asked was whether he was satisfied that the Irish agricultural exhibit at the Paris agricultural show was adequate and satisfactory. Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that food fairs at agricultural shows are an extremely important part of agricultural promotion from the point of view of processed foods and would he not also agree that in the past, and right up to now, the level of Irish participation has been inadequate?  Could we get an expression of intention now to the effect that there will be a greater expenditure of money and greater participation in what is a very important international shop window?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will state in respect of the financial year 1971-72 (a) the estimated extra demand on the Exchequer likely to arise from increased prices provided during the year for dairy products; (b) the gains to the Exchequer likely to arise from lower subsidisation costs as a result of the fall in dairy productions; and (c) the estimated net saving to the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As supplies of milk for manufacturing purposes are seasonally small in the winter period and as there is no great volume of exports of products manufactured during that period, no significant Exchequer expenditure is expected to arise in the current financial year as a result of the increased prices provided for dairy products manufactured as from 1st December last.  The bringing forward from next September to the present month of the date of payment of the deferred portion of the former milk price allowance will, however, cost approximately £1.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> Exchequer support to meet export losses on dairy products has been reduced during 1971-72 as a result of the improvement in the prices of such products on export markets.  The reduction is estimated at about £4¼ million in the current year but this is offset by the cost of the increases granted during the year in the support payments through creameries, the cost of supporting an increase in the creamery intake of milk and the £1.8 million referred to above.  Allowing for these factors it is expected that there will be no net saving to the Exchequer on the original provision.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is prepared to <Col N="1438" /> introduce more effective measures towards dealing with the continuing dangers and menace arising from the fact that scores of horses are wandering on the roads of north-west Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the past 12 months in the north-west Dublin area more than 200 horses have been impounded by the Garda and more than 80 persons have been prosecuted for permitting animals to wander.</P>
      <P>The problem has been due in large measure to the existence of an area of unfenced land, belonging to the Dublin Corporation, where horses are turned out to graze by their owners.  The Garda have no power to deal with horses on corporation or on private lands and can only impound horses found on the public roads.  Following discussions last November between the Dublin Corporation, the Garda Síochána and my Department, the corporation established a team to make frequent visits to lands held by the corporation and drive any horses they find thereon to corporation pounds. The Garda provide any protection which the team need for their operations. The Garda believe that the new measures adopted by the corporation have reduced the problem considerably.</P>
      <P>In January of this year I made an order increasing pound fees by 50 per cent and I hope that this increase will also help to reduce the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether, in view of the alarming increase in vandalism and the defiant attitude of law-breaking teenagers in Dublin city, he will establish a special Garda squad to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>While every effort is being made to cope with vandalism, the Garda do not consider that the establishment of a squad to deal exclusively with the problem would be justified. The special task force established in Dublin in August, 1971, have, however, been paying special attention to areas in which vandalism is prevalent.</P>
      <P>The strength of the force in Dublin has been increasing and will be increased still further over the next few years.  This will allow continued improvement in patrolling, which is probably the most effective way in which the Garda Síochána can help to combat crimes of this sort.  However, as I mentioned in answer to previous parliamentary questions on the subject, most of the damage is done by youngsters between 12 and 15 years of age, and I believe that action by parents, teachers and local community leaders can be much more effective in installing a sense of civic responsibility in these young people than any Garda activity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no undue delay generally in the allocation and payment of new house grants by my Department.  However, there has been some increase in the time taken to pay in individual cases because of the big rise in the number of grants paid in the current financial year.  Over 9,700 new house grants will be finally paid this year, as compared with 8,753 in 1970-71 which, up to then, was an all-time record.  In the normal course, delays also occur where work is not completed in accordance with grant requirements or an applicant otherwise fails to comply with conditions governing the payment of grants.</P>
      <P>With a view to improving the quality of the service provided, I secured the agreement of the Minister for Finance to the commissioning of a firm of consultants to advise on the introduction of management by objectives in the housing grants section of my Department. The exercise commenced in April, 1971, and is proceeding with the aid of the consultants and of officers from the two Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals to improve the efficiency of the section are being developed.  It is intended, for example, to change the existing procedure for dealing with the approval and payment of most types of grant.  Administrative checks on grant <Col N="1445" /> allocations and payments will be reduced to the minimum.  These changes are expected to yield a worthwhile reduction in the cost of administration and, at the same time, to enable grants to be approved and paid more quickly.</P>
    <P>In addition, four extra inspectors were recently assigned to the section to cope with the increased work load.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress on Thursday afternoon I had made suggestions to the Minister as to how charges could be <Col N="1451" /> taken off the rates and more equitably distributed over the public as a whole. There is no need to go further into that matter except to say that the real trouble now is that the regional hospital boards are spending the money and the county councils are asked to vote that money although they no longer have any say in the expenditure of the money.  Therefore, we put down the motion referred to by Deputy Richard Barry in which we suggest that the charge should be transferred to the Central Government.  If the Minister adopts the suggestions I made on Thursday afternoon he will be able to do that; he will be able to collect sufficient money and remove from the county councils the odium of having to increase the rates to meet ever-escalating charges.  I shall not deal with that matter any further at this stage as I do not want to hold up the debate unnecessarily.  I am sure that Deputies who will follow me in the debate will have some comments to make along the same lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a word or two about the FitzGerald Report.  The Minister did not clarify in his long opening speech what decision he would take about the regionalisation of hospitals. There is considerable concern in a great many counties because of the suggested closure of hospitals.  I want again to advert to the position in Wexford.  For many years we have been awaiting the provision of a new hospital in Wexford. All we get is an indication that not only will we not get a new hospital but that the existing hospital will be closed.  Sufficient Deputies have spoken of their particular problems for the Minister to realise that different circumstances exist in different areas.  The Minister would be ill-advised to proceed <i>in toto</i> with the suggestions made in the FitzGerald Report because, while they may be applicable in some circumstances, they are not applicable in the majority of cases.  The Minister should keep an open mind on this matter.  He should examine the matter very thoroughly before arriving at any decision.  I understand that he has not as yet taken any decision and is not likely to take a decision in the immediate future.  He should evaluate all the <Col N="1452" /> facts and should allow the present situation to continue.  I can certainly say that as far as County Wexford is concerned we will use all the force we can command, political and otherwise, in an effort to maintain our hospital and until we get the service we require.</P>
    <P>I want to put one point to the Minister. Before tourism from the United Kingdom was destroyed due to the political circumstances obtaining today there was a very heavy influx of people into Wexford during the summer. They included not only persons coming on holidays but also Irish nationals living in Britain who came back to obtain maternity service.  It is a very easy matter to get from Wales and other places to Wexford.  Persons also came for the purpose of surgical operations.  The idea of transferring our general hospital is unadulterated nonsense.  I hope the Minister will do some deep thinking on that matter.</P>
    <P>I notice that in his opening speech the Minister still allies coronary thrombosis and lung cancer or other cancer conditions as the two leading causes of death in this country, as they are in most other countries.  There are three causes contributing towards these two conditions.  Two of them certainly apply in the case of lung cancer.  Air pollution is much more injurious to health than anybody in this country seems yet to have realised.  In 1968, the United States of America realised the adverse effect of air pollution on the health of the community.  It was found that the pollutant emission from cars and other mechanically propelled vehicles consisted of carbon monoxide, a deadly poison if consumed in sufficient quantity, hydrocarbon gases and nitrogenous gases.  In the United States of America the volume of the emission was considerably above that in other countries.  Anti-pollutant emission devices were produced.  Regulations were introduced in 1968 which had the effect of reducing the pollutant emissions, in the case of hydrocarbon gases, by 40 per cent and in the case of nitrogenous gases by 25 per cent. No European country seems to have made any study in depth of this matter, with the exception of Sweden. Sweden has devised a scheme along <Col N="1453" /> the lines of that introduced in the United States of America and as a result pollutant emissions in that country have been reduced.</P>
    <P>Pollutant gases, with all the noxious ingredients they contain, are a contributory cause of lung cancer and of chronic bronchitis.  They are also extremely injurious to the heart.  An extra load is imposed on the vascular system and that in itself is a contributory cause of coronary thrombosis.</P>
    <P>A second cause is cigarette smoking. Some people think that cigarette smoking is the sole cause of lung cancer.  I would draw attention to the fact that cases of lung cancer occurred long ago. In considering the increase in the incidence of lung cancer one must bear in mind the fact that cases occurred long before pollutant gases became as prevalent as they are now.  That is understandable.  Exhaustive tests have been carried out in the US and in Sweden and it has been discovered that there are carcinogenic materials in polluted air.  Cigarette smoking is one cause of cancer and pollution is another.  They are both irritants to the lungs.  If people smoke in a heated atmosphere their smoking is certainly a contributory cause of cancer.  I would not agree with those who say that it is a direct cause but it is a contributory cause by virtue of its being an irritant. It is also the cause of many chest ailments. The Minister should direct attention to both cigarette smoking and pollution.</P>
    <P>Cigarette smoking has been highlighted in this country as a cause of cancer but pollution has not.  The country is aware of the dangerous situation which we face.  A hydrological expert has said that pollution of the air is so great that it finds its way into the water and that in 25 years time all marine life will be destroyed.  We should look intelligently at this problem.</P>
    <P>The three causes of coronary thrombosis, which is taking a big toll of middle-aged people, are faulty diet, weight and the lack of exercise.  Many breadwinners have been struck down with this disease with consequential <Col N="1454" /> suffering to the families involved and a considerable charge on the State.  I suggest to the Minister that he bears a responsibility to the public to highlight this issue.  Television is a good advertising medium.  Talks should be given by people who are competent to deal with diet and factors which lead to coronary thrombosis.  Research has been carried out and it has been found that fat is one of the major causes of clotting.  The fat of meat is the most injurious of all fats.  Butter is harmful to a lesser extent.  The public should be advised of such things.</P>
    <P>I have often seen men in restaurants eating fat meat.  Generally they are very much overweight.  Such people, in my opinion, would be incapable of walking a mile even though they may be in early middle life. Extensive investigations carried out in the US on the subject of coronary thrombosis have shown that butter is a contributory cause.  The Americans have spent millions on research.  They have been responsible for schemes to prohibit the sale of butter.  People are inclined to heed advice for a short time and then to forget about it.  The Minister should use RTE to highlight these facts and also to conduct a campaign against cigarette smoking and pollution.  It should be shown that faulty diet and overweight are responsible for coronary thrombosis.</P>
    <P>The advent of the mechanically-propelled vehicle has meant that there are people who never take any exercise. Going along the street one sees people who have too much avoirdupois and some of them would not be able to walk two or three miles.  I know of people who would get into a car to go to the nearest corner shop for cigarettes. Lack of exercise is one of the causes of early death.  The public should be awakened to the facts of this dangerous situation.  Until they heed the warnings the heavy mortality rate, with all its suffering and unhappiness and the hardships imposed in a great many cases on young widows, will continue.</P>
    <P>The rush and bustle of life today is another contributory cause of heart disease.  Everyone is in a hurry everywhere. People are worried about their <Col N="1455" /> financial position and taxation.  People are worried about the state of the world, feeling that there will be a world conflagration or a civil war in this country.  The only advice I can give is to tell people not to worry.  If something is going to happen it will happen anyway.  Worry is certainly a contributory cause because it constricts the arteries and coronary thrombosis is a blockade of the main artery to the heart.  If it is totally blocked the person dies.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to speech therapy. This is something relatively new. Speech therapy is something which is quite different from elocution.  Elocution is aimed at enabling people to articulate properly.  Many people require elocution.  Speech therapy is something that is necessary for many children.  It is a distinct science for training vocal muscles and the proper emission of sound.  I am associated with mentally handicapped children. Speech therapy is absolutely essential for such children if we are to tackle their problems properly.  There should be a speech therapist in every county. I have been present at the discussions of a committee concerned with mentally handicapped children.  There are a considerable number of teachers on this committee.  The teachers expressed the opinion that not only was speech therapy needed by handicapped children but that it is also needed in every primary school in the country.</P>
    <P>There is a small school of speech therapy at the entrance to St. Vincent's Hospital.  It is run by the Irish Sisters of Charity and there is a very skilled nun in charge of the school. The Minister has been concerned with this school and has helped it in every way.  The school turned out 15 graduates in June.  That is not sufficient.  We should try to expand considerably in regard to speech therapy.  The British have also been very much behind in speech therapy but they are in a position to pay higher salaries than we are.  Most of the girls who qualify in speech therapy will probably emigrate because they would be able to obtain better salaries in the United Kingdom than they <Col N="1456" /> would here.  In County Wexford we have even gone to the extent of putting up a voluntary fund to sponsor a girl through the college on the understanding that she will stay with us for three years.  The intention of the person we have in mind, who has agreed to stay with us, was that she would emigrate as soon as she could.</P>
    <P>Speech therapy is a comparatively new thing all over the world and I suggest to the Minister that we should have an institution here which would be responsible for training at least 30 people per annum.  If we could turn out 30 speech therapists a year we would clear off the backlog which we have at the moment.  I do not believe there is any speech therapist in the South Eastern Regional Health Board of Carlow, Kilkenny, South Tipperary, Wicklow, Wexford and Waterford. There may be a couple in the Dublin North Eastern Health Board area but there certainly are not many all over the country.</P>
    <P>They are very anxious in the small colleges to obtain university status when they would be able to expand and could have available to them some of the educational grants which are made available to universities.  They would thus be able to carry on their work.  Perhaps the Minister would see his way to giving us double the amount we are getting for the coming year.  It is a three-year course and we all hope that in a few years time we will have in this country the number of speech therapists it is necessary for us to have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate gives us an opportunity of discussing the progress made by the Minister in his Department over the past year.  It is right that we should pay tribute to him for his conscientious approach.  Perhaps we expect too much of him but he certainly has tried to do his best in regard to our health services.  He has been described as an arch-conservative. His speeches have indicated that he is very conservative in his approach but despite this he has gone a long way to try to make something of our health services.  It is no credit to his predecessors, with the exception of the late <Col N="1457" /> Donogh O'Malley, who was, unfortunately, too short a time in this Department, that the present Minister was left with so much on his plate and so short a time in which to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been trying to cope as best he can.  There are a few things about him which puzzle me.  I wonder why he did not consider extending the health services we have. Reunification of our country is in everybody's mind at present, North and South.  I have been in the North on many occasions recently.  One of the obstacles to which the extreme Unionists refer&mdash;those who say they will have nothing to do with us&mdash;is the fact that we have deplorable health services, that it costs so much to get medical services in the South.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to answer that especially when in the North of Ireland any man, woman or child can be assured of full and adequate health services free.  We are not doing anything in the South to put our health services on a par with those in Northern Ireland.  If we are sincere in our statements about the reunification of our country we should be making every attempt possible to produce national health services covering every person, to ensure that our health services are as good, if not better, than those in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have told the medical profession in Ireland that they may have to submerge any selfish interests they may have in this and they may have to look at the bigger interest at stake and say that we will have national health services for our people in the interest of the entire country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how long the Minister will remain in the Department of Health but I should like to see him there for quite a while.  I would ask him not to set his sights on Europe but to see if he could produce national health services for our country.  It should not be impossible.  The cost would not be that much.  It was said that we could not produce a free choice of doctor for the lower income group.  A former Minister, Mr. MacEntee, said that the care of the <Col N="1458" /> aged was the responsibility of their relatives.  Now we realise he was wrong.  I ask the Minister to see if he could make an estimate of the cost of national health services for the country and how they could be implemented.</P>
    <P>The 15p per week provides security for the middle income group who must seek hospitalisation from time to time. It is a great relief to them to know when they enter hospital that they have not to face a large bill when leaving. It should be possible to go one step further, because the administrative costs could not be that much greater. The Minister has put a figure on the cost of providing a choice of doctor for the lower income group.  I should like to remind him that the cost of this need not necessarily be multiplied by the remaining 70 per cent because it is the lower income group who make most calls on a doctor's time.  Therefore extending it further does not necessarily mean a proportionately greater cost.  The Minister should grasp this nettle.  He should see what he can do about extending this facility and providing a national health service for this country, and having regard to our aspirations and our wishes in regard to reunification, I believe he would have the support of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister is anxious to make this health service a model service, but he has not broken through a number of restrictions that are on him.  It has been said by other Deputies that the biggest worry and complaint of the people is the impossible burden of health charges on rates.  It should be possible to take this burden off rates completely and make health a charge on the Exchequer.  The Minister may put up all kinds of arguments against this and say we cannot possibly do it.  We have got to do it.  We have got to follow Britain in this.  By making health a charge on the Central Exchequer, at least we shall know that those who can afford to pay will pay.  It is morally wrong that people on fixed incomes who happen to own a house, and who would be glad to dispose of the house but they cannot get alternative accommodation, should be crippled with <Col N="1459" /> rates due to the enormous health charges.  I know many who are in this position but who cannot dispose of their houses because they would be left homeless and would not be granted accommodation.</P>
    <P>Something must be done about this before there is a public outcry.  I believe the Minister knows it is a crushing burden, but there is a stranglehold there from which he cannot free himself.  I have heard the Minister speak and I know how he feels about this.  He will have to get someone working on this and convince his colleagues in the Government that action must be taken in this regard.</P>
    <P>If we had a national health service we could get rid of the indignity and humiliation of the medical card system.  It is perhaps the most degrading system that was ever devised. There is a great disparity between the different counties.  I jotted them down last week as one Deputy was speaking. How can it be that 50 per cent in Galway have the medical card while only 12 per cent in Dublin have it? There is something radically wrong with a system that permits a public servant to decide whether a person is entitled to a medical card or not.  We cannot have public officials asking the most intimate details about a person's means before they will decide to give a medical card, or politicians using it as a political gimmick, which is happening regularly, in order to get votes.</P>
    <P>I have said over and over again that this system must be abolished, because there is no uniformity about it.  I have tried to find out what qualifies a person for a medical card, but I cannot get the answer.  I got such a vague, ambiguous statement from the CEO in the Eastern Health Board that I just could not understand it.  Having made representations over and over again, I have found that on the fourth or fifth occasion a medical card has come.  I am wondering what has happened to the Minister's earnest and sincere intentions, as announced by him some months ago, that there would be some uniformity.  He found it impossible to work it in practice.  He found he would <Col N="1460" /> upset many people; selfish interests would be interfered with.  It is a bad system under which if you are friendly with the CEO you will get a medical card for a person and, if you do not know him, the person suffers.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister would contradict me on these points.  He knows they are true.  He must tackle this problem and tackle it fast.  There is only one way to tackle it and that is to get rid of the medical card system completely.  The whole concept of the system is wrong.  It is degrading and humiliating and it is used for so many things.  It is even used to obtain free books for school children.  People apply for the medical card for that purpose alone, in order that they can show the medical card to a superior in a school to get free books for their children.</P>
    <P>There certainly is not the disparity in incomes between Kerry, Galway, Roscommon and Dublin that would justify the disparity in the numbers holding medical cards in those counties. There is something wrong with a system that can provide 50 per cent of the people in Galway and only 12 per cent of the people in Dublin with medical cards.  I do not think the incidence of poverty in Galway can equal the incidence of poverty I have seen in Dublin.  I should like the Minister to be courageous in this matter and to persuade his colleagues to rid us of this terrible system of the medical card, this poor law system that we should have shed long ago.  I do not think the answer is in the choice of doctor scheme for the lower income group.  The scheme must be extended so that there will be no discrimination, so that people do not have to keep writing in, keep sending in forms, getting their employers to state that they are paupers and that they are, therefore, applying for medical cards.</P>
    <P>The system here is such that the income of sons and daughters is taken into account.  They must go to their employers to get them to fill in certificates saying their incomes are so-and-so. Some of them will not do that for their parents and accordingly many invalid fathers and mothers are unable to get treated medically.  The Minister knows that.  I have written to him <Col N="1461" /> about it dozens of times.  The time has come for him to be courageous about it.  I ask him as a matter of urgency, pending a complete reappraisal of the system and the complete elimination of such an iniquitous set-up, to call the CEOs together and get them to issue some standard so that the public will have some idea of who is and who is not entitled to a medical card in each region.</P>
    <P>Last September the Minister promised to do that.  I ask him to do it now as a matter of urgency.  It is appalling that it should be left to individual CEOs with one assistant each who do not understand prescriptions.  It is dangerous that they should have to consider prescriptions and medical histories of applicants.  It is wrong that they should be called on to make decisions on the basis of prescriptions submitted.  That is why I ask the Minister, as an immediate step, to call the CEOs together to arrive at a standard for the entire country.  I do not know what is stopping him from doing this.  I know he has the best intentions and he is on record as having told this House that he intended to do it.  This is one of the enigmas of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Another enigma is the spectacle of the Minister for Health going into the Division Lobbies to vote against giving a First Reading to the Contraception Bill and at the same time approving of the two family planning clinics in Dublin.  He saw the booklet they issued and said it was a great service. His voting against the Contraception Bill was the most disgraceful thing I have seen any Minister do.  I know he did not vote from conviction and this makes me say that he was a coward on that occasion.  He speaks about medical education but why has he not got facilities for family planning as well?  Ireland was a signatory to the UN Convention on family planning yet if it were not for those voluntary organisations we would not have any family planning facilities here.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is sincere and believes that these clinics should not exist, let him stand up here and say so. He cannot have it both ways.  He <Col N="1462" /> praised their booklet and yet he voted against the Bill.  The time has come for the Minister to display his courage, to stand up and be counted no matter what his colleagues say.  I am surprised that a Minister of his religion should speak as he did, knowing the importance of this to the country.  We have doubts about the Minister for Health, we wonder if he acts according to his convictions.  I ask him now if he has had consultations with the Minister for Justice about the right of our citizens to education in family planning, or has he decided to turn a blind eye to this whole matter?  Is he prepared financially to support those organisations who are having a difficult time?  Does he know of the increasing demand for this service? Has he considered the importance of it in the context of a united Ireland? I hope he will have the courage to stand up here and reply to all these questions.</P>
    <P>In the past year we have seen headlines about our psychiatric services and I am aware that attempts have been made to improve them, but only after extreme public pressure.  A year ago I asked the Minister to set up an inquiry into our mental hospitals.  Despite all we hear, despite the lovely facades of some of our new out-patient clinics, intolerable conditions exist in our mental hospitals.  I had one of the most depressing experiences of my life recently when I visited St. Ita's in Portrane.  It is a beautiful place with beautiful surroundings, but then I asked about the temporary buildings which 87 years ago were erected as temporary accommodation for the workmen.  I saw those temporary buildings and I never want to see them again.  There, 96 people were herded into a ward with two open toilets.  I should like to see television cameras out there to show up the intolerable conditions We have no right to treat people like that.  Of course, the Minister will say we have plans, but they are not plans for this year, next year or the year after.  This is an urgent problem. We would not dare treat cattle as we treat those people.  These poor innocent people are herded, worse than cattle, in intolerable conditions.  I had <Col N="1463" /> to demand that another toilet be provided for them.</P>
    <P>Television should highlight these facts and let the public know what is happening.  It is not the fault of the doctors that such conditions exist but I do not like doctors to defend the system. I do not think any doctor should be afraid to speak out on this matter; fear of losing his job or anything else should not be a deterrent.  If they find that such conditions exist they have a duty and a right to speak about them in public.</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that bad conditions exist in Our Lady's Hospital in Cork.  That made the headlines some time ago but there are many other places that do not get any publicity because people have not the courage to speak out.  Perhaps we should have an independent body to investigate this problem and to decide the number of hospitals that need replacement or improvement.</P>
    <P>We should be ashamed of our mental services.  It is nice to see the new St. Brendan's building but there are parts of St. Brendan's that nobody would like.  The Minister may stand up and say that we are doing very well, but I say it is not good enough when 96 women are herded into a place with two open toilets.  When such conditions exist it is obvious that we have our priorities wrong.  The Minister's first priority should be to go out to Portrane and see the conditions.  If he does this I would defy him to stand up here and say that he is satisfied with them. Will the Minister do this?</P>
    <P>I admit that the Minister tries, but he must have more courage.  I realise that he cannot do everything himself and that he must convince the Minister for Finance that the money is required.  If he is courageous or persuasive enough he will get the money. The Minister cannot leave it to the health boards.  Our mental health services are not good enough and we must do something about them.  There is a moral obligation on us to provide the necessary money.  If the public knew the facts they would support us in <Col N="1464" /> allocating the necessary funds.  We must let the public know the situation.</P>

      <P>If I might interrupt the Deputy for a moment, I am glad to tell him that we have finance for the year 1972-73 to begin work at St. Ita's.  The Deputy is absolutely right; the work is long overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. We have a problem with regard to the aged in our community and I realise that the Minister is sympathetic towards them.  A former Minister for Health, Mr. MacEntee, said that the care of the elderly was the responsibility of the relatives and that the State was not to be bothered with them.  I regard this as a most callous attitude. All of us, if we survive the coronaries and other hazards, will get old.  I agree with many of the statements made by the Minister about what the community can do for the elderly.</P>
      <P>However, there are geriatric cases who need medical and surgical attention and who cannot get admitted to hospitals.  I must confess that, as a doctor, I have had to tell lies in order to get people into hospital.  If a man is 73 years I have to say he is over 60 years; 65 years is regarded as very old by hospital standards and if a person is said to be more than 65 years he has no hope of being admitted.  Geriatric cases suffer from medical and surgical problems as do any other section of the community; in fact, a geriatric can get an acute appendix.  However, there is a reluctance on the part of hospitals to accept these patients.</P>
      <P>We should insist on general hospitals having a certain number of beds for geriatric patients.  Geriatrics is part of hospital teaching and I do not know how a teaching hospital can give instruction on this subject if they have not geriatric patients.  I hope the Minister will say to the general hospitals that they must have a ward for these patients or a geriatric unit.  If this is done many of the geriatric cases can get proper attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing more depressing or frustrating for a doctor than to try to get a case of terminal cancer into hospital. <Col N="1465" /> If a general hospital decides that a person has cancer, either they operate or they decide the person's condition cannot be helped by operation and he is sent home.  That is the end of the matter so far as the hospital is concerned.  They have not the right to write off a person in this fashion.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to insist that these general hospitals have terminal care units for such cases.  There is nothing worse than to be forced to tell a person that you will try to get him a bed in Our Lady's Hospice or in the Hospital for Incurables. These units should be attached to general hospitals so that patients can get the complete medical and surgical care necessary.  The units might even be prefabricated but they must be provided.  People suffering from incurable diseases are in need of treatment and regular injections; they may even need emergency surgical treatment to relieve pain or obstruction. This is the thinking I should like to see in the Department of Health.  We are paying for the general hospitals, voluntary and otherwise; we have a right to these services.  It is a sad reflection on a city of 750,000 people that there are only five beds in Cabinteely for terminal cases.  That is organised by the Irish Cancer Society but, having regard to the number of terminal cases that exist, there is urgent need for a number of units to be attached to hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is need for a rationalisation of our hospitals.  I should dispense with St. Luke's Cancer Hospital.  No matter how enlightened our people are they do not like being sent to St. Luke's.  One can see immediately the fear in a person who is told: &ldquo;I should like you to be seen at St. Luke's.&rdquo;  No matter how much one tries to allay this fear and anxiety one cannot do it.  Personally I should want this removed.  We should be able to site these facilities in a large hospital complex.  I do not think you can isolate one service from the other.  The facilities should be sited in a large hospital complex and we should get rid of the idea of St. Anne's for skin <Col N="1466" /> and cancer and so on.  There is a lot of money wasted because of duplication and we could save a good deal by providing the services in a centralised hospital complex.  The opportunity is there with St. James's.  These relics of the past must be re-examined in the light of present day knowledge.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the skin hospital in Hume Street.  There is no reason why these hospital services should not all be included in a general hospital.  I do not think it is right to isolate these cases.  So many skin diseases are of a general systemic origin that you cannot just look at a skin condition and say: &ldquo;That belongs to the skin.&rdquo;  Its origin may be and indeed is invariably in the system. It then becomes a matter for consultation with a consulting physician and this can only take place properly in a vast hospital complex with a saving of money to the State.  The Minister has done a great job in regard to the federation of the Dublin voluntary hospitals.  He sees the need for it there with the vast hospital complex he is producing at St. James's.  This is the right idea but I want to go one step further and do the same with these other institutions.  He knows it will save money for the State and there are so many things on which the money saved can be used.  I should like him to think along these lines because in that way we shall get answers to our problems, save money and get better services.</P>
    <P>I am all for rationalisation.  We can get a better hospital and better specialised service in this way.  I know the Minister is up against vested interests.  People who are depending on votes do not like these changes but when I went to Athlone, I think it was, and spoke to the people there and told them the risks involved in small hospitals, that what was sent in as an appendix might not be an appendix, they fully understood and were not opposed to the idea.  If the Minister wants to implement the FitzGerald Report and comes up against vested interests he must say: &ldquo;They must be dealt with.&rdquo;  This goes beyond politics. This is where trouble arises between Ministers and their colleagues.  I do <Col N="1467" /> not think the Minister cares about votes in a matter like this.  He is outspoken, but his colleagues are not and they have done him an injustice and hindered him.  I should have thought he could have approached this matter by a process of education and by encouraging public meetings on it.</P>
    <P>When there was an outcry in Athlone he should have brought down his experts, his doctors there and talked to the people.  I found when I explained this to the people, they said: &ldquo;What about an acute appendix?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Who says it is an acute appendix? Many a case of acute appendix sent in was not an acute appendix and needed more specialised treatment, but if you have a small hospital that has not got facilities and has not a few surgeons for consultation, a patient may die.&rdquo;  The people saw the logic of this and were not opposed to it.  This is where the Minister could break the resistance barrier and he should take account of what I say in this regard. We should not follow public opinion; we should lead it.  You need not necessarily tell people what they would like to know but tell them what they need to know.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very touchy on the McKinsey Report.  I am not out to criticise him all the time; I think he honestly believes in the McKinsey Report and what it intends to do; I think he is sincere and I pay tribute to him in that he firmly believes in this report.  While I do not agree with a man's views I must respect them and I respect the Minister's views on this. I do not think there was sufficient opportunity for discussion of the McKinsey Report, which is arousing much opposition, and this may be because it has not been properly explained.  Perhaps I understand Americans having lived in America for a number of years.  They have a way of putting things that is not too readily understood by Irish people. This is the whole crux of the McKinsey Report.  We are not accustomed to the pattern that operates in American business and this is an American business approach to our services.  This is obvious in the McKinsey Report, but <Col N="1468" /> it is not completely adaptable to the Irish system.  I was interested to see that the agenda of the Irish Medical Association's annual meeting next month includes a resolution from the executive committee condemning the McKinsey Report.  This is significant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I am beginning to think that they are only now realising that the McKinsey Report may not be quite applicable to the Irish scene.  I think it is significant that this resolution should come from the executive of the IMA.  They think the results may not warrant the cost. I should be interested in this debate because if this resolution is carried it indicates that the IMA oppose the McKinsey Report, and if that is so it will be an interesting situation.  I suppose we were all in a hurry but I thought we should have given more time to discussing it; and a draft of it should have been available which should have been discussed at length. Certainly, the seminars did not achieve a great deal by way of explaining it sufficiently.  Too many representatives on health boards are still very confused about the different posts that have been created and the purpose of them.  Perhaps we will adjust to it now that it is in operation but I am dubious about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been watching the course of events in relation to the Mallow and Mount Alvernia Hospitals.  Deputy Barry mentioned these hospitals during his contribution to the debate.  In replying to Parliamentary questions the Minister has always told us that such matters are for the health boards and they are autonomous bodies.  I wonder how, then, he can justify his decision to overrule the decision of the health board in the case of Mallow Hospital. The Minister is a man who moves around a lot.  I read many of his speeches.  He is a tremendous worker but I wonder how his Department could have had consultations before overruling the health board.  This step <Col N="1469" /> was unprecedented and raises the question whether health boards are autonomous bodies at all.  What is to happen in the future in respect of any resolutions passed by health boards?  There is a peculiar dilemma in respect of the two hospitals I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I shall refer briefly to our dental health services.  As the Minister must be aware, these services are very unsatisfactory but the problem is one that he inherited.  The record of performance of the Department of Health in this respect has not been the best. Our health service has suffered.  It is possible, I suppose, that we expect too much.  Being so close to Britain, we expect to be as good as they are in relation to the various services but we must realise that we have not been able to be as good as them in this respect because the necessary finance has not been available to us.  However, one can hardly be blamed for questioning the overall policy of the Government when we have a situation where 5 per cent of the people own 71 per cent of the wealth.  We have had Ministers for Health who have been stymied because of lack of money.  The Minister for Health cannot provide any service unless he receives the necessary moneys from the Department of Finance and, of course, when seeking money he must compete with the other Ministers.  Perhaps it is taken into account, too, that health is not something that will win votes.  I would say that our dental health services are the worst in Europe.  Long before fluoridation was thought of, it was remarked constantly in America that the Irish people were among the worst off in the world as regards dental health.  Our people did not take care of their teeth.  They did not know how to do so and proper services were not available to them.  Even now for certain orthodontic treatments there is a waiting list of up to 18 months.  Pregnant women are very susceptible to tooth decay.  Therefore, in their case in particular it is vital that the necessary dental services be available.  There are many people who cannot afford to pay for treatment and, consequently, must continue to suffer.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am placing too much <Col N="1470" /> emphasis on the bad points of the service.  The problem is one that has been tackled in so far as schoolchildren are concerned but it is not enough that school children only be looked after in this regard.  We must admit that the Minister has done wonders in a short time in recruiting dental officers into the local authority health services, but he has inherited a bad system under which there was no consideration for people who could not afford to pay for dental care.  Steps must be taken to provide proper services for everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit it is a low priority but there is £250,000 extra provided this year for dental services. That should do something towards solving the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says and I believe him to be very sincere in the services he wishes to provide.  Great credit is due to him for having made so much use of the money that was available to him, but there is much more to be done to bring the dental health services up to the level of other countries in western Europe.  Perhaps we inherited a tradition of looking for everything without having to pay for it.  I realise the expenditure involved in providing proper services and I know how high such costs are in the United States. Fluoridation is good but it will not solve the whole problem.  A better service should be available to children after they leave the national school. There is much to be tackled and much money needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I omitted to mention one matter in respect of health education and that is that there is some provision in our legislation which prevents us from providing information on venereal disease. There should not be a repression of information relating to this subject.  I <Col N="1471" /> believe the disease to be on the increase.  The people must be informed about this disease.  The problem will not be eliminated by pretending that it does not exist.  One must face the fact that it is there and there must be a campaign of public education.  That is not available.  There is no education. I should like the Department to initiate such a campaign of public education about these diseases and the facilities provided for their treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of cases notified is minimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If only the Deputy could get doctors to write to me privately, in which case I would not, perhaps, take the legal action I could; if I could get from a group of doctors the number of private cases I would then know whether or not these diseases are still minimal.  The information I have is that they are minimal. If doctors would let me know the number of private cases then I would at least know where I was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The way in which doctors are expected to notify the Department is not helpful.  I know this. I would ask him to get his officials to look into this aspect because the incidence is very much higher than is reported.  Venerologists agree on this. Perhaps we could improve the system of notification.  Doctors are very busy men and they can be forgetful.  If there were record cards we could have a better system of notification.  This will have to be looked into to ensure that the Department will have an accurate picture of the incidence of the disease. There is need for education.  As a medical student, I had the experience of seeing a patient refused treatment because he could not afford to pay.  I thought that a deplorable situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Treatment is free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not know that.  People generally do not know treatment is free.  Very few people knew there was a hospital in Townsend Street <Col N="1472" /> or what that hospital was for; it was a hospital for females.  It was used to treat venereal diseases in females.  Very few people know that St. Margaret's of Cortona, as it was called, is now transferred to the Mater Hospital.  The danger of infection is serious.  We are in an age now in which we can stop pretending these things do not exist and the Department must get to work on a programme of education.  I would ask the Minister to look into the legal aspect because I think it is even illegal to have posters about these diseases.  I should like to hear the Minister on this.</P>
      <P>The work of the Department is very important and I am sure I will be excused if I spend some time on various aspects of health.  There was a statement recently by Dr. Clinch, the Master of the Coombe Hospital, to the effect that the number of maternity beds in that hospital is inadequate.  At the time the Coombe Hospital was opened I said to the then Minister, Deputy O'Malley, that I thought the Department were not looking ahead and were not aware of the trend away from domiciliary deliveries.  What I said then has been amply born out with the passage of time.  There is a shortage of maternity beds.  There is a shortage in most of our major towns. The trend has changed.  We no longer deliver three babies in their homes in one night.  People now realise the risks involved in home deliveries.  We will have to have prefabricated units erected in order to provide enough beds.  I dislike the demarcation &ldquo;north side&rdquo; and &ldquo;south side&rdquo; and, if we had a proper system, we might do away with this demarcation.  There is need for an investigation into the shortage of beds.  There is need for a proper maternity unit on the north side and an extension on the south side to the existing Coombe Hospital.  I was opposed to its erection on that particular site.  It is a very impressive building and there are excellent facilities but not enough beds. We must, of course, weigh this against a possibly more enlightened Government which will allow contraception and family planning.  In that event we may not need all the beds I am talking about now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the problem of drug abuse, I do not intend to set any scare headline. <Col N="1473" /> This is a problem of our society.  It is a problem we must look at dispassionately and coolly in an effort to solve it.  I do not think we are doing enough about it.  There is need for more education. I do not believe such education would give rise to an unhealthy curiosity.  I have been lecturing to youth groups for the last two years and I have found these groups very interested but not unhealthily curious. They appreciate the dangers.  Proper facilities must be provided for drug addicts and those dependent on drugs. We are not doing this.  It has been said that the Jervis Street clinic is merely a meeting place for drug abuses and that drugs are exchanged between them there.  I believe this.  I do not think we have the facilities there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The social workers and the doctors do a lot of excellent work there, even though what the Deputy says may be partly true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, they do. I do not disagree with that.  However, the doctors are there twice a week We do not have a registrar there.  There is a house doctor, an intern, who looks in occasionally and who has no knowledge of drug dependence.  We need a registrar there who has a full knowledge of this condition.  How many doctors coming out of medical school know about drug abuse?  Very, very few.  How many doctors in active practice know about drug abuse?  A doctor friend of mine, Dr. Davin Power, wrote a very enlightening article on this in a humorous vein.  He wrote about a man coming into a doctor and using modern language about drugs and the doctor did not understand him.  He was pointing to the fact that so many doctors are not aware of the facts and would not know a drug addict.  I was fooled by drug addicts too often.  I was fooled into giving them narcotics by injection although I had seen the problem in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the doctors in Jervis Street are working very hard but what is the use of counselling drug addicts if they are to be sent back to the same environment?  This is what is wrong. The only way to cure a drug addict is <Col N="1474" /> to get him out of the environment and get him rehabilitated.  For that, therapeutic beds are needed and they should have at least six such beds down there. We need hospitals to get these people away from the drug environment.  The Minister knows this is how the problem must be approached and this must be done before the problem gets too big.  As it is, it is escalating.  I am being constructive in telling the Minister what we need.  The facilities at Jervis Street are not good enough having regard to the magnitude of the problem.</P>
    <P>I earnestly appeal to the Minister to look into this and see what we can do about providing therapeutic beds and also how we can rehabilitate these people by means of hostels.  We may have to look to voluntary sources for this but it must be done and very soon. The drug addicts are coming out worse than ever, going back to the same environment and spreading drug abuse like an infectious disease.  If it were an infectious disease we would get it under control, but it is the very same and we are not getting it under control. Unfortunately it is on the increase.  The only way to tackle the drug problem is by proper education.  This is the preventive measure.  The treatment is therapeutic beds attached to the clinics and the third requirement is hostels for the people we are trying to rehabilitate.</P>
    <P>Alcoholism is a big problem which we are all trying to hide.  People are stunned when they are told they are alcoholics.  Alcoholism is the greatest curse in this country.  We are not facing up to the problem nor providing the treatment.  Doctors are not helping. Doctors do not want to treat alcoholics. I might as well be honest.  This is my impression.  It is time-consuming, frustrating and it calls for tremendous patience and understanding.  It is a family problem.  It calls for a joint effort of social worker and doctor. Perhaps the Minister would talk to our profession about this, talk to the medical schools, see how we could adjust our curriculum.  Alcoholism is the curse of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I glanced at the leaflet the other day. It is not adequate.  There is much left out of it.  It does not cover the full range of alcoholics.  It does not mention <Col N="1475" /> the alcoholic who needs a drink to get through the day.  There are many who cannot get through the day without a drink.  I do not know who prepared the leaflet but I think it was hastily prepared and it is not good enough.  I agree with the Minister that it is a step forward.  It has made people think.  We should have open discussion. Community associations should be encouraged to have seminars on alcoholism. Families have been almost destroyed by this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is included with drugs now in the new seminars for teachers and youth organisations.  A lot more has to be done about it.  First of all, we must take it out from under the carpet.  It will take at least 12 months to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, and I know what the Minister is trying to do.  I am not condemning him at all.  Far be it from me to condemn the Minister.  He knows it is a worse problem than drug abuse, but what is wrong is that we accept it as a social norm.  Nobody wants to talk about alcoholism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any way in which we could have treatment of the alcoholic in hospital? The cost in one Dublin hospital is much higher to the alcoholic than to the psychiatric patient.  Even the doctors and the hospital forget that it is a disease and they push up the price because he is an alcoholic.  That is bad.  The Minister should look into that and enlighten the doctors of the fact that it is a disease and that its treatment should not cost more.  The alcoholic patient is occupying a bed the same as any other patient.  He is as much in need of treatment.  I deplore this approach by doctors who are experienced in the treatment of alcoholism. I found a reluctance on the part of hospitals to admit alcoholics.  The Minister might have a talk with them about this.  The Minister is correct in saying we must take this from under the carpet and he is correct in saying it is a worse problem than drug abuse.  In a year's time, the Minister will probably be in a position to tell us how bad the problem is and then we will be really surprised.  I could hazard a guess <Col N="1476" /> as to the incidence, which would not be far from the actual figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The nearest I can get to it is that one out of every 33 consumers of alcoholic liquor has a serious drinking problem.  That is the nearest I can get and, God knows, that is bad enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would put the figure at one in six.  Watch what I say. The incidence among females is increasing and I am not saying anything new when I refer to the supermarkets and the vodka.  There is nothing worse than a female alcoholic.  Such a person is a very difficult patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The position about alcoholism in this country is very frightening.  I will probably incur the wrath of all Deputies if I say that we could do without our bars here.</P>
      <P>With regard to the choice of doctor scheme, a number of doctors have been precluded from entry.  That is a little unfair.</P>
      <P>It is time that the Minister, by regulation, implemented section 69 of the Health Act in relation to the disability allowance.  Under this section only the person's income is taken into account, not that of his children.  Again, the Minister comes up against a problem and I am sympathetic because I am aware of the problem.  Disabled persons have to depend on the charity of their relatives.  To a disabled person an independent income, no matter how small, is important.  There should not be a means test.  The Minister is a humane person.  I would ask him to implement section 69 in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perfectly right.  All the sections in the Health Act involving extensions of monetary assistance have been put into operation, save that one.  That is the last one that we have to do and I could not afford to do it this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to make the other section of our society pay a little more.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will heed what I said about family planning and our contraception Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything that I suggest involves more money.  I have already brought up the point about old age pensioners who are medical card holders.  The Minister should clarify this matter. The medical cards can be torn up when these people go into hospital for treatment.  Their pension book is taken from them. We are discriminating against this section of our community. I do not think we have a right to do that.  I do not understand why these persons should be classified differently from others.  A person who is 73 years of age, who has a medical card and who becomes ill, does not get free medical treatment.  At 37 years of age a man with a medical card will get free medical treatment.  That is illogical.  I want to see that these old age pensioners get their rights.  It is a question of rights.  I do not think it should be left to a public servant to decide this matter.  We have to accept the fact that these persons must have the right to free medical service because they are holders of medical cards, irrespective of age.  Neither the Minister nor the Department has any right to discriminate against this section of our community.  I want the Minister to have the courage to stand up and answer me on that matter. What are we going to do about these people?  I have fought time and time again for these people because they are being deprived of their basic rights.  Otherwise, you can take the medical card from them and tell them that they are not entitled to a medical card.  We had better make up our mind that if they are given a medical card they must be provided with the facilities the medical card entitles them to.  At 37 years of age they get it; at 73 years of age, they do not.  There is something radically wrong with that system.  It will have to be challenged, <Col N="1478" /> unless the Minister now has the courage to say, yes, they are entitled to it.  He and I and everyone else know that they are entitled to it but it is not being provided.  This is not right, as the Minister knows.  It is morally wrong to deprive these people of this service.</P>
    <P>A public servant has not the right to say for six weeks that they are only sick because they are 73 and after six weeks that the pension book will be taken from them, although they may be receiving treatment for a heart ailment or surgical treatment or may have suffered a stroke that involves medical treatment.  The medical treatment must be defined.  I am not dealing with the case of persons who are receiving institutional care.  I am talking about medical treatment.  We must distinguish between the two.</P>
    <P>I have had a resolution passed at the Eastern Health Board about this. I am wondering is it being implemented since I had it passed, despite the opposition from the chief executive officer, Mr. O'Keeffe, who has no right whatsoever to do it.  I think he exceeded his authority in doing this and I denounce him for it.</P>

I do not care how it will be done but it will be done.  The Minister has no right to do this.  I tell the Minister frankly that I will have the case challenged. That is an interesting point for the Minister.  I threatened this before with the health board when they would not dispense private doctors' prescriptions for medical card patients.  I told them I would challenge it in the court and I will challenge this in the court and we will see whether the Minister is right or wrong.  These people have a right as holders of medical cards.  I will challenge it in the court.  There is an interesting case.  It will be a case against the Minister for Health.  The Minister has admitted that he is not going to change.

That is telling the Minister straight.  I would like to refer to the question of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  I should like to make my views on this known.  Voluntary hospitals must accept recommendations about appointments that come from <Col N="1481" /> Comhairle na nOspidéal.  The Minister knows my views on this.  I have explained them before.  If managers of voluntary hospitals will not accept the recommendations I say they are not entitled to the grants to cover their capital deficits.  I do not think that anyone has the right to decide that the appointments suggested or approved by Comhairle na nOspidéal will not be acceptable to them, or that they have the right to decide.  We will have to change.  When we get a change of government we will have to look at the question of the voluntary hospitals.  The Minister may not agree with me.  I will be anxious to examine this question.  I would hope to hear from our new archbishop on this point.  I have a feeling that he will have an enlightened approach to this.  I am anxiously awaiting the next annual general meeting which he attends in one of the hospitals of which he is manager.</P>
      <P>The Minister in a statement last September did not assert himself sufficiently. He has not asserted the power or the function of Comhairle na nOspidéal sufficiently. I do not think the Minister should bend over backwards for the voluntary hospitals.  On the question of family planning, if it is being taught in the medical schools there is a right to teach it in the hospitals.</P>
      <P>I want to mention the measles vaccine.  Too many complications follow measles.  We should avail of this vaccine which is so successful.  We should make it available to those most at risk&mdash;children under one and two years of age.  We should carry out a national programme with this vaccine. Now is the time to do something about it.  I welcome the programme of vaccination in connection with German measles.  A few lives have been lost every year as a result of measles and the horrible complications which follow this disease.  The question of vaccination should be carefully examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I spoke about volunteers in hospitals.  The Minister has spoken about the useful role which citizens could play in society.  I agree with this. Many people have time on their hands and they would like to be gainfully employed helping their fellowmen.  This <Col N="1482" /> can be done best in hospitals.  Hospitals should appoint organisers and encourage the public to help.  This could be done in mental hospitals.  It is being done in Britain with great success.  The Minister should consider sending a circular to the hospitals about this matter.  People could do more than visit the sick.  They could carry out duties as well as read, write, help with beds, <i>et cetera</i>.  Such work could give people a great awareness of the problems in their midst.  Such a scheme could be organised with a little help from the Department.  A pilot scheme could be experimented with in certain hospitals in Dublin.  It would be an eye-opener for people to visit St. Ita's.  This plan should be seriously considered.  The Minister might look at this point.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Waters Preservation Bill, 1972: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill which has been before the House for some hours now, an effort has been made by Deputy Belton and the Fine Gael Deputies associated with him to direct public attention, if direction is needed, to a problem which is now regarded as a very serious one.  There has been growing concern in recent years over the gradual and apparently inevitable destruction of the natural amenities of our country.  This growing awareness of what is happening is probably in accord with a consciousness which also exists in many other countries.  It is timely that we should express concern now because we still have time to avoid many of the consequences that pollution has brought to the Continent and other parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pollution is a term which can have many connotations.  When we speak of conservation as an antedote to pollution we ought to mean the keeping of our land, air, water and our wild life in a state of preservation.  This Bill does not seek to deal with the general <Col N="1483" /> problem of pollution or generally to demand conservation.  It deals with a limited area of water pollution.  In that respect the point has already been made, and it is no harm to make it again, that putting various polluting materials into water has been recognised as a social wrong for many years. It first became a matter for legislation when what was being done in the way of pollution interfered with the private fishing rights which flourished so extensively at the end of the last century. There have also been instances in our internal administration and our legislation where the general social harm being done by pollution has been recognised.</P>
    <P>Our trouble in relation to the present state of the law and our present administrative code is that there are too many bodies that have a limited responsibility in this respect.  The various boards of conservators have a responsibility in relation to rivers and lakes within their districts.  Local authorities also have responsibility. There are any number of authorities that have some responsibility for certain parts of the fresh waters within our territory.  That certainly has not meant a move towards uniform control or the bringing about of any uniform policy to deal with pollution.  In our statute law and in the regulations which apply there is a tremendous scattering of statutory provisions and a general confusion as to what the law is or ought to be.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is nothing to prevent a local authority polluting a lake which it controls and owns by direct sewage outflow into that lake. Indeed, many local authorities have purchased rights to do that in many of the small lakes and water areas throughout the country.  That is apparently regarded as a tolerable thing to do if private rights are not interfered with.  Of course, that kind of disposal of town or urban sewage is in fact the destruction of an amenity which exists in the local authority area even if private rights are not being interfered with.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill is to <Col N="1484" /> direct attention to this problem, but generally speaking the purpose of the Bill is to start a thinking in this House which will lead to some national policy with regard to the preservation of unpolluted water, both fresh water and in the seas contiguous to our country. I believe this is essential because, if we permit the situation to be as it has been, not only will we gradually destroy the natural amenities available to our own community, but it will have a very drastic effect on this country in regard to its tourist attractions.  We will certainly affect the health and well-being of our own people.</P>
    <P>We suggest that this problem is serious, that it has grown in seriousness in recent years and that it is urgent now that some action be taken.  This Bill proposes that there shall be, in accordance with its terms, responsibility placed on one single authority, the Minister for Local Government. He will have the responsibility of seeing, as a long-term objective, that our inland waters, and the seas that wash our shores, will have a standard of purity which he, after advice and having regard to local circumstances, will declare.  It is clear that there must be a standard.  Reference has been made to the Royal Commission standards at the end of the last century.  We have had a situation over the years in which those standards were observed in relation to moving waters.  I just cannot recall whether Royal Commission standards dealt with lakes and still waters, but certainly we have the problem of polluted rivers and polluted lakes, and we ought to be in a position to declare in relation to any particular group of waters in any country what a proper standard should be.</P>
    <P>Presumably such a standard would have regard to the degree of use being made of the waters which cannot be avoided and which may be in part traditional, and maybe in relation to certain waters, a standard lower than in other parts of the country might be declared and adopted.  Certainly if this approach commends itself to the House I would hope that in the areas in the country&mdash;thank goodness they are still many and diverse&mdash;in which pollution <Col N="1485" /> has not come about, the standard of purity declared for those waters would be as high as possible.</P>
    <P>The idea, in any event, is that the Minister would have the responsibility to declare a standard or standards of purity, and that, having declared a standard of purity for the different waters that we control, he and his Department would under, presumably, a chain of command, see that this standard is achieved or preserved.  If the particular waters have a degree of pollution which is higher than the standard declared by the Minister, then that is a situation which requires remedial action.  It will have to be observed if the Minister merely declares an existing standard of purity in any waters to be tolerable.</P>
    <P>The point is that under this proposal there will emanate an active policy from the Minister's Department in relation to the different counties, regions and local authority areas throughout the country in order to ensure that this problem is contained, dealt with and solved.  These proposals should commend themselves to Deputies on all sides of the House.  No matter what constituency we represent, each one of us, unfortunately, hears from time to time of cases of pollution, destruction of fish life, the disappearance of local amenities, all these things which makes one sad for our country and for the environment in which we live.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance that this kind of problem should be approached with goodwill and tolerance by Deputies on all sides of the House.  I should not like to feel that the Minister or any Deputies who normally support the Minister in this House would become complacent in relation to the powers of the legal provisions which are there now.  Certainly any expression of complacency would be utterly unjustified.</P>
    <P>I can well understand the Minister or other Deputies saying: &ldquo;The proposal in this Bill is not sound, is imperfect or has a whole lot of loopholes in it.&rdquo; This Bill is merely offered as the collective work of a number of Deputies from this side of the House.  We do not for a moment suggest that it is the only way to deal with this common <Col N="1486" /> problem.  However, I would hope, in any event, that the existence of the problem would be recognised by all Deputies and that the need for action, for reform in our law, for the declaration of some kind of policy, the development of appropriate machinery, would be accepted, and that, if it is accepted, if this measure does not commend itself, some alternative proposal will come before us.</P>
    <P>We shall be judged in our time not merely by the manner in which we face up to the social problems of our day, to the economic or political problems which face us, but also by the manner in which we have sought to preserve the environment and our particular surroundings. It would be a desperate and a very sad thing if by inaction, lethargy, complacency or whatever it may be, we destroyed for those to come after us the amenities which are found so generously in this country. That is the purpose of the Bill.  I hope that the debate which we have had up to this, which has been a good debate conducted on a very high level, will continue and that from the introduction of this Bill and the debate upon its proposals we shall have evidence that we are taking steps towards dealing with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with many of the comments that have already been made in relation to the desirability of indicating certain standards so that the position in regard to pollution will not deteriorate.  The pollution situation at the moment is a very grave one, one that possibly has been neglected over a long number of years, notwithstanding the fact that the Minister and his Department have from time to time drawn attention to the matter.</P>
      <P>The problems of pollution are many and varied.  Examining them on a local or national basis provides much food for thought.  As Deputy O'Higgins and other Deputies have said, it is essential to indicate standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we examine the many forms of pollution occuring throughout the country we find that nearly all of them are being tackled in different ways in other countries with success.  Other countries have succeeded in salvaging <Col N="1487" /> for use as fertilisers and otherwise a certain amount of sewage.  They have built plants for the treatment of sewage and in that way have converted some of it to beneficial use in their respective economies.  We should follow their example; we should build similar plants for the treatment of sewage.  In that way not only would we be relieving people's distress from pollution but we would be creating materials for use in other spheres.  While referring to sewage disposal, surely there must be other outlets than the sea for it.  Discharging raw sewage into the sea causes great distress to people living nearby.</P>
    <P>There are many tip-heads to be seen throughout the country and I feel sure that in the same way as with sewage the materials in these tips could be converted for use in industry.  We have only to think back to the last war to appreciate the various uses these materials could be put to.  The same is true of other countries.  This would in turn benefit the economy because it would mean fewer imports of iron and other such materials.  These tip-heads contain a lot of scrap iron which could easily be converted into ingots for use in industry.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies referred to particular cases of pollution.  I represent Dublin south-west through which the River Camac flows.  It is an open sewer where it flows through Inchicore and Old Kilmainham and it causes great distress to people living beside it.  Much of the pollution comes from industrial waste and I am afraid we must prescribe new standards in this respect.  In the case of the Camac the pollution comes from the paper mills, the owners of which have made endeavours to reduce this pollution.  There is no fish life to be noticed in the stretch of the river between the paper mills and the Liffey. The people have called for it to be culverted but this apparently is too costly and it is to be left as it is.  This river has caused a lot of sickness in the area.  Most of the houses adjacent to its banks have been demolished and no others are to be built to replace them, which is an indication of the distress caused there by pollution.  This river <Col N="1488" /> is the most polluted in the country and I ask the Minister to have the case examined.  I have spoken about it here and elsewhere on many occasions.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill or other Bills which will be introduced dealing with pollution will help to relieve the distress of people living near stretches of polluted water.  I can speak with authority of the Camac which is in my constituency.  The water has been tested on many occasions.  I suggest that the industries responsible should be forced to pay more attention to the health of the people who have to live on the banks of such rivers.</P>
    <P>The river Camac is heavily polluted and this applies to other rivers also. When the public know that a river is polluted and that there is no fish life in it they tend to increase the amount of waste matter that they dump in the river.  I have sympathy with the other speakers who spoke about the problems in their areas.  For a number of years I lived near the Camac river.  One would not need a map to find the river; all that was needed was a good sense of smell.  The problem is particularly grave during the summer months.  The Camac pollutes the river Liffey as it flows from Kingsbridge to the centre of the city.  I hope that new industries will not be allowed to discharge their waste into the river.  I know that when planning applications are made there are restrictions laid down with regard to pollution and this is to be welcomed. In the case of established industries which pollute our rivers, I hope some effort will be made to ensure that this pollution is eliminated as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Some industries think that they can discharge all kinds of effluent into our rivers.  In some cases they construct drains that carry some of the waste; this waste is filtered into lands that are not the property of the firm concerned and in this way damage is caused to such property.  These drains are discovered by local authorities when they undertake roadworks.  Frequently it may be years after the drains have been constructed and considerable damage is caused.</P>
    <P>In my area we have a problem with regard to the dumping of old cars.  Frequently <Col N="1489" /> they are left for the local authorities to take away to a tiphead. Most of these cars are wrecks and frequently children are injured when they play in them.  I would suggest that an initial charge should be placed on the car when it is purchased and this would not be returned until the car is disposed of finally.  The local authority or the Government would have the money necessary to dispose of the car.  This would ensure that some responsibility could be attached to someone.  This system is used in other countries and I understand it works successfully.  The problem is greater in the cities than in country areas and I would ask the Minister to consider the suggestion I have made.</P>
    <P>At the moment the practice is to leave the old car in an area far from the owner's home and it is difficult to trace him.  In some cases he can be traced by checking on the number plates or the chassis numbers but sometimes the numbers are removed. There must be some way round the present problem.  If a person leaves his car in a built-up area he causes problems for the residents.  The Garda are unable to take action until they are satisfied that there is no owner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Eventually these cars are dumped in streams and in rivers. This problem must be tackled.  The disposal of industrial waste is a problem. Many local authorities have failed to make provision for the disposal of such waste.  In Dublin city and county the local authorities have been more than cautious in making available areas where industrial waste can be disposed of.  On the south side of the city it is a major problem.  On one occasion there was leakage from an oil tanker and a leakage of 5,000 gallons caused a considerable amount of trouble.  Unless we can find an efficient way to dispose of industrial waste it will be dumped in rivers and lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years industrial waste in Dublin south-west and Dublin south had to be dumped in the north of the city.  Industrialists tend to dump <Col N="1490" /> this waste at the most convenient point and the inevitable result is that the river or stream nearby is polluted or damage is caused to another person's property.  The dumping of industrial waste and the availability of sites are major problems in our city.  When industrial waste is dumped into streams, seepage containing chemicals has found its way on to the roadways and damage has been caused to clothing. In addition, it has been injurious to young children who have met with accidents as a result of this seepage.</P>
    <P>While there are responsible people in the waste disposal business operating to very high standards, there are others whose standards are not so high and who are not very concerned where waste is dumped provided they get it away from the industrial area concerned. We know that many drums of industrial waste containing large amounts of acid have been found adjacent to industrial estates in Dublin south-west in recent times and have been allowed to go into the nearest stream which, in fact, was the Camac. It could happen with any stream in any place.</P>
    <P>Another source of pollution of rivers and lakes in the area arises from the dumping of plastic containers which float on the surface and tend to become entangled in bushes and cause unsightly obstructions.  It is very important to keep the waterways clear and it is a necessity that cannot be overlooked. In some cases the local authorities are to some extent responsible for some of the waste disposal problems.  Lack of sewage facilities is a particular problem in my area.  Sufficient sewerage facilities were not available for many years to meet development requirements.  Sewerage development such as the Grand Canal scheme is essential.  This scheme was on the books for a number of years but it was impeded by political pressures and this has caused problems.  Twelve or 15 years ago we in Dublin Corporation thought that the Grand Canal scheme would be under way in a year or two but we now find that no start has yet been made on the scheme.  This is the type of scheme that can relieve many of the pressures from industry, housing, small factories and workshops from <Col N="1491" /> which waste is now finding its way into the cesspools we see studded throughout the south side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>On one occasion during a corporation survey of an open space in Inchicore &mdash; Grattan Crescent &mdash; it was found that there were many unauthorised drains there.  Apparently the corporation would have to take responsibility or else find the source, which could be quite a distance away.  If they failed to locate the source, apparently they would have to take in charge and service these drains if this development was to take place at Inchicore.  If the Grand Canal scheme had been got under way the number of people tending to use the Camac and such other outlets would be reduced.  For that reason it is essential that in tackling the problem in regard to rivers, lakes and streams we should also tackle the bigger problem of defects in the sewerage system.  That problem arises in this city.  I am glad that we have on one side the Dodder Valley scheme which will relieve many of the pressures and problems that would develop if the scheme had not been provided.  The longer the Grand Canal scheme is put in abeyance the greater the temptation to industrialists, factory owners, backlane workshops and private houses with possibly unauthorised extensions to find their own way of disposing of their waste.  At present, the sewer, being overloaded, cannot take any more.</P>
    <P>The Camac and other rivers in a similar condition tend to become rat-infested and so create further problems. Highly-polluted rivers are always rat-infested despite the efforts of local authorities through organisations for elimination of these pests.  Where there is heavy pollution you always have this additional problem which is a major one and one which will have to be taken into account by whatever standards are introduced at any stage.</P>
    <P>While the Bill does not meet all requirements, it goes some of the way and has shown the necessity for clear thinking on pollution.  Much has been said and done in regard to pollution in the past by various Ministers.  Substantial efforts have been made to <Col N="1492" /> eliminate the problem or reduce it to some extent but more deliberate action must be taken now to ensure that we rid ourselves of pollution.</P>
    <P>We also know that another factor of pollution is the detergents pumped into open streets.  Some pools near the city in which people bathed in summer were found to contain chemicals, detergents of some kind or other which caused grievous injury.  To a great extent, the problem boils down to having a proper sewerage system in the first instance.  The problem is a very large one covering a variety of fields and needs to be examined in a highly technical, effective and efficient way if we are to ensure its elimination.  The Bill has spotlighted the problem and may give many people food for thought.  We should all ensure that we do our own part by advising or assisting local authorities and communities in their anti-pollution efforts.  Public representatives have a particular role to play, apart from whatever role the Department may play or any measures the Government may introduce to eliminate pollution.</P>
    <P>We should encourage the various groups and in particular tenants organisations to play their part in ensuring that residents do not contribute to the problem of pollution.  A very special effort must be made to ensure that industrialists meet their responsibilities in this regard.  I have no wish to see any industrialist going out of business because of failure to meet his responsibilities but, at the same time, no lame excuse should be accepted from any industrialist who is found to be responsible for the creation of pollution.  Adequate information and technical know-how is available to anyone who seeks it.  I hope that whatever legislation is enacted will be effective in preserving the rivers and lakes so that instead of being the cesspools that some of them now are, they will be a joy to future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we must be grateful to the Minister for allowing this Bill to be introduced and discussed but so far both he and his Parliamentary Secretary have maintained a remarkable silence as to <Col N="1493" /> whether the Bill is to be accepted.  The Parliamentary Secretary did interject the other day to say that the Planning Act was sufficient to ensure that our waters would not be polluted.  He said that when planning permission was being given the applicant was required to give a guarantee to the planning authority that he would not cause the polluting of water.  That is not preventive legislation.  There is no preventive legislation here in respect of the pollution of our waterways.</P>
      <P>In relation to other countries we are in an advantageous position here in that our rivers flow through no other countries, such as happens in Europe when rivers flow through four or five different countries so that pollution can come downstream from one country to another.  The fact that we only began to industrialise recently does not mean necessarily that our rivers will not be polluted by industrial waste.  The House may be interested to hear the figures for the use of water.  Of the amount of water we use, 10 per cent is for domestic use, 55 per cent is used for agriculture and 35 per cent for industry.  It is interesting to note also that of the world water supply &mdash; included in this are the lakes, rivers, seas and oceans&mdash; only 2 per cent is fresh water and of that 2 per cent the great proportion is under the ice caps at the North and South Poles.  Therefore, anyone who believes that there is an unlimited supply of fresh water in this world will have to start thinking again.  Some hydrologists have stated that the greatest problem facing the world today is the impurity of water.  This can be borne out largely by the facts in other countries and I might place a few of these facts on record here for the benefit of the Minister and his advisers in helping them in their decision to accept this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United States is a highly industrialised country.  The situation there now in respect of fresh water supplies is so bad that they are dependent largely on the desalinization of sea water.  One of the greatest water experts in the world has stated that all the impurities that go into rivers and lakes find their way ultimately into the sea.  Therefore, while the answer to the problem of procuring pure water for <Col N="1494" /> domestic and other purposes might seem to be the continued desalinization of sea water, it must be remembered that the seas are being polluted also. There is one important fact to be borne in mind in relation to lakes and that is that if pollution sinks to the bottom it takes a very long time to eliminate it.  The process of purifying the waters is intensive, expensive and totally destructive to marine life.  Running waters have the capacity to re-oxygenate themselves but lakes do not have that capacity.  If we want an example of that we could take practically all the lakes in Europe.  These are impure at the moment and practically all of them are devoid of vegetable or fish life in any form.  That very big lake which touches Switzerland, Germany and France, Lake Constance, is completely polluted and has no life of any sort but an extremely expensive process of cleaning it has commenced.</P>
    <P>In the early part of this century there was a salmon conservancy board for the purpose of protecting the salmon fisheries of the Rhine but there is nothing left in the Rhine now except a few eels.  This river would be polluted largely by industrial waste.  It has been designated as the sewer of Europe.  I am putting forward these facts to indicate that we are in the position yet of being able to save what fresh waters we have but if we do not take action to do this we will find ourselves in the same position as those other countries and our fisheries will be affected seriously by this pollution.</P>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago there was an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on Lough Sheelin.  This is one of the lakes on which fishery conservation boards have spent a lot of money.  The lake is the best trout fishing one in the country and it also carries a lot of coarse fish.  Therefore, it is one of our great tourist amenities for fishermen. However, the lake is being polluted by pig slurry and the trouble is that that is the sort of pollution that sinks to the bottom of the lake and will ultimately totally destroy marine life there.  I understand that about 10,000 dead trout have been seen floating on the lake recently.  I do not know how much <Col N="1495" /> it would cost to restore the lake to its normal condition.  The pollution of this lake should serve as a warning to the Department of Local Government and should make them realise the necessity for effective legislation.  A lot of money has been spent on Lough Sheelin as a tourist amenity.</P>
    <P>I am told that the early sign of the pollution of a lake is the appearance of algae in large quantities.  About two years ago I went to a lake to fish for pike and to my horror I discovered that it was covered entirely with algae. I have to tell the Chair that I fished there all day but caught nothing.  Probably there was nothing left for me to catch.  Algae appears at certain times of the year in certain lakes.  In small quantities it is a useful fish feed but its appearance in large quantities indicates a dying lake.</P>
    <P>In the majority of our urban areas there has been a reliance on rivers for the disposal of sewage.  I was in south Tipperary about a year ago and I noticed there that the Suir, which was quite a famous trout lake at one stage, is polluted but has not reached the point of total pollution.  On making inquiries locally I was given to understand that some sort of treatment disposal works were being brought into effect there.  Down through the years sewage from Clonmel has gone directly into the river.  One might say that in practically every town the nearest waterways have been utilised for the disposal of sewage.  Unless that practice is stopped, the results will be disastrous.  Of course we get plenty of rain here but we have not a tremendous quantity of water at our disposal. In Gorey there is a leather factory and for years the waste from that factory was directed into a small river.  The farmers of the area protested against this but they had to endure the situation for years.  Ultimately, about 12 cattle belonging to one farmer were poisoned and the man got anthrax.  It was then that the medical authorities came into the picture with whatever powers they had at their disposal.  The result was that the factory piped whatever waste they had into the sea and a treatment plant was installed.  This involved <Col N="1496" /> piping it for four or five miles but it meant that the farmers were able to use the water of the river without any fear.  Legislation is needed that will empower the Minister to ensure that no untreated sewage is allowed flow into any river.  There are many places in this country where treatment works are required.</P>
    <P>To give some idea of what sewage disposal means when it is on a large scale I might refer to the River Seine which provides water for two million people in Paris.  Above the city there are only 15 noxious germs per cubic centimetre.  That would not poison anybody, but below Paris there are 1½ million noxious germs per cubic centimetre. This means that the water in that part of the river is a sewer.  It may take us a long time to reach that unhappy situation but it would be possible for us at the moment to resolve the question at very little expense.  First, legislative powers should be given to the Minister to enable him to ensure that every area that is discharging waste has treatment works.</P>
    <P>Coastal towns may argue that, because they are coastal, the tide takes the discharge out to sea.  That is not the answer.  The sea can take a certain amount of waste, but it cannot go on taking waste indefinitely. There are too many problems involved.  There is an agreement under which ships are not supposed to dump noxious waste, such as oil, within a certain distance of the shore.  There are nations which are not signatories to this agreement and so the agreement cannot be made fully operative.</P>
    <P>One of the causes of pollution is silage.  Silage is a comparatively new development here.  The effluent from silage can be a serious source of pollution and legislation will be required to prevent this pollution.  Pig slurry is another pollutant.  In the Border counties pig production is an important industry.  In that area, too, there are important waterways and lakes.  Now one cannot expect one man to take steps to ensure that everything is perfect while his neighbours do nothing at all.  It comes back then to legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> Deputy Belton's Bill emphasises that we recognise there is a pollution problem. Everybody must accept that there is such a problem.  The Bill will give the Minister power to introduce the necessary legislation and, in that legislation, he will have public support because the vast majority of our people are seriously concerned about pollution. I cannot understand why the Tourist Board have not made some move in this matter long ago.  They must know that we are facing a deteriorating situation.  From the health point of view pollution is very serious. Some 30 or 40 years ago someone put a dead donkey into a stream close to a school.  This was fairly near where I lived at the time.  I think 12 boys died of typhoid fever.  Of course they did not have the treatment 30 years ago to deal with typhoid.  This shows the extreme danger of polluted water.  The donkey rotted and the stream flowed towards a well on which the school was dependent for water.  Apart from the 12 who died quite a number of boys went down with typhoid fever and the school had to be closed for three or four months.  That was long before the Minister became Minister for Local Government. In fact I think it was before he was born.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the responsibility he carries in this matter. His predecessor, Mr. Kevin Boland, was questioned many times on this matter.  His reply always was that there was plenty of legislation to deal with the matter.  Nobody has power except the medical officers of health and all they can do is to try to catch an individual and bring him to justice. That is no use.  When that happens the individual says: &ldquo;I was brought to justice.  Everybody else is doing the same thing and they are not brought to justice.&rdquo;  This must be an overall, national business.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister accepting this Bill but I will not be surprised if he does not because there seems to be a theory in this House that if the Government accept something brought in by the Opposition they are lowering their prestige.  I hasten to assure them that their prestige is at a level now at which I think it will stay <Col N="1498" /> for some time.  I do not think it will go up and I do not think this will bring it down any more.  I ask the Minister to accept this Bill, but if he is not going to accept it I would ask him to appoint a water board straight away and to appoint to that water board not a lot of political hacks but people who know something about the question, people who have studied it and who are experts on it.  There should be somebody on it with an extensive knowledge of bacteriology and also somebody dealing largely with public health and water supply.  There should also be people from the conservation board, people associated with fisheries and with tourism.  A little help might even be got from Bord Fáilte if they were awakened to their responsibilities in relation to fishing and tourism.</P>
    <P>Within a reasonable time a water board should be able to give the Minister a report on what would be necessary and I am sure the first suggestion they would make would be that the Minister should give them legislation because they would be unable to do anything without legislation.  If we do not have legislation in the lifetime of this Dáil we will face a crisis in and around the big centres.  If the Liffey was investigated I do not suppose it would come up to the high standard of the Seine for bugs, but it would probably be found that there were several hundred thousands of bugs to the cubic centimetre.  I would not like to drink the Liffey water.  Sometimes I do not like to be too near the Liffey because I get a fairly strong &ldquo;sniff&rdquo; from it.  I certainly would not like to bathe in it.  In summer I see quite a number of young fellows bathing near the Custom House.  I think they are taking a considerable risk.  If you do not get typhoid fever from bathing in polluted water you can get a urinary infection, a bacteriological or bacillus coli infection of the urine which may take years and years to cure.  In fact, it is one of these things that is more or less incurable and can only be kept down by specific treatment.</P>
    <P>These are the problems the Minister should assess.  He should forget the political side of it.  Maybe when he goes back to his constituency he will <Col N="1499" /> be told that he accepted a Fine Gael Bill.  That is nonsense.  We need to grow up politically in this country.  We need to work, at times anyway, in this House for the benefit of the people as a whole.  This is a vital matter.</P>
    <P>I was reading a Council of Europe document, which I meant to bring in with me, on the policy for environment. Some of the experts there say that the degree of pollution that has been reached in Europe and in the United States is even more serious to the life of the people than the risk of a major war.  The British have acknowledged this problem.  They have been dealing with it.  They have purified their waters.  They have organised their industry and they have legislation to control pollution there.  Although they have more big factories, more chemical works and things like oxides and lead that pollute waters, they have managed to keep their waters pure.  I would strongly advise the Minister to take the advice of British experts on this because they have had the problem on their doorstep and they have solved it. The only other people in Europe who seem to have got under the job are the Swedes.  They have made a pretty useful attack on pollution.  The difficulty of central Europe is that the Rhine and the Rhone flow through practically all the countries there and it is the problem of several countries.  There is an attempt on the part of the EEC to set up a united conservation board to try to solve the problem.  The long suffering Dutch will then perhaps come into their own because all the pollution comes right down to them and they cannot discharge anything into the river because it is overpolluted already.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept this legislation because if legislation is not passed in the lifetime of this Dáil it will have to come at a future date and then it will require a big budget.  A comparatively small budget would settle it now.  I recommend the Bill to the Minister with all the force at my command.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde has ranged fairly widely.  He talked of <Col N="1500" /> Europe and the fact that the major rivers there are in danger.  In the course of the discussion on this Bill I was glad to see that the Minister has shown an active interest in this matter and that a working group are studying the position at present.  This group have the advantage of having material from a survey available to make the public aware of the danger of increasing pollution not only of water but of air.  This interdepartmental working group will, I suggest, be in a position to give a lead not merely to this House but to local authorities who carry a great share of the responsibility for the prevention of pollution.</P>
      <P>The pollution of water is a fact of life at present.  It has many causes.  It has been said here that material advance, the spread of industry, for example, modern methods of farming, factory farming, in particular, the use of nitrogenous fertilisers, and so on, have all contributed to this problem. If this Bill did no more than highlight and emphasise this problem of pollution, it would be worthwhile.</P>
      <P>I note from the Minister's statement that the working party in relation to water pollution are studying the problem of the degree of pollution in receiving lakes.  Pollution from effluent or sewage or from any other cause eventually finds its way to a drain leading to a river, leading to a lake.  I am glad that the point is made as to whether or not it is advisable to temper the effluent, discover how much the receiving lake will bear and the best methods of treating effluent so as to reduce the risk of pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who were brought up in the country know of the many fine lakes in our countryside which are polluted. This is a sad fact.  Last year we read of a well-known fishing centre where fish life and marine life in general was destroyed and no one had even suspected that pollution would occur.  There was no apparent reason for the pollution.  Subsequently the causes were discovered.  There was a combination of elements, not merely in relation to industry but also in relation to farming.  Septic tank systems in an open countryside can lead to a <Col N="1501" /> certain degree of pollution.  This is a problem which local authorities will have to deal with later.</P>
    <P>There is laxity in relation to this whole matter and a lack of interest. This is shown by untidiness and the horrible spectacle of dumps.  It has been suggested that mini-dumps may not be primarily responsible for water pollution.  I suggest that mini-dumps can represent a high risk of pollution and that it is very difficult to preserve water in or near mini-dumps.  A start should be made to deal with the highly objectionable practice of dumping thrash along country roads or in <i>culs-de-sac</i>.  What would one think of a neighbour who would deliberately sweep out his house and outbuildings and leave the rubbish at his neighbour's door?  This is, in effect, what happens when persons carry rubbish in cars and vans and surreptitiously dump it in mini-dumps.  Local authorities should take a more direct interest in this matter and see that those who dump rubbish are forced to use the official dump.</P>
    <P>There are many forms of pollution. The motor-car may be said to be a source of pollution.  The factory with a high smoke content may be an agent of air pollution.  The lorry and the tractor are involved in air pollution. In reference to the preservation of water we must also consider preservation of vegetation and we must also have in mind the need to preserve the appearance of the countryside.</P>
    <P>At this stage of our development of industry and intensification of farming methods and the provision of services it would be too bad if there were not an active unit in each Department concerned that would be directly interested in anti-pollution methods.</P>

      <P>I should like to discuss the question of mentally handicapped children and the number of children awaiting admission to institutions or homes.  Mentally handicapped children are a great burden on their parents.  The Minister claims to have done wonders and marvels in regard to mentally handicapped children.  Perhaps he has, but this is no consolation to the parents of a mentally handicapped child who requires constant care.  I wonder if the Minister has seen any of these cases.  The child is constantly banging his head against the wall.  The mother must remain with the child day and night.  She lives in fear that the child may burn or scald himself. This should not be the responsibility of the parent.  The State must accept responsibility for these children. The State cannot ignore its responsibility and say that it is doing all it can.  I say to the Minister the State is not doing enough.</P>
      <P>This matter has been neglected by this Government for too long, on the basis of the same old doctrine preached by the former Minister for Health, MacEntee, that it is not their responsibility</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>He was long enough in this House abusing people.  He can take care of himself.  It is a pity he is not in the House because I would love an opportunity of telling him that he evaded his responsibility as Minister for Health.  He represented a Fianna Fáil Government who have always held that a person's health was his own responsibility.  The Fianna Fáil Government were responsible for the long queues and the long waiting lists for beds in sanatoria, when people were left to die because the Government refused to face facts.  I know this from my own personal, family experience. <Col N="1503" /> This is the doctrine which has been preached by the Government about mentally handicapped children.  The present Minister for Health has said that they are doing their best.  This is not good enough.  The Minister is not getting his priorities right.  He has shown that by speaking about the development of a social service council in this country.  It is hypocrisy.  Before I reported progress the Minister's last statement proved to me that he is nothing more than a hypocrite; he is not sincere.  The Minister is not prepared to help old age pensioners.  I am now going to tell the Minister what I think of him and of his policies and those of his Department.</P>
      <P>We should not have long waiting lists of mentally handicapped children who are absolutely at the mercy of their own parents who have no one to help them, to provide for them or to guide them.  The Minister says that they are doing their best.  A Government who admit to a long waiting list have no constructive policy.  This has gone on too long.  I know of a mother who had been waiting 17 years for her mentally handicapped child to be admitted to an institution.  The child was so badly mentally retarded that the mother could not move out of the house.  There are thousands of cases like that in the country.  The Government refused to accept responsibility for them.  The Government have responsibility for them, unless it is Fianna Fáil policy that there should be euthanasia.  Maybe that would solve all the problems.  These are serious problems in our society today.  The Government are not doing enough about them.  They have depended for too long on voluntary organisations to take care of their problems for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the situation. I am going to see to it that the Minister does a little more work and uses more influence with his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  The Minister must see that we have proper health services. Some grave mistakes have been made by the Department of Health.  We talk about helping the people who are suffering from chronic illness.  The Minister boasts constantly about the provisions being made for these people <Col N="1504" /> and the free drugs and appliances and medical treatment which are being provided. Let us consider the case of people with muscular dystrophy.  They have been left out of the category to be helped.  How many doctors in the Department have heard of this condition? The sufferers from this disease need constant attention.  They need wheelchairs, but they are left on a waiting list because the Department do nothing about them.  The sufferers from this disease have been brought to the notice of the Department but the officials only say: &ldquo;That disease is not on our list.&rdquo;  The Minister might consult a medical textbook about this disease.  The sufferers from it do not live very long.  They may live for 20 or 22 years but they are cripples and they need wheelchairs.  Wheelchairs cost between £50 and £100.</P>
    <P>When we are discussing chronic illness we must consider these people and the necessity of providing them with appliances.  The present means test adds to their difficulties.  The patients are fully dependent on their brothers and sisters.  This is an injustice.  I see glaring injustices and discrimination in the application of our health services. I do not intend to tolerate such injustices any longer.  I will tell the Minister that he must do his job.  I am disgusted about the Minister's pronouncement in regard to old age pensioners.  He has made up his mind that he will not do anything for them.  From now on the Minister will have a hard time with me.</P>
    <P>A parent of a child with muscular dystrophy told me that there are about 2,000 victims in the Republic suffering from this condition.  One parent asked why this disease was excluded from a list of diseases for which aids are available. She was told its omission was &ldquo;just one of those things&rdquo;.  This is a disgraceful attitude to adopt about a serious condition which affects about 2,000 of our people.  I would like the Minister to give us an assurance that these victims, who do not live longer than about 20 years, will be given appliances free of charge.  This condition is at least as important as diabetes.  There is a constant wasting of the whole body.  The patients need wheelchairs.  They are cripples.  We <Col N="1505" /> have no right to discriminate against them.  They are completely helpless and cannot fend for themselves.  I would like to get an assurance, in the reply to this debate, that the Minister is going to do something about these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 2,000 children in the Republic today suffering from this disease.  Would the Minister like me to go into the history of muscular dystrophy?  It has existed for over 100 years but it is new to the Department of Health.  It is a very serious condition.  The onus is on the Department to find out how many sufferers there are from this disease.  I do not want this point to be considered and reviewed at some future date.  I want immediate action on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that he was disappointed because there was a strike by the psychiatric nurses.  He deplored the strike and said that it must have caused acute distress to many of the patients and great anxiety to their relatives. It certainly did.  I am wondering what it must take to bring official action in such a matter.  I wrote about this strike and I emphasised the importance of it.  I stressed in the House that there was a danger of suicide resulting from patients not getting their treatment.  A reliable, authoritative medical journalist reported one case of suicide which resulted from this fact two days after I spoke.  Why was something not done about this?  The blame was placed on the psychiatric nurses but we brought this matter to the Minister as one of urgency.  We tried to warn him about the dangers of it <Col N="1506" /> and he said it was not for him to deal with it.  A Minister for Health must act in a situation like this.  I hope there will not be another strike and that their grievances will be completely resolved.</P>
    <P>Psychiatric nurses are a very important part of our health services.  I would like to see their grievances rectified to their complete satisfaction. We do not appreciate how difficult their work is.  We have to see that their conditions are right.  There is talk about seniority versus merit.  Who is to decide merit?  If some person is due for promotion by virtue of his seniority, but a person has a grudge against him and says that someone else on merit alone should get the promotion, this is a dangerous thing.  If I were working in the service I would not like to see someone chosen ahead of me when I had years of experience &mdash;which is what counts, not necessarily merit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows very well that merit enters into promotions in every other section of the public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was proposed in the agreement that one promotion in two was to be on seniority and one promotion in two was to be on merit, 30 per cent marks to be given for seniority. What could be fairer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should have close consultation with the trade union representatives on this.  They are the people who can best decide and who know the dangers of the other method.  I hope the Minister will have a look at the question of nurses and doctors living in hospitals.  It is not good for nurses to live in.  It alters their approach to medicine and to nursing care.  I would like to see us dispensing with nurses homes.  They should be able to live at home or away from the hospital.  They are much happier and they have a better approach to their work.  I do not see anything wrong with nurses or doctors living away from hospitals.  All sorts of problems <Col N="1507" /> can develop when they live close to the scene.  We should take this into account in any future planning of hospitals.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the question of the State registered nurse and the State enrolled nurse.  Medical and nursing care has reached such a sophisticated state at the present time that we will have to consider the nurse in a new role as assistant to the doctor and she must be fully aware of all the new developments in medicine.  In our policy document I proposed that we should have a college of nursing attached to the university.  The new course for nurses should embrace this.  We may need assistant nurses or State enrolled nurses.  The Irish Nurses Organisation are opposed to this.  This is a reactionary approach.</P>
      <P>There is a great shortage of nurses. State enrolled nurses will not make great inroads on the nursing profession. Laboratory technicians had this problem, but now they have laboratory assistants.  They opposed this originally but now they see that laboratory assistants are needed.  Nurses will have to do the same.  In America, with the shortage of doctors, they have doctors' assistants who give injections and such minor things.  What is wrong with a grade of nurse who may not have her leaving certificate but may have the desire to help the sick, performing some chores in a hospital, doing normal routine work which would leave the nurse free to become so up to date with all the new advances in medicine?  The whole curriculum for nurses will have to change, and there will be a need for assistants to nurses. We need people who will be able to help with geriatric patients, patients who may not necessarily require expert nursing care such as is required in a coronary, intensive-care unit or a brain unit.  Why should a person need a leaving certificate for this?  Why can we not have this grade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would solve many of our problems. Many girls are debarred from taking up nursing here because, due to our present system of compulsory Irish, they have not got their leaving certificate.  They are forced to go to <Col N="1508" /> Britain.  They should be permitted to come back here and take up posts as State enrolled nurses.  There is no danger of our having too many nurses. There will always be a place for the fully qualified State registered nurse. The shortage will get worse because the United States, where nurses receive very high salaries, will always be an attraction.  State enrolled nurses could complement nurses in their work.  State enrolled nurses have done great work in England.  But, when they come home here, they work practically as wards-maids. It is not right to discriminate against them.  I would hope that the Irish Nurses Organisation would see reason on this, and realise they have a role to play.  They could even supervise the training and co-operate in a special course to produce State enrolled nurses.  I feel the Minister would welcome this.  No.  He does not.  He is another reactionary.  Anyway, he will not be that long in office and we shall bring about the changes whether he likes it or not.  It is in the interest of the country and the hospitals.  The medical profession and the patients are for it. Everyone is for it, and I do not think he can hold back the tide, because we need nurses.</P>
    <P>With the ending of the dispensaries, I would hope that the system that operates in chemists' shops, retail pharmacies, will continue under the new scheme.  On more than one occasion I deplored the system that operated in our public dispensaries and dispensary pharmacies.  I thought it was wrong.  We were not saving any money at all, and it was a dangerous system. Retail chemists are the only people who are properly trained to dispense prescriptions accurately.</P>
    <P>A problem arises, however, about Sunday and emergency opening of chemists' shops.  I have heard all sorts of excuses put up by the retail pharmacists about this, for instance, that doctors carry ample supplies in their bags.  This is not good enough.  Retail chemists must provide a proper service to the community.  The community pharmacist is an important person. There should be a night pharmacy in the city.  I have heard pharmacists saying over and over again that there is no need for it.  I am saying there is need <Col N="1509" /> for it and they should promote a proper campaign to tell the people that there is a pharmacy available.</P>
    <P>I know, even from the normal ailments and illnesses of my own children, that on a Thursday all the chemists in the area are closed.  I might phone the chemist at his home, but I feel under an obligation, that I am upsetting him, getting him from his home to go a mile or a mile and a half to his shop. He should not have to do this.  There should be a central pharmacy in the city.  I brought this up on numerous occasions in Dáil questions and it has always been said that there is no need for it.  I do not accept this excuse that doctors always have samples in their bags or that they have what would provide emergency treatment.  Many a person becomes ill at night&mdash;it is not necessarily an emergency illness&mdash;and it is better that he should start off on treatment at night.  A doctor could not be expected to have every sample in his bag.  I should like to see the Minister taking the initiative and consulting the retail chemists on this matter.  They are community pharmacists.  It should not be a nine to five lock-up shop arrangement any more than a doctor can operate that system.  When a doctor goes off duty he has a responsibility to see that there is a doctor on duty in his place.  Illness can happen at any time.  It does not recognise union hours, and because chemists are there to protect illness they should not recognise them either.  I should like the Minister to elaborate on what he said in his speech about medical cards.  He said:</P>
    <P>Each CEO is now in the process of preparing for the area of his board means assessment regulations of a consistent pattern, the hardship clause, of course, being retained.</P>
    <P>Is that just for the area or will it be uniform?  I should like the Minister to clarify that in his reply.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I wish to refer is the hardship clause regarding drugs.  The Minister will agree that if we can keep patients out of hospital we shall save a great deal of money. This is important with the present high costs especially in teaching hospitals. The Minister said it is costing £60 to £70 a week.  It will be difficult for a <Col N="1510" /> patient to accept that out of an ordinary wage he will have to pay for the cost of drugs as well as medical attendance, and, therefore, he will elect to go into hospital.  He will be very annoyed with the doctor who says to him: &ldquo;You are all right.  Stay at home for a week or two, but it will cost you £5 to £10 for drugs.&rdquo;  That patient will say: &ldquo;I am paying 15p per week for hospitalisation.  It will be easier for me to go into hospital and get all my drugs, food and everything else free.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Because many more patients will be pressurising doctors to have them admitted to hospital, we should be much more flexible about this hardship clause.  I am talking about the immediate future.  I know we shall have to have an extension to produce a complete national health service but, in the interim period, if we are going to save money on hospitalisation there must be more flexibility about this hardship clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not fair.  It should be possible to take the income into account and this should not cause any great hardship to the Department. It would be a recognition by the Minister that the cost of drugs is a big problem.  At the moment, it would be much cheaper for many people to elect to go into hospital instead of being treated at home.  They would be costing £60 a week in hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> It is a question of which is better for the State and which is better for the patient.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the administrative costs of the health services, I have said they create a lot of jobs for certain people. I was referring to the McKenzie Report.  I still think we are making jobs for people.  This is the way big business operates in America.  I am not satisfied that some of these jobs should be whole-time in one area and part-time in another.  I wonder why this should be so.  If there is need for a full-time appointment, the man should get a full-time job.  I should like to have the Minister's view on this.  I am afraid that the cost to the health services of these new posts will be very high.</P>
    <P>I have been reading reports of health board meetings throughout the country and I know there is general dissatisfaction. For example, in Cork and Kerry they see themselves back at the original boundaries.  The position arises here of the proportion of the health charges which should fall on the rates.  Under the old system administrative costs were not so heavy on the rates but that has changed under the present system.</P>
    <P>In relation to the big teaching hospitals, the cost of inpatient services is very high.  I cannot see why hostel accommodation should not be provided for such patients with minimal nursing requirements, if any.  In this way, with proper reorganisation we could save a lot of money.  Indeed, during the past couple of hours I have indicated to the Minister where savings can be made.  He spoke about insufficient funds being available for the mentally handicapped, for dental services.  As I have said, savings can be made.  For instance, I asked the Minister on a number of occasions the number of commissions set up under the aegis of his Department and the number of reports.  I was told there were two investigations into thalidomide children but neither was published.  If public money was spent on this, why were the reports not published?  I cannot accept the Minister's earlier reply. Money was spent here on scientific research and the findings should have been published.  Indeed, I was amazed at the Department's reluctance to make any statement on thalidomide children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> At page 33 of his opening statement, we find this reference by the Minister:</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that a comprehensive assessment service for handicapped persons on the lines recommended by the Commission is being developed for the whole country.</P>
    <P>That is a very broad statement to make. I wonder when this assessment service began, how far advanced it is and when some results will be obtained.  The statement covers a multitude but does not say anything, and perhaps the Minister would clarify this point.  It is a nice way of glossing over the situation, but it does not give us the facts.  The mentally handicapped children I have been in contact with have not been assessed. I have written to the Minister making representations on behalf of these people, but other than getting a doleful letter saying that places are not available I have not been given any other information.</P>
    <P>We were led to believe that everything was fine with regard to the child health services but the figures given by the Minister in answer to a parliamentary question indicated that very few schoolchildren were examined.  We could have incorporated this service in the family doctor service, because the family doctor is the person who is best able to deal with the child.  If family doctors are not up-to-date in paediatrics we should have taken steps to ensure that this was corrected.  The other public health doctors were catered for in this regard and we should have done the same thing for the family doctor.  If we had incorporated this examination in the family doctor service it would have been much more satisfactory than the present system where a strange doctor examines the children.  I cannot visualise this system being a success and I would repeat my request to the Minister to reconsider this matter and to see how it could operate most efficiently for the benefit of the children and the parents.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length about cigarette smoking, but it did not impress me in view of the decision he took a few weeks ago which indicated that he is not sincere.  He is well known in this House for giving lengthy answers <Col N="1514" /> to parliamentary questions and all he has said about cigarette smoking corroborates what Deputy Browne has said.  Nevertheless, the Minister opposed the Bill.  This makes me wonder how sincere he is about this matter, how sincere he was about the family planning clinics, about the Contraception Bill, and other matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister has much to do.  I am a little disturbed about what he said a while ago that he does not intend to take action or to help in cases from now on.  I shall not make his life very pleasant because I will harass him with parliamentary questions and I will see that he and his Department work a little better.  I started on a note of hope and euphoria that the Minister was trying to get something done, but the fact that he has taken such an adamant stand about the most neglected section of our community has disappointed me.</P>
    <P>Many of these people are living in abject poverty, they are not able to articulate their problems, and the Minister is not prepared to stand up in their defence.  I have held the Minister in high regard for many years, but now I am very disappointed in a Minister who has not the courage to stand up to his colleagues in defence of these neglected people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of all the Estimates, I find the Estimate for Health the most absorbing and interesting.  I have listened to many contributions and they have put some force into the adage that &ldquo;doctors differ and patients die&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speech of the last speaker makes me realise that to cure the ills of human beings would require unlimited resources, financial and professional. <Col N="1515" /> We have not unlimited resources and we must choose our priorities with great care.  This is not an easy thing to do.  Other Deputies have spoken about the dangers of smoking, drinking, of eating fat meat, of using motorcars and not taking sufficient exercise. I often wonder if we have come to the stage where we think people will live forever.  We are trying to ensure that people have happy lives and that they receive proper care as they grow older.  I am neither a drinking nor smoking man and I have been told that I do not live, I only exist.  Having listened to some of the pronouncements made here it appears that if people wish to have long lives they will not really live but will only exist.</P>
    <P>I have 30 years experience in hospital administration and this gives me an opportunity to see more of what happens in hospitals than the ordinary man in the street.  Criticism was voiced about the recruitment of nurses.  I do not know about the position in Dublin, but in the south we find that the best type of young people apply as trainee student nurses.  In fact, we get ten times more applications than there are vacancies.  In one hospital in Cork there were 40 vacancies; they received 530 applications and many of the applicants had their leaving certificate. Deputy Barry is not present at the moment but I can assure him that it does not hinder the recruitment of nursing personnel to apply the leaving certificate standard.  The matron of that hospital told me that 500 of the 530 girls would have been snapped up by any hospital in England.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the medical Deputies realise that only a certain number of nurses can be trained and this is related to the number of beds, patients, medical and surgical staffs.  We are in the happy position in the south that an excellent type of person applies for nursing training.  It is a great vocation but up to rather recent times nurses were second-class citizens.  They did a tremendous job and got little recognition for it.  Things are very different now.  Perhaps conditions are still not all we would wish but good progress has been made in the past ten years.  One exception is the recruitment of psychiatric <Col N="1516" /> nurses.  It is rather peculiar that in spite of the vocation our young people have for doing good work and healing work which appeals to them so much, we find it very difficult to recruit young people, especially girls, for the psychiatric service.  I think this is, first, because of the conditions in which they live which, perhaps, are not as modern as general hospitals especially the modern hospitals; secondly, psychiatric nursing is a special vocation.  One factor, however, above everything else which to my mind prevents them from joining is the lack of promotional advancement.  They cannot advance as they would in any other walk of life because they are in a psychiatric institution.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for what the previous speaker said because of his profession and because he has given a great deal of time to health matters and knows much more about those matters than I profess to do but you cannot, as he says, have democracy for nurses by agreeing that psychiatric nurses should have a certain way of promotion, only through seniority, and then say that the general nursing body should allow in lay-nurses or helpers, whether they like it or not, because it is good for the patients.  If he continued that line I would favour it 100 per cent because some of us are inclined to forget that the patient is the most important person.  In all the £68 million we are spending we are aiming at benefiting the patient.  I am sorry to say that very often I find on certain boards and bodies of which I am a member that it is only in one meeting out of every six that you hear a word about the patients.  Apparently, there are so many other activities to be looked after in an institution that the patient is &mdash; I do not say forgotten &mdash;seldom discussed at board level.  I deplore any situation that would bring a cessation of service to the patients, especially psychiatric patients.  It is deplorable to right a wrong on the most defenceless and innocent people who have nothing to do with the dispute. I know it takes more than one to make a dispute and I am not apportioning blame to one or other, but before people take an action like that they should consider the innocent victims <Col N="1517" /> who will suffer most even if they gain their objective.  Surely at this time in our history people of that standard of education should be able to sit around a table and solve their problems without drastic action.</P>
    <P>We are very lucky in Cork, and I am sure this is also the case in most of the country, in the number of voluntary workers we get to help out in various hospitals and clinics.  We have a tremendous service in Our Lady's Hospital, which is a psychiatric hospital. I was on the board there many years ago and, with other speakers, I can deplore the condition of some of it still, but I am glad that thousands of pounds have been spent on it in the past two years.  I remember when it was infinitely worse than it is now. Progress has been and is being made. We have a voluntary organisation, the Mental Welfare Association, and hundreds of Cork citizens visit the patients, read or walk with them and do everything possible to ensure that they feel they belong to the community and that somebody takes an interest in their welfare.  Very often these people have relatives who do not visit them at all.</P>
    <P>We also have voluntary workers and organisations in our city in connection with polio, spastic and rehabilitation patients.  In any place where you need help and volunteers you will get them in large measure.  The only thing I would say to the Minister about that is that I feel there is a danger they may dissipate their energies by overlapping. Persons or organisations with the best intentions begin to take care of some clinic or school or institution and very shortly find they are doing similar work in another body of a similar nature.  I do not want them to lose their identity but to continue enrolling workers and recruiting more help and I should like to see co-operation and co-ordination of their efforts so as to avoid overlapping. I need scarcely tell the Department that their value financially is incalculable.  One could not pay for the service they give.  I think nobody would give the service for pay that many of these people give freely.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the Minister's idea of setting up a unit in his Department to be concerned with work study <Col N="1518" /> and management.  That unit should have as one of their functions the overseeing of the general health of the country and the various bodies down to the smallest unit, and give all the help possible.  We say we have more hospital beds per thousand of the population than any other European country but judging by my own experience if we doubled the number of hospital beds tomorrow they would all be filled in a month's time and there would be no trouble in doing that.</P>
    <P>I wish there was less encouragement for people to go to hospital.  I agree with the previous speaker and others on this point because anybody connected with hospital administration must realise that it is cheaper for the State and better for the patient very often, for the patient to stay at home and be cared for at home.  I ask the Minister to use his influence with the Department of Social Welfare, if that is necessary, to see that people get some financial help towards keeping their old folk at home.  Anything that would help to shorten the stay in hospital would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>I am neither a smoking nor a drinking man but for years past I have felt that the campaign against smoking may have obscured something.  I am against smoking.  I fully realise its ill effects, especially on young persons who are interested in sports.  I have always deplored smoking, which does not help any one of them.  But I feel we are inclined to forget that excessive drinking brings more misery to more people.  The excessive drinker may be a patient who is ill and he brings misery to his wife, family and friends, but the man addicted to drugs or smoking, while he may kill himself &mdash; and, of course, then he will be a loss to somebody &mdash; he does not bring the same circle of misery to the people around him as does the man or woman who drinks excessively.  It is disturbing to hear today of so many young ladies who are drinking.  I can only express the hope that they will be discreet in their drinking habits.</P>
    <P>The Minister supplied us with a very detailed account of the activities of his Department.  I was glad to hear Deputy O'Connell praise the Minister and, of course, he criticised him too. <Col N="1519" /> Earlier in the afternoon Deputy O'Connell expressed the hope that the Minister would be left in the Department of Health for some years to come but because of some remarks made by the Minister subsequently Deputy O'Connell changed his mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Connell would be the first to admit that we could have a much worse Minister for Health than the present occupant of that office.  It annoys me to hear the view put forward year after year that the health services should not constitute more than 10p in the £.  That sort of money will not provide very much nowadays.  When the 2s was fixed, the late Dr. Ryan, as Minister for Health, tried to bring in a Health Bill that would have been far in advance of anything we had up to then but that Bill met with severe opposition.  When Dr. Ryan decided on a figure of 2s in the £ he could not have imagined the kind of situation that we are dealing with now and the amount of money that must be spent in providing the various services.  One might understand various matters being used to some extent for political capital but I am sorry that the question of health should be reduced to the status of a political punch bag.  No honest person could agree that 10p should still be the amount paid on the rates towards the health services.</P>
      <P>Another question which comes up annually is that of the financing of the health services from the Central Fund. Many people advocate that but I have never agreed with the suggestion.  In my county most of the people who put forward the suggestion are those who are most anxious to have representation on every board connected with health administration.  If there should be no payment from the rates towards the health service, I do not see how these people could expect representation on the administrative side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People talk about the Government providing money as if the money could be found without the collection of rates and taxes and so on.  I can <Col N="1520" /> understand why the Minister ensures some of the expense is carried at local level.  We must think of some other way of raising the necessary moneys than the method used now but until such time as that can be done, one cannot expect the Central Government to bear the whole cost of the health service.  This year the Minister was able to persuade his colleagues to make available an extra subvention of £5½ million.  This went a long way towards easing the burden and was in many cases more than two-thirds of the cost that would fall on the rates in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has presented the House with a very elaborate brief, a record of what has been done and promulgations of what it is hoped to do. Tremendous advances have been made in the last ten years.  It is impossible to meet all demands and no one knows that better than those of us who are members of local authorities.  Not a meeting passes without a demand for yet another service.  The only time there is any hedging is when it comes to striking the rate; then it is the faceless men in the Department and the Minister who are blamed, depending on which side of this House one sits. That is not good enough.  Credit must be given where credit is due.  There is another side to the coin: if people want specialists, they will have to pay for them; if they want hospitals, they will have to pay for them; if they want more services, they will have to pay for them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the dental hospital in Cork, I would ask the Minister to come to a decision one way or the other as soon as possible.  It is rather disheartening to find ourselves educating dentists and then failing miserably to provide a dental service.  No sooner do these young men graduate than they go to England where, because of a shortage of dentists, they can command very high salaries.  We should get some return for our investment in these people because not one of them graduates without some State aid.</P>
    <P>The Minister has proved himself a very dedicated Minister.  Professional men all over the country, though they may differ from him in some things, <Col N="1521" /> are agreed that he is probably the best Minister for Health we have ever had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to accept that circumstances in rural Ireland, particularly in the west, are different from those in the bigger centres of population.  The two previous speakers come from urban areas in which there are numbers of hospitals, doctors and consultants.  I come from an area in which we have one surgical hospital.  In 1969 a member of the Cabinet promised in Roscommon that this hospital would be upgraded; that promise was made in the presence of the Taoiseach.  On February 23rd, 1970, that self-same Minister at a meeting of Roscommon County Council gave an undertaking that, before any major change would take place, there would be consultations with the local authority.  It is time some definite decision was made known to the people of Roscommon as to what will happen to this hospital.  I would like the Minister to deal with this matter in his reply.  Plans and an estimate of the cost for the new extension to Roscommon County Hospital were submitted to the Department of Health on 25th September, 1970, for the purpose of increasing the bed complement from 126 to 203.  The Department, instead of considering the plans, deferred the matter until the new body was formed.  Despite that, we have had an increase in the rates.</P>
      <P>Roscommon has the most up-to-date maternity unit in the whole country. The extension to this unit in 1968 cost £104,000.  It is fully equipped.  Recently a new X-ray machine was installed at a cost of £20,000.  When the new hospital boards are established is there a possibility that this equipment might be requisitioned by another hospital within the region?  This is a matter that concerns the people of Roscommon because this was purchased and paid for by the local authority of the county.  With the establishment of regional health boards the authority invested in the local body will be limited to ordinary routine business and major changes can be effected only after consultation with the regional health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a number of medical cards <Col N="1522" /> were withdrawn because there was a slight increase in valuation or a slight rise in salary.  There was no allowance made for the increase in the cost of living and the fall in the value of money.</P>
    <P>Again, patients attending out-patient clinics in Dublin are brought to Roscommon Hospital or the county home at a very early hour, possibly five o'clock or six o'clock in the morning, in order to be here in Dublin before ten o'clock; if they are not in Dublin by that time they will not be examined by the consultants.  This constitutes a hardship on old people particularly on cold winter mornings.  Would it not be possible to bring the consultant from Dublin once a month, or every other month, to examine these patients?</P>
    <P>We have a grave shortage of dentists in Roscommon and a long waiting list for dentures.  The system at the moment is that dentists drive from one dispensary to another.  I have been approached by patients who attended dispensaries in three consecutive months and no dentist arrived.  Granted the dentist may get sick or his car may break down, but would it not be more satisfactory if the dentist worked whole-time in a clinic where the patient could visit him instead of having the dentist driving from dispensary to dispensary?</P>
    <P>There would be no need for our aged to end their days in county homes if the Minister would give an allowance to relatives to care for them.  I do not mean now the same allowance that the Minister for Social Welfare gives because his allowance is very limited indeed.  The aged person has to be living alone.  It is really useless.  If an allowance were given to a relative, whether married or single, a son or a daughter, a son-in-law or a daughter-in-law, to care for an aged relative that would be a far more satisfactory situation. It would also be cheaper in the long run because it costs at least £10 a week to keep these aged people in county homes.  As well as that, the aged person would be much happier surrounded by grandchildren.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Irish Nurses <Col N="1523" /> Organisation for all they have done and are doing to improve conditions and standards.  As a nurse, I appreciate the crying need for this organisation and its work.  I deplore the insistence on leaving certificate for admittance to the profession.  Academic qualifications are all very well in their own way, but they are no substitute for responsibility, cheerfulness, kindness, dedication and willingness to serve.  These are the things a patient expects from a nurse.</P>
    <P>Thousands of girls, admirably suited for this noble profession, are denied admittance to training simply because they fail a subject in their leaving certificate; very often this is the very controversial subject, compulsory Irish. Knowledge of the Irish language will not make them better nurses.  I should like to see the establishment in the near future of the promised college for nurses.  The emphasis at the moment is on the establishment of regional health boards.  We should get our priorities right.  Care of the sick starts and finishes at the bedside of the sick person and all the advances in management techniques, administration and training are no good if the nurse herself is not properly trained.  Needless to say she cannot be so trained if she is not the proper material.</P>
    <P>What progress has the Minister made in resolving the grievances of the psychiatric nurses?</P>
    <P>The Minister should make a bigger contribution towards the cost of the health services.  The extra grant of £5½ million which he has made available this year has already been collected by him under the 1971 Health Contributions Act.  One of the reasons given by the Department why local authorities should bear a proportion of the health charges was that these local authorities had a say in the running of the health services.  This is no longer the case.  That being so the Exchequer should now provide more.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the composition of the health boards.  Counties which hitherto ran their own hospitals may not even have representatives on the new hospital board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for Health and <Col N="1524" /> the officers of his Department on the marked improvement in the health services. This improvement, of course, has resulted in an increased burden on the local authorities particularly in Dublin which, I understand, does not stand to benefit from the £5 million recently announced by the Minister.  I am conscious, too, of the continuing spiralling of health charges which has created serious financial problems for the city and, to a lesser extent, for local authorities. I note that some representatives who could be regarded as being conservative in their thinking have protested about these charges and have implied that if they were in charge and if the old system had been continued these increases would not arise. Therefore, I was glad to see that the Minister recently pointed out that the extra administrative charges would not amount to more than a halfpenny in the £ in the share borne by the rates.</P>
      <P>The Minister took a step forward in the setting up of the regional health boards.  I am a member of the Eastern Health Board and I should like to pay a tribute to the medical and other ancillary professions associated with this body.  They are making very valuable and constructive contributions towards the welfare of the citizens.  It is an example of co-operative community effort and has been to me personally a very revealing experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the cost of health services has increased enormously in the past ten years.  We have witnessed their improvement.  There are more expert personnel running them.  There are advanced methods and expensive drugs and equipment used for the treatment of patients.  The question is raised as to whether a different method of collection of revenue to defray costs should be devised.  To put the whole cost on to general taxation might not be the right answer.  The possibility of putting it on a new national health insurance basis might be worth considering. I would ask the Minister, in his reply, having regard to the escalating cost of the services and the burden on taxpayers and ratepayers, whether he would keep this point in mind.  I would point to the success of the voluntary health insurance scheme which provides a high level of service <Col N="1525" /> with a minimum of management and retains effective control.  It provides us with a valuable headline.  Contributors have a range of services to choose from and they can obtain cover for their needs according to their incomes. That organisation has shown a willingness to extend the range of benefits according as finances improve and as they gain experience.  I would ask the Minister to take a serious look at the whole structure of the financing of the health services and having regard to the experience of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, see if some better method can be evolved for the financing of our general health services.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with other Deputies in speaking about the appalling lack of accommodation for geriatric patients.  This is particularly marked in Dublin city.  St. Kevin's Hospital has now been completely changed and is known as St. James's Hospital.  It is being organised as one of the leading general hospitals of the city and I understand that it is the policy to phase out geriatric patients. There are no new admissions.  There is no alternative accommodation available for these patients.</P>
    <P>I have personal experience of the great difficulty there is in obtaining admission of a patient to St. Mary's Hospital.  Understandably, there is a waiting list and a process of assessment and I hold with that.  There is an urgent need for the provision of more accommodation for old people.  It is a big problem in some of the older urban centres where many people are, unfortunately, living alone with, perhaps, their relatives far removed from them.  At times the neighbours have to look after these old people.  I would ask the Minister to keep this urgent problem in mind.  It is an acute problem in Dublin but I am sure it exists in other areas too.  Any public representative in this city can testify to the difficulty there is in getting a patient admitted to St. Mary's which is the only geriatric hospital as far as I am aware.  There is another hospice which accepts geriatric patients under a different system of certification but this does not meet the situation in regard to the kind of case I have in mind.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister in his <Col N="1526" /> reply to deal with the problem facing this expanding city.  The constituency I represent, North-East Dublin, is rapidly expanding.  New housing areas are being developed and new families coming in.  There are no hospital facilities in the constituency.  On the north side of the city we only have the Mater Hospital, Jervis Street Hospital and the Richmond.  These are traditional hospitals which served the needs of a much smaller population than that which we have today.  In any policy that is being formulated by the Department of Health I suggest that the needs of these rapidly growing districts should be taken into account. Suitable facilities should be provided whether by way of a general hospital, maternity hospital or emergency hospital to cater for the needs of the people.  There is a vast number of young people living in these areas.  We have had the experience of young children meeting with accidents and the time taken for the ambulance to arrive at the scene of the accident, having to come from the centre of the city, through traffic, a distance of five or six miles, means that the victim of the accident is exposed to greater risk. The community should have a better service.  The Department should address itself to these problems.</P>
    <P>On the general question of public health, I should like once again to congratulate the Department on what they are doing to improve the facilities and to inform the public.  Greater use should be made of the television and radio services to promote the objectives of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>While efforts are being made to improve the health services we who live in the country are of the opinion that the machinery set up recently is too expensive, completely bureaucratic and too remote from the people.  Having been a member of a hospital board for a number of years I am of the opinion that the closer the organisation is to the people, the better.  The new organisation is covering a very large area.  The people are hardly able to get in touch with it and are therefore unable to derive the benefits they should get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last few years rates have increased. <Col N="1527" /> County councils now are charged with the burden of collecting rates that the people cannot afford, in order to implement the schemes devised by the Department of Health.  The people did get a service from the already existing hospitals.  There was no need for this violent change.  Things are moving so fast that the people are not able to keep in touch and cannot afford to pay the rates demanded of them.</P>
    <P>We saw an announcement in the papers today that the health charge in some counties has gone as high as 9/-in the £.  It is obvious to any Minister and to the Government that the writing is on the wall.  The people simply cannot afford such charges.  It would be all right if they got good results but, as I have said, the services are too remote from the people for them to be able to benefit by them.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is Bantry Hospital which was built some ten or 12 years ago and has been of tremendous benefit to the people of the area.  The area served by the hospital extends from the Kenmare River to Cork, the former West Cork Board of Health area.  Prior to the building of that hospital persons requiring hospital attention had to travel from the glens and mountains of Ardgroom to Cork city.  Many who undertook that journey died on the way.  When the hospital was built in Bantry, the people were delighted.  It is a well run, up-to-date hospital, a credit to the staff who run it and to those who built it.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that if that hospital is downgraded or closed, the people will rise in protest.  I warn the Minister and the Department that the protests in Mallow will be mere tea parties compared with the protests that there will be in West Cork.  I say that with a knowledge of what is happening. I appeal to the Minister and to his Department to ensure that the hospital is continued on the present basis and that it is not downgraded or closed.  The hospital serves the people of that wide area.  The next nearest hospital is, in the case of some of the people, 100 miles away.  Workmen on the island who received serious injury during the building of the Gulf Oil plant and <Col N="1528" /> fishermen injured while fishing around the coast came to Bantry Hospital for attention.  I have seen them there. French and Spanish fishermen have been brought into Bantry Hospital for treatment of injuries received at sea. But for the fact that their injuries could be attended to at that hospital, many of these men would never have returned home.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and the Department to reconsider any decision to close or downgrade Bantry Hospital. The people there are determined to retain the service they fought so hard to get and for which they waited so long.  There is no reason to downgrade that hospital.  The staff are excellent and do a great job of work.  The sisters and nurses are highly skilled.  The operations carried out there are too numerous to mention.  The benefit conferred on the area is considerable. Urgent cases can be treated at Bantry Hospital.  In some cases, if the patients had to be taken to Cork, the position would be the same as before Bantry Hospital was built: they would die on the way.  The people deserve something better than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my former colleague from West Cork, I shall not delay the House more than five minutes.  I am sure the Minister will be pleased to hear that but he may not be too pleased with what else I have to say to him.</P>
      <P>With all respect to the Tánaiste, whatever he touches, no matter how he may improve matters, costs the earth. When he was Parliamentary Secretary in charge of Fisheries, the price of fish went out through the roof.  When he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the cost of posting a letter went from three old pennies to six old pennies, in a very short time, and of course it is now 9.6 old pennies to post an ordinary letter.  As one of my children remarked to me, she could post ten letters for half a crown when she first went to school but could post only five when she left school.  That covered the period during which the Tánaiste was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have great sympathy with the Tánaiste.  He worked very hard on the Health Bill during 1969 to 1970.  Everybody <Col N="1529" /> gave him all the help possible.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan, there is too much money going on bureaucracy. Everyone listening to me knows what I mean by bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak about medical cards in Dublin city and county.  I will not delay the House long.  It appears that there were different standards in granting these cards.  The Tánaiste provided me with the necessary material for my points, which I hope I have recollected accurately.  In Dublin county only 8 per cent of the families have medical cards.  In Dublin city 12 per cent of the families have medical cards.  In Limerick city and county 40 per cent of the families have medical cards. Limerick is one of the wealthiest counties in this country.  It forms part of the Golden Vale.  Forty per cent of the families there have medical cards.  I do not know how the medical card scheme is administered, but it is certainly not administered in Limerick the same way as it is in Dublin.  In Cavan 35 per cent of the families have medical cards.  I see nothing wrong with that.  I know what West Cavan is like, and how hard the people work there to make a living from the land.</P>
    <P>What is wrong in Dublin?  Some years ago staff officers in the health service, when it was first established, were recruited from the ACC.  Was it the training of these men in the ACC which affected the administration of the scheme?  These men were badly paid.  Is that what made them so meticulous? With the training they got in the ACC they would not lend a shilling to the biggest farmer in the country. That has all changed now.  The majority of the staff officers in the health services in Dublin were recruited from the ACC.  I presume they have advanced in the ranks.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy O'Connell saying that 50 per cent of the people in Galway have medical cards.  When one considers the position of West Galway one cannot see much wrong with that. There is a great difference in the value of money in the city of Dublin and in the country.  In the country a family often has an acre on which to grow potatoes.  They often have a cow and hens.  I know of large families in <Col N="1530" /> Crumlin, Dublin, with ten or 12 children and a father earning £20 a week. In <i>The Times</i> of London yesterday it was stated that the cost of food per person per week in England was £2.4. What is the justification for our system of handling medical cards in Dublin? Last year we raised this point but got no answer.  Will we get an answer to it this year?  The system of administration is outrageous.</P>
    <P>I was back in this House for two years before I succeeded in getting a medical card for anybody.  The situation is a bit better now.  The Eastern Health Board are dealing with this problem.  It is a central organisation. The Wicklow people come under the Eastern Health Board.  Things appear to be better in the bigger organisation. Extra expenditure has been incurred on the health board but things are better outside Dublin, even if people are paying for the service.</P>
    <P>Is there any possibility of a man earning £20 to £25 per week with a family of six or more children paying for medicines or for medical attention? Such a man has no chance whatever of getting a medical card in Dublin city. It could be said that there has been too much emphasis on health in this country over the last 20 years.  I have as bad a health record as anybody in this House and have been ill occasionally. It is foolish to be upset about health.  There has been altogether too much emphasis on health and it would be much more to the point if the Government attended to housing and children's allowances.  There would be less illness in the community if young children were looked after properly instead of being reared in conditions of starvation as at present.  If someone becomes ill there is altogether too much argument about the medical card.</P>
    <P>The present Government have raised the social welfare contribution greatly.  If that money had been put into an insurance scheme for health such a scheme would have been accepted by the ordinary workers.  During the 1961 election campaign, on making inquiries in Ringsend, I found that the people would agree to a health system based on insurance.  The Fianna Fáil Party pandered to the béal bocht.  It <Col N="1531" /> is probably too late now to make radical changes.  This also applies to what the Government are doing in relation to all expenditure.  Since the Tánaiste believes obviously in this expenditure, why does he not attend to the question of medical cards in Dublin?  The situation in Dublin is outrageous as compared with the situation in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In Kilkenny nearly 40 per cent of the people have medical cards.  This is absurd.  In the city of Dublin there is extreme poverty.  Nobody will write about it.  The people who have investigated the poverty will not write about it.  We have the Economic and Social Research Institute.  I do not know what the second half of that title means.  Nobody will write about the poverty although they are supposed to do so.  No matter where one goes in the present establishment one notices the emphasis on keeping quiet.  I see the Tánaiste looking to see how many Deputies are in the Fianna Fáil benches.  That does not surprise me.  I have said what I wanted to say.  I want to make the strongest protest about the manner in which the health services have been operated in relation to medical cards in this city in recent years.  As everything the Tánaiste touches costs the earth I hope that a little of the money that he is taking out of the pockets of the people will be used to provide medical cards for the unfortunate workers of this city who have to live on small incomes and whose money is not worth anything like what the same money is worth down the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House any longer than is necessary but there are a few points in the Minister's brief I want to refer to.  I read recently in one of the newspapers that the Minister, speaking at the Coombe Hospital, stated that the figure for the coming year would be £84.3 million for health expenditure.  This is a fantastic increase and it indicates the phenomenon which has occurred in the provision of medical services for the community.  One cannot help however but compare this increase with what the general public spend on alcohol. <Col N="1532" /> It is estimated that last year something in the region of £110 million was spent on drink.  I believe that, from the grassroots to the top, we have our priorities wrong.</P>
      <P>Many steps have been taken by the Department of Health and we have heard some Deputies here praise the Minister for the work he has done.  I do not come here to praise the Estimate but to criticise it in the most constructive way I can.  There are aspects of the Minister's brief which I feel are possibly misleading.  In the third paragraph of page 1 the Minister states:</P>
      <P>These increases are attributable largely to improved pay and improved conditions of service for staff and the rising costs of drugs, medicines, foodstuffs and so forth.</P>
      <P>The rising cost of medicines has not been helped by successive Ministers or by successive Budgets.  Turnover tax on two separate occasions has been levied on medicines.  This is possibly a budgetary matter, but I feel, since the Minister mentioned this in his brief, I am at liberty to comment on one of the reasons for the rise in the cost of drugs in this country.  This is not totally outside the control of the Government. The turnover tax on medicines, as originally imposed and as later increased, is one of the contributory factors for the increase in the cost.  It is impossible for the Minister to estimate the amount of money spent by private patients on medicines at local level.</P>
      <P>There is great discontent among patients who are not covered for free drugs and they represent 90 per cent of the population.  These people have to pay rates but they have little or no provision made for them at general medical services level.  Deputy O'Donovan mentioned the increase in postal charges.  When a patient is sent into hospital by a general practitioner the consultant sends a report to him and this postage has increased very much over the last few years.  This has not helped the situation.  I would like to see all forms of health accessories, all medicines and medical instruments exempted from the excessive taxation which the Government impose at least annually, if not bi-annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> When the Government imposed turnover tax on drugs they exempted medicines for cats, canaries and household pets.  It might not mean more than an extra few shillings in the £ every year if it only occurs once or twice in a family but in a chronic illness, which is not covered under the regulations which the Minister made effective from 1st October last, it means a big increase. These regulations give power to health boards to provide free of charge drugs and medicines to people under 16 years of age who are suffering from mental handicap, cystic fibrosis, epilepsy, diabetes, haemophilia, spina bifida, and cerebral palsy.  There is no harm in pointing out that when we were asking the Minister to state his <i>bona fides</i> in regard to making medicines available for these categories of people there were many other classifications of patients we wanted included in this.</P>
    <P>We appreciate the Minister's response to the numerous representations made by different voluntary boards who have got together to present their case to the Department of Health to provide some form of relief for these illnesses but there are other illnesses which could be included in this.  Asthma is one of those.  I know there are different types of asthma but certainly bronchogenic asthma should be included in this category.  It is a very difficult illness to treat unless one has a free hand as regards the types of medicines used. Medicines which have come out during the past decade for the treatment of asthma are very expensive.</P>
    <P>Asthma can be treated very successfully with modern drugs but where a private patient is on the borderline and does not qualify with a health board for the supply of free medicines in a case of bronchogenic asthma, which a patient suffers from for many years, it can impose a heavy cost on the patient.  This should certainly be included in the category of diseases for free medicines.  The quality of treatment and the quality of therapy that a general practitioner can give to a person suffering from the specific type of asthma I mentioned would greatly improve the patient's health and could restore him as close to normal as <Col N="1534" /> possible with the present compounds that are available, but they are so expensive that they are outside most people's pocket at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is another disease which should be included here&mdash;I know it is a wide type of definition as regards disease&mdash;and that is arthritis.  I do not mean lumbago or other such aches or pains, but osteo-arthritis or rheumatoid-arthritis where there is a specific disease diagnosed and where the general practitioner has to certify that the patient is suffering from this.  If osteo-arthritis and rheumatoid-arthritis were included it could cover the vast number of those who do need the most expensive medicines, particular gold injections, cortisone treatments and so on which are given for these diseases.</P>
    <P>There is another disease which one comes across every day, that is blood pressure or hypertension.  This is a disease which can require very prolonged treatment.  We have seen some excellent programmes on television which have come into the country from abroad indicating how chronic this disease can be, the effect it can have upon the patient, upon his family life, upon his performance at work and on everything he does.  Yet this is a disease 70 per cent of the cause of which is never found, but one of the remarkable things about that disease is that the treatment, which is long-term treatment, can produce all the symptoms which result from the disease hypertension.  Here again at general practitioner level we are not going to disguise the fact that people are not wealthy.  They are not well off and you cannot prescribe the up-to-date medicines for a hypertensive person when you know that the very cost of the medicine will result in his getting upset and raising his blood pressure.  Even though there is some provision whereby he can bring his prescription to the health board and get a month's supply until his case is investigated, there is far too much inquiry into cases like this.  Due to the way in which the cost of living has increased nearly every second patient goes to James's Street to try to get his medicines free.</P>
    <P>The fourth type of disease which I <Col N="1535" /> think should be included is chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  In the city of Dublin there is smoke pollution which is twice that of London city. This is one of the factors in chronic bronchitis.  Due to our failures as administrators and legislators we have allowed that to happen.  A person might have a job in a mine or in industry which is not helping the respiratory system.  Our damp climate, particularly for six months of the year, is also a factor.  The first thing one is taught in medical school is to tell anyone who has chronic bronchitis to go to the Meditteranean.  People cannot afford that, but there are many medicines which can give relief to a chronic bronchitic for the winter months.  While once again there may be provision whereby a chronic bronchitic can get a week-to-week or month-to-month supply of drugs, I think that should be dispensed with and that such a person should be included among those entitled to free medicine.</P>
    <P>Another disease which should be included is angina.  Any person who has a coronary attack as a result of which he requires treatment for the rest of his life should get the benefit of this provision.  In fact, any disease which lasts or is likely to last longer than three to five years should be automatically included.  One thing I am pleased to see in this connection is that there is no means test in connection with these diseases, but the application form which a person has to fill in when he is applying for free drugs or a medical card contains many questions of a personal nature: his weekly wage or other income, overtime, bonus or other allowances; what the rent is, what the mortgage payments are, ground rent, rates, rateable valuation and special circumstances, if any.  Then after that his house is inspected and possibly, if his furniture is good and shiny, if there is a television set, a telephone and so on, his application may be refused.</P>
    <P>I have replies back from the Eastern Health Board indicating the number of people being refused or possibly having difficulty in obtaining the evidence necessary to give to the <Col N="1536" /> Eastern Health Board.  There is a great deal of bureaucracy involved.  The applicant has to go to his employer or to the secretary of the company for which he is working, get an income tax certificate, details of what he has earned for the year and so on.  This can be embarrassing for certain people and they may not like to do it.  It is time we got away from counting the chickens in the farmyard and having a look at the furniture in the house and made a reasonable provision in respect of those suffering from chronic illnesses.</P>
    <P>May I point out, without being too severely critical of the Minister, that under his Ministry, for the first time as far as I can remember in any country in the world there has been a strike of junior hospital doctors here. Nurses have paraded in their uniforms and carried banners outside Dáil Éireann, certainly not what their parents intended them to do when they started them off in nursing, or when they entered that great vocation. There was a threatened strike of dispensary doctors about two years ago so that they could have a day-and-a-half off a week.  We have had the tragic strike of the psychiatric nurses, something everybody was bewildered about.  Nobody could understand how it could have been allowed to go to such an extent.  I was not surprised that it was allowed to boil over, that once again the Minister was trying to capitalise on the nature, the vocation, of the psychiatric nurses.  It had happened before in regard to the junior hospital doctors who found they could not live on the salaries they were getting for the hours they worked.  The psychiatric nurses found themselves in difficulties with the cost of uniforms and the cost of meals going up. Earlier the dispensary doctors had the same experience.  All of these strikes came right up to the full bluff point but the psychiatric nurses' strike was the one that exploded.  Many of us know of the tragedies that resulted from that strike in certain parts of the country.  We have had the dentists' dispute.</P>
    <P>That is not a great record.  I am not criticising the Minister as a person, though I shall have plenty of criticisms <Col N="1537" /> to offer later.  I am criticising his general administration.  No other country in the world has had that record in the two and a half years the Minister has been in that office.</P>
    <P>The dentists, from a poll of 64 per cent, have voted 84 per cent in favour of the new proposals.  I am glad to hear it and I hope they abide by that decision.  It is good to think that the dental services will be back in action. However, a point that is often made, and there is great validity in it, is that once you cross the Border you can notice the difference in dental hygiene as between residents in the North and the South.  The services here are very poor.  Only the mother who has a medical card and who is pregnant is entitled to dental treatment in the local dispensary area.  Only the man who pays his insurance stamps is entitled to dental treatment with a private practitioner. Where does the mother go in regard to her children?  Where does the man go who has not got a medical card?  For the adults, they can go to the Dental Hospital which has, as we know, quite a large number of people on its waiting list which closed in June 1970. The Minister told us that the reason for this was that the number of persons awaiting this service was beyond the ability of the hospital to deal with.  He said the matter was plainly one for the Eastern Health Board.  That may be so, but if the Minister is subsidising the Eastern Health Board to the extent he says he is, it is also a matter for the Minister.  If our party were in office I would not expect Deputy R. Barry to make such an observation or to try to pass the buck in that way.  I am surprised at the Minister in this respect.</P>
    <P>For instance, I asked a question about somebody who could not get treatment for a particular illness.  I was told to go to the Eastern Health Board. Practically every question asked of the Minister is referred to that board.  One of the few democratic rights we have in the House is the Parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>Three of the previous five speakers dealt with particular matters about which I have a certain amount of knowledge.  I do not say I have the same knowledge as the Minister has. <Col N="1538" /> Let us consider what Deputy Mrs. Burke said regarding the hospital in her constituency.  It is a short distance from where I was reared in north Longford.  I very often travel there and I know the difficulties and the feelings of apprehension at the down-grading of that hospital.  It ill becomes any Minister to say it will not be down-graded in the way Deputy Mrs. Burke stated. In this respect I would urge the Minister to reconsider parts of the FitzGerald Report, written by a committee chaired by Professor Paddy FitzGerald.  It is a good document but since its issue we have had the results of a census.  The report was based on the old census but left a certain amount of leeway for changes in the population. I do not think it covered fully the changes revealed in the new census. Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned a hospital in Kerry.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt this hospital provided services second to none.  I do not wish to intrude on the South Western Health Board but from my experience there in 1968 I fully appreciate the services that were available in that hospital.  I should not like to think of practising in that area if the facilities provided by that hospital were taken away.  One must have regard to the feelings of the people there among other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Timmons gave interesting facts about the relative poverty of the hospital services in the north side of Dublin.  I am sorry he is not here to hear the figures I am about to give. The total number of hospitals in the Greater Dublin area is 72 institutions of one kind or another, including convalescent homes, children's hospitals and other places where institutional care is provided.  Of these, 54 are south and 18 north of the Liffey.  The adult population is 169,000 people on the north side of the Liffey and 157,000 south of the Liffey.  On the north side <Col N="1539" /> there are six general hospitals, compared to 24 on the south side.  On the north side there is the Rotunda Hospital which is the only maternity hospital on that side as compared with five maternity hospitals on the south side.</P>
    <P>On the south side there is St. James's Hospital, which has a large maternity unit; there is the new Coombe Hospital which was built at a reasonable price.  This is an excellent job and, in addition, recreational facilities for the nurses' home and the doctors' home are provided.  However, it is overcrowded now; one of the reasons is that the number of maternity beds available on the north side is 134. This results in a massive overflow to the south side.  The third hospital is the National Maternity Hospital at Holles Street.  It is not unusual to hear complaints from husbands that their wives are left lying in corridors.  I can remember one case where a patient was taken in at 10 o'clock; a D and C was performed and the patient was wheeled out to a car.  The patient could not be kept in the hospital because of lack of accommodation.  This happened in 1965 and the patient was allowed to go home after what might be considered a minor operation.  In any operation involving the use of a general anaesthetic the patient should have expert supervision for more than one hour afterwards.</P>
    <P>Another hospital is St. Michael's at Dún Laoghaire and this provides a good maternity service.  This place is regarded as the &ldquo;in&rdquo; place to go.  The fifth hospital, Mount Carmel, has adequate provision for maternity cases. On the north side there are 134 maternity beds catering for 169,000 adults whereas on the south side there are 442 maternity beds catering for 157,000 adults.</P>
    <P>This leads to a situation where Dr. Clinch, Master of the Coombe Hospital, says that they need prefabs. I would appeal to all involved in the matter not to be too parochial in their attitude but to have regard to the way the city is expanding.  Regardless of what the FitzGerald Report says there appears to be a definite need for a new maternity complex on the north side <Col N="1540" /> which would eliminate the overloading of hospitals on the south side.  If we could have a maternity hospital with 130 to 140 beds on the north side considerable progress would be made towards providing maternity beds for those in need of hospital delivery.  The question arises: how are we going to get this and how can we afford to pay the cost?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people who consider that part of Blanchardstown would be suitable for a maternity unit and I do not deny that.  However, I would point out the distance a patient from Finglas, Ballymun, Coolock, Kilbarrack or Sutton, would have to travel would be very great.  It would be most inconvenient for those people who might only have to have a urine test carried out or an ante-natal examination carried out.  Such a scheme might work later on when Blanchardstown is extended but at present the distance is too far for those who live in other areas.  Although the distance in miles as the crow flies might not be very great, the amount of time spent in travelling by bus would be considerable.  In addition, it would not be desirable for a pregnant woman to have to travel such a distance.</P>
      <P>I will make a suggestion to the Minister.  There is at Old Cabra Cross a large site which was purchased in 1957 under a compulsory purchase order by the then Minister for Health. It was intended for the erection of the St. Laurence Hospital which did not materialise.  We will not go into the history of what happened to the board.  One of the most expensive aspects of building in Dublin is the cost of land but here there is a large acreage which was purchased as suitable for the building of a hospital. There has been a certain amount of capital investment in that land and a considerable amount of work and effort was put into the planning of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Coombe Hospital which was built some years ago was badly needed and it has provided benefits for the people on the south side.  The plans <Col N="1541" /> drawn up by Mr. Kennedy, the design of that hospital and the facilities provided by that hospital and its outer buildings could be used on the site at Old Cabra Road.  In this way the Minister will be able to provide at a minimal cost to his Department, to the ratepayers and taxpayers, a fully modernised maternity unit, a gynaecological unit, peri-natal and neo-natal care units.  The Minister will be able to eliminate architects' fees because plans are available and the land is already available.  All that is needed is to get the builders who did the other job to submit an estimate and then erect the hospital.  It is an excellent situation, it is accessible to all parts of the north and north-west, 700 new houses are being erected nearby and 1,000 houses are being constructed a further distance away.  When Blanchardstown expands there will be plenty of room there to provide maternity accommodation for the 100,000 people.</P>
    <P>We know that the Rotunda Hospital is in disrepair.  I do not know the exact date on which the Minister told me that the number of beds decreased by 28 because of the fact that repairs were being carried out to the roof.  There is provision to provide 28 or 30 beds in the Drumcondra Hospital when the legal procedures are settled.  I would ask the Minister to provide the extra ante-natal care unit and extra maternity beds at Drumcondra but even if he does that it will still not solve the problem and a new complex of hospital beds on the north side will still be badly needed.  I know that senior consultants have been thinking of opening a unit in the Blanchardstown area but, with all humility, I do not think patients will travel that distance for ante-natal care which is a vital factor in keeping maternity deaths and morbidity at a minimum.  The patient-lapse in ante-natal care would increase if patients had to go to Blanchardstown.  It is not unusual&mdash;I am speaking for mothers on the north side&mdash;that they have to book in at the Rotunda Hospital very early, practically before you can tell whether they are expecting a baby or not, because the hospital is so crowded. There is an increase in domiciliary deliveries by the Rotunda unit because <Col N="1542" /> there are not sufficient beds available. One must give credit to the units doing this work and especially to the nurses who are up at night for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I put this proposal to the Minister and I sincerely hope in the interests of all the people of Dublin he will seriously consider the utilisation of the site, the utilisation of the new Coombe Hospital plans and possibly the builder &mdash;I do not know who he was&mdash;to get that project started as soon as possible. It will solve the problem.  If he does not do it now, he may have to do it very soon.  Make-shift and patchwork arrangements will not be sufficient to cope with the population explosion we are now having on the north side and also on the south side.</P>
    <P>In regard to the hospitals available in Dublin, and going back to facilities for children in Dublin city, we are evolving towards catchment-type areas and we find again this tremendous imbalance. There are three childrens' hospitals on the south side and only one on the north side, where you have Temple Street Children's Hospital, run by the Irish Sisters of Charity who do absolutely wonderful work there. On the south side you have our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, Harcourt Street Children's Hospital and St. Ultan's Children's Hospital.  If you take in the paediatric or children's beds available in the general hospitals such as Jervis Street, the Richmond and the Mater, all of which will have a certain number available, together with the other hospitals you find there are 50 per cent more beds on the south side than on the north side.  There were 695 beds available on 27th April, 1971, for children on the north side and practically 1,000&mdash;966&mdash;available on the south side.</P>
    <P>I have made pleas to different Ministers in regard to the big discrepancy in all facilities on the north side of the city.  Obviously, over the years there has been top-heavy development on the south side which was regarded as the place to live or build a hospital or whatever it was.  Since Lord Oxman and the gentry who were with him in Old Oxmanstown, and the Duke of Leinster, moved over here, it seems that nobody thought of the north side <Col N="1543" /> of the city.  So we have five centres of higher education on the south side and one on the north side and so on.  I shall not go into that but merely point to it to demonstrate the lopsided development of hospital services that we have.</P>
    <P>In regard to fever hospitals, not only is there a decrease in the number of beds available this year compared with last year, not only have we had a succession of Parliamentary questions answered showing that wards are closed due to lack of nurses or because of decoration or because of preparation for a special type of unit or something like that, but the point is that in the city itself a vast number of children and the largest families have gone out to Finglas, Ballymun, Coolock, Kilbarrack and Donaghmede. Some time ago, before the water supply was connected in the Coolock area we experienced an outbreak of scabies, a contageous disease, because there was no water available or there was not a liberal supply of water.  The same thing happened in Cabra because of the height.  We know the mechanics of water pressure.  We had boilers bursting and there was insufficient water simply because of the height.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that in a rural area, where I was brought up, you had to go to the well for water but when one is accustomed to something and has never experienced anything but a constant flow of water then, when it is cut off or interrupted for hours in the day it is not easy for one to adapt. Thank God in all parts of my constituency, following the co-operation I got and for which I am very grateful, there is plenty of water.  We are very grateful to the Department and the corporation for their co-operation in providing an adequate water supply. We did have epidemics of scabies and so on and these have not yet abated to any great extent.</P>
    <P>I think there should be a fever hospital on the north side of the city. Even though fever hospitalisation is provided completely free of charge under the Infectious Diseases Act the cost of going to see a baby through the glass wall&mdash;and for a young mother that can be a very trying experience&mdash;<Col N="1544" /> can also be very expensive because of travelling to and fro.  There is not much justification for having the two fever hospitals on the south side.  Very often children who suffer from the routine fevers, measles, scarlet fever, virus infections, chickenpox and so on, come from large families and those hospitalised are possibly hospitalised very often.  It is not so unusual to see a child in hospital on a regular basis. Inaccessibility of the hospital to the parents can result in their not being properly briefed by the hospital as to the proper precautions to take.  The next time the general practitioner sees them is when the child is down with the infection again.  Without harping on the lopsided hospital facilities available I should like to point out we have over 70 hospitals in the greater Dublin area, 18 of them north of the Liffey and 54 south of the river.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the increases in the Health Estimate are attributable largely to improved pay and conditions of service for staff and the rise in costs, <i>et cetera</i>.  I am not, and do not pretend to be, an economist and I know very little about the subject, but I imagine that if you have 72 institutions you will start off by having a secretary for each hospital institution.  In some of the bigger ones there will probably be a panel of secretaries for the secretary and maybe some sub-secretaries for the assistant secretary.  There would also be a matron, an assistant matron, staff nurses and others down the line.  There would be a head of catering, a head porter, telephonists and many others. Special notepaper would have to be printed.  There would also have to be the special charts that hospitals must have.  Some form of rationalisation is taking place with the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals but what amazes me is the number of hospital institutions that are doing the same kind of work.  In general practice one often has to telephone the bed bureau when it is necessary to have a patient removed to hospital.  The bed bureau then try to find a bed for the patient. There are approximately 30 specialised hospitals in this city.  These include maternity, fever and the general hospitals.</P>

      <P>One of the points I was trying to make was that with the 72 hospital institutions that there now are in the Dublin area, obviously, the cost of maintaining staff will be very high. The Minister pointed out recently that we have a very high bed ratio per head of the population but at the same time these hospital beds are not all in what one might refer to as economically viable institutions.  I would say there is overloading in so far as administrative personnel in the Dublin area are concerned.  Generally speaking, the health services of the country are top heavy.  Apart from the medical side there must be administrative and maintenance staff and when there are more than 70 institutions involved, the wage and salary bill for these staffs will be very high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that in certain cases the number of staff in some of these institutions is greater than is necessary.  We know that many consultants travel from one hospital to another in the city and even outside it. Their appointments are duplicated in so far as they have visiting appointments to different hospitals throughout the city.</P>
      <P>In the field of orthopaedics one might find a specialist with appointments at the Mater, Temple Street, Cappagh, Baldoyle and other hospitals. Some of the recommendations of the FitzGerald Report would be welcomed by economists.  I do not wish to mention any hospital units in particular as not being viable economically but there are very many small hospitals and institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I would like to make concerns the conditions of service of the staffs of hospitals.  I do not think a lot has been done in this regard. Therefore, I would not regard the reference in the Minister's speech to the <Col N="1546" /> conditions of staff as being valid.  I have not noticed much improvement in the conditions of service of the staffs apart from the introduction of shorter working hours.  The conditions under which some junior doctors had to live were deplorable.  The recreational facilities did not extend beyond the table tennis table.  The improved pay will enable junior hospital doctors to pursue higher studies.  This is something we welcome.</P>
    <P>One of the big defects in the general medical services is the duplication of drugs and the number of different brands of a preparation available. Tetracycles are supplied under different brands names.  A committee should be set up to investigate the establishment of a national drug industry.  As it is, we have little or no control over the cost of medicines.  It should be possible to provide 20 essential compounds for general medical practice and hospital use.  The duplication and the massive advertising indicate the profitability there is in this drug industry.  Certain firms pay back a certain percentage of their profits to the Government but this, in itself, is not right.  It is not right that the patient should be taxed, having had to pay his rates, his income tax and possibly voluntary health insurance.  There is a double turnover tax on medicines, imposed by successive Fianna Fáil Governments.  Rationalisation of the drug industry and the pharmaceutical industry is very desirable in a small country like ours.  It should be quite a simple exercise. Incentives could be offered to existing pharmaceutical companies to help them to export.  We should not spend the amount we do importing medicines from Germany, Holland, France, the United States of America and Britain. We are not justified in doing that.  It should be possible to establish our own manufacturing industry which would distribute 20 or 30 of the most widely used essential medical compounds.</P>
    <P>On 1st April there will be a change-over in the Eastern Health Board region to the choice of doctor system. If the two tier system is abolished there will be a massive increase in the cost of medicines.  It is a fact that these have increased only once since 1947.  That was an increase of some 25 per cent.  A certain part of the fees <Col N="1547" /> paid by the health boards will be paid back by way of tax.  I do not think the profession can complain.  If the boards go broke the Minister will have to find the money somewhere.  There is a guaranteed 16s; possibly 8s of that will go back by way of tax.  I am sure allowance was made for that in the calculations.</P>
    <P>The medical card will not disappear under the choice of doctor scheme.  We will still have to forward them to the local authority.  There should be a flat rate.  If the scheme is estimated to cost £500,000 to £600,000 for one-third of the population, roughly 800,000 people, in the first year and since most of the capital equipment has already been provided by way of large dispensaries <Col N="1548" /> and surgeries the actual cost of providing a choice of doctor service on a fee per item basis would not seem to be a massive sum.  The estimated total cost is 3 to 4 per cent of the £84.3 million the Minister mentioned.  I think the ceiling should be raised from £1,600 to £2,000 per year.  In 1961 we adumbrated the free choice of doctor scheme in our policy document and we are glad that a year ago the Minister adverted to that; we were the first to put it down in black and white.</P>
