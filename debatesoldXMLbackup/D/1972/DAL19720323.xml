      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Business in the following order: Nos. 1, 3 and 21.  Questions will be taken from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the remark with which the Minister for Justice opened his reply to the Question on the Adjournment last night, in which he appeared to reflect on the loyalty to this State and its forces of order of Deputy Fox as a member of the Protestant community and to subsequent remarks by the Minister for Transport and Power during which he was heard to call Deputy Fox a B Special.  Will the Taoiseach ask the two Ministers in question of withdraw their remarks especially in view of the most unfortunate impression which such behaviour must make at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I read in the newspapers the remark of the Minister for Justice in reply to the debate in which he said he was glad that a conversion would take place, especially in the case of Deputy Fox.  If Deputy Fox read an implication into that I did not see it.  It is a matter for Deputy Fox and his associates.  I did not see any reason for the uproar that was caused by these remarks and especially I did not see any reason for the remark of one of the Fine Gael Deputies in calling the Minister a sectarian scut.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Might I point out to the Taoiseach that during the last general election, in County Monaghan, there was a campaign of vilification adopted against Deputy Fox on the basis that he was a B Special and that that remark was repeated in this House by one of the Taoiseach's former Ministers, Mr. Kevin Boland, and that Mr. Boland, as the man that he is, withdrew that remark.  In that context the remarks of the Minister for Justice last night&mdash;he is normally a man for whom I have respect&mdash; were read by everybody in the House and outside it as a repetition of this vilification against one of the 5 per cent in this country, and common decency demands that they be withdrawn?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, the Taoiseach is responsible for the behaviour of members of his Government. Secondly, the Minister was asked to clarify his remark as to whether he meant what it was thought he meant and he refused to do so, thereby confirming the implication.  Thirdly, this was further confirmed by the Minister for Transport and Power, referring to Deputy Fox again as a B. Special.  In these circumstances can we ask if the Taoiseach has any responsibility for the behaviour of his Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was anything of a sectarian nature in the remarks of the Minister for Justice I will ask him here and now to withdraw any sectarian implications in so far as his remarks were so interpreted by the people opposite.  He will do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make my position very clear.  I endeavoured to reply last night to the debate on the Adjournment. I did not succeed.  Indeed, I succeeded in uttering one sentence and although I remained on my feet for seven minutes after that I was unable to make any further contribution to the debate, notwithstanding your best efforts and my best efforts to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sentence with which I opened what were meant to be my remarks was apparently taken up by Fine Gael Deputies as meaning something which I certainly did not intend it to mean. I made no reference, either express or implied, to Deputy Fox's religion.  It has been alleged this morning by Deputy FitzGerald that in addition I made some implication about his loyalty to the forces of this State.  Certainly what I said did not do that either.  If I expressly or by implication made any derogatory comment whatever on Deputy Fox's religion or his loyalty to the forces of the State I would immediately and without reservation withdraw any such remark or any such implication.  There was no <Col N="2296" /> such remark and there was no such implication.  Therefore, I cannot in all honesty withdraw what I did not say or what I did not do.  I have no wish whatever, I had not last night and I have not now, and I never had and never will have, to reflect in any way on anybody's religion.  I did not do it and, therefore, I cannot withdraw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I said the bulk of what I wanted to say on this motion but it is essential to draw the matters together.  About 40 years ago I went to the Blasket Islands one summer and there were 60 families living there at that time.  About 15 years ago the whole population was taken off the Blaskets and taken over to Dún Chaoin.  Of course Dún Chaoin is now disappearing rapidly and an effort has been made to close the national school there.  At that time there was a national school on the Blasket Islands.</P>
      <P>This is a real instance of what will happen if we join the Common Market. This island will be a greater Blasket. It will be deserted by the people and the population will drop away again. It will be down to what was forecast 30 years ago by Dr. Roy Geary, 2,500,000 people.  Of course it will be a very elegant ranch&mdash;I suppose the finest in the world.  The big farmers, as the Minister so glibly said, and the small farmers will get the same rate but of course the small farmers will not have enough to live on.  Since they pay no income tax, if this Government remain in office the big farmers will become wealthier and wealthier.  We will have a divided community of the haves and have-nots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan quite rightly drew attention to the position in Laois/ Offaly.  As I said before, Laois/Offaly is a super-depressed area and if we go into the Common Market it will be much worse.  Let me give an example of what will happen.  We have 100,000 unemployed today because of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement which was made by this Government. We are exactly half-way through the reduction of the tariffs and we will abolish the tariffs completely on industrial goods in five years if we go into the EEC.  I cannot understand what has happened to the two wings of the great Sinn Féin Party, the party that killed and buried the &ldquo;Mickey Mousers&rdquo; of the old Irish National Party in 1918.  Why the sell out?  At least the men who sold out in 1800 got large sums of money by present-day standards.  They got titles and honours.  There was bribery on a <Col N="2309" /> wholesale scale.  It is quite obvious that there is no bribery in this, except the expenditure of a great deal of our resources on the effort by the Government to get us into Europe.</P>
    <P>The Government are keen on this sell-out because of a world movement towards free trade.  Any day now that movement may go into reverse.  It has continued for an extraordinarily long period of time, roughly speaking over 20 years.  On the whole, especially in view of the way the United States behaved up to a certain period, it has brought a great deal of prosperity to the world.  As I read out last night from the British Ambassador in Paris, the European Economic Community has come to a standstill and this is the argument which is now being put to the British as to why they should go in.</P>
    <P>One reason why the Government are so keen to take us into Europe is that they are completely barren of ideas.  They have been so long in office that the few able men among them are tired, and the bulk of the Ministers are children, as I said before.  Yesterday the Minister for Finance talked at considerable length about the great arrangements that were made in Brussels when he was there a few weeks ago.  Let us be clear about it. There is no subject I was fonder of when I was a student than foreign exchanges. I often regretted that I did not specialise in them as distinct from specialising in the economics of agriculture. Of course at that time all the talk was about agriculture.  If I had known the way monetary matters would go I would have specialised in great detail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit old now.  I keep my eye on the matter.  We were told three months ago by the central bankers and all the people who took part in the discussions at Washington that they had fixed up the foreign exchanges.  It took only a couple of months for the whole edifice to be in ruins.  What is being attempted in the Common Market at present, to have fixed exchange rates, is not <Col N="2310" /> possible.  It is contrary to a natural law.  The natural law is that currencies exchange for one another in proportion to their internal purchasing power and therefore if the money of one country, like ours, is depreciating very rapidly you cannot, through time, maintain its parity with other currencies if they are maintaining their purchasing power.  This is a well-known theory which was thought up by Professor Gustav Cassel of Sweden in the twenties when there were large movements of currencies.</P>
      <P>This idea in Europe at present of fixing the rate of currencies and allowing them to move by 1 per cent or 2 per cent only is all rubbish.  Anybody who suggests that you can get rid of gold from the international monetary system is an idiot as I said last night about certain other people.  Gold has lasted for 2,500 years for currency purposes.  It has lasted ever since it was suggested by Aristotle in Greece as the basis for international currency. Of course the other great Greek philosopher, Plato, took the point of view which the Americans have been trying to sell to the world, that currency should be paper.  Plato had the common sense to say that the paper currency should only circulate inside one country.  He did not suggest that it should be the reserve currency for transactions between countries.  He was a sensible man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot persuade the so-called specialists in currency to see common sense.  The facts of life will teach them common sense.  There is no doubt about the urge which the countries of the Common Market have to fix the relative values of their currencies and in which they have now apparently been joined by Britain if we are to believe what was said following the meeting between Monsieur Pompidou and Mr. Heath.  The English have departed from the American system.  They were with the Americans.  Their sterling was reserve currency with the dollar until it could no longer bear the weight of it.  They had not sufficient resources. Therefore, they withdrew sterling in effect as a reserve currency.  They have now gone a step further.  There is a special reason for this; this is the fact <Col N="2311" /> that their external reserves have increased enormously and therefore they can move; they are not caught. They are joining with the French in the attitude that gold had to be maintained as the real basis for currency in international trade.  For myself, I would rather trust gold than any piece of paper; in other words, I would rather trust gold than any man and especially a country like the United States which has a deficit of 30 billion dollars this year in its Budget.  So far as spending money goes they leave even our present Government far behind, although I think our Government are learning rapidly from them.</P>
    <P>Those who believe in gold as the basis of international money have had to endure a great deal of rubbish in recent years.  At one time I spoke a great deal about the subject to my students but I have given it up for some years now because I could not see any hope of making any impression on those in charge of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The Fund is supposed to be a bank and the Bank is supposed to be a fund, I am told, but that does not surprise me.  Nothing surprises me about this kind of carry-on when you call something by one name and it is in fact something else.</P>
    <P>In spite of what the Minister for Finance said yesterday I take it that even the most inexpert people can now read between the lines and are now aware of what has happened to this paper system, paper gold, and so on. The most important thing by far if we go into the Common Market is the promise made to us that there would be more employment, that there will be 50,000 more people at work in industry. They will leave agriculture, presumably, and go into industry.  Anybody who believes this would believe anything, just as the same is true of anybody who believes we shall get £40 million or £30 million a year from the Agricultural Fund.  I want to be blunt about this: I should much rather see Dr. Paisley as Taoiseach here than see us in the Common Market.  At least he has voted against going into the Common Market in the British House <Col N="2312" /> of Commons and to that extent he is on my side, or I am on his side, whichever way you like.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what kind of poltroons are in the two big parties in this House to have swallowed this, hook, line and sinker.  The old Sinn Féin Party and the two branches of it which existed after the Civil War, stood on their own feet.  From where did the two big parties get this death wish? What is the cause of it?  Is it a fact that the older men in the Government have been there so long that they are tired and worn out mentally and the others are so inexpert that they listen to the bureaucrats and nothing else?</P>
    <P>There is one country to which I should like to compare us since we were far superior to them prior to the second World War.  I am referring to Norway.  <i>The Common Market</i> and <i>the Common Man</i>, this very useful document circulated to us, shows that the average income per person employed in Norway in 1968 was 4,100 dollars and the average income per person employed in the Irish Republic was 2,400 dollars.  This is the exact reverse of the pre-war position.  We get various explanations such as that the Norwegians had shipping, that they had worthwhile fishery fleets and, above all, that they had forests and that the price of timber went up much more than any other product after the war.  The explanation does not matter: obviously we have lost.  We are always being told to compare our incomes with the incomes of the countries in the Common Market.  Let me compare that 2,400 dollars with the 4,000 in Norway, which is not in the Common Market and which, according to rumour, will not go in.  Did not one of the most senior politicians there resign on the issue of the Common Market?  If we believe what we are now told, the Common Market referendum in Norway will be lost in that the vote will not favour going in.  For this reason I hope our referendum will not be held until after the various referenda have been held all over western Europe in the next three or four months.  Otherwise, you will have the position mentioned here yesterday. Suppose France votes &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and the English Parliament say <Col N="2313" />&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and we vote &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; where are we then?  Suppose Norway and Denmark vote &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  There can be any combination among these five.  I am glad to believe, as I have already said, that our referendum will not be held for quite a while.</P>
    <P>About a month ago I asked a simple question in the House as to why the Government did not accept the offer of General de Gaulle of associate membership of the Common Market. The question was ruled out of order on the grounds that it contained argument. Where is the argument in it?  I think it was a disgrace to rule it out of order and it was an outrage on the House.  I protested about it at the time. There is no argument in the question which was a straightforward one.  I got no reply to that question.  This is not the first question about Foreign Affairs matters to which I did not get a reply.  I asked a number of questions about the bilateral trade agreements and these were not answered either on the grounds that the great gentlemen in the Department of Foreign Affairs would have to do some work on the matter.  I made a very appropriate remark at that time when I asked if they were afraid to dirty their minds with a little honest work.  These questions have never been answered.</P>
    <P>For example, I asked on how many occasions were the Germans in breach of their bilateral trade agreements with us.  The only man from whom I got an honest reply was Deputy Blaney. On one occasion, when they refused to accept some cattle, I asked if that was the only occasion, and he said no, it was not the only occasion.  What are we afraid of?  Are we just a lot of little shivering children that we cannot stand up and be counted?  I despise cowardice; I have always despised it in myself any time I have seen it.  We had another example of this yesterday when the Ceann Comhairle informed Deputy Fox that he could ask his question today if the Department agreed.  He did not say if the Minister agreed.</P>

I got no reply but when I was passing the postal window at 2.55 p.m.  I found the letter addressed to me although the question had been put down ten days previously.

      <P>I am suggesting that there is and has been continuously a specific attempt by the Government to stifle serious criticism of the effort they are making to take us into Europe.  In 1961 I accused the Press of this country of a conspiracy of silence on the argument against joining the Common Market.  I am glad to be able to say that one newspaper, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, made their column available to me and I contributed a long article to the paper.  What I said then has been vindicated.  I said that Britain would not go in.  I also said that Mr. Lemass was not doing a bad job, that he was succeeding in making our industrialists more efficient by threatening them with this big stick but the matter has gone on for too long.  I hope it goes on even longer.  There was no air of reality in this debate until Deputy Oliver Flanagan spoke yesterday.</P>

      <P>We are told that it is of the greatest importance that the people are given clear and precise information of what membership of the Community means for the country because it is for the people to decide this issue.  What have the Government done to supply the people with this precise information? Nothing.  Continuously they have made available prejudiced and one-sided information.  If we have any doubt as to how this can happen, let us look at England where the Labour Government produced one White Paper and the Conservatives a different one on the same subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much talk of what will be the position regarding the price of beef cattle.  I shall make a forecast. Yesterday, in answer to an interruption that was not very bright, I said that dropped calves are now fetching almost £60 each because of the prospects of entering the Common Market. What about the 10 cwt beasts that are being sold at £140 each?  Are they to be killed and eaten in the Common Market?  That is not the case.  It is suggested that the British Government are easing off the situation and allowing food prices to rise so that, if Britain joins, the jolt will not be too great.  If we join, our people are in for a very nasty surprise.  I would much prefer that we should stand on our own feet as we have been doing more or less for the past 50 years.  Why are we needed in Europe?  I do not understand the effort being made by Brussels to bring us in but if I might express a suspicion, they want an aircraft carrier far out in the Atlantic and we are the only one that is available.  Regardless of what the Government may say about defence commitments and so on, these will come afterwards.  I cannot see what other value we could be to Europe other than as an aircraft carrier or a site for intercontinental ballistic missiles.  We have had visits from various EEC commissioners, Dr. Mansholt, <Col N="2316" /> Signor Spinelli and many others. What is all the fuss about?</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Government conducted the negotiations in the way they have done.  As I have said, I thought there was an agreement between the British and ourselves that they would negotiate toughly and we would indicate we were delighted to go in and would accept all the obligations. Muna bhfuil ach pocán gabhair agat, bí i lar an aonaigh leis.  One does not sell the goat by saying that he is a worthless animal.  One says he is a fine animal and describes him in glowing terms.  We have not sold this country to Europe in the way we should have sold it.  Therefore, the terms of our entry are very bad and I pay no heed to this talk of five years guarantee for this or that.  We were for 40 years in the common market of Great Britain and Ireland before it started to bite. We must remember that the famine occurred only in the 40s of the last century and, on the whole, this country, relative to Britain, was in as good a position population wise as it was in the year 1800.  From then on and especially from 1850 to 1875, although our farmers who are engaged in extensive farming did well, and the Land League was not formed until the dreadful depression from 1875 onwards, the population decreased.  Anybody who thinks that a country without a population is without any significance should begin to look at reality.  I am grateful to the Minister for Labour and Social Welfare for having listened to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow the last speaker along the many avenues he pursued regarding whether we should join the Common Market.  I shall merely state my own views and what have been my own views for many years regarding our integration with Europe.  Closer integration with our colleagues in Europe is a desirable and worthwhile objective and for the first time in our history we have an opportunity, not to join some domineering block, but to become equal partners in an association which I think had to come about ultimately.  I know there is not sufficient time for all <Col N="2317" /> speakers to contribute to the debate and to deal with it in the manner which they feel it deserves.  I will endeavour in the time available to me to relate my remarks to how I feel membership will affect the Departments of Labour and Social Welfare, without attempting to go into any detail.  I would like to refer to a recent debate where it was said that we were not, in these Departments, gearing ourselves or taking sufficient interest.  I want to say at the outset that there has been considerable consultation between the officials of both my Departments in Brussels in relation to the matters which will directly affect us in these Departments when we become members.</P>
      <P>We have already done most of the preliminary work necessary in preparation for the different matters that will be of direct concern to us.  As Minister for Labour, I am particularly concerned with worker-training.  Our economic success will, to a great extent, depend in future on the extent to which we can provide training to update and extend the skills of our industrial workers and to meet the needs of this technological age.  Nobody disputes that.  It is only right that I should be concerned with matters in relation to Common Market policy and Treaties, as they affect us.  There will be pressing need to ensure that workers leaving agriculture or declining industries will be retrained for industrial employment with the minimum delay. Worker-training is one of the areas in which we should benefit substantially when we join the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only concerned with factual matters as they have been provided for in the existing regulations.  The resources of the European Social Fund will be available to assist us in the expansion of our retraining and resettlement schemes.  Already 1,300,000 workers are benefiting from expenditure from the fund on retraining and resettlement schemes.  We are not talking, as Deputy O'Donovan would have suggested, as if everything was likely to happen in the future. In retrospect, we have a good deal of knowledge of what the workings <Col N="2318" /> of these things are.  I am deriving knowledge from and basing arrangements on matters as they have been working, and as we will have to face them in accordance with the letter of the regulations.  For that reason I see tremendous hope in the practical assistance that is available to us for training workers.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund was originally established by the Community to improve employment opportunities and raise the standard of living of workers.  The fund has recently been reorganised.  As Deputies know, and as some Deputies have already said, it has been reorganised so as to make it a more positive instrument in formulating and bringing about a policy capable of coping with future economic and social changes.  We must always expect changes.  The Community and the people who form it are not a lot of simpletons.  They are people who are capable of maintaining the necessary flexibility that progress demands, as it does in any Parliament.  It is envisaged that expenditure from the fund will be of the order of 50 million dollars this year, increasing to 250 million dollars a year when it is fully in operation. This is a very considerable sum of money by any standard.  Nobody can denigrate the importance of this fund. We stand to benefit considerably from it.</P>
    <P>Among the objectives of the Community are the promotion throughout the Community of the harmonious development of economic activity&mdash; this is what the EEC is all about&mdash; continued and balanced expansion, an increase in stability, an accelerated raising of the standard of living.  This is why the Community came into being in the first instance.  This is why they continue at an accelerated pace.  As with any other bloc or association of nations they will have their peaks and valleys, subject to world conditions to some extent, but certainly the member states must stand to suffer less from any world recession than if they were standing out alone.</P>
    <P>Assistance from this fund may be given towards eliminating long-term structural unemployment, underemployment and training manpower, as well as operations that tend to give <Col N="2319" /> employment to disabled workers, older workers and younger workers.  This will include expenditure on training and retraining, resettlement, career guidance, income maintenance, the elimination of obstacles which make access to employment difficult for handicapped workers and the promotion of better conditions in regions of slow development.  These things are all of major importance to us, particularly, in the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>Assistance from the fund is granted at the rate of 50 per cent of the public expenditure on projects of training, retraining and resettlement of workers. We do not stress sufficiently the importance of that very tangible benefit for which we, in the Department, are already preparing to submit our application. In simple language, this all means that we will have a great deal more money available for expanding our training, retraining and resettlement schemes.  The relevant Community Regulations have been examined in detail in my Department. Work is proceeding on the drawing-up of an application for aid from the fund.  I wanted to say that in place of some of the statements made nobody, seemingly, was making any definite move towards providing for the benefits which will undoubtedly accrue in this respect.  The whole range of training and retraining will be co-ordinated and fitted into an overall plan for submission to the Commission with our application.  An application will be submitted to the Commission in good time, so that we may be able to obtain the maximum benefit from the fund as from the date of our accession.</P>
    <P>It is too early to put an exact figure on the amount of benefit we will receive from the fund, but it will be substantial.  It will be based on the amount we spend on projects and schemes which will be submitted and approved.  It is clear that the money which AnCO are spending on training centres will qualify for recoupment from the fund.  This is important. AnCO have four training centres at the present time.  There is a new centre in Dublin.  The Cork centre is due to <Col N="2320" /> open shortly and the Gweedore Gaeltacht centre is due to open this year. That will be six centres.  Then there are three mobile centres.  We refer to them as mobile centres although in the strict sense they are not mobile.  Perhaps they could more appropriately be called itinerant centres.  They are not permanently established in any particular place.  These centres are at Athlone, Tralee and Ballina, and they do a specific job of training.</P>
    <P>I mention these things to show that this type of training is well and truly established.  A considerable number of workers have already been trained.  It is necessary that we should make rapid progress in the future and we have planned to do this.  In that context we stand to obtain definite, tangible benefits from membership of the EEC.  We may speculate as to what is good and bad in membership, as to what we may obtain and what we may lose.  I am talking about something which is available to us and for which we are already making preparations.  We need considerably more money if we are to accelerate the pace of training.  Let us face the fact that the many millions we require are not available from our present resources, and to get access to the necessary moneys is in itself something which would justify our membership.</P>
    <P>A resettlement allowances scheme is very important in the context of the changes in industrial methods, new industries or the decline of industries, that will inevitably result from membership. The resettlement allowances scheme under the National Manpower Service which will promote this geographical mobility of workers as well as a careers information service will also benefit from this fund.</P>
    <P>There is also freedom of movement for workers within the EEC, but we have negotiated a five-year transitional period in this respect which means that the present system of permits for workers coming here for employment will continue for five years.  One can immediately see the need for that, in that some people fear we might have many technically qualified persons coming here to take advantage of jobs of that type for which we might not <Col N="2321" /> have sufficient people trained.  We do issue permits at the moment for persons of this calibre coming to this country when they are not available here.  That system will continue until 1st January, 1978.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A permit is not normally issued where there is a suitably qualified Irish worker available to take up the position.  The Government have negotiated this arrangement because of the relatively high level of unemployment and to allay any anxiety about the employment situation during a period when Irish industry would be adapting itself to free trade conditions.  We should be in a position to use the transition period, with the assistance I have already mentioned, to update our skills and to supply the labour market with the necessary skilled labour force which would obviate any worry about the future after 1978.</P>
      <P>Nationals of the EEC member states who move within the Community and seek work or take up employment must be given equality with nationals of the host country in the filling of vacancies and are guaranteed full equality of treatment in other matters relating to their jobs.  There are also vacancy clearance arrangements within the EEC whereby supply and demand of labour are kept in contact with each other.  This involves the issue of monthly statements listing people seeking work in any of the other member states and also listing offers of employment to a European office and to other member states. There is a very significant limitation here&mdash;and this I should like to emphasise&mdash;that offers of employment refer only to vacancies which cannot be filled from the national labour market; in other words, if we advertise or notify existing vacancies here they are only those which we cannot fill ourselves. There is nothing seriously at fault there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2322" /> An important point is that a member state can request a suspension or a suspension in part of these free movement arrangements if they feel that there is or there is likely to be a threat to living standards, or to employment in a region or a particular occupation.  Free movement does not apply to the public service.  There are also limitations on the ground of security and of health.  Therefore, the safeguards in regard to free movement of people are adequate and satisfactory and, from the point of view of the Department of Labour, most beneficial.</P>
    <P>The question we must ask here is to what extent this right of workers to move freely within the Community will affect this country.  I do not expect that there will be any great influx of workers into Ireland for the simple reason that workers move to the areas where most work is available.  I suppose that is fairly evident to everybody. Experience shows that for a person seeking work the attraction is towards the centres where there is full employment, in other words, where there are more jobs than people to fill them.  We are unlikely to reach that happy situation in Ireland for some time to come.  Here I would say that, despite the best estimates that can be made, I believe that once we get moving towards full employment, nothing succeeds like success.  That is my own personal view founded on some experience.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper, the creation of a net additional 50,000 jobs over the transitional period is envisaged.  This should lead to a progressive reduction in unemployment and involuntary emigration.  I use the word &ldquo;involuntary&rdquo; in relation to emigration, because I suppose there will always be people who wish to emigrate.  So long as they are not driven to emigrate for economic reasons, then we can say we have not an emigration problem.  It is interesting that we should be talking about this question of emigration now at a time when emigration has been running at its lowest ever figure and, we must admit, creating problems that one did not anticipate a short time ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2323" /> I should like now to say a few words about industrial relations.  We have all been concerned with certain areas in which we will be obliged to comply with Community law and many people, trade unionists in particular, apparently believe that we may have to align our industrial relations system with the type of system operating in the EEC member states. I should like to take this opportunity to assure these people that this will not be the case.  There are no binding Community instruments in the industrial relations area and, because of the diversity of the industrial relations systems in the various countries, I cannot see any major changes in this field; in other words, we will be free to pursue our own system.  I would hope, of course, that as members of the enlarged Community we would take from the Community all that is good in order to bring about better industrial relations.  Nothing is imposed on us and we are under no obligation to adopt any Community law in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government have examined the alternatives to full membership of an enlarged Community, an enlarged Community which will include Britain. It is rather surprising at this stage to find people accusing us of not having examined the alternatives.  We did not apply for membership yesterday. It is a long time since our application was submitted and surely it has had sufficiently serious consideration by everybody by this.  Those who argue against membership have had plenty of time to prepare a proper case.  They do not seem to have done this and, in the absence of a proper case, one can only conclude that they have not bothered.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied there is no realistic alternative.  Deputy O.J. Flanagan said last night that we have always said there was no alternative.  In actual fact, there are several alternatives, but there is no realistic alternative compatible with the objective of increasing employment and improving the standard of living.  That is the assertion we make.  Some opponents to full membership point to the fact that <Col N="2324" /> countries like Sweden, Switzerland and Austria are not seeking membership but have applied for trading arrangements; if they are getting free trading in the industrial sphere there is no question of their adhering to the common agricultural policy.  This has been answered several times and I think everybody is now familiar with the position; it is absurd to compare the position of countries with less than 4 per cent agricultural exports with our position with approximately 50 per cent exports.</P>
    <P>If we were to seek a trading agreement instead of full membership our industry would face free trade competition in any event.  Those who talk about associate membership signify to me that they see some good in membership but would prefer to trail behind instead of being full members. These people do not seem to have the faith they should have in our people to play their full part as members.</P>
    <P>On the social welfare side, there has been a good deal of misunderstanding about the effect of entrance to the Community on our systems of social security.  There is a great variety of social security systems in the member states.  Each has a compulsory general system for wage and salary earners up to a certain income for the nine benefits covered by the International Labour Convention on minimum standards of social security.  In addition, there are special schemes for certain occupations such as mining and those who are self-employed in farming. Social security contributions and benefits are usually related to incomes.  In general, the systems adhere to the insurance principle.  Most of them rely on employers' and insured persons' contributions for the bulk of their finances.  They draw on the Exchequer to a limited extent only.  While there is a broad similarity in scope in the general systems of the Six and the methods of financing them and calculating contributions and benefits, there is no uniformity in the rates of contributions or benefits.</P>
    <P>There is no European normal standard of social security to which this country would be obliged to conform as a condition of entry.  Under Article <Col N="2325" /> 118 of the Treaty, the Commission is required to promote close collaboration between member states in almost all fields of social policy.  This is something we should welcome.  While the Treaty of Rome does not contain any specific provision for the introduction of a single or uniform system of social security throughout the member states, it does refer to harmonisation and the regulations, as I have pointed out, refer to collaboration.  There is, in fact, a gradual trend in the Community towards convergence of the systems of social security and it is expected that this broad tendency towards harmonisation will make itself felt in Ireland after entry.</P>
    <P>The Community regulations dealing with the social security of migrant workers are binding on member states and over-ride any reciprocal agreements unless these are specifically provided for; these regulations result from the Community objective of permitting the free movement of labour. They cover all questions arising in regard to social security in the case of wage earners and dependants who move within the Community.  They relate to social security benefits for sickness, maternity, invalidity, old age, survivors, whom we refer to as widows and orphans, employment accidents and diseases, death, unemployment and family payments.  The latter we call children's allowances.  Basically, the objective of the regulations is to ensure that nationals of one member state will not suffer any handicap in acquiring title to and payment of benefit by moving to another member state.  Migrants carry their acquired rights to social security with them when they move from one member state to another and, when a claim for benefit is made, insurance in the former country, or countries, is fully reckonable for the purpose of satisfying contribution conditions and, when payment is authorised, it may be made to a person resident in another member state.</P>
    <P>The manner in which these objectives are to be achieved is dealt with at length in the regulations.  After Ireland accedes to the Community these regulations will replace the <Col N="2326" /> existing series of reciprocal arrangements we have with the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland.  They differ in some respects, but we will have a much better set of reciprocal arrangements as members of the enlarged Community.  The present reciprocal arrangements we have do not cover children's allowances. When the new regulations are operative it will be possible for an Irish worker in Britain to be paid British children's allowances for his family in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In regard to unemployment, provision is made for full merging of previous insurance.  That is, when a worker has, following employment in one state become unemployed in another state.  Up to now this existed only in a limited way and there was provision for payment of unemployment benefits for a limited period only to persons who go to seek work in other countries.  In other words, in relation to national insurance and the benefits derived from it, one can say that these benefits are interchangeable, payable from one country to another as if they applied to only one country.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one point which I think is very important concerning social insurance.  It is dealt with in the part of the White Paper which deals with the implications for the Exchequer of entry to the Community. An annual net saving of £25 million to £30 million will result from entry.  It is the firm intention of the Government to draw on this substantial sum to cushion, for those in receipt of social welfare payments, especially pensioners, the effects of living costs brought about by any increases in prices of essential commodities as a result of entry to the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat what others have said that we do not envisage any significant increase in prices as a result of EEC membership.  There have been several wild, distorted allegations made that the cost of living will increase sharply when we join.  These allegations are, of course, groundless.  The only two products in respect of which significant prices rises are expected are milk and beef and the result will be a very modest rise in the overall cost of <Col N="2327" /> living.  Moreover, it is important to remember that outside the EEC we will still face the necessity of raising farm prices anyhow in an effort to bring farm incomes up to the level of people in industrial employment.  If this is not done by higher prices, it must be done by increased subsidies and the burden of these subsidies must, in turn, raise the cost of living for all taxpayers. That is an important point for the anti-marketeers who would say that we could do all these things outside the Common Market without any serious impact on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In regard to savings on agricultural subsidies I have the authority of the Government to state that social requirements will be a first charge on savings in this respect.  I would hope that the improvements in social welfare rates, the expansion of existing schemes and the introduction of new schemes as outlined in the Third Programme for Social and Economic Development would be accelerated and the day brought nearer when we can achieve that improved position.  We have at the moment preliminary arrangements made for bringing in pay related benefits so far as some of our social welfare benefits are concerned.  This we would hope to extend to pensions.  We recently raised the insurable limit to £1,600.  We would hope to abolish that and introduce insurance on a broader scale even for self-employed persons. These things will be brought nearer by our membership of the Common Market and, indeed, our need to harmonise and to collaborate with other countries whose systems admittedly are better than ours.  For the nine basic benefits under social security we have a sufficient coverage to justify our association with the other countries.  I have already referred to these.  There is sickness, maternity, invalidity, old age, survivors, which is widowhood, accident/diseases, death, unemployment and family payments, which are children's allowances.  We have the necessary spread of the social security code to justify our membership.  I would not say we actually have but we desire to extend and I personally think that the expansion of the scheme and the improvement <Col N="2328" /> of rates are things which are being advocated by everybody and the limit of which is set only by the availability of resources.</P>
    <P>I hope and I feel confident that the area in which we could show the most rapid advance on becoming a member of the Community would be in a general improvement of our whole social welfare code.  There is no mystery about what we require.  There is nobody trying to deny that we would like pensions at an earlier age, an increase in the amounts being paid, an extension of some of the schemes that we are already operating and a general improvement in the rates all round. This is something that gives one an exciting interest in the years immediately ahead as far as social security is concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to refute something that has been used in a rather naïve manner for the purpose of making the small farmers of rural Ireland fear what might happen in the Common Market.  The phrase &ldquo;small farmers' dole&rdquo; is being used which is a phrase I do not like.  What is being said is that unemployment assistance will not be payable to small farmers.  I should like to repudiate that.  There is no such thing as a scheme of small farmers' dole.  Unemployment assistance is paid to everybody in the same manner, requiring the same qualifications from small farmers, tailors or butchers. There is no difference.  When this reference is made to small farmers' dole people are referring to the method of assessing means which is based on valuation and has nothing to do with the other necessary qualifications of being capable of and available for and genuinely seeking and being unable to find employment.</P>

      <P>Closer integration with fellow European countries is long overdue.  Furthermore, some of the <Col N="2331" /> speakers seem to have little faith in the ability of our people, not merely society or the community as a whole, but those who will take part in looking after our interests when we are a member of the Community.  I have had some little part on occasions in international organisations such as the United Nations, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Council of Europe.  I have seen Irishmen at meetings of these organisations in various capacities and they have been as capable as the representatives of any other country.  Some of the speeches I have listened to here against the proposed entry to the European Community would suggest that we would not be able to stand on our own feet or pull our weight as a member.</P>
      <P>We talk about what is likely to happen.  We look back on what has been happening.  We must remember that we will be there as part of the Community, doing our thing as we would like it to be done, co-operating in what the Community was originally established to do, that is, to harmonise, uplift, to improve the standard and expand the economy of all the member states.  We will have a part of that. We will take a part.  We should have some confidence in ourselves and in our people to play a full part in reaping the fruits of membership, obviating disadvantages which are bound to arise in this new situation in which we will find ourselves.  We are well capable of doing it.  If we do not give ourselves an opportunity to do it, future generations will blame us.  I hope the motion will be carried and that we will be given an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits we can derive from membership of the European enlarged Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to quite a number of speeches in this debate.  There have been serious and intelligent contributions on both sides. Deputy Keating's contribution merited close attention.  I did not find it convincing; I found it contained certain internal contradictions which I shall return to later but it was a serious attempt to present a case against <Col N="2332" /> membership.  Other speeches descended to a level of triviality which is disturbing in relation to a matter as serious as this.</P>
      <P>The last two speeches against had one theme in common, a theme which they both urged as an important and significant point on the question of entry, that was, that the people in Europe get up earlier than we do and we would not be up to dealing with them because of the early hour at which they rose.  When this is the common theme of several speeches against and this is the level at which the matter is discussed, one despairs of having a serious discussion of this whole matter.</P>
      <P>The Labour motion putting down an amendment makes several points and criticises the negotiations.  I think Labour speakers have also criticised the White Paper.  There is some measure of common ground on these points between us.  The White Paper was grossly inadequate in a number of respects.  Indeed, I made that comment as soon as it was produced.  In fact, I listed many of the things that were not in it and which should have been in it.  It produces a number of figures as to the likely effects of membership on this country some of which seem reasonable to me.  It is entirely possible that they represent an accurate order of magnitude of the changes that will take place but as no reasons whatever are given for this, as no explanation is vouchsafed as to how the figures are arrived at and as there is no evidence that any calculations were, in fact, done and that the figures were not taken out of a hat, the document is in this respect unconvincing and the failure in the White Paper to make any real case as regards the quantification of the gains of membership has left the whole burden of dealing with this to the Fine Gael Party.  Indeed, it is significant that, so far, the main burden of the referendum campaign has rested on us.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from that, basically, the White Paper has been largely invalidated to anybody concerned with economic reality.  There are particular deficiencies in it which merit legislation and on which I suggest Labour and ourselves have common ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2333" /> I think the reference in the White Paper to the situation at the end of ten years is disingenuous.  I cannot reconcile that statement with the actual decision-making system in the Community in relation to this matter and I am disturbed that a document&mdash;we all know it was prepared by civil servants &mdash;with which the Government have not had much to do could appear.  One wonders whether the statement in the White Paper represents what the civil servants think.  If so, one must be worried.  Perhaps, in this instance the politicians' hands descended and changed the words to state something other than what I think to be the truth.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the White Paper is that the statement in it in regard to our alternatives are very vague and seriously defective.  There is no attempt in it to assess the alternatives adequately.  That part of the White Paper does not bring out at all the dilemma we face if we stay out after Britain effectively repudiates her trade agreement with us next January.  We will be faced with the alternative of either doing nothing and having our exports excluded from the British market or signing a trade agreement under which we would have to give free trade in our market in return for trade on the British and the EEC markets.  That is not an attractive alternative.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the White Paper does not make any attempt to indicate the kind of terms that we might get for agricultural products under any kind of agreement with the EEC if we were outside it.  There is no attempt to set out the terms other countries have got. Such an indication is necessary because our people must understand exactly how serious such a situation could be in regard to our agricultural industry. Our people must be told in concrete terms what sort of concessions, if any, the Community have given to other agricultural producers exporting the kind of goods we produce.  It is only in that way that the Irish people can assess the effect of a decision to stay out of the Community.  The White Paper does not make any reference to the Argentinian or Yugoslav agreements on beef or to the New Zealand agreement on dairy produce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2334" /> I have been conscious of all these things during this campaign and I still am conscious of them.  I wonder were the Government trying to lose the campaign.  Not alone that, but I wondered at the ineptitude of the Government&mdash;if they are trying to win this campaign.  If they wish to do so, they must put the facts before the Irish people.  The people must be given the full facts, including the unfortunate alternatives.  They must be told bluntly what are the consequences of staying out.  If the referendum is lost, it will be due largely to the ineptitude of the Government in not telling the people that, for instance, a £140 bullock exported to the Common Market which would fetch £140 on the British market at the moment would be taken from us for nothing, if we could get rid of it.  That is one of the alternatives.</P>
    <P>We must join with the Labour Party in criticising the Government in regard to the negotiations.  Personally, I am not satisfied that the negotiations on fisheries were adequately handled.  I know the political situation.  I know the whole position was pre-empted by the Community decision on fishery policy.  I am not satisfied that we could not have got the same terms as Norway, although I have not understood fully and I have not had explained to me why we took a different line to Norway and why Norway at the end managed to get a declaration on fisheries which we did not get.  I am not sure that different handling would have produced a different result, but I think this should have been explained.</P>
    <P>I think the handling of the sugar matter was particularly inept.  The deal we got on sugar was good but the Government managed to convey to the Irish people the impression that they had lost out.  Of course, they had asked for an absurd figure of 240,000 tons at the full price, or 300,000 tons at the prevailing price, which is twice our present output.  This is in respect of a product of which there is a surplus in the Community.  Any Government responsible for that kind of action could be treated only as having acted frivolously.  It made them look as if they came back from Brussels with <Col N="2335" /> their tails between their legs when, in fact, they had got a deal which guaranteed us a market for an output of sugar in excess of the maximum we have ever produced.  Any Government capable of doing that should not have been in charge of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the negotiations in regard to protocol and the speeches in connection with it.  The wording of the protocol is not, in a sense, all that important.  What is important is the interpretation put on the protocol in the speeches made at the time it was agreed.  The speech by our Minister, unless rebutted, stands as our interpretation of it.  In making that speech, the Minister did not, for some reason, bring in the question of increased employment.  He brought in the question of underemployment and of living standards, but he did not refer to the question of increased employment. I do not understand why not. My understanding is that he was instructed not to do so.  It seems very odd, and I think it was an unfortunate mistake in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it must be said that with the deficiencies to which I have referred, with the apparent weaknesses shown by the Government in the negotiations, the outcome of the agreement, although it may not be as good as we would like, represents to us a substantial net advantage over remaining outside.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, will turn to the question of whether, fundamentally, membership of the EEC will be beneficial to us.  There is a tendency to discuss this very much on the level of individual products at an economic level.  There are fundamental underlying realities behind our relationship with our neighbours in terms of trade and politics which will make membership of the Community beneficial to a country like Ireland.</P>
    <P>First of all, one must be clear about the nature of the EEC.  It is, of course, a customs union.  It is a union in regard to external tariff which on certain products runs as high as 24 per cent, on carpets, for example.  It is 17 per cent on textiles and clothing.  That is an important fact that one must <Col N="2336" /> know because on it depends our assessment of our net gain from membership.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the EEC has a common agricultural policy which is designed to protect farmers inside the Community from being undercut by imports. It is designed, in respect of many products, effectively to ban imports.  It is vital to understand that, but there are still people who are talking in terms of our staying outside and sending our goods to the EEC by cutting our prices a bit.  As I have said, we could cut our prices to nothing and still not get our goods paid for within the EEC.  We must face the fact that a small country like ours is the main beneficiary from membership of the Community.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is aware of any incursions by British troops into the Republic at Douskey, County Monaghan on Sunday, 19th March, 1972; and of reports that live bullets, CS gas and rubber bullets were fired by British troops at people assembled on the Republic side of the Border at Mullanahinch; and if he has made any representations to the British authorities with regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Detailed reports of the incidents at the border on the 19th March have been studied.  I am satisfied that gas canisters, smoke bombs and bullets were fired across the border by British troops and I am further satisfied that British troops crossed the border into the South on a number of occasions that day.  A protest has been lodged with the British authorities and it has once more been pointed out to them that incidents of this nature are a direct result of their ill-advised policy of road cratering.</P>

      <P>I was recently advised by a commercial group that they intended to discuss with the Dublin Port and Docks Board the question of the establishment of an oil refinery in the port of Dublin.  As is usually the case in initial approaches concerning <Col N="2339" /> the establishment of new industry, this approach was on a confidential basis.</P>
      <P>My main concern in this matter would be to ensure that the requirements of the Harbours Act, 1946, and the Foreshore Act, 1933, are complied with.  Assuming that the Dublin Port and Docks Board are prepared to consider this proposal they must apply to me for a Harbour Works Order and for any necessary lease under the Foreshore Act.  No such applications have yet been made to my Department.  If and when they are made they will be published in the normal way and any objections will be carefully considered.</P>
      <P>The permission of Dublin Corporation under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, will also be necessary for any works proposed.</P>

      <P>All unestablished members of the airport security force at Shannon Airport took part in a competition held by the Civil Service <Col N="2344" /> Commissioners in April, 1970, for their establishment as security officers.</P>
      <P>On the recommendation of the Commissioners appointments in an established capacity have been offered to and accepted by most of the officers.</P>
      <P>Decisions by the Commissioners on a number of other officers have not yet been made.</P>
      <P>The grant of established status in the Civil Service is a statutory function of the Civil Service Commissioners with which I cannot interfere.</P>
      <P>A superannuation scheme for unestablished State staff generally has recently been introduced and confers pension benefits very similar to the benefits for established staff.

They are in receipt of an average of £7 per week less than their colleagues who joined the service five or six months ago.  Will the Minister not agree that this is an outrageous situation?

Aerlínte will be represented by their American lawyers and witnesses will be called on their behalf representing the airlines, Shannon Free Airport Development Company and the US travel trade.  No officer of my Department will be attending the hearing as the matter is, in this context, one between the airline and the US licensing authority.

If it is in public, in view of the serious implications of the outcome of the hearing for the national airline, for Shannon Airport and western tourism, it would be desirable that the strongest possible case should be made to the CAB hearing with a view to having the ban against Aer Lingus withdrawn.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give any precise indication of the amount saved in unpaid dental benefits as a result of the withdrawal of a majority of dentists from the dental benefit scheme administered by my Department, but it can be said that it was not substantial.</P>
      <P>Because considerable advance publicity had been given to the intention of dentists to withdraw from the dental benefit scheme, many thousands of persons anticipated the withdrawal and lodged claims for benefit before the strike began.  Treatment under all these claims was carried out during the period of the strike as well as treatment under claims which continued to be received through the substantial number of dentists who remained on the dental panel.  It is expected, moreover, that many insured persons requiring non-urgent treatment will have deferred making a claim until the end of the strike.  This backlog of claims will now have to be dealt with in addition to the normal intake of claims for this period of the year.</P>
      <P>So far as my Department can ascertain only some 1,000 insured persons were unable to obtain under the scheme dental treatment urgently needed, e.g. extractions and fillings, during the period of the strike and were obliged to pay for it as private patients.  The amount saved to the Department as a result would not, it is estimated, exceed £2,500.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to a situation similar to that which arose during the recent dispute with the Irish Dental Association, as a result of which a majority of dentists withdrew from my Department's dental benefit scheme.  In this connection I wish to point out that the dentists who participate in the dental benefit scheme are not employed by my Department.  Each such dentist enters into a contract to provide dental treatment to qualified insured persons in accordance with a prescribed scale of fees.  As I informed the Deputy on Tuesday last, there is no statutory authority which would enable me to reimburse the cost of dental treatment received by insured persons from dentists outside the scheme.  I cannot, therefore, give the assurance sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>No medical doctors are employed by, or are under contract to, my Department to provide medical treatment to insured persons.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the consultations with all interested parties concerning the Government's proposals for the setting up of the National Economic Council have been completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic purpose in attempting to establish a National Economic Council was to allow a wider spectrum of the community to participate in the formulation of national economic policy.  The NIEC, who were consulted in the matter, took the same view.  The Government also considered that if the new council were properly to fulfil its role as a consultative body, competent to give independent advice to the Government on economic policy, membership of the council would be incompatible with membership of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the termination of the mandate of the NIEC in January, 1971, a draft constitution and terms of reference were discussed with interested <Col N="2353" /> bodies over a period of some months and was finally agreed to by all parties except the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who did not find it possible to agree to the non-political character of the proposed council.  Congress have, accordingly, withheld their agreement to the constitution and terms of reference of the council and have declined to participate in its operation.</P>
    <P>As there would be little practical value in a National Economic Council which did not include ICTU representation, the Government do not intend to proceed further with the proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Minister that it is a very serious state of affairs that for six months or thereabouts this impasse has been permitted to continue between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions concerning the composition of the national economic council?  Is there any hope that the Minister might decide to have direct discussions with the congress representatives to resolve this matter?  As the Minister knows perfectly well, the Northern Ireland Economic Council is not regarded as being of a political character.  Members of the Northern Ireland Senate, for example, who are also trade union officials, are members of the council. I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that this situation has come about.  I was certainly anxious to avoid it but I am afraid the Deputy's suggestion is not as useful as he might think in the light of the following facts.  On 16th December last a letter was written to the various interested organisations which said, in effect, that in response to a suggestion from one of the organisations concerned a meeting could be held, arranged between the parties concerned, to see if there was any way out of the difficulty which had been encountered in establishing the council. On 14th January last the ICTU executive council replied that they could not see any useful purpose being served by such a meeting.  In the light of this, I fear the Deputy's suggestion would not advance the position any <Col N="2354" /> further.  I was anxious, certainly, to explore any possibility that existed of getting around the difficulty but, apparently, the ICTU take the view that there is no way because they have taken the decision for their own good reasons.  They are quite entitled to take the decision they took but, having taken it, they do not seem to feel it is worthwhile to get the parties together to see if there is any way around the difficulty.  That being so, I cannot do anything further.</P>

      <P>There were two Senators on the executive of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the late Senator James Dunne and Senator Fintan Kennedy.  The Minister must appreciate that this, in effect, is debarring such persons if they were nominated by the congress.  There is also Senator Norman Kennedy from Northern Ireland.  I strongly urge the Minister in view of the urgency and the imminence of international free trade, to have another look at the situation.  I think congress would be only too anxious to co-operate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was anxious to find a way around the difficulty but, as I have indicated, it does not seem to be possible to do so.  While what the Deputy has said is true, it is also true that all of the other organisations concerned, who might well in certain circumstances have considered nominating members of either House of the Oireachtas, accepted that they would not do so in the interests of ensuring that there was no ambiguity about the question of the independent nature of the advice that would be tendered. Every other organisation found it possible to do so, but the ICTU did not.  That is the position.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2359" /> The Land Commission have, for some time, been endeavouring to accumulate a pool of land in the Tully/Rushestown area in order to facilitate the formulation of plans for the rearrangement and enlargement of fragmented holdings in the locality.</P>
    <P>Composite resale proposals are now envisaged for the Cunningham and Martin holdings and three other properties in the locality&mdash;giving an aggregate area of 358 acres for division.  Pending completion of the necessary inquiries on the ground, it is not possible to forecast when allotment will be effected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possession of this 63-acre property passed to the Land Commission in June, 1965.  The preparation of resale plans for this and another estate in the locality, aggregating 91 acres, was deferred in the expectation that it would be possible to secure a third holding by the migration of a local farmer&mdash;thus enabling a more balanced scheme of land settlement to be implemented.  Transfer had been approved but the prospective migrant then changed his mind and that matter has fallen through.  It is now proposed that the two estates referred to in the question will be allotted together and the aim is to include the lands in next year's allocation programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 19th March, 1972, the Garda authorities requested military aid in Monaghan town where the Garda station was under attack by a hostile crowd estimated at about 300 strong.  A military party was despatched to Monaghan.  The hostile crowd grew in number until it reached a strength estimated at between 1,200 and 1,500.  An armoured car which was parked under guard some distance away was attacked by a crowd of approximately 200.  They attempted to set the car on fire, deflated its wheels and smashed its windshield.  The military, however, succeeded in getting the car away.  In the fracas around the car two soldiers got detached from the main body, were knocked to the ground and beaten and had their rifles wrested from them.  The rifles have not been recovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2375" /> Almost every officer and man deployed at the Garda station was struck by a missile of some description but fortunately no serious injury was sustained because of their protective equipment.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned for Question Time I was mentioning some of the features of the EEC which, from our point of view, are important. I mentioned the customs union, which is significant, because if we are outside the Community we will face that customs <Col N="2391" /> barrier unless we sign a trade agreement giving free trade on our side.  I mentioned the common agricultural policy and its implications.  I mentioned the principle of non-discrimination, but there is also the decision-making system of the Community which carries with it considerable interest for us.</P>
      <P>There is the fact that all decisions affecting the vital interests of member states are taken by unanimity.  This has been the practice and there is no indication that this practice will be departed from.  There is moreover the fact that, if at any stage the French position on this matter changes and this practice is departed from, the voting system by which decisions will then be taken is, I think, uniquely favourable to us and to small countries generally, one under which our voting power would be five times that justified by our population and under which we and other small countries would have blocking power against actions of the larger powers should there be any attempt by the large to exploit the small, so much so, indeed, that even if five of the six small countries in the enlarged Community got together on some issue to protect themselves against the larger countries they, with 13 per cent of the population, would have an absolute blocking power on any decision, even if the qualified majority system is implemented. From our point of view, to join a Community in which the rights of small countries are so remarkably protected is naturally something of particular interest and attraction to us. The fact that this was the price that the larger powers had to pay in the 1950s to secure the agreement of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to join in this Community is significant and something which the people of this country should be told fully about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are some of the features of the Community which are important to us and they carry with them certain conclusions.  First of all, there is the basic factor that the principle of non-discrimination makes it impossible for Britain to exploit this country any longer by paying our farmers lower <Col N="2392" /> prices than those paid to her own farmers.  That alone is worth twice as much to us as any possible losses attributable to the withdrawal of protection. Those who insist on the right of sovereignty in all respects, regardless of the consequences for us, must take the consequences of that.  If we insist that we retain sovereignty in all economic matters to the fullest degree, by remaining outside the EEC, then we cannot object to other people maintaining their sovereignty and using it against us.  If we wish to obtain the benefits of the restraint on the exercise of British sovereignty to our disadvantage, which is one of the inherent features of the EEC, we can only secure that advantage if we join it.  If we remain outside, we remain open to exploitation not only by Britain but by the Community as a whole.  If we join it we get the protection of the Community in that respect.  Those who are opposed to membership must have regard to this if they are serious in concerning themselves with Irish interests.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact, to which inadequate attention has been paid, that this Community, from the point of view of an agricultural producer, is one uniquely attractive.  It consists of some of the greatest industrial powers in Europe whose wealth enables them to protect their farming community through a system of relatively high prices, and within which the farming community is numerous enough to be able to acquire that protection through their influence in the democratic system.</P>
    <P>Another feature is that within that Community the range of climate is very different from anything we are used to in this country or in Britain. In Britain and in Ireland the climate is broadly favourable to the production of livestock products and grass. Consequently, even the prices the British farmers secure from the British consumer for their products, even the prices paid in Britain for farm products, are by European standards very low in relation to livestock products. We have been accustomed to selling the great bulk of our products to a country where not alone do we suffer from price discrimination but where <Col N="2393" /> even if we did get the full price, that price would be by the standards of the Continent of Europe low, because although, as Deputy Keating has pointed out, there are parts of the Continent, the north-western corner, where grass grows fairly easily, taking the Community as a whole it is not a grass-growing area, and, in order to induce a sufficient, or approximately sufficient, output of meat in this Community as a whole, it is necessary for them to pay prices not alone higher than the prices we are used to, and very much higher, but also higher than the prices paid in Britain.  We have been used to selling our products in the British market where the price of meat and the price of milk are usually low and where we do not even get these prices.  In future, we can be selling in a market where the prices of these products are high for basic climatic reasons which man is not capable of changing, which are unchangeable of their very nature, and we shall be assured of being paid the identical prices the farmers in this Community are paid.  The prices that are actually paid to a German farmer to induce him in the conditions of farming in Germany to produce milk and enough beef for that country's requirements are the prices our farmers will get.</P>
    <P>This represents not only a change of a kind which has no parallel in our relationship with Britain but also a change in our fundamental relationship with other countries to which we sell our goods.  At no time in our past history have we ever been placed in the kind of situation we will be in in the EEC.  I know that in asserting that I will draw on me the usual accusation of being an enthusiast for Europe but, never mind; whether or not I am an enthusiast for Europe, I am stating a fact.  If anybody has a different fact to put forward, if anybody feels that my statements about the climate are incorrect, that I am incorrect in saying that the great bulk of this area is not well adapted to the low-cost production of beef and milk, let them say that.  But it is no answer to say that, when I make an assertion, it must not be believed because I am in favour of membership, no more than it would be valid for me to say that something <Col N="2394" /> Deputy Justin Keating said should not be believed because he is against membership.  Facts should be judged on their merits rather than by the intrusion of personalities into the debate, the kind of personalities we have had, for example, from Deputy O'Donovan, who told this House, with all signs of apparent seriousness, that my enthusiasm for membership derived from the fact that I thought that, within an enlarged EEC, I would have more opportunity of speaking French.  If we are to discuss the EEC at that level, this debate is just a waste of time and the contributions of Deputy Flanagan and Deputy O'Donovan are, in fact, a waste of time, a rather considerable waste of time.</P>

      <P>Diversity of economic thought is desirable in a university. I want now to apply myself seriously to the serious arguments put forward by a serious representative of the Labour Party, Deputy Justin Keating.  He asserted that the two great issues here, the two threats to us, came from free trade and the outflow of capital.  His arguments were, I think, sufficiently seriously put to merit a reply and I am by no means confident that on the Government side of the House there will be such a reply, that there is either the capacity or the will to give such a reply, and it is up to us then on this side of the House on this occasion as on other occasions to answer these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2395" /> On the first point of freedom of trade, Deputy Keating is right that freedom of trade poses problems for this country, but he himself made it clear that, if we did not join the Community, the threat that would be posed to our export industries and the 35,000 jobs in those industries, producing products sold to Britain, the threat that would be involved in our remaining outside in facing tariffs on the British market of up to 24 per cent is such that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Keating himself told this House that we face free trade in any event and it would be disastrous for us, if we remained outside the Community, not to sign a trade agreement with the Community maintaining our free entry to the UK markets.  For him, therefore, to say that membership of the Community poses two threats, free trade and the outflow of capital, is less than entirely fair because when he, at <Col N="2396" /> the same time, says that, in fact, that threat of free trade is there whether we join or not.</P>
    <P>It is true that Deputy Keating has attempted to draw a distinction.  He has said: &ldquo;Yes, we would have to remove tariffs and quotas if we join the EEC; if we stay outside we would have to remove them, too, but we would be free to do other things, to protect our industries in a way that we would not be free to do in the EEC.&rdquo;  But, each time he said this, I tried to extract from him some indication as to what exactly are the things we could do.  He has given us some indication of the kind of things he is thinking of; he has spoken of taxation provisions which we could undertake to assist industry by tax reductions.  But Deputy Keating did not advert to the fact that these negotiations have assured us the right to maintain the tax reliefs we have at the moment for industry, with the single qualification that, after 1977, the Commission may raise with us the question as to whether these tax reliefs should not be modified.  But we have the right, if that question is raised, to seek their replacement by some other tax relief equally effective &mdash; for example, tax reliefs based on the expansion of total output rather than on an increase in export trade alone.</P>
    <P>That is something which we should in any event be considering on its own merits and it would, I think, have been considered on its own merits even if the EEC issue had not arisen because, when trade is free, there is no point in discriminating in favour of exports since, in free trade conditions, there is exactly equal economic value in increased sales competitively in the home market, keeping out imports, or increased sales in export markets.  One is as good as the other and there is no point in having a tax system discriminating, therefore, between export and home sales.  We would, in any event, be thinking of such a change. Inside the EEC we have, therefore, the same rights to maintain the tax reliefs, in their present or in a modified form, equally effective for the full term that we ourselves consider these tax reliefs necessary &mdash; that is, until 1990 &mdash; and for Deputy Keating to suggest <Col N="2397" /> that, if we stay outside the EEC, we will be able to do something more or something different from what we do inside the EEC in terms of tax reliefs is not entirely accurate.</P>
    <P>Secondly, he spoke of financial aid to industry.  Inside the EEC we will be entitled to give grants for industrial development.  There is no restriction on that and our present grants at their present level are compatible with EEC regional policy.  There is no change in that respect.  The only kind of assistance to industry which we could give outside the EEC, but could not give inside it, is direct subsidies to running costs.  Why Deputy Keating as a socialist should wish to finance capitalism by giving subsidies to running costs I am not entirely clear, but I wonder whether outside the EEC we would, in fact, be capable of providing the kind of subsidies he speaks of because we would have to give massive subsidies for the export of farm produce.  It was £36 million last year and it would rise very rapidly if prices and output rise, as he suggested would be the case outside the EEC.  If we are to subsidise agriculture to the tune of many tens of millions of pounds and, indeed, achieve EEC prices and output outside the Community, that would cost us £200 million by 1978. If we were to do that and, at the same time, provide home subsidies to keep our private industry sector going, a somewhat unsocialist policy, but one advocated by Deputy Keating, where is the money to come from?  Who is to subsidise who?  Who is to pay all the taxes?</P>
    <P>If industry is to be subsidised on its current production and if agriculture is to be subsidised on a massive scale, who will pay the taxes?  Did Deputy Keating apply his mind at all to that question?  He is right in thinking that outside the EEC we could provide current subsidies for industry and that inside it we could not, but he is wrong in thinking that, outside the EEC, we would be able financially, or would wish, to subsidise industries with current subsidies and to that extent his point, a good theoretical one, is not of any practical consequence.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, when you come down to it, Deputy Keating has failed <Col N="2398" /> here, as on previous occasions, to give any indication as to precisely what methods of assistance to industry we could employ outside the EEC, if we would wish, and be able to employ financially which we could not employ within it.  There is no distinction there.  It is a false distinction, a fudged distinction.  In fact, inside or outside, we face free trade on much the same terms and the attempt to distinguish in this way&mdash;quite understandable because Deputy Keating has to make his case&mdash;in unconvincing.</P>
    <P>His second point then concerns the outflow of capital and this has been asserted so often and has become so much the theme &mdash; I almost said the swan song &mdash; of the anti-EEC lobby that it needs to be dealt with a little more fully than it has, perhaps, been dealt with hitherto.</P>
    <P>I have in the last couple of weeks written several articles on this subject in <i>The Irish Times</i> and I see a reply on this morning's paper, or what purports to be a reply, to one of these articles.  Let us face the facts on this matter.  Deputy Keating tells us that outside the EEC we could ensure an inflow of capital, inside it this would not happen because the capital would flow to the centre, to this golden triangle of which he, Deputy O'Donovan and others, are so fond of speaking.  Precisely what changes in our economic conditions could induce this change in the flow of capital?  Let us remember that at this time the inflow of capital to this country is on an enormous scale.  Deputy Keating referred to the fact that we have very large investments outside Ireland.  He referred to a flow of capital from Ireland. I listened to the words carefully, but he was, of course, incorrect.  There is not a net flow of capital from Ireland. There was a net outflow of capital from Ireland in a sense during the first world war and to a lesser degree during the second world war, when we sold goods abroad and were not able to use the money to buy imports and accumulated assets abroad. If you call that an outflow of capital, that did happen, but the only flow of capital that has occurred in the last 20 years or more in this country has been an inflow of capital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2399" /> Only in one year, in the 1950s, was there ever a net outflow of capital of a very small kind, £7 million.  The inflow of capital in the past three years has averaged £115 million and, indeed, our problem at the moment, and anybody who reads the Central Bank Bulletin will be aware of it, is that we are trying desperately and vainly to prevent the excessive inflow of capital to this country.  The Central Bank set out in its credit advice a year ago that there should be no net inflow of capital to the non-associated banks in the year starting April last and our problem is that that advice has been disregarded and that a total of £46 million of capital has flowed in up to 18th January through these non-associated banks.  We cannot stop the inflow of capital.  Our attempts to do so have proved in vain.  For Deputy Keating to talk as if this is a country from which capital flows out is nonsense. There has never been such an outflow of capital for decades past. There is an inflow of capital.</P>
    <P>Why?  Why is it this peripheral area is drawing capital from the golden triangle?  The question must be asked. It is not good enough to talk theoretically and say that in an area with free movement of capital the capital moves outwards.  This country is part of an area, with free movement of capital, with the United Kingdom.  Within this area where capital moves freely we have a large chunk of the golden triangle from Birmingham to Dover. Why is it the capital is not now flowing out to that area from here?  Why is the capital flowing in from London to Dublin?  That question must be answered by anybody who is seriously asserting that within any area where there is a free flow of capital it must move to the area of highest living standards and highest output.</P>
    <P>The fact is that under modern conditions capital seeks outlets where capital gets a return.  Capitalists find that where there is an underdeveloped economy, where there are resources not fully tapped and not fully used, where there are workers unemployed, there they can get a return from their capital by lending their money out. They get a better return there because <Col N="2400" /> use can be made of it.  Nobody is forcing this capital to come into this country.  Of course, we attract some of it by industrial grants, by tax reliefs. But when you analyse the actual capital flow, you find that of the £115 million per annum which, on average, has come into this country in the past two years only £11 million last year and a similar sum the previous year can be identified as a direct investment flow for new industry.  Ninety per cent of it is not related to new industry or to these grants or tax reliefs.  Ninety per cent of it seems to be coming in to help finance the ordinary development of the Irish economy.  It comes in freely.</P>
    <P>Nobody forces it in.  Some of it is borrowed by the Government.  The Government can continue to borrow under EEC conditions and may be better placed to do so.  Some of it is borrowed by State companies.  They can still borrow in EEC conditions and will be better placed to do so.  The rest flows in autonomously.  We cannot even prevent it though we try to do so.  It comes in here because it can get a better return here.  On what basis is it suggested that if we join the EEC this return will become less good?  What are the changes that will take place? I do not think much of this capital is coming in to protected industries. Much of it consists of an investment in the expansion of protected industries which are about to lose their protection. Capitalists may be odd but they are not lunatic.  The last thing they would be doing would be pouring money at present into industries about to disappear under free trade.  Therefore, the capital coming in at present cannot be for that purpose.  Therefore, the removal of protection cannot have any net effect on the flow of capital.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating and the Labour Party are required to tell us precisely what changes in EEC conditions will lead to this extraordinary phenomenon, the reversal of the massive inflow of capital into Ireland turning it into an outflow.  They must tell us why within the capital free flowing area of Ireland and Britain capital at present flows into this country to the tune of £115 million and not outwards.  Until they answer those questions and face <Col N="2401" /> the fact that this is what is happening nobody can be expected to take seriously this argument or economic theory of an Adam Smith outdated character coming very oddly from the Labour Party that, of course, capital always flows to the centre.  It does not for the reasons I have mentioned. These are the facts and I hope that in reply they will be adverted to because nobody will take seriously this argument when it runs completely contrary to the facts as we know them.</P>
    <P>The truth is that Deputy Keating is living in the world of Adam Smith.  He is somehow such a pure capitalist in his outlook that he thinks the rest of the world is purely capitalist.  I mean that obviously humorously.</P>

      <P>There is a difficulty. You can be misled by a particular ideology into assuming that the world takes the shape that you think it ought to take according to your ideology.  I do not defend capitalism. I do not like capitalism and the present capitalist system I find in many ways offensive.  That does not mean that I turn it on its head and assert that under capitalism money flows outwards when, in fact, it flows in.  We have to look at the facts and then find a theory that fits the facts, not invent a theory and ignore the facts, which is what is being done in this argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being asked by Deputy Keating why should multi-national companies come here under EEC conditions. Why do they come here now? What is it about this country at the moment that attracts them?  Is it industrial protection?  How many multi-national companies have come here in the last two years and set up firms behind tariff walls for the home market? Any?  The multi-national firms that have come here have come here because of resources of labour here, because they believe they can manufacture here profitably despite the fact that they have only access to this and the British market and that they have not absolutely guaranteed access to the British market.  The only significant change in EEC conditions will be the <Col N="2402" /> removal of the barriers which at present prevent goods from this country flowing freely to the whole of the EEC. The multi-national companies which come here now will come here much more freely under EEC conditions when there can be no question of any fresh barrier being imposed on trade to Britain which can now arise despite the free trade area agreement and will arise on 1st January next if we do not join.  Under EEC conditions they would have access to a market of 160 million people.  If they are coming here now, they will come in larger numbers then.</P>
    <P>On the question of regional policy generally, I want to say a little more. We have these assertions that within the EEC the peripheral regions are losing out badly, that they are falling behind and declining but none of this bears any relation to the facts. Occasionally, some phrase is picked up from a newspaper publication which is latched onto as proving the point but the recent newspaper publication which dealt with this matter referred to a publication which I commend to the House.  It is <i>The Regional Evolution of the Community</i>, a recent publication of the EEC which contains many tables at the back, perhaps, the most interesting of which is the very last table which gives us for each region within each country of the Community the relationship between domestic products per head in that region in 1960 and 1969 and the value in current money terms of domestic products per head in these two years.</P>
    <P>From this it can be found that with a remarkably high degree of consistency the poorest regions had the fastest growth rates.  There is no question about this.  In Italy, above all, the country which is nearest to us, because in 1958, when the Community was founded, the GNP per head, the living standards, were identical with ours &mdash; under EEC conditions, of course, it forged far ahead in the meantime &mdash; in that country we find an extraordinary position in which in parts of the south the increase in living standards has been doubled in 9 years, where on average in the south, living standards increased by three-quarters, and where in the rich north-west the increase has <Col N="2403" /> been about one-third.  The difference in the increase in living standards has been three-fold between the poor areas of the south and the rich areas of the north.  It is true that as between some of these areas in the south and some in the north this three-fold faster growth rate in the south is still inadequate to achieve the catching-up process required because if you have one area where living standards are a quarter of the other and if you double the living standards of a quarter and increase by one-third the living standards on the higher level, there is still a slight widening of the gap but in any of these instances you like to take, if the growth rates of the last 9 years shown here are maintained for the next 9 years in all these areas, the catching-up process in absolute terms will begin to operate as it does already in many of them, as it does today in the very poorest of all, the province of Basilicata in the south of Italy.  Anybody who asserts that within the EEC the national regional policies have failed to achieve faster growth in the poorer areas is flying in the face of the facts.  You can look at Germany, Italy, Belgium.  In each of these areas the poorest parts of the country have the fastest growth rates and the richest parts have by far the lowest growth rates.  There is an absolutely consistent pattern from which, in fact, there are no exceptions.</P>
    <P>I have a map here.  Maps are not useful in the House.  They cannot go on the record.  I wish we could illustrate the record with little drawings and maps.  They might enliven it at times.  The map I have shows the provinces of Italy in 1960 in terms of standard of living.  It shows those that are poorest in the south and along the east coast.  The second map beside it shows increases in living standards and it shows these as by far the greatest in the areas of the south and along the east coast, almost identically the same areas.  One by one, you can go over them and find that the poorest areas have grown fastest.  The same is true in Germany and in Belgium. We do not know what has happened in France because there are no similar figures available for France.  We only <Col N="2404" /> know that in France the areas from which emigration was greatest in the 1960s, before the Community was formed, are areas from which emigration has fallen sharply.  In the whole north-west of the country, including Brittany, from which emigration was at a very high level between 1954 and 1962, in the following six years emigration has been about between one-third and 40 per cent only of emigration in the earlier period.  We have not got the figures for regional income, regional output.  We have the emigration figures, however, which are the best indication.</P>
    <P>So, throughout the Community this phenomenon operates.  Where does it not operate?  &mdash;in this country.  In this country we have totally failed.  The only figures we have for Ireland are between 1960 and 1965 and they show that in that period the growth of output and income in Connacht has been less than in the rest of the country, that that area has, in fact, fallen further behind.  How anybody can seriously suggest that in joining a Community in every member state of which the poorer areas have achieved a much faster growth rate than the richer we would lose something and that we should stay in the condition we are in, where our poorer areas are falling further behind, is something I cannot fathom.  That kind of argument, unrelated to the facts, is not worthy of those who put it forward. Argument is only worth while if it is based on facts.  To produce economic theories about flows of capital and poorer areas having lower growth rates means nothing when the facts are to the contrary.  The quality of argument in this House suffers even from somebody of Deputy Keating's intellectual eminence when he does not have regard to the facts and produces theories and ignores the facts.  So much for regional policy.</P>
    <P>In the limited time at my disposal there are many other things I would like to deal with but I should like just to deal with two other points in what Deputy Keating said because his speech does merit a reply, which is not true of all the other contributions. There are two other points I should like to make because I was struck by <Col N="2405" /> the difficulty he had in making his case.  He was forced into contradictions at certain points even within a few minutes of each other and that is something which I found in his case surprising.  He told us, for example, at one point, that real farm income in the Community fell in the 1960s by 2 per cent per annum.  This is possibly true, in fact.  I do not dispute the fact. I will come to that in a moment.  The figure sounds right to me.  Then he tells me, within five minutes, that, of course, if we had joined the Community in 1961 we would have done very well in agriculture but we should not join it now.  This is perverse.  It is, of course, true that the Community in the late 1960s, having established a common agricultural policy with a common price level at the higher German/Belgium level, kept its price static for a few years because during that period the average price in the Community as a whole was rising rapidly as the lower prices had to catch up, French prices in particular.  France is a low-price country and an increase in prices of about 20 per cent in five years and an increase in output of about 10 per cent, increases farm incomes by about one-third.  The other countries had to mark time at that stage but, in fact, now, since 1969, farm prices have begun to rise rapidly because that period of adjustment to common policy is coming to an end and last year and the year before we had, for the first time since 1965, significant price increases in the Community and this year the price increases which are proposed by the Commission, trying to keep down, are 8 per cent in the case of milk, 9 per cent in the case of beef.  We are told in the new press reports from Brussels that these increases are unlikely to be accepted, that they are too low, that the farmers are looking for more and the Ministers for Agriculture and Finance will probably have to concede more to them.</P>

      <P>I am talking of the products we are interested in.  Of course, the prices are lower for other products, for grain, I think, 4 per cent, but we are not a grain producing country.  We are interested in the price increases of 8 per cent at least for milk and 9 per cent at least for beef.  They may be more.  I do not stress the point as to whether they will be more or not.  The fact is that it is since 1969 that the Community prices have begun to rise sharply because, having had their period of adjustment, the farmers are now demanding that the prices generally will rise.  For Deputy Keating to say that we should have joined the Community in 1961, for the decade in which, on average, real income fell, although in France, a country in a similar position to us, the low prices there rose and rose sharply &mdash;and that we should not join in 1969 when prices are starting to rise is, I think, perverse.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Deputy Keating put forward the remarkable argument that if we join the Community and are a member of it there will be no question of our being allowed to produce more milk year after year, that, of course, quotas will be imposed to restrict our output.  There is no evidence whatever for this.  No suggestion has been made by anybody in the Community that output should be restricted of either milk or other products by quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No suggestion is made of a restriction of milk or beef by quotas.  The only area where they apply is in relation to sugar.  No proposal of that kind exists for restriction by quotas.  Deputy Keating said that, if we join, our milk output will be restricted by quotas.  If we do not join, then he tells us, of course, it will be quite different.  If we remain outside the Community, having no right whatever to participate in the agricultural policy, then he said that our 3½ per cent of the total of milk was a very small problem, such a small problem that they would fix us up; there would be no difficulty about it.  Anybody who suggests that if you join the Community <Col N="2407" /> you are ruined and will not be allowed to produce any more but if you stay out there is no problem, that people will facilitate you, is not being terribly serious in the argument he puts forward.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, although the intellectual level of Deputy Keating's speech was high, although, as always, he made a serious contribution to the debate, I am afraid that the absence of a factual foundation for his speech, his ignoring of the actual facts of capital flows, his unwillingness to face the implications of his own view that we must face free trade one way or the other and the contradictions in regard to agricultural policy into which he was forced by the intellectual position he has had to take up, leave me unconvinced that what he had to say need be taken terribly seriously in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that I want to turn to one or two other points in the brief time available.  I want to deal briefly with prices.  It is important that we are clear what the position is about prices. Here, as elsewhere, we had from Deputy Flanagan various assertions, none of them quantified, none of them to be taken very seriously.  In this case, in regard to prices, I think we should be clear on the facts.  The facts are that there are certain farm products whose prices will rise sharply in the EEC. These are milk, beef and, though the Minister for Labour did not mention it and should have, mutton and lamb. These prices will rise sharply.  The farm price in the EEC in 1970 was about 50 to 55 per cent higher than here.  The gap is now smaller because, of course, farm prices have risen sharply in response to the expectation of EEC membership.  Increases of that order in farm prices had we been a member of the EEC in 1970 would have pushed up retail prices by something like 40 per cent, allowing for the fact that retail margins are not affected, but I am sure that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would have ensured that we would not have been exploited by an expansion of retail margins in those circumstances.  A 40 per cent increase should, therefore, have been expected had we been a <Col N="2408" /> member of the EEC at that time.  The retail prices of beef, mutton and lamb and milk products such as cheese and butter, on average, would have been about 40 per cent higher at retail level. However, other products would have been affected less severely, pigmeat, liquid milk and bread.  The price of liquid milk has already been high here in relation to the EEC.  Distribution costs are a very high proportion; the mute cost is a low proportion and consequently the impact on the cost of living of an increase to the farmer is proportionately much less.</P>
    <P>Taking account of these two sets of increases, the very substantial ones of 40 per cent on certain products and the smaller ones of 7 to 12 per cent for others, the most that you can squeeze out of this in terms of overall effect on the cost of living is something like 3½ per cent.  Three and a half to 4 per cent has been suggested.  I think that is too high and I have gone into these figures most carefully.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully had a point to make and I would refer him to an economist called Deputy Nevin &mdash; sorry, Doctor Nevin &mdash; of Wales who spent some time among us and who is one of the most eminent economists in the ranks of my colleagues.  He spent some time here and he told us about the extraordinary problem to be tackled in regard to Irish price levels.  You will find that approximately 20 per cent of one-fifth of the goods and services we provide fall into the protective category.  To my simple-minded calculation, in respect of one-fifth of the goods we buy the removal of protection will reduce prices by 10 per cent, and that knocks 2 per cent from the cost of living.  If anybody can do the calculation any other way, he is entitled to do so and if Deputy Tully could do so, I should be delighted to hear him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Keating made the point so well that Deputy Tully need not make it again.  Whether we join the EEC or not, we face the removal of subsidies and tariffs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I would be glad if the Deputy would allow me to make the point.  Foods and tariffs according to Doctor Nevin involve a 10 per cent increase in prices here.  If they are removed that, to my mind &mdash; I may be simple-minded&mdash;involves a 10 per cent reduction in prices.  Of course, there is the implication in regard to employment in these industries. Nobody doubts it.  However, as Deputy Keating pointed out, we face that anyhow because inside the EEC tariffs and quotas have to go.  Inside or outside the EEC the cost of living will fall by 2 per cent.  Therefore, if we join the EEC we will save from a 3½ per cent increase in the cost of living over the early years through food prices and a 2 per cent fall as a result of food price protection, which means a net increase of something like 1½ per cent more than would otherwise happen. The effect of that on living standards will, however, be more than cushioned by the £30 million available to us when the Community takes over the burden of agricultural subsidies.</P>
      <P>This £30 million will be available to us for use to help social welfare beneficiaries and others in need.  Consumer spending here at the moment is at the rate of £1,500 million a year, and £30 million extra for the consumers improves their living standards by 2 per cent.  The net effect of membership of the EEC is, therefore, that during the period of years there will be a ½ per cent improvement in living standards, completely ignoring any beneficial effects from increased demands generated throughout the economy from greater prosperity in agriculture and from higher productivity in factories. The overall result will be an improvement in the order of 3 to 4 to 5 per cent&mdash;I would not put it higher&mdash;that would not have happened otherwise, in the standard of living of our people. As far as one can calculate it, that will be accompanied by an increase in jobs running into some tens of thousands. Again, it is difficult to be precise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One must give credit to Deputy FitzGerald on any occasion for the vigour with which he defends full membership of the EEC, as, indeed, the intensive work he has been doing for a long time.  Needless to remark, we do not go along with his point of view.  Speaking on the two important sectors of our economy &mdash; our agriculture and our industry &mdash; I think it is a great pity that in arranging their speakers and the timing of their participation in this debate, Fianna Fáil did not allow the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in particular, and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, an opportunity of participating.  I do not deny the right of the Ministers for Labour and Lands to participate, as they did, but I think the two most important Ministers after the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who negotiated on behalf of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying this was deliberate, but the Government left the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Labour at the tailend and there are many questions that they should have answered in this debate. I hope that in a short time there will be an opportunity for them to answer these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need elaborate on the position of the Labour Party in regard to the EEC.  Our position is essentially a political one and not just as an economic union.  We agree, and we have said, that we cannot ignore the existence of the EEC, and certainly we cannot ignore its existence when, as it seems likely, the British will enter it because such a proportion of our exports, ranging between 65 per cent and 70 per cent, go to Great <Col N="2411" /> Britain.  We realise that the full tariff wall between Britain and us, with Great Britain in the EEC, would be an insurmountable problem as far as all sections of our economy are concerned. We never disputed our relationship with the EEC if Britain enters.</P>
    <P>What we are concerned about and what we are trying to make clear here, as the third party, is the kind of relationship that we hope to have with the EEC in view of our trading position with Britain and in view of the fact that we are a part of Western Europe. Is it to be a relationship that will not guarantee employment or growth?  Is it to be a relationship that will undermine our weak industrial sector or is it to be a relationship that will pressurise our small and medium-sized farmers to leave the land?</P>
    <P>In a situation where it is abundantly clear, and will be clear in the future, that there are alternative jobs for these farmers who will be induced to leave the land, as far as we are concerned our relationship with the Community must assist the development of this country's economy and social life and not hinder or destroy it.</P>
    <P>Briefly, therefore, as far as we are concerned, they are the terms of our relationship.  We have many objections in principle to the whole concept of the EEC.  We have expressed these objections during the past 12 years, since the first application was made for full membership by a Fianna Fáil Government.  We are not in agreement with the philosophy enunciated in the Treaty of Rome and its implementation since 1957, that of free trade and competition.  We disagree with the basic reliance on free competition as the principal means of economic development and industrial organisation. We have grave reservations, as a socialist party, about the relegation of State aid for the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is true, as has been said by the Taoiseach in his opening remarks and as has been stated in the White Paper, that tax concessions to exporting industry will continue but I quote the words of the White Paper &ldquo;in some form or other&rdquo;.  In some form as yet undefined; in some form that has not <Col N="2412" /> been adequately described by various Ministers, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in particular and the Minister for Finance, when questioned in this house over a long period.</P>
    <P>We are told that the whole matter of tax concessions and tax incentives for export will be up for review after entry.  It appears from the comments of the two major parties that once we get in as full members of the EEC it will be very difficult to get out.  I cannot conceive of a situation wherein our negotiators, our Minister or our Commissioner, will be able to preserve that form of protection that we have for the exporting section of industry. So, to say vaguely that the whole matter will be up for review after entry is, of course, similar to the statement to the effect that the fisheries policy as far as this country is concerned will also be up for review after the transition period.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of being vague in our comment and in our objections and vague in the alternative we propose.  Surely the White Paper, not alone in this particular matter, is a mass of vagueness, the same vagueness we have as far as what is being negotiated for fisheries is concerned. The political implications, of course, tend to be ignored but they must be considered.  May I say at this stage that this has been a most inadequate debate, apart from the hour that we lost this morning.  It has been inadequate in view of the fact that it has been jammed, so to speak, into the last week of this particular session. There are very many Deputies who would have liked to contribute and many whose contributions we would like to have heard, particularly those from the backbenchers of the two sides of the House, who must be concerned, if not necessarily about the whole national economy, about their own constituencies and with the various cities, towns and villages in their own constituencies.</P>
    <P>The political implications must also be considered.  I think it is freely admitted that the aim of European integration is political union.  This involves us in very serious political implications which have not been fully <Col N="2413" /> explained by the Taoiseach or any member of the Government.  The EEC has now been established.  It has established a customs union.  It is presently creating an economic union in which we propose to participate.</P>
    <P>The next stage, I would say in the next five to ten years, is a political union.  This will involve, as we pointed out in the debate on the Bill for the amendment of the Constitution, a loss of sovereignty and must be examined honestly by this House.  We will be involved in an economic and a monetary union if the people of this country so decide in the referendum. After that comes the political union. Will it then entail military commitments? I know the Taoiseach said that these obligations, when he referred to the changes in the Constitution <i>et cetera</i>, do not entail any military or defence commitments.  That may be so but if we are to have political union it must necessarily follow, if not in the next year, the next five or ten years, certainly in the near future, that it will also involve a political commitment.  Whilst he did not say it in express terms, the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke about the likelihood of military commitements and as I think he put it himself, defence commitments on our being full members of the European Economic Community.</P>

      <P>I think those were his actual words.  I must confess that it is a long term probability.  Remember, we are not just legislating and making decisions here for the people of this generation in such a serious decision as this.  We must also think in terms of the generations to come.  The Taoiseach referred to military and defence commitments and suggested that those who talk about military and defence commitments were merely scaremongers.  He must know that there will be a new Treaty, that there will be many more Treaties, that there will be new discussions on defence commitments or on the protection of the Community.  I think Deputy Tully said that the Minister for Foreign <Col N="2414" /> Affairs said that on two or three occasions.</P>
      <P>Therefore, if we are to be involved in Europe, economically and politically, we will not be able to pull out and we will have no option but to subscribe to these commitments to which the Taoiseach referred and to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred.  We have more than serious reservations about the nature of the decision making process in the Community. Article 138 of the Treaty of Rome provides for a European Parliament but very little has been heard of a European Parliament in the last ten or 11 years.  It is totally unrepresentative of the people.  If we become full members I trust we will not behave in the same way as many of the European Parliaments have behaved.  They throw the safe men into the European Parliament or they throw those who are at the end of their years in Parliament or those who have no real concern about their own countries into this Parliament merely to give the impression that there are elected representatives and that this is a democratic assembly.</P>

      <P>That is so and we will not be able to provide for such representation from our country until the changes are made in Europe.  Unless the European Parliament is given teeth, unless it is seen to be and is in fact a democratic assembly the situation will be, as it is now, and has been with the power lying directly with the Council of Ministers or to a lesser extent with the Commission.  I believe the Brussels Commission has developed into a bureaucracy with power and position never intended by the Treaty. It is not invalid or unfair criticism to say that the European Parliament has not been in any way affected in influencing the decisions of the Ministers or influencing the directives or the regulations framed by the Commission because there is no real democratic control by the people through their representatives.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, we realise we must have a relationship with the Community.  We cannot ignore the existence of the Community nor can we afford to ignore our position with regard to our nearest neighbour, Great Britain.  Our task should have been to secure a relationship with the Community suited to the underdeveloped state of our economy.  I know that Fianna Fáil are reluctant to admit that we are underdeveloped but I do not think that members of Fine Gael would subscribe to that view of Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In his short introductory speech the Taoiseach stated:</P>
      <P>Although I could not go along with his view&mdash;</P>
      <P>he was referring to more favourable circumstances&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;I accept that there is always scope for such argument after conclusion of negotiations, however successful. What I cannot accept is the claim made by some that we could have obtained a much more favourable deal and even that we could have negotiated changes in the Community <Col N="2416" /> rules and policies to suit us. These people choose to ignore the fact that these policies and rules were worked out by the present member states after years of arduous and prolonged bargaining.  The negotiations were conducted on the basis that the applicant countries accepted the provisions of the Treaty establishing the Communities and the action taken for the implementation of these treaties.</P>
    <P>So far as Ireland is concerned, the position is that we are to join the Community as a full member.  We are to join with a Community who made the rules and regulations after years of arduous and prolonged bargaining, as the Taoiseach has pointed out.  These rules and regulations were framed to suit their own economies.  I should like to repeat this fact: they spent long and arduous years, according to the Taoiseach, arriving at certain decisions. When the Community framed these rules and regulations they had their own economies in mind and they had no concern for the problems of this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if we had arduous and prolonged bargaining in order to protect our economy and to suit conditions in this country?  Our bargaining or negotiations did not take long and arduous years; the negotiations took some months, or rather they took place over a period of months because they were not conducted on a day-to-day basis.  Neither were we concerned about obtaining a longer transitional period in order to protect our economy.</P>
    <P>We are an underdeveloped country and facts and figures will show this to be true, apart from the obvious fact that there is high unemployment and poverty in the country.  Our gross national product per head is half that of the average of the ten states who may become the EEC.  We differ from other countries in that 30 per cent of our work force is in agriculture; so far as the EEC countries are concerned only 14 per cent is employed in agriculture. Therefore, we have a special problem but I do not know if this fact was mentioned at Brussels.</P>
    <P>Our industrial sector could never <Col N="2417" /> provide for those who have left the land.  In the last ten years there have been figures of 11,000, 14,000 and 15,000 persons leaving the land.  Our unemployment figure is 8 or 9 per cent and in recent times it is over 9 per cent. Our GNP per head of the population is one-third that of Norway, one-fifth that of Denmark and it is the lowest by far in the group of ten nations. Even in the tiny Duchy of Luxembourg the GNP is twice that of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our economy needs special policies if it is to come to the stage of development in order to catch up with the other member and applicant countries of the EEC.  We need to protect our weaker industries and to develop alternative industries behind a tariff wall.  Could this not have been negotiated? Were any special efforts made to do this?  Was any special effort made to ensure that we could control our own finances so that we could use them for the development of this country?  Was any effort made to ensure that there would not be a flow of capital from here to other countries, to provide employment and money for people in other countries?</P>
    <P>It is essential that we prevent our finances and manpower from being pulled into the stronger regions.  This was referred to by Deputy FitzGerald. It is necessary for us to use State interventions as a means of economic development.  Will we be able to do that in EEC conditions?  Will we be able to keep our capital in this country for this purpose?  I do not think those questions have been answered adequately by any Fine Gael or Government speakers.</P>
    <P>All the statistics with regard to unemployment and GNP demonstrate how underdeveloped and vulnerable we are, and how much more vulnerable we would be if we became full members of the EEC.  In the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement our weaknesses were exposed, particularly in the industrial sector.  There was not the bonanza that was promised at the time by the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Haughey.  At that time he said very positively that so far as Irish agriculture was concerned there would be a <Col N="2418" /> direct benefit of £10 million in the first year.  We have seen the effects of that agreement in the redundancies which amounted last year to 9,000.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about people. Statistics can be thrown from one side of the House or the other, as has been done by Deputy FitzGerald and other speakers in this debate.  I know the Minister will not repeat what he said to other people&mdash;we thought he meant us&mdash;when he described them as being anti-national, enemies of the country, guilty of treason and so on. I am sure the Minister will appreciate our genuine concern for the people, particularly those who are dependent on industrial employment.  What we should be thinking about is not only this generation.  It is not just making a decision in 1972 and hoping that by 1978 everything will be all right.  This is something that should be seriously considered because we will not be thanked by succeeding generations if we make the wrong decision or if we do not obtain the proper safeguards which we have advocated should have been sought in the negotiations in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The Government should have sought an associate agreement in order to safeguard our small population and the employment of our people.  Such an agreement, even if we were only offered a medium-term one, could have offered us expanding markets and could have secured protection for our weak industries.  Instead of exploring the feasibility of such a course, the Government opt for full membership without any reservations whatsoever. I think it has been said before&mdash; I did certainly say it in this House&mdash; that even if an associate agreement was turned down, our negotiating position in discussions for full membership would, I believe, have been strengthened and there would have been a better appreciation by those with whom the Minister negotiated of the situation in this country where we have an underdeveloped economy.</P>
    <P>It was about 11 years ago that the Government decided on full membership and I assume that that was an instinctive reaction as soon as it was known that the British had applied <Col N="2419" /> for full membership as well.  I also remember that around that particular time, the then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, when questioned, in some queer mood of humour, said that even if Britain did not go in, we would go it alone.  However, I think that idea was dispelled by members of his own party very quickly indeed.  That decision to apply for full membership was taken in 1961.  In 1961 we did not have, and I suggest the Fianna Fáil Government who were then in power did not have, a full appreciation of the consequences of full membership. There was no reversal; there was no re-appraisal of the situation, no worthwhile one that we know of.  That is the essential difference between our party and that of the Government, the terms or the form of relationship with the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>We said, and we say again, that our economy is under-developed and requires special provisions which can only be secured through a treaty of association, but despite all the statistics which have been quoted with regard to the state of our economy in agriculture and industry, the Government still insist that our economy can withstand the full force of competition and all the obligations of membership.  Instead of that, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, without qualification, in, I think June of 1970:</P>
    <P>I now reaffirm on behalf of the Irish Government our full acceptance of the Treaties of Rome and Paris, their political finality and economic objectives and the decisions taken to implement them.</P>
    <P>He said that before we even started to negotiate, and there he was virtually throwing himself at the other Six and saying: &ldquo;No matter what the terms are, we want to be full members without we want to be full members without any serious reservation.&rdquo;  I think that was irresponsible on the part of the Minister.  I think it was irresponsible on the part of the Government to allow him to say it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>He said: &ldquo;We do not expect that the application of the common agricultural policy will present us with any major difficulty.&rdquo;  Of course, that went without saying.  Of course, agriculture&mdash;it has been dealt with in full by Deputy Keating&mdash;will benefit in the short term.  However, when one listens to what has been said and the evidence there is, submitted by members of this party, one realises that while there will be benefits in the short term, in the long term, the Irish farmer will undoubtedly find himself in the same mood as the farmers of Belgium, of Holland and of France where they find that the agricultural policy of the EEC has not proved to be the bonanza or the El Dorado which was promised to them 11 or 12 years ago.</P>
      <P>Agriculture will benefit, but people will be induced to leave the land.  We have here been decrying for a long time the flight from the land, and not from this side alone.  The Government Party have tried to stem it, as they said, by the application of various policies; they have tried to stem the flight from the land, but now under the conditions on which this country will become a full member of the EEC, these people will be induced to flee from the land.  Agriculture may be good but may be good for whom? For the few lucky survivors, but there will be thousands of casualties in my constituency, in the Minister's constituency and in every rural constituency in this country.  The small and medium-sized farmer is expected to disappear, will be encouraged to disappear, will be induced to disappear, and this represents 70 per cent of the Irish farmers.  That would not be so bad if on leaving the land, there was any sort of guarantee that there was going to be industrial employment for us.</P>
      <P>Speaking again on 30th June, 1970 &mdash;if the date is wrong, the Minister will not deny the quotation&mdash;the Minister said:</P>
      <P>We are confident of the increasing capacity of Irish industry generally to meet the competitive challenge involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2421" /> How can he in honesty say that when, again, I remind him that we have 77,000 unemployed, when, again, I remind him that the industrial incentives introduced by his Government so very many years ago for re-adaptation and so on were not availed of by Irish industry?  How can he say that when every Irish manufacturer is fearful for his survival, not in the next seven or eight years but in this year, next year or the year after?  How can he say that when he knows the precarious position in which the boot and shoe industry finds itself?  How can he say it when he has all the evidence &mdash;or his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has all the evidence&mdash;that the woollen and worsted industry and many other industries are hanging on from day to day and week to week, in the hope that something will turn up or that some other similar factory will close down and bring a bit of added business to them?</P>
    <P>He did say in that speech that there was a very small number of sensitive industries for which the existing arrangements may not be adequate but this, he said, would be discussed during the negotiations.  Could the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Minister for Foreign Afiairs, tell me whether any special terms were sought or any attempt made to get special terms for any industries outside the sugar industry or the motor car assembly industry?  I am talking about industry now.  If so, what were they? I know myself that because workers are fearful of their future, they have approached their Fianna Fáil representatives in the various towns and have asked what is going to happen.  This is so in the case of an industry which comes to mind quickly, Springs Limited, who make springs practically exclusively for this country.</P>
    <P>When they approached their Fianna Fáil representatives, they were told that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would attempt to negotiate special terms for that particular industry, and this happened all over the country. It was designed to stifle the antagonism and opposition there was, and still is, on the part of these workers to full <Col N="2422" /> membership of the EEC without adequate protection for the industries on which they depended for their livelihood. I think the Minister is bound to tell us this and not merely to say, as the Taoiseach said, that the motor car assembly industry is protected to a degree up to 1984, that we have our sugar quota for two years and that it will be reviewed.  There are other industries, many of which I have mentioned here, which should have had special mention by the Government spokesmen and certainly should have had special consideration by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his negotiations in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I do not know what one can say for the White Paper.  I shall not say it is unreadable but there is not much consolation in it for those dependent on employment in the industrial sector. The White Paper, like all the documents presented by the Government, are pieces of propaganda in the guise of economic projections.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the speech to which I referred, prior to the negotiations, I think, said that apart from arrangements for fisheries, plant and animal health&mdash;and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;it is not expected that membership of the Communities would create exceptional problems for Ireland&rdquo;.  In this, the last debate before the referendum, unless the Minister gives an answer different from what he has given, I think that should be described, and is being described by me, an absolute irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>But there is a gleam of hope for those who are committed either by conviction or because of political loyalty to the idea of full membership of EEC. There is a projection that 50,000 new jobs will be created between 1970 and 1978.  Why it should be dealt with in retrospect I do not know, but if we talk about 1970 and 1971 and prospects for 1972 it seems to me very unlikely that we shall attain the target of 50,000 new jobs.  Between 1970 and the end of 1972, according to the information we have, there will be no increase in total employment.  So, for the first two years referred to in this document, we have not increased the number of jobs. In 1970 and in 1971 there was no increase in employment.  In 1969 we had <Col N="2423" /> 1,073,000 people in total employment; in 1970 it had decreased to 1,066,000; early in 1972 we had in total employment more or less the same number as in 1969.  Since the projection is that there will be 50,000 more jobs created between 1970 and 1978 this means that the task of the Government on the assumption of full EEC membership is, within six years, between 1972 and 1978, to provide 50,000 new jobs.  That represents over 8,000 new jobs per year.</P>
    <P>From where and from whom will they come?  This is all so vague when one gets down to the realities.  Talk is all very well; in the White Paper the Minister could have said 100,000 new jobs.  Where he got the 50,000 new jobs I do not know.  Now that the Taoiseach has signed the Treaty of Accession, would the Minister for Foreign Affairs consult his colleague in the short time available to him and find out how many inquiries have come to the Industrial Development Authority from outside the country in regard to the establishment of industry here. It would be interesting to know if there has been an increase and much more interesting to discover if there has been a decrease.  There is great talk about the Japenese and the Americans coming to establish industries here in order to gain access to Europe but, as yet, we have no evidence of this.  I believe the figure of 50,000 net new jobs is based on the assumption that the flight from the land will slow down and that the rate of redundancy will remain the same as in 1970.  But in 1971 redundancy doubled from 4,500 to 9,000.  The assumption is that the number of new jobs created would be 110,000 but this is not justified in the White Paper and there has been no consultation with and no comment from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or from individual trade unions or from Irish industry.  The assumption that there will be 10,000 new jobs and a net 50,000 jobs is, I suppose, based on the assumption that fewer than 60,000 will lose their jobs in agriculture, plus redundancies.  Is that how the figure of 50,000 is reached?</P>
    <P>It is assumed that foreign firms <Col N="2424" /> will establish themselves here.  Whether they will come from Europe or outside it, I do not know, but it seems unlikely that if there are 2,200,000 people out of work in the EEC countries at present they will not have sufficient labour there to establish industries in their own countries.  Certainly, they will not come from Britain in view of the unemployment situation there and the unattractiveness of this country in recent years, especially when one remembers that they have one million unemployed to provide with jobs.  We have our own problems with something in the region of 80,000 people unemployed.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper there are also projections about the growth rate which, it is stated, will be 5 per cent per year between 1970 and 1978. Again, I do not know why it was mentioned in this way in the White Paper. In the first two years, between 1970 and 1972, the growth rate here averaged only 2 per cent per year.  Therefore, in order to achieve the target the growth rate between 1973 and 1978 will have to be about 6½ per cent if we are to catch up at the time of free trade, if we enter EEC.  We had the same sort of programmes from Fianna Fáil Governments since 1957.  We had the same sort of forecasts in regard to employment and the same sort of projections regarding growth rate.  I did not know my time was so limited. I wanted to talk about prices and refute things said in the White Paper and projections made there.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much. The White Paper projection regarding prices was that there would be a 1 per cent per year increase in prices between 1973 and 1978.  Yet, we were told agricultural incomes would increase by 50 per cent.  Food prices on the Continent are nearly 50 per cent higher than in Ireland.  In my view, the real increase per annum will be 4 per cent.  If I am challenged on that I would say that my advice&mdash;and the advice I get is not as widespread as that available to the Government&mdash;is that it will be 4 per cent.  My prediction <Col N="2425" /> of 4 per cent is as good as the modest 1 per cent mentioned by the Government.  The White Paper cannot be sustained by any reasonable argument.  It is not one that should be taken for the assumptions or projections it contains.  It is merely a propaganda document, as have been all the other documents circulated by the Government.  At this stage it would be no harm to compare it with a document issued by a trade union that have come out overwhelmingly against full membership of the EEC.  I refer to that balanced document issued by the ITGWU which gave the pros and cons of entry or non-entry, of association or of full membership.  It was a much more honest document than the literature produced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>This White Paper is not a serious document.  Workers want to know what are the prospects for their future. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the workers are afraid of their own immediate future but there is nothing either in the White Paper or in the Taoiseach's speech that gives them any reason for hope or consolation regarding their security.  We need not necessarily be concerned about the other applicants.  We cannot say what will be the outcome of the referendum but we know that so far as Norway is concerned, 46 per cent of the people are against membership for that country and it appears that in Denmark the majority are against membership. There are indications also that in respect of Britain, a proposal for full membership would be turned down if there were a referendum, certainly on the conditions that were negotiated by the Tory Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper should have given a detailed assessment of the prospects for every section of industry instead of giving merely a global promise of 50,000 new jobs.  If jobs are in danger, people have a right to be told so.  It is not good enough to quote the special protocol for industry which in itself is vague and has no firm commitment as far as protection for Irish industry is concerned.  In relation to agriculture we are told that if we do not opt for full membership we will not get benefits for agriculture.  Norway has a special <Col N="2426" /> protocol for agriculture and we also should have sought a special protocol.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to be too disparaging but so far as the Taoiseach's speech is concerned, it is a typical Brian Lenihan one.  On top of it I wrote the words: &ldquo;No problem&rdquo;.  This was the message I got from the Taoiseach's ten page speech.  I trust that within the time available to the Minister for Foreign Affairs he will expand further on the speech and will spell out the prospects for workers and for industry.  This is not done either in the White Paper or in the Taoiseach's speech.  For our part we will endeavour to try, by way of argument, to persuade the people that the terms that have been negotiated by the Government will do untold damage not only to the industrial sector of our economy but to the whole country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Corish has said, this is the final debate in this House on the question of whether we join the European Communities.  We should realise that the Community we are discussing is a political Community and the decision of any country to become a member is, primarily, a political decision.  Indeed, in our case should we decide to become a member of that Community, we would be exercising our sovereignty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there are strong political reasons as to why the European Community came into being.  One can recall that in this century, before half the century was out, Europe had almost destroyed itself and its people in two dreadful wars, wars that brought carnage and destruction and  and suffering to the Continent of Europe and to most European countries. We were one of the few  did not have our land despoiled  we did suffer our own losses.  It is well to remember that this idea of Europe which has been discussed very sincerely and very fully during this debate by various Deputies has been discussed on the basis of statistics proving one thing or another.  Necessarily, of course, we must approach it in that way but there is an idealism about Europe which I hope we will not forget.  We should remember that after the last war had ended the great liberal statesmen of Europe, the great <Col N="2427" /> humanitarian movements of Europe, the vast number of peoples and organisations who were concerned for the future of European humanity and the great socialist leaders of Europe, great men like de Gaspari and Schuman, came together to form this new Europe. Let us recall, too, the principles they put before themselves.  The first of these was to end forever the conflicts which for so long divided the nations of western Europe and the second was to restore Europe's self respect and to enable her to play a role in the world commensurate with her economic strength and cultural heritage, to improve by joint action the working conditions and the living standards of the people of Europe, to abolish the outdated barriers which split western Europe into small protected markets, to speed up technological progress and to make possible large scale operations in the increasing number of industries in which it was essential.  The final principle was to make a special joint effort to help the less favoured areas of the Community and their overseas associates.</P>
    <P>These are the political aims of Europe and it is a matter of regret for me that the Labour Party, as they are entitled to do, cannot for economic reasons subscribe to the idea of Ireland partaking in this great new political movement.  I am sure it is not a question of their not being able to subscribe to the aims I have mentioned because these aims inspire the minds of everybody here and would arouse the idealism that ought to be latent in every political movement.</P>
    <P>Our dialogue and discussion descends from the idealistic and comes down to facts and figures, percentages, statistics and all the dull dreary arguments which must be involved when one considers Europe merely as a training and commercial enterprise.  If we must approach it in that way let us do so but let us do so with a sense of objectivity and of intellectual honesty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it appears that a certain amount of intellectual honesty may be missing <Col N="2428" /> among certain people who have taken part in this dialogue particularly outside the House.  Facts should be faced. Regardless of whether we like the idea, Europe will never be the same again and Ireland, from the end of this year will never be the same again.  A change is coming in which we can have no say, no way of controlling it and no way of stopping it and the choice is not between remaining as we are and entering the new Europe.  That is not the choice.  That choice is no longer there.  The choice is something different, which I will mention in a moment.</P>
      <P>I suppose people who have a very emotional approach to Ireland will always hanker for the good old days, the Irish way of life, the special, particular, independent way in which they regard us as carrying on and living our lives.  Such people do not want to be disturbed and really wish things would remain the same.  What they are wishing for is that the British had not decided to enter Europe.  If Britain had not decided to enter Europe, perhaps, we could continue in a sort of Celtic twilight, producing cheap food to feed the British as we have done for so many centuries, watching our young people leave the land and go to work for other countries and other people and sing Irish ballads in the local taverns, wishing to be back in Ireland.  Such people never returned home.  Some people regard this whole question in such a manner.  Why can things not be the same?  They cannot be the same, for the simple reason that the British have decided to enter Europe, and that places upon us the obligation to realise that a change is coming.  We either control that change or we will be controlled and, in my view, destroyed by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that because, strange to say, there are people in this country who do not realise it.  They think that the choice is between continuing the existing trading arrangement which has operated over the years between ourselves and Britain or deciding to take a leap into the unknown.  That is not the choice.  Another factor should be mentioned.  There is a strange feeling round the country at the moment. It is that people do not like the holding <Col N="2429" /> of a referendum and that the present Government are unpopular&mdash; and one can say that again&mdash;and that the people are likely to teach them a lesson and turn it down.  There is such a danger.  Had this party of which I have the honour to be a member decided to play politics, we could have caused a very serious situation, but we had regard to what we believed to be the national interest.  We have not allowed any consideration of political or party advantage to enter into our view in relation to this question. People think that a referendum will be held which may or may not succeed, but if it does not succeed that they can always have another &ldquo;go&rdquo; in the autumn.  Let us end that feeling here and now.</P>
    <P>In my view this is Ireland's only chance to enter Europe.  This chance will never again be repeated.  If our people freely decide when the referendum is held not to go into Europe, that will be a decision for all time.</P>
    <P>If we come next year like the Bisto Kids of Europe scratching at the pane, and trying to knock again we will be met by a veto so clear that it will blow the cobwebs from many of our ears. It is because we are here as a primary producer of food that Britain had her problems with New Zealand.  Because we are here as a primary producer of food, the Danes are wondering whether they are better in or out. If we decide not to go in, let us do so knowing that if we apply again we will be met by a British or a Danish veto.</P>
    <P>Let us approach the question in that knowledge and in that frame of mind. What is the choice?  We either go in or stay out.  In the referendum that is the choice.  There is no further alternative. There is no possibility of an association relationship.  Such a relationship is talked about here.  It is amazing how people can invent an alternative from nowhere.  I have always believed one cannot have a marriage without somebody being willing to marry you.  We cannot have an association agreement without somebody being willing to associate with us.  There is no alternative.  We either go in or stay out.  That is the choice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2430" /> Nobody now could doubt the consequences to us of staying out.  Ireland is the nearest bit of rock to America. It is a little, rocky island off the shore of Europe.  What sort of future would we have if we stay out?  What would posterity think of those who led people to such a decision, who scattered our young people all over the world like the wandering tribes of Israel?  We would be abdicating our responsibility of providing a way of life for our people if we decide to stay out of Europe.  Do people realise that on such a decision from 1st January next year a European frontier would march across six of our counties from Newry to Lifford?  Everything we sell would bear tariffs of from 10 to 20 per cent. We could live on our fat if we had fat, but we do not have it.  We face an immediate situation in which there would be a general, economic collapse. Who wants that?  Who desires that? Who is seeking that end in Ireland today?  There may be some who desire it consciously&mdash;and they are not my concern&mdash;but if those who argue this way would only realise the eventual logic of their stand, I have no doubt but that they would change.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party may say that they do not agree.  They are forced into saying that if we stay out we must try to seek some agreement with Europe. We will be in a very nice, bargaining position, having slapped the Europeans on the face; rejecting the whole idealism of Europe, we now go crying to them, saying: &ldquo;By reason of our decision, what will you do for us?&rdquo; The Bisto Kids of Europe!  that is what we will be.  What will you do for us?  At least the Swedes are at the moment busy trying to hammer out some deal with Europe before the inevitable logic of the facts of the situation force Sweden into Europe and I have no doubt but that, before 12 months are out, Sweden will be a full member of the European Community. She is trying to avoid that at the moment.  What is she trying to do? She is trying to hammer out a free trade area agreement with the EEC. All right.  Supposing we were lucky enough, and had the bargaining power to do it, to be able to seek such an agreement, where would we be then? <Col N="2431" /> They would not want our agricultural products.  Presumably they would allow us some base in the British market at prices they would dictate.  Presumably they would allow us to sell our industrial goods free of tariff&mdash;they are prepared to agree to this&mdash;on the basis that European goods would, of course, come in here.</P>
    <P>What is our bargaining position?  I cannot understand how people have got themselves into the position in which they appear to be.  A Europe in those circumstances, Britain and the other seven, would represent 80 per cent of our export market and 100 per cent of our agricultural market. We refuse to join and then we say: &ldquo;Let us do a deal&rdquo;.  We have removed all bargaining power.  The best we can hope for is the free import into this country of the industrial goods of Europe in return for some concession which will allow our agricultural exports to go in the same direction as they have been going, with the added problem that they will have to be levied in some undefined way.</P>
    <P>This is suggested as an alternative. Maybe that would save our export industry, but it would mean we would still have to live with free trade; our textile industries, our boot and shoe industries, to which Deputy Corish referred, would still have to face the challenge of free trade in any event, but this time they would face it without our country having any control whatsoever or any rights whatsoever, in no position to develop any policy or in any way control our economy.</P>
    <P>Is that seriously suggested as an alternative to entering Europe proudly, with confidence and courage?  I cannot understand how ordinary rational men can put themselves in the position of so advocating.  What would happen, apart altogether from the ordinary ravages of free trade?  There are challenges and difficulties admittedly in free trade, as we all know, but what would happen to our existing industries, the ones that might meet the challenge of free trade in those circumstances, the ones which at the moment may be engaged not only in providing for the home market but also for the <Col N="2432" /> export market?  Take Guinness.  Guinness is a traditional Irish industry which controls many breweries throughout the country; there is one very important one in Kilkenny.  What would Guinness do in those circumstances? They would produce for the home market.  They would change their production to Britain and from Britain export to the European Economic Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One could name any number of industries that would be so affected.  I cannot personally see any logic other than the logic of taking what is there, the choice that is open to us and the opportunity that is offered.  I should like to feel we could make this choice with confidence and enthusiasm, sharing in the political hope and the idealism that ought to be there, but that, as I have said, is a matter for each one's individual approach to this.  Even on the mundane question of the material welfare of our people the logic points in the same direction as the idealism indicates.</P>
      <P>The cost of living has been mentioned. Of course the cost of living will increase.  Why would it not?  Are we to be special among the nations of the world, we, a primary producer of food, that we are afraid of the economic consequences to this country if our farmers can achieve what they have been seeking to achieve for generations, namely, selling in an unlimited market at prices twice what they are getting at the moment?  Are we going to squeal about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2433" /> Whether the resulting increase in the cost of living is 1 per cent or 2 per cent over four or five years, is it suggested that this is a price we refuse to pay?</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan talked about Laois-Offaly last evening.  I will ask Deputy Flanagan to take a look at all the ghost towns all over Laois and Offaly, towns that saw their day, towns in which a penny is not stirring, towns in which nothing is happening.  Why? Because of the impoverished farming and agricultural industry around them.  What will happen to out country towns when we enter Europe? If you find £60 million increased income going into the Irish agricultural industry the lights will go on again in the midland towns of Ireland and I have no doubt you will find a real increase in business and in small industries. The small shopkeeper will again have a chance.  There will be a transformation in the scene in provincial Ireland.</P>
    <P>But we will have to pay more for food.  I believe we can ride that; I believe we can adjust to it.  But there are those who will suffer, and nobody ought to suffer.  There are those who will suffer if we do not take steps now.  I refer to pensioners, to those on fixed incomes, I do not mind whether they are from the State or from any other source.  Let us give a commitment here, honestly and sincerely, that no person on a fixed income will suffer for the sake of putting the economy of this country on a sound basis. There will be £30 million net made available as a result of the removal of agricultural subsidies.  My party will insist that that money will from a pool to insulate people on fixed incomes from any fall in their real incomes as a result of our going into Europe.  It is only right, it is only fair and it is only socially just.  If as a result of the decision to go into Europe prices have to rise, there are those who can ride that rise in prices. But these people cannot and they must be protected.</P>
    <P>Other bogies have been used by various people arguing against Europe and I think one or two should be dealt <Col N="2434" /> with.  It is said that the foreigners&mdash; the Germans, the Belgians and the French&mdash;will come here and buy up our land.  People who say that are people whose general from of exercise is to shift their rumps from one arm-chair to another, sitting in Dublin and thinking of the place their family left in the West of Ireland centuries ago.  They have as much concern for the preservation of Irish land and the Irish way of life as Mao Tse Tung or Ted Heath has.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  Of course it is implicit in the whole principle of Europe that there shall be no discrimination in relation to the purchase of land, to living in any part of the Community, and so on.  It is because of that we have this vista of the beer barons of Europe ranching Irish land with fat cattle and our people working for them somewhere else.  But this is not in accordance with facts.  The whole object and purpose&mdash;and it is being worked out now: whether people have a feeling in this respect or not the work is going ahead&mdash;of the Mansholt policy is to try to provide in every backward region a people established on the land entitled to earn a similar income as that which can be got in the industrial sector.  That is the object and that is the policy.  Towards that end in the transitional period inducement will be offered to the older land owner to give his land to somebody else.  That inducement will mean that he will benefit and the person who gets his land will benefit.  It is implicit in the Mansholt approach that a pool of land must be made available as priority to small farmers.  Not only will we find when we go into Europe that the concern will be to provide land for residential small farmers in any particular region but we will be asked what are we doing about it.  I should like to suggest to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that we take action now, in case there is any one now who still believes in this canard about foreigners purchasing our land.  Let us now provide the machinery in the Land Commission, the list of priorities which will ensure that Irish land as a matter of priority, in accordance with European policy, will be available first of all for the small farmers of <Col N="2435" /> Ireland.  I would recommend that that be done now.  It is in accordance with the policy being advocated in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald dealt very fully today with regional policy but opponents of the idea of going into Europe have said that there is no regional policy.  I suppose they felt that the statesmen of Europe for the last 25 or 30 years and all the people in Brussels have not been doing their job&mdash;they really should have been working out a solution for the future of Ireland.  That is what they think. What have these Eurocrats been doing that they have not worked out an immediate policy to save the West of Ireland?  We have no responsibility at all of course.  They do not think there is any obligation on Irishmen to work out the destiny of their own country.  Of course a regional policy must come from the region.  A regional policy must be worked out by those who live there and know the problems. That is precisely what I hope we will be able to do when we go into Europe: that we will look at our underdeveloped area, which is west of the Lagan, which is west of the Shannon, which runs throughout all of Ireland.  No Border will interfere with that; the regional problem will be the same in any part of Ireland.  I hope we will be able to develop a proper regional plan for our own underdeveloped regions probably also incorporating the Hebrides and other parts of the neighbouring island.  We can do it with our own intelligence, our own imagination, our own knowledge of the problems of our own country and we will be assisted in doing it by European investment: the money and credit can be made available.</P>
    <P>Nobody can ever be certain.  We are all human beings, we may fail in what we aim to do, but one can almost prophesy a real hope for the west and north west of Ireland inside Europe.  What kind of a future would the west and north west of our country have if we remained outside Europe?  What would happen to change what has been happening up to this?  With the weakening economy, without any possibility of maintaining <Col N="2436" /> a way of life there, it would disappear; but who would come marching in?  The beer barons of Europe? If you want to keep Irish land in the hands of Irish farmers you will do it by going into Europe.  If you want to sell Irish land to the foreigners you will do it by staying out of Europe.  That is as certain as night follows day, because the people will not stay, they will be offered a price which will be attractive to them and you will find this country, if we stay outside Europe, becoming the playground of the rich Europeans.</P>
    <P>We would have liked the terms negotiated to be better terms.  In particular we are not satisfied with the terms in relation to fisheries.  We are very concerned with the provisions in relation to dumping.  We have these reservations.  We think we may have the responsibility of doing something about these things in due course.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government has today made an order appointing Wednesday, 10th May, 1972, to be the polling day of the referendum on the proposal to amend the Constitution to allow the State to become a member of the European Communities.  Polling will take place between the hours of 9 a.m. and 10 p.m.  The Minister has also made an order appointing Mr. Gerald O'Doherty, a principal officer in his Department, to be the returning officer for the purpose of the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2437" /> I should like to add to what Deputy O'Higgins has said, that on 10th May we get an opportunity to vote and we have to insist that this chance will not come again.  There will be no second run at it.  We make a decision which, one way or the other, will be a firm decision about the future course of the country and the decision to join Europe is the only one that I or any member of the Government on behalf of the Government could recommend to the people.  Anybody with any responsibility to bear, either in fact or in imagination, for the future of this country and its government could only be appalled at the prospect of carrying that responsibility if the country failed to decide now, in the present conditions and on the present terms negotiated, to accept membership.</P>
    <P>Apart from some inaccuracies about the terms negotiated, I think Deputy O'Higgins made a very useful contribution to this debate in stressing this fact that the decision is so appallingly different&mdash;a decision to go ahead into membership, into a framework where this country can find its full economic and social development, where the normal democratic processes here can work for the development of this country in co-operation with countries democratically ruled in the same way as this one is, or a decision to turn away from the other democratic countries in Europe, to turn towards a situation where we would be seeking charity from a Community where we could have rights or where we would have to look elsewhere for the support of a crashing economy.  This decision is such a big one that I would like to say again that we will not get the chance to make it twice.  We make it on the 10th May and it will be made by the people.  Anybody whom I can influence to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for membership to Europe, I will do so.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, when the Taoiseach asked me to go to Europe, to the capitals, to find out was there any change in the position about negotiations, I was met with the appalling news there at the time that there was a prospect of a Community of seven, that Britain would be admitted through negotiations <Col N="2438" /> and that the other applicants would follow at a later date.  At that time we made a serious study of the effects of this on our people, on our economy and of our prospects for negotiating conditions of entry with a Europe of seven rather than with a Europe of six.</P>
    <P>Since that examination I have put as much of my time and energy as possible into convincing the people concerned in Europe that we should be allowed to negotiate at the same time as Britain and accede at the same time as Britain.  They accepted this and they have given us conditions on which we can do it and it is in the hands of our own people now.  But, if by our own decision we fail to take this opportunity, the same prospect is there before us of coming back, as Deputy O'Higgins said, begging for charity from a Community where we could have rights, coming back to negotiate with a Community in which there are people whose interests are different from ours, to negotiate with a Community of people whose own interests would be damaged, perhaps, as Deputy O'Higgins said, by our admission.  This opportunity to negotiate these terms of entry, to negotiate admission, will not come again.</P>
    <P>About the same time as we started this investigation on behalf of the Taoiseach, or soon after, there was a leading article in one of the Irish papers saying that the Minister for External Affairs was interested only in the price of butter in this European venture.  This, of course, was not so but, no matter how high up we start on the idealism in relation to membership of Europe, we always end up sliding down the economic and other problems involved until we come to the price of butter.  Deputy Corish first, and then Deputy O'Higgins, started off by saying that this is a political decision and it should be based on political considerations.  In both cases they met the same fate as I have so often met, ending up talking about the ordinary things that bother ordinary people about membership of Europe.</P>
    <P>I will try it the other way round.  I will try to deal with some of the points raised in the debate.  Most of the points <Col N="2439" /> against membership have been dealt with by other speakers here and there is no need for me to deal with them. Some of the points made in the debate I will deal with and I will try to end by dealing with some concepts of the Community as I see it and as I would wish to have the country join.</P>
    <P>Most of Deputy Corish's speech was taken up with the threat of free trade.  I should like to say again&mdash; and I will say it as often as I can&mdash; that free trade is coming whether we join Europe or not.  Free trade is coming.  Europe is there.  Europe is enlarging.  Britain is joining Europe. These are facts of life.  So, the question of worrying now about what will happen or what we can do about free trade is a job for a banshee.  It is no good going around saying we will all be ruined if we join the Community because of free trade.  We are going to have free trade whether we join the Community or not and, instead of doing a banshee job on it, the Government, ten years ago, commenced the preparation of this country for free trade.  I do not know how well it was understood by Opposition Deputies at the time but when we made unilateral cuts in our tariffs, when we made the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain, when we set up the Department of Labour and legislated for the provision of training for workers and retraining, when we brought in legislation for redundancy and resettlement, when the CIO reports were instituted, when grants were made available to industrialists for adaptation and when time after time the present Taoiseach and the Taoiseach before him went throughout the country exhorting managements to take steps to meet free trade, this is what we were preparing for.  We were preparing for free trade, which is coming anyway.  Our decision to meet free trade as a member of the European Communities instead of meeting it outside of membership, without any help, was a decision taken after we had made it quite clear that free trade was coming anyway.  We decided then that we would meet the problems and difficulties of free trade as a member of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2440" /> When Deputy Corish referred to the Minister for Transport and Power in a jocose way saying &ldquo;no problem&rdquo; I know he did not mean to offend him.  Nobody in the Government has ever said there will not be any problem. We are prepared for problems. We have told the people there will be problems.  What we emphasise is that there shall be fewer problems by our being members of the EEC.  Free trade is coming anyhow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating argued that an association agreement would be preferable to full membership.  That is a measure of the weakness of the case he put.  He illustrated his case by referring to the association agreement entered into by the Community with Turkey and he said that the same type of agreement would meet our interests, and suggested we could now negotiate such an agreement.  That is nonsense.  Ireland is not Turkey.  The considerations which existed in the case of Turkey do not apply to Ireland. Turkey is an underdeveloped country&mdash;it is accepted as an underdeveloped country&mdash;and I suppose it is necessary to make the point that classification as a developed country or an underdeveloped country is done not by the country concerned but by other countries.  It is done according to objective economic criteria.</P>
    <P>We might look at some of the international statistics.  We find that the gross national product in Ireland is four times that of Turkey.  72 per cent of Turkey's work force is in agriculture. The figure we have now for Ireland is 27 per cent.  These are examples of the major economic differences between Ireland and Turkey.</P>
    <P>In October, 1969, the EEC Commission gave an opinion on Ireland's application for membership.  In that opinion they stated that we were a developed country and the Community has dealt with us on that basis.  It was possible for Turkey to negotiate the terms of an associated membership because the Community regarded Turkey as an underdeveloped country. There were other considerations.  The Community takes care of itself.  For instance, the Community gave favourable <Col N="2441" /> concessions to Turkey for her agricultural exports because these consisted of products which are not produced, or produced in insufficient quantity, in Community nations.  Therefore, when Deputy Keating speaks about agricultural products which the Community would buy, I should like to refer him to Turkey's exports to the Community&mdash;tobacco, hazel nuts, dried grapes, seeds, citrus fruits and olive oil.  The Community will take any amount of these because they are not in direct competition with Community interests.</P>
    <P>Even if the Community were prepared to begin to negotiate for associate membership for Ireland, I do not think Deputy Keating believes that the Community would be, or could afford to be, so generous with Ireland in respect of the temperate zone products which we export.  In regard to temperate zone products, we are in direct competition with the nations of the Community, and we must remember that the Community is there for the benefit of all its people.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Keating has visualised a situation in which the Community would allow any exit for our dairy produce although he must know how much farmers, particularly small farmers, depend on dairy produce. He said that Turkey got a transitional period of 22 years.  I can tell him that the basic transitional period given to Turkey was 12 years and in respect of some produce it was given 22 years.  Therefore Deputy Keating was inaccurate in that respect.  Neither was he accurate when he said that from time to time all Turkish produce has free access to Community markets. The condition does not apply to fabrics and textiles which comprise one-third of Turkey's industrial exports. The excluded products are those which are in competition with Community production.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can take it that the Community lets in what does not harm them in any type of market.  All our industrial products would be in direct competition with all or some members of the Community.  Therefore, the likelihood of free access for our industrial goods would be removed even if the Community thought in terms of <Col N="2442" /> Ireland being an underdeveloped country.  I suppose the Deputy thinks we might get free access for some of our industrial products for a 12 or a 20-year period.  In that time we would be excluded in respect of our industrial products and we would be excluded&mdash; and I emphasise this&mdash;from participation in the EEC common agricultural policy and from taking an effective part in the making of Community decisions.</P>
    <P>I think any decisions made by the Community will affect vitally our interests in the near and far future. Our exclusion would mean that in a period of, for instance, 12 years our growth would be less than that of the Community and everybody will accept that the rich countries are getting richer and the poor poorer.  Therefore, there is no point in advising our people to take the road to being worse off, and I do not think anybody legitimately will suggest that in a period of 12 years we could close the gap now existing between us and EEC countries.</P>
    <P>We need the help of the Community. There is not anything to stop us from growing except lack of capital.  If there is one thing which will stop us from creating new jobs for our people it is lack of capital.  As members of the Community we will have access to capital.  As I have said, the gap between us and the Community will widen if we are outside it, and the disasters spoken of by Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;the wiping out of our industries and the wrecking of our entire economy&mdash;will bring all the bad effects that people forecast who speak against membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>If we do not join the Community now, the arguments put up by the Labour Party against our joining will certainly come true.  If the Community negotiates with us on the basis of recognising that we need help&mdash;as that was done in the protocol&mdash;we will get it and it will be guaranteed on the basis of our present state of development.  Anybody making an assessment of the progress made by countries who have capital available to them, and who compare that with those who have not, will see that our decision to join the Community now is the wise one.  A <Col N="2443" /> decision on our part to stay out of the Community would have the effect of widening the gap, of making it much more difficult for us to become members of the Community at a future date.  If we were to become members at a future date our contrary decision now would create a much bigger problem for the Community then in respect of what they have now undertaken in our respect&mdash;to bring this country's level of development up to that of their present member nations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish remarked that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries could not get in.  I would remind him that they have spoken in many debates here in regard to our membership of the EEC.  One point the Minister for Industry and Commerce might have liked to deal with is the cost of living.  It is impossible exactly to predict what the cost of living will be in membership of the EEC.  Nobody knows the changes that will take place in agriculture prices during the next few years.  The only estimate that can be made is one related to prices in the EEC and in Ireland at the moment. If we are to close the gap between these two sets of prices in a period of five years from now, it appears that the overall cost of food will rise here between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. Because the cost of food represents only part of the cost of living, the increase in the overall consumer price index would be less than that, not more than 1 per cent a year.  That is the extent of the increase in consumer prices directly attributable to membership of the EEC.  However, membership of the EEC may be expected to bring reductions in the prices of some items other than food.  The elimination of protective duties on trade within the Community and improved competition in the sale of many goods should benefit the consumer by lower prices or better value for money.</P>
    <P>It must be said that factors such as rising costs due to general inflation may affect prices in the years ahead. I think the House would agree that it would be clearly wrong to attribute all that or any such price increases to <Col N="2444" /> EEC membership.  The direct effect of EEC membership on consumer prices will be quite small.  Some opponents of membership, who have made very misleading and even dishonest statements about food prices after we join the EEC, must know that the real effect will be quite small.  These people have quoted the retail price of some food in Germany and claimed that we in Ireland will have to pay the same prices as they now do in Germany. This is simply not true.  In the present Community of six countries prices vary greatly and widely.</P>
    <P>Membership of the EEC does not require us to have the same retail prices as any other member of the Community.  The results of a survey of retail prices within the Community published last year illustrate this position.  The price of bread was found to be 10 per cent higher in Germany than in the other countries while beef, fresh fish and some milk products were cheapest in the Netherlands. Variations were found in the cost of other goods and services largely due to local conditions in the member countries.  It is quite irresponsible and quite misleading to select prices of particular products in particular countries and say that the Irish prices for these goods will be similar.  The classic example which has been taken is that of the price of tea.  The anti-EEC lobby implied we will all have to pay the very high price now found in Germany. There is no reason whatever why the price of tea should change because we join Europe.  We do not buy our tea for Europe and there will be no import duties payable on tea.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of neutrality.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien went so far as to allege that I had in the negotiations voluntarily offered that we would enter into military commitments.  This is totally without foundation.</P>

      <P>I have answered questions. I think the Deputy's party are more responsible for this than I am. Questions were asked of me in the Dáil and in newspapers but in the negotiations this did not arise.  When the Taoiseach opened the debate, and I think it is clearly stated in the White Paper, he said that there are no military or defence commitments whatsoever in Ireland's acceptance of the Treaties of Rome and Paris.  Our obligations as a member of the Communities will not entail such commitments. It may be instructive for Deputies on the Labour benches who persist in this anxiety on the question of military and defence commitments if I recall some of the remarks made by the representative of the French Government, the French Foreign Minister, M. Schuman, when he visited both Dublin and Copenhagen in the second half of 1971.  He is reported from Copenhagen as saying&mdash; I have a quotation which is a translation from the transcript of a television interview:</P>
      <P>France has never at any time associated adhesion to the European Economic Community with conditions of a military character. That would be absurd.  The European Community, as its name indicates, is an economic one.  The proof, moreover, is that among the countries applying for membership at the present moment there is one, Ireland, which is not even a member of the Atlantic Alliance, which is a country, if you wish, neutral in the general sense of the term and which in no way renounces its neutrality in entering the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a quotation from a television interview in Copenhagen.  While he was in Dublin M. Schuman, apart <Col N="2446" /> from the discussions I had with him and which he had with members of the Opposition, spoke to the press on the question of neutrality.  I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 21st October, 1971:</P>
    <P>There was no provision whatever in the Treaty of Rome stating that membership of the EEC involved belonging to any particular alliance. The EEC was a purely economic community.  It was wrong to say that joining the Community involved a change in Ireland's neutral policy.</P>
    <P>If Deputies on the Labour benches will not heed what the Taoiseach called the repeated unequivocal assurance given by the Government on this subject perhaps they will at least take note of the considered remarks of the distinguished Foreign Minister of France.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien in his speech also alleged that the Government were claiming that membership would solve the problem of Partition.  We are not.  Neither the Government nor any speaker in our party made such a claim.  It would be absurd to make a claim like that. What we have said, and what is obviously true, is that, as a consequence of Britain's decision to join, the North will be in the Community. That decision is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>If we in this part of the country decide to join then the whole of Ireland will be in the Community and a very considerable degree of economic integration will follow.  For example, both parts of the country will be participating in the one Common <Col N="2447" /> Market.  This means that there will be no tariffs or other restriction on trade between North and South. For agriculture much more will be involved. As a result of the operation of the Community's common agricultural policy throughout the whole country, Irish farmers, North and South, will be working under the same conditions as regards prices and marketing of their products.</P>
      <P>Membership of the EEC will bring about freer movement of people between the North and the South because with Britain and the Six Counties a member of the Community the restriction at present in force in the North on employment of people, which we regard as most undesirable, will have to be abolished.  Another advantage of joining the EEC in so far as North/ South relations are concerned, is that the common policies of the Community in matters of great importance to us will be in operation throughout the Thirty-two Counties.</P>
      <P>In addition to the common agricultural policy, there are also economic, regional and social policies.  The operation of these policies throughout the whole country will provide an unprecedented opportunity for concerted action North and South in dealing with the economic and social problems which we share.  In membership there will be unprecedented opportunities for close co-operation on a practical basis between North and South for the benefit of the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands dealt fully with the matter of the structural reform of agriculture and the related question of the purchase of agricultural land by non-nationals.  I should like to return briefly to these matters as some comments were made by speakers who followed the Minister in the debate.  I should like to make three points.  First, there has been a draft Community directive before the Council of Ministers since 1969 which, if adopted, would give nationals of one member country the right to purchase agricultural land in another country under the same conditions as a national of that country.  We have received assurances that no action will be taken with regard <Col N="2448" /> to the adoption of this draft directive before the enlargement of the Community. If after enlargement moves are initiated towards its adoption, Ireland as a member with a full voice and vote in the Council of Ministers&mdash;the decision-making body of the Community&mdash;can and will ensure that our interests are taken into account and are protected.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Community is now on the point of adopting proposals in regard to the structural reform of agriculture. One of the main features of these proposals is the opportunity and assistance that will be offered to small farmers who decide to adopt development plans for their farms for the purpose of improving efficiency and productivity, thereby giving them a decent standard of living.  There is a very important provision which will give these small farmers priority in the allocation of land becoming available if they require more land in order to give them the requisite standard of living.  As the Minister for Lands pointed out, this is very much in line with the priority system at present operated by the Land Commission in the allocation of land.</P>
    <P>However, this provision has a greater dimension so far as this country is concerned.  In operation, it will afford us a considerable measure of protection in the disposal and allocation of land.  This protection will help us greatly to continue to operate measures of structural reform for agricultural land designed to improve the viability of small farmers.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that we must take whatever measures we consider necessary to ensure that the sale of land is controlled here in the interests of land structural reform.  I should like to assure the House that the Government have under active examination the question of our adopting measures by way of legislation and otherwise which, while being compatible with the obligations we shall assume as members, will afford us the necessary protection for our own interests with regard to the disposal of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>The preoccupation to date in relation to the vital question of Ireland's <Col N="2449" /> membership of the EEC has been centred on specific economic and trading issues and their implications for us.  In the negotiations we were primarily concerned with obtaining terms of accession which would enable us to adjust gradually to the economic and trading conditions of membership and, at the same time, take advantage from the outset of the opportunities membership will offer.  The national debate on the question of membership which is now gaining momentum is centred on specific economic issues&mdash; employment, the cost of living, prospects for our farmers, and so on.  These are understandable preoccupations but because of them sufficient attention has not perhaps been paid to the nature of the Community we have applied to join.  Sufficient notice has not been taken of the aims and achievements of that Community.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper and in this debate the arguments in favour of alternatives have been well and truly demolished.  Throughout the discussion there has been the assumption that we should seek an alternative, that some alternative should be possible and that we want it.  The Government and others in favour of entry into Europe, in their anxiety to demonstrate to the public how unfounded are the arguments in favour of an alternative, may have appeared to accept the implication that if an alternative were available we would take it, and that it would be preferable to protect our trading and economic interests in another way.  This implication may have been accepted, but it is not the case.</P>
    <P>The Government are convinced, and I think we have shown this in a definite way, that outside membership of the enlarged Community&mdash;which includes Britain&mdash;we could not adequately protect our economic and trading interests, nor could we realise our potential for economic expansion. We believe that the EEC is a Community worth joining.  We believe that because of our history and traditions, because of our commitment to the democratic way of life, to peace in the world, because of our aspirations for the future of this country and the rest <Col N="2450" /> of the world, the EEC is a Community we should join, that our appropriate place is in full membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>It is important that in this national debate we should ask ourselves what the Community is all about.  The essence of the Community is to be found in its foundation and in the inspiration that motivated the founding fathers.  The EEC and its two sister Communities were born out of the devastation of the last world war.  The founders were determined that Europe would never again become the cockpit of the world.  They aspired to the ever closer union among the European peoples, of which the Preamble in the Treaty of Rome speaks.  This unity would make war in Europe impossible in the future.  But, with a unique blend of idealism and realism, the founders realised that this objective of unity could be achieved only by a series of practical concerted measures.</P>
    <P>Robert S. Schuman said: &ldquo;A united Europe will not be achieved all at once, not in a single framework.  It will be formed by concrete measures which first of all create a solidarity in fact.&rdquo; The present member states undertook in the creation of the three Communities to take these concrete measures.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Coal and Steel Community, which was the first, the member states set about pooling their coal and steel resources in a single market.  They saw the establishment of that Community in the context of safeguarding world peace by creative effort and in laying the foundation of a broader and deeper Community among people long divided by conflict. Euratom was established for the purpose of creating a major nuclear industry within the Community and in the awareness of nuclear energy as an essential resource for peaceful progress and in the desire for co-operation in its peaceful development.  In the establishment of the European Economic Community, the founder members set as their aim the creation of this ever-closer union among the European people.  The EEC was seen as laying the foundation for this union and the member states in this new Community set about ensuring the economic and social progress of their countries.  They <Col N="2451" /> accepted as an essential objective of their efforts the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of their people.  They committed themselves to reducing the differences existing between the various regions in the Community and reducing the backwardness of the less favoured regions.</P>
    <P>The achievement of balanced trade and fair competition within the Community and the progressive abolition of restrictions in world trade were two tasks also of the member states.  They also recognised their obligations jointly to help in the economic and social progress of the developing countries.  The member states of the Community sought by thus pooling their resources in concerted, practical effort to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty. They did not seek a compromise between their respective interests.  In an unprecedented way, they took a common view of their common interests and together sought ways of achieving the objectives which they recognised as being valid for all.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the origins of the Community, the motivations for its establishment and the immediate goals and ultimate objectives which the founder members set themselves because I think it is important that we know about them and appreciate fully the nature of this Community which, subject to the approval of the people on 10th May, we shall be joining.  I would like to ask: surely the ideals I have mentioned, the objectives set, the tasks they have undertaken are ones that we in Ireland fully sympathise with and can support?  The Government are convinced that they are.  We are certain that they find a ready response in the Irish people and if we sympathise with and support these ideals, these goals, these tasks of the Community, surely we will want to participate in them fully?  We should be all the more anxious to participate when we look at the achievements of the Community in the 13 years of its existence and the objectives and tasks now being set for themselves by the Communities for the years ahead, objectives for the creation of a wider and stronger Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2452" /> It is remarkable that those people who oppose Ireland's entry to the EEC always ignore the experience of the Community to date and the evidence of Community policies and actions as they affect each member state.  Perhaps it is no wonder, for the operation of the Community and its very considerable achievements are a clear manifestation of the will and purpose of the member states in achieving the goals and fulfilling the tasks they undertook together when the Community was established.  These achievements I speak of are not something theoretical, something remote.  They permeate and colour in a very real way, a real tangible and beneficial way, the lives of all the people in the member states. There are certain things which young people growing up today take for granted which the founders of the European Communities knew they had to ensure.  There is freedom which exists within the boundaries of the Community for the Community is composed of like-minded, democratic countries. This freedom was hard won out of the near anarchy and despotism and the threat of despotism in the earlier decades of this century in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Community is also characterised by peace and the pursuit of peace.</P>
    <P>It was created, as I have said, out of the horrors of war, a war in which we did not participate, but who can guarantee that we will be far removed from further wars that might start?  It was created out of a war because of the determination of its founding fathers that they would construct a new Europe in which war would be impossible.  The construction of a Europe, this new Europe in which war would be impossible, has yet to be completed, but what has been achieved so far by the Community is the framework of a broader and deeper community between countries which have long been opposed to each other in conflict, and this, the true basis of lasting peace in Europe is being made by the creation and enlargement of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>Another of the major achievements of the Community is its prosperity, the economic and social progress of the member countries and the improvement <Col N="2453" /> in the living and working conditions of their people which was envisaged by the Treaty of Rome.  And it must be remembered that the prosperity which has been achieved has been achieved by the concerted efforts of the member states working in the common interest and realising their own national objectives for their economic development and the welfare of their people.  Freedom, peace and prosperity&mdash;these benefits characterise the Community which has been created. They are real, tangible benefits affecting and shaping the lives of the people of the member states and the societies in which they live.  As I have said, people born since the last war have grown to accept these things as normal and those of us in positions to give leadership should think in the same terms as those who founded the European Communities; that what the young people expect as normal may now be guaranteed.</P>

      <P>If I could say one further word about the Community&mdash; we have all been thinking of the price of butter&mdash;I have tried to go back to matters which motivated the founding fathers and for which we now have responsibility to make sure that it continues.  There is one other aspect of the Community and its prosperity, <Col N="2454" /> that is, its obligations and responsibilities to the rest of the world.  The next meeting of heads of state will deal with the relations between the Community and the other developed countries, with the development of <i>détente</i> and the easing of tensions in Europe, the development of relations with the eastern part of Europe and in particular, and of interest to this country, especially, I know, its relations towards the Third World and the increasingly generous contribution which the European Community must make as its own prosperity grows.</P>
      <P>These are the things that are emerging as a blueprint for the Europe we want to join.  As I say, they are already preparing, with the full participation of the applicants, for a meeting of the heads of state and Government which will take place in October and which will decide that this Community, which is democratic, human, prosperous, committed to peace between countries and within them, is also committed to helping the developing world.  This is a Community which I think we should join, a Community for which the Government feel the people of Ireland should get the leadership to join.  The ideals of the Community are our ideals and I would like to finish by saying what I said at the beginning, that the vote on 10th May will be the last chance to go in on the conditions negotiated now, and if I might say so, they were very good conditions.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Television Programme Statement.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> At Question Time yesterday, Deputy O'Donnell, spokesman for the Fine Gael Party on Transport and Power, put down a question to the Minister for Transport and Power asking the Minister whether he has now investigated the statements made recently by a director of Bord Fáilte on the BBC programme &ldquo;24 Hours&rdquo;, and, if so, if he will state his findings and what action he proposes to take in the matter.  Because of the unsatisfactory nature of the Minister's reply, I considered it my bounden duty to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Before going into the matter, I should like to say that I do so with the full approval and consent of the spokesman for Transport and Power, Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
      <P>I should also like to explain to the House that my reason for intervening in Deputy O'Donnell's question by way of supplementary question was because on Tuesday night last I watched the television programme, &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo;, which dealt with the previous &ldquo;24 Hours&rdquo; programme on which a director of Bord Fáilte, Mr. Evans, appeared and dealt with the tourist difficulties in this country.</P>
      <P>I had not known that Deputy O'Donnell had put down the question and, were it not for the fact that I saw this &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme on Tuesday night, I would not have put any supplementary question.  I want to say to you now and to the House that I was absolutely horrified at the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme which was a reproduction of the &ldquo;24 Hours&rdquo; programme on the BBC.  I was so incensed that, when I heard Deputy O'Donnell raising the matter here, I availed of the opportunity to intervene. I say that to explain to you and to the House why I, who had not put down the question, have now raised this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>It is a well-known fact that the tourist industry here is second only to the agricultural industry.  In fact, until the deplorable handling of the national situation by this Government, it was running neck and neck with the agricultural industry.  It is very proper that we should have a Bord Fáilte to deal with the tourist industry, to encourage foreigners to come here and spend their money here.  It is also very proper that we should have on that board people with considerable experience in the tourist industry, hoteliers who are held in the highest esteem and who do an excellent job.  Before I go further I want to say&mdash;it may be a reflection on myself or on my lack of finance&mdash;that I never heard of Mr. Evans until Tuesday night when I looked in at this &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme, but I have since learned a number of things about him: I have learned that he is a first-class hotelier and that the way in which he runs his hotel in Glenbeigh is a credit to the nation.  I want to go on record as saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only proper that a man like him should be a member of Bord Fáilte, but it is also very important that men like him should behave in a responsible way and in the interests of the tourist industry.  I am sure that the amount of money paid to Mr. Evans as a director of Bord Fáilte is a mere pittance to him.  I am sure that he is not on Bord Fáilte for the fee that he is paid, but he is paid a <Col N="2459" /> fee and he does get travelling expenses. It is, therefore, in the interests of this country that he behaves in a responsible manner.  That is particularly so at this time when, as the Minister for Transport and Power will say, because of the activities in Northern Ireland, we are going through a difficult period. Because of a lack of leadership, and because we have no Government in this country, we are going through an exceptionally difficult period as far as the tourist industry is concerned. Because of absurd actions, like the burning of the British Embassy, we are in a particularly difficult situation. It is then all the more important in our interests that our State-appointed, publicly paid members of Bord Fáilte, directors of that body, should behave in a responsible way.</P>
    <P>I want to say, as the Minister said yesterday, that there is no antagonism towards the British public in this country and, when I say no antagonism, I mean that there is in every country a lunatic fringe and there is a lunatic fringe in this country.  By and large, however, responsible people have nothing against the British public or foreign tourists.  They appreciate the injection they give to the economy. That is a fact.  My own constituency of Cavan is a Border constituency but there is no worthwhile objection in that constituency to the British public coming here.  I believe they are welcome. As far as I am concerned, they are very welcome and I am glad that those were the sentiments of the Minister yesterday in his attempt to cover up for this well-intentioned but completely irresponsible member of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I make the Minister a present of the fact that, while this man is a director of Bord Fáilte and was introduced as a director of Bord Fáilte, he said he was speaking as a private hotelier. When he was asked did he think this was not a year for English people to come to Ireland he answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I concede this was a 17-second interlude in a ten minute programme but, if he did not say that people should not come to Ireland in 1972, he would not have been reported as saying it.  I <Col N="2460" /> want the Minister for Transport and Power now to dissociate himself completely from what Mr. Evans said on that television programme.  I want to go a little further.  He did not go on television alone and unaided.  He went on television ably supported by a gentleman called Mr. Eamon Kane, or O'Kane&mdash;I will call him Kane&mdash;the marketing director for Bord Fáilte. Mr. Kane chipped in to say that, in his opinion, Mr. Evans had performed a work of national importance.  He supported him.  He is a paid official of Bord Fáilte.  He is a paid official of Mr. Evans.  This adds insult to injury. One could complain and say that the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme should not have been shown.  But it was factual. It was factual to the extent that it showed a recording of the &ldquo;24 Hours&rdquo; programme.  In my opinion, it was adding insult to injury to have this first-class hotelier coming on the air and really emphasising what he had said, that he thought it was his duty to warn certain British people with young families that they should not come here, that they might get involved in rows or that their children might get involved in rows; he did not use the expression &ldquo;skinheads&rdquo; or &ldquo;Teddy Boys&rdquo;, but that could be read into what he said.  If this man thought that he had a duty in respect of his own hotel to issue this warning, then he should have done it privately through the post and not after being introduced on television as a director of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I would have expected the Minister for Transport and Power to come into this House and to dissociate himself utterly and completely from the programme, from Mr. Evan's irresponsible pronouncements and from the statement of Mr. Kane aiding and abetting him.  I was shocked when I heard the Minister for Transport and Power standing over him, saying that this was only 17 seconds out of a ten minute programme, justifying him, blaming the &ldquo;24 Hours&rdquo; programme and excusing Mr. Evans.</P>
    <P>I looked around for some reason and now I will be political because I am entitled to be political.  I never heard of this man, and the House has my <Col N="2461" /> word of honour that I never heard of this man until last Tuesday night, but I now find that he is one of the staunchest supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party in the County of Kerry.  I find that the Fianna Fáil Cumann in Glenbeigh got first prize in the Fianna Fáil competition for the best cumann in the national collection.  It headed the poll&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;because of the handsome contribution of Mr. Evans in return for his appointment to Bord Fáilte.  That is why the Minister stands over him.</P>
      <P>It is high time this sort of thing was put out of public life.  It is high time we had a bit of common decency in public life in this country.  I do not expect anybody to be absolutely devoid of politics, I know that everybody has politics, but I do not believe that a Minister for Transport and Power in this sovereign Parliament should stand over a man whom he has appointed for political reasons if he damages the economy of this country, as Mr. Evans has done.  I do not believe that a servant of this country who is paid by the taxpayers should be paid to go in and support him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tom O'Donnell has letters here from abroad which he will read because I propose to give him five minutes of the time.  He will prove that decent travel agents in England have been absolutely horrified by the pronouncements of Mr. Evans.  I am not indulging in any witch hunt, I never heard of the man, but I am asking the Minister for Transport and Power to remove him from this board, to dissociate himself from the statement this man has made and to publicise to the world at large that we are not a community of people who are out against foreigners.  That has always been the Fianna Fáil line.  Get away from it, for God's sake.  Every ship was at the bottom of the sea.  You preached that long enough.  That was before the Minister's time but they are now going into Europe.  They have voted here with us to go into Europe.  Go into it and tell the Europeans and tell the <Col N="2462" /> English people and tell the Americans and tell the world that they are welcome here and that we are glad to have their company and that we will put their money to good use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House very long because I have already made my views known both here and on the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme regarding this whole question. I have given a lot of consideration to this in the last two days.  I have had telephone calls and letters from people regarding the impact of Mr. Evans's statement on the &ldquo;24 Hours&rdquo; programme on the British tourist market in so far as Ireland is concerned.  I believe Mr. Evans has made a major blunder particularly in view of the highly critical and very delicate situation that obtains at present in Britain and in view of the almost impossible task which our people selling Irish holidays in Britain have to encounter at present.</P>
      <P>I have been to Britain on numerous occasions on tourist promotion trips.  I have been, over the last two or three months, in almost daily contact with the travel trade over there, with some of Mr. Evans's Bord Fáilte staff there. I know the difficulties they have to encounter.  There is no doubt that Mr. Evans's statement on this programme, which I understand has a viewing audience of several millions, served to sow the seeds of further doubt in the minds of those British families who were still contemplating coming to Ireland.  We have not lost out entirely on the British market but Mr. Evans's statement must have had, and I have evidence from Britain that it had, a very bad effect.  This confirmed the suspicions they had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister realise the reception that meets a British tour operator or our own Bord Fáilte staff or the staffs of the regional tourism companies, who have been in Britain for the past couple of months, when they go into a travel agent?  If the reception is not hostile it is one of suspicion, it is one of fear and it is one of: &ldquo;We do not want to hear about Ireland.&rdquo;  This is what our people in the field in Britain have been fighting against. Here is Mr. Ernie Evans, a leading <Col N="2463" /> personality in the Irish tourist industry, a man who is well known to the British travel trade, going on the &ldquo;24 Hours&rdquo; programme and making implications&mdash; whether intentionally or otherwise is beside the point, I am concerned with the end product.  He has confirmed the suspicions in the minds of the people.</P>
    <P>I am not vindictive.  I have never indulged in personalities in this House but I believe the directors of State bodies should be accountable to the people of this country through this House.  I have consistently held this.  I believe that Mr. Evans has made a major blunder which has been seriously embarrassing to his own Bord Fáilte staff and that, having made that blunder, he must be prepared to suffer the consequences.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister also realise that, due to misrepresentation on the British news media over recent months regarding the position in Ireland, it is very difficult to sell Ireland over there.  A hotelier said in a letter to me today:</P>
    <P>Seeing and hearing the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme last night we feel that we must confirm your view re the Bord Fáilte official who made absurd statements on English television. We have received cancellations from English people who have been here many times on holidays&mdash; one party over the past 20 years, another for the past six years.  They have not directly stated their reasons but there is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Evans's remarks were certainly no help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat what I said here on the debate yesterday morning on the Supplementary Estimate for Bord Fáilte which is that, as far as Ireland and Britain are concerned, <Col N="2464" /> the bonds that unite us are far more important than what divides us and that there has been a close communication between our peoples over many centuries and there is a basic racial association as well.  The welcome the British people have always got in Ireland will be extended to them a hundred and a thousand fold in the coming year.  This applies not just to Irish people in Britain but to all people there.  I want to re-emphasise this point because we live here in peaceful Ireland where we have built institutions that guarantee stability and freedom, where peace obtains and where we have an attitude to life that is most conducive to enjoyment by anybody who comes to our island for his holiday and pleasure and that Ireland and our people&mdash;we can say this with justification&mdash;have a particular attitude towards hospitality and welcome that, in my view, is unique in the world.  Nobody knows this more than British people because of their association with us and their knowledge of us as a people.  It is our attitude and the basic hospitality of our people that is the biggest factor in our favour in regard to our tourism business, and the difficulties and the problems that have beset this island in recent months count very little against this basic regard in which Irish people are held by people at all levels of life in Britain.  For that reason, I want to reiterate the welcome that is here, the total céad míle fáilte, on the part of all Irish people to visitors from Britain.</P>
      <P>I want to say straight away in regard to the particular matter here that all of us in the House, of all political parties, and the gentlemen here representing the media, know how on television or radio or in the course of an interview one can be taken out of context.  This was a ten minute interview given by Mr. Ernie Evans in his hotel in Glenbeigh to gentlemen of BBC television.  There were 17 seconds excerpted out of that interview and projected on the screen and let me say here and now&mdash;and I have had him in with me for interview and discussion on it and I was quite tough about it with him&mdash;as projected, that 17 second interview did not do our tourism industry any good.</P>

      <P>That is agreed. But, having said that, I want to emphasise the further fact that I am certainly not going to embark on any witch-hunt in regard to any person who works hard, gives his time and his energy to any State-sponsored organisation because he has just been, as it were, to use the phrase, caught out in a particular situation by media interviewers. Let us reduce it to its proper context.  This is what happened on this occasion.  Whereas people like ourselves in this House are reasonably skilled at not being caught out and reasonably skilled in regard to our dealings with the media, there are many people, let us face it, who do an excellent job in our society, at every level of our society, in the trade union world, the business world, the farming world, in tourism&mdash;any walk of life one takes&mdash;who are not skilled and do not have any particular training in dealing with this interview type of situation.</P>

      <P>I grant the Deputy his point in that respect.  I am quite clear in my mind, having fully investigated the matter, that this was a situation where an interview was slanted, taken out of context.  The remarks made, as slanted and as taken out of context, did not do any good.  But I am further satisfied that the gentleman concerned is fully equipped to play a very honourable part as a director of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise that he was a man appointed by the Government on the basis that he had a real contribution <Col N="2466" /> to make and has done so in terms of hard work and input into his position as director of Bord Fáilte.  I am more than satisfied that he has stretched himself to the utmost in this respect.  I deplore some of the remarks made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  What his political affiliations are, I do not know. I deplore the remarks made by Deputy Fitzpatrick in that context.</P>

      <P>I would have better regard for what Deputy O'Donnell had to say about him and Deputy O'Donnell knows well, as I do, that this man and his hotel represent the very best in catering for the public and for visitors here.  Certainly, in regard to his appointment to Bord Fáilte, the question of his political affiliation never arose as far as I was concerned. I was totally concerned with getting on the board at the time people who had complete knowledge of tourism and in that respect he has been a notable addition to the board.  I certainly am not going to accord to the view expressed by Deputy Fitzpatrick that a mistaken attitude towards a television interview is sufficient in itself to knock a person and to boot him out. That is not my view of how things should be done.  The more proper view is to look at the overall record and contribution by any man in any such position.</P>

The contract price works out at £3,359 per house, which includes central heating and an element of work in respect of future development. The contract completion period is 68 weeks.</P>
      <P>The contract prices per house for the last two schemes in Meath County for which loans and tenders have been approved by me, a 20 house scheme at Athboy and a 12 house scheme at Drumconrath, were £2,867 and £2,800 respectively.  The price for Athboy excludes the cost of private site development which was part of the contract. The Athboy tender is dated 20th October, 1970, and the Drumconrath tender 27th January, 1971.  The tender for the Athboy scheme was sanctioned on 30th June, 1971, and the Drumconrath tender on 3rd September, 1971.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that the provision of a septic tank could affect public health and amenity for people living nearby or using an adjacent road.</P>
