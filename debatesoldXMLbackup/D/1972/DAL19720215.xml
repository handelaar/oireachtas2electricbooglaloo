    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> The cost of printing, compiling and circulating the booklet is estimated at £1,360.  It includes all revelant statements made by me between the 13th August, 1969, and the 20th October, 1971, except where, as indicated in the preface, there has been editing so as to reduce unnecessary repetition.  The question of publishing speeches and statements of other members of the Government, ex-members of the Government and members of the Dáil&mdash; either from the Government Party or the Opposition parties&mdash;has not arisen in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach states that all relevant statements made by him are published, will he not admit that some things are left out, that correct reports are not made even of his own statements?  I would ask why the Taoiseach left out that beautiful word &ldquo;idly&rdquo;, that signifies so much as far as he and the Government are concerned, from the phrase &ldquo;standing idly by&rdquo;?  Was that left out deliberately?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied specifically to a question from the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Cluskey, on that point, and I said on that occasion that we were not prepared to differentiate between those interned because, as far as we knew then, they were all Irish citizens.</P>

We pay social welfare benefits only to our own residents in this <Col N="1686" /> part of the country.  Could he explain what he means by saying he is not prepared to discriminate in this matter?

      <P>The work at present being done does not constitute the making of blueprints or definite plans for a united Ireland. Its function is to identify the various problems or questions which would arise, and to explore the possible solution to these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Departments involved are my own Department, the <Col N="1688" /> Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The inter-departmental unit have supplied information on the situation in the North of Ireland to many of those who have sought it, including foreigners and, indeed, many people within the North of Ireland.  I think it would be possible for certain information to be made available by this unit to the inter-party committee when it is set up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of a boycott on British foodstuffs currently being maintained in the Republic and, in the light of the warning given by Córas Tráchtála to the effect that any such boycott could seriously damage our trading relations with Britain, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the reported intimidation of shopkeepers with a view to a boycott of British goods will have an effect on jobs in this country; and, if so, what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen Press reports of intimidation and boycotting, but nothing to suggest that there have been any such activities on an extensive scale.  I believe it would be a mistake to attach too much importance to a campaign which would appear to be the work of a tiny handful of anonymous irresponsibles. These people are certainly not motivated by patriotism, since, as has been pointed out by a number of people, the only effect of their campaign would be to endanger the jobs of Irish workers in our export industries. About two-thirds of all Irish exports go to Britain and the North. Less than 5 per cent of British exports come to Ireland.  Therefore any halt to trade between the two countries would mean a major disruption of our economy and a comparatively minor discomfort to the British.  Those who are motivated by patriotism in matters of this kind should adopt, not the negative attitude of boycott, but the positive policy of &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; which has long been encouraged by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government's view on this matter, and the view of the House, been made absolutely clear that buying Irish is one thing but, as the Taoiseach said, the negative approach of boycotting British goods can involve nothing but danger for our exports to Britain and for the jobs of Irish people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1690" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been made absolutely clear.  At least three of my colleagues have already spoken publicly on the matter.  As I said already, those who have been making these threats are irresponsible people and not just irresponsible but the enemies of the Irish people, of Irish workers and of Irish shop assistants, and even of the cause they might seem to put forward as being their goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that he has seen Press reports, but surely he has had reports from the Garda authorities.  Is he aware that there is intimidation of shopkeepers and Protestants, and has been for the past year, and very little has been done about it?  Is the Taoiseach serious when he tells us that they are only a tiny handful of irresponsibles?  Surely the Taoiseach is aware that some of the major organisations which could have 15,000 people marching in this city recently are responsible for this?  What does the Taoiseach intend to do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>According to newspaper reports the organisations which the Deputy probably has in mind have repudiated this activity and have denied any responsibility for it.  I accept that. I hope it is right.  So far as the intimidation of people over the past year is concerned, all these allegations have been investigated.  In most cases it has been done by way of anonymous phone calls.  In some cases it has been identified as being the work of cranks who have some local or personal grievance against the individual concerned or his property.  I would not like the Deputy to give the impression that this is widespread and that there is something sinister or subversive in these alleged acts of intimidation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the burden which would fall on the rates if the demand of the health boards on local authorities were to be met in full, he is yet in a position to state the levels of health grant to be provided from the vote for his Department in the coming financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be in a position to say that a very substantial amount of special supplementary grant will be made available to health boards both in respect of the year 1971-72 and 1972-73.</P>
      <P>The information supplied to my Department by the health boards indicates that in the current year the increase in the cost of the services, mainly in respect of staff costs and consumer goods, is such as to involve a rate increase of 16p in the £ on average if the normal levels of subventions from central funds are to apply.</P>
      <P>In respect of the year 1972-73 the estimates based on information supplied by health boards indicate that the increase over the latest figures for 1971-72 would, in the absence of special relief by way of increased grant from the Vote for my Department, involve an average rate increase of 48p in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the amounts involved, the total which without special subvention would have to be raised by the rating authorities in the coming financial year would be £40.35 million, consisting of £2.53 million in respect of the increase in health costs during the year ending <Col N="1696" /> 31st March next, and £37.82 million in respect of the year commencing 1st April.  The special additional grant will, however, absorb the full £2.53 million in respect of the current year and will reduce the burden on the rates by £2.81 million in respect of the coming year.  The total additional grants will thus amount to £5.34 million.</P>
    <P>The figure of £2.53 million will form part of a Supplementary Estimate of £7.39 million for the year 1971-72 to be presented to Dáil Éireann.  Apart from the £2.53 million this sum comprises almost exclusively the statutory element of grant to health boards and a further subvention to the Hospitals Trust Fund.  The latter item is £1.5 million and arises from the increase in the revenue deficits of the voluntary hospitals which, in turn, is largely attributable to the growing difference between hospital costs and the rates of payment by health boards for treatment of Health Act patients.</P>
    <P>In the absence of this special assistance from central Government funds, the average increase in the health rate would, as I have indicated, have been 64p in the £ as between the years 1971-72 and 1972-73.  Special grant is, however, calculated to limit the increase to 30p in any area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not appreciate that even at that the increase in the health grant of 30p, together with the other increases which have to be borne by local authorities, will mean a tremendous increase in the rate for the coming year?  Is he not prepared to increase it more than the amount which he has announced here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many other calls on the Exchequer for education, social welfare and other essential services. I think I have been able to persuade the Government to make a reasonable increase in this regard.  The House will be interested to know that I will be circulating to Deputies a complete statement of exactly how the increase arises, the amount required purely for increases in remuneration and the increased costs of drugs resulting from inflation and so forth and from normal increases of salaries plus <Col N="1697" /> the inflationary element, the amount required for the increase in the user of services and the amount required for brand new services.  In respect of each of these items the extra number of pence per pound required to be raised by the local authorities will be indicated, so the House will have a full concept before the debate on the Health Estimate begins as to how these figures are made up.</P>

      <P>In view of erroneous statements freely circulated about the increases in administrative staff employed by the eight health boards, it should be clearly stated that the total net extra cost of administrative staffs for the boards as compared with the corresponding staff cost before the establishment of the boards will amount to £200,000 approximately and after making allowance for grants from the Exchequer this represents an average increase of ½p in the £ in respect of the share born by the rating authorities.</P>

      <P>The person in question was initially disqualified for unemployment benefit by a deciding officer for a period of six weeks from 4th September, 1971, on the ground that the claimant had voluntarily left his employment on that date without just cause.  On the termination of the period <Col N="1701" /> of disqualification, the person's claim to unemployment benefit was admitted as from 18th October, 1971.</P>
      <P>The claimant appealed against the decision of the deciding officer and attended and gave evidence at the appeal hearing on 22nd November, 1971.  The appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer.  The appeals officer also decided that the statutory condition for receipt of unemployment benefit, which requires that a claimant be available for employment, was not satisfied as from 18th November, 1971, and payment of unemployment benefit was accordingly stopped as from that date.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are, however, being made to ascertain whether any change has occurred in the claimant's case since the appeals officer's decision on the question of availability for work and the position will be reviewed by an appeals officer in the light of any further information obtained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim to unemployment benefit from 25th October, 1971, by the person in question was disallowed by a deciding officer on the ground that the claimant did not satisfy the statutory condition for receipt of unemployment benefit which requires that not fewer than 26 employment contributions reckonable for the purposes of entitlement to unemployment benefit have been paid or credited in the contribution year or years governing the claim, in this case the 1969-70 and 1970-71 contribution years.  The contributions paid in respect of the claimant subsequent to December, 1969, were at rates applicable to a female outworker not employed under <Col N="1703" /> a contract of service and were not reckonable for the purposes of the statutory contribution condition I have mentioned.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that reply was to the Deputy.  With the permission <Col N="1704" /> of the Ceann Comhairle I will repeat it:</P>
      <P>To qualify for a deserted wife's allowance a woman must naturally be a wife, and arising out of a decision in the case of women who have been divorced in England, the deciding officer took into account legal advice to the effect that under our law the divorce in England of a person domiciled in England is effective to dissolve the marriage and the dissolution is recognised as being effective in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>So we do recognise divorce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue with the earlier reply:</P>
      <P>The applications for a deserted wife's allowance for a number of women so divorced have been rejected. A number of them have, however, appealed the decision.  Their appeals have not yet been determined by the appeals officer.  Pending this decision I would not like to make any final statement in the matter. I should like to mention, however, that the scheme for deserted wives' allowances, which is now a little over a year in operation, is being reviewed with a view to making such improvements in it as experience has shown to be desirable. In this review consideration will be given to the position of women divorced in the circumstances mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The appeals officer in this case must have regard to the legal advice available to him. This has arisen in another way before our deserted wives' legislation was introduced.  In the past, in connection with widows' pensions, when her divorced husband died a wife divorced in England applied for a widow's pension here and was refused on the <Col N="1705" /> grounds that she was not married before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of 50p a day referred to in the question does not apply solely to farmers claiming unemployment benefit but is, in fact, generally applicable under the relevant statutory regulations as a method of determining claims by persons whose involvement in more than one occupation is such as to raise doubts as to their availability for and dependence on ordinary wage-earning employment. Moreover, remuneration or profit in excess of 50p a day from a subsidiary occupation is not necessarily a bar to receipt of unemployment benefit. Under the regulations there is an alternative method of identifying those claimants who can be regarded as genuinely available for wage-earning employment in a primary occupation. This alternative provides that the limit of 50p a day on remuneration or profit from a subsidiary occupation does not apply where the claimant has had at least 78 employment contributions paid in respect of him during a recent three-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the regulations, taken as a whole, ensure that the unemployment benefit scheme, in accordance with its basic principles, gives protection to persons who are genuine wage-earners and who on becoming unemployed are available for suitable <Col N="1707" /> full-time wage-earning employment that offers and I do not propose to alter the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputies have in mind restriction of the currency facilities available to persons spending holidays abroad.  The position in this respect is that under our obligations to the International Monetary Fund and OECD we are required to make reasonable currency facilities available for foreign travel.  These arrangements are made on a reciprocal basis.  Any attempt on our part to derogate from them would bring the risk of retaliatory action by other countries which would have the effect of restricting the flow of tourists to Ireland.</P>
      <P>I may mention that in 1970, the most recent year for which figures are available, the total expenditure abroad was £42 million of which as much as £34 million was spent in Britain and Northern Ireland so that only £8 million was spent in other countries. On the other hand, our earnings from tourism that year amounted to £99 million of which £63.5 million came from Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the case of Britain and Northern Ireland, it would be impracticable to restrict the availability of currency facilities for travel as there is free movement of funds between the two countries.  We derive considerable benefits from this.</P>

While such milk here has an average fat content in excess of 3.5 per cent, that level may not always be reached during certain months of the year and there could be some problems at present in arranging for the addition of extra fat.  We accordingly secured a derogation from the relevant requirement for a period of five years from the date of accession.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, there is a motion in my name on the Order Paper for Private Members' Time dealing with unemployment. I am informed that you have ruled that this motion cannot be taken in view of the fact, as indicated to me in any case, that we had a debate on the economy last month.  I should like to make a few respectful submissions to you.  First, the motion that was down in the Taoiseach's name in January was one asking the Dáil to approve of the Government's handling of the economy.  I submit that that was a vague sort of motion.  It was a motion in very general terms.  The motion that is down in my name, and one I should like to have discussed tonight, is a motion dealing specifically with unemployment, a motion in which I call for certain action to be taken by the Government.  As far as &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to have a long argument at all.  I just want to make a short submission.  Standing Order No. 46 is, I think, the one under which you, Sir, have ruled and that Standing Order says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> No member shall re-open a discussion on a question already decided the preceding six months...</P>
    <P>I respect Standing Orders certainly, but I have two submissions to make. The first is that the motion down in my name is quite specific.  It relates to growing unemployment and it is, I think, due to the House for either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance to say whether, in fact, the £20 million promised to be spent in October last has, in fact, been spent, what the effect is on unemployment and what has happened to the £50 million the Minister for Finance &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not giving me any opportunity of commenting on anything.  The Deputy is correct in stating that under Standing Order No. 46 no member shall reopen <Col N="1722" /> a question that has been debated in this House during the preceding six months. On the 19th and 20th of January last the House debated and carried the motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the Government's handling of the economic situation.</P>
      <P>Now the debate on that motion dealt mainly with unemployment and redundancy. It was the same subject as the Deputy wishes to raise now and, in view of that discussion, the Chair has no alternative except to rule the Deputy's motion out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If the handling of the economy means we have so many hundreds of thousands working in another country I do not see the similarity in the motion moved by the Taoiseach in January in this House and the one I want to move here tonight.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Prices (Amendment) Bill is couched in such terms that it could itself readily permit of a debate on unemployment. Before the debate was adjourned I had been dealing with the Bill in so far as it brings the price of new houses within the scope of price control. I regretted that it is confined to new houses.  I believe it should be extended to include old houses also in price control.  In my opinion one of the most important factors of inflation in our economy is the price of houses. If prices for new or old houses are excessively high and inflationary in themselves they will produce a vast number of other pressures within the economy.  By and large, the person buying a house has to borrow money to make the purchase and the borrowing has to be repaid in annual instalments. If these instalments are high because the purchase price is high, there will be inflationary pressure in that the borrower will see if he can improve his income to relieve the burden of his house repayments.  This is so common that it must be a very potent factor in the inflationary spiral we have been experiencing.</P>
      <P>This is equally relevant to the cost of old houses.  There is a remarkable lack of logic in a Bill which seeks to control the price of new houses and leaves old houses alone.  Whether it is hoped that if new houses are controlled the price of old houses will be kept in check in consequence, I do not know and the Minister does not say so, but it would not necessarily follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that to control the price of houses presents much practical difficulty. The matter would be probably passed to the Department of Local Government to deal with rather than be dealt with by Industry and Commerce. There is power in the Bill for <Col N="1727" /> the Government, by order, to transfer to any Minister of State any particular subject and I presume the cost of new houses is a matter that would be transferred to the Department of Local Government.  It is disappointing that the Minister gave no indication in his speech and we have had no indication from the Minister or from the Minister for Local Government or from the Government as to how this very important price factor will be tackled. It seems to me that the only way in which it can be tackled is by controlling the supply of money available for house purchase.</P>
    <P>At present building societies, banks and insurance companies are making very large sums available to house purchasers. These sums are related to the wage or salary of the potential borrower. It may be argued that because they are so related they cannot be excessive and that no building society or insurance company will allow a man to borrow more than his salary will appear to enable him to repay.  This is the theory but in practice we have houses in the £10,000 to £25,000 price bracket being purchased frequently in this city and county and to a lesser extent in other parts of the country.  It amazes me that there is a sufficient number of persons in the country with incomes of the size that would justify the borrowing that has to be made.  I also wonder if the houses themselves are good value for that sort of money.</P>
    <P>Some drastic changes will have to come about in regard to the availability of money for house purchase if it is desired to control the price of new houses.  If the source of supply of money is controlled and a limit is set to the amount a bank or building society or insurance company may lend that will limit the market potential without decreasing the demand.  If, in conjunction with that, there is a strict examination of building costs the two factors should combine to bring down building costs.  At present, as far as I know, there is no control whatever over building costs.  The only move in that direction is the commission which is at present investigating the price of building land and, as far as I know, <Col N="1728" /> the builders themselves have not been subjected to any scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I think there should be a system whereby either this Department or the Department of Local Government take power to investigate and scrutinise builders' costs at random so that the building industry may at any time and without notice expect a detailed examination of its costings.  I mean a really detailed examination so that it will not suffice for an inspecting authority to be told that wages and materials cost £X and the land costs so much.  These things themselves must be sifted in detail and if a wages figure is given it should not be taken at face value but should be investigated and it must be ascertained who is actually receiving the wages.  That can be cross-checked through the PAYE office of the Revenue Commissioners.  In the case of building materials the check will have to go back as far as the suppliers.  If the examination is not as strict as that, a tricked-up balance sheet or account could pass scrutiny.</P>
    <P>This matter is too serious to permit of any superficial examination.  If we are ever to control the cost of houses we must get at the builder's operation. If rumour is true the profits available to those in the building industry are fantastic.  One may assume that there is some truth in the rumours because one sees signs of quick and very evident prosperity on the part of those engaged in that industry and it behoves the Government, as custodians of the common good, to ensure that no one section of the industry is so acting as to acquire for itself profits which are out of proportion, especially when that sector has such far-reaching effects on the general health of the economy.</P>
    <P>If these rigorous controls of building societies are introduced and at the same time the supply of money to potential borrowers or house purchasers is also controlled, so that a person will not just get the amount he asks and will have to satisfy the lending authority that the house is value for that money and if, in turn, the transaction will have to come under scrutiny by the Department, these things together might manage to bring some reason into the price of <Col N="1729" /> houses.  If that were done it might be sufficient to have the control applied to new houses and the cost of old houses might begin to come into line. If that did not happen, some form of control would have to be introduced with regard to old houses.  The amount of money available for their purchase would have to be controlled and if the price being asked was out of proportion to the original cost of the house, the borrower would have to be refused a loan.  The matter has become so serious and so detrimental in terms of contributing to our inflation that something drastic will have to be done.</P>
    <P>On the last day I mentioned the question of prices being paid for property and for land and how certain wealthy organisations appear to be willing and able to pay prices higher than the market price at the time.  A report in last Saturday's <i>Irish Independent</i> was a perfect example of what I had in mind.  This was that a firm, Irish Distillers Limited, had bought 65 acres of land beside a small town, Midleton, County Cork, for which they had paid £120,000.  Apparently land for building purposes in that area was already expensive at £1,200 per acre. Yet, this wealthy company paid almost twice the current market rate in the area.  What effect can this have on the economy of that area except to increase prices and increase again the inflationary spiral?  The real irony of the matter is that this particular company were, I am sure, in the vanguard of the demands for the reduction of corporation profits tax before Christmas last.  Corporation profits tax was reduced and it could well be taxpayers' money that is enabling people such as those to pay outrageous prices for land.  The reduction in corporation profits tax, while it was good in principle, should not have been available in a global way to every company.  The reduction should have been available only to companies that put to the Revenue Commissioners a definite scheme for spending whatever tax rebate they would receive.  It is counterproductive to give this reduction and see it being availed of, either in the distribution of increased profits or in inflationary purchasing of land.  The <Col N="1730" /> example I have quoted highlights the problem.  It is a problem that has not been given any attention by the Government. If this Bill is to mean anything and if the philosophy behind it is firmly to be put into practice, the sort of practice that I have quoted can no longer be tolerated.</P>
    <P>On the last day, too, I referred to the effect on the cost of living of the change-over to decimalisation.  Again, by coincidence, in last Sunday's <i>Independent</i>, there appeared an article by a journalist who has researched into the effects of decimalisation.  His conclusion, as reported in that article, is that the change-over has led to a startling increase in prices.  One particular organisation which that journalist quotes is the Irish Housewives' Association.  This is an association who are in high standing with the Department, because so far as I know, they will nominate to the advisory committees that are proposed to be set up under this Bill.  This is a responsible organisation and they estimate that the increase in the cost of living since decimalisation has been 29 per cent.  That is a huge increase to accrue merely from the change-over to decimalisation. It could have come about only because of lack of control.  Lack of control is unforgiveable in something that was anticipated for a long time.  It should have been anticipated also that there would be rounding up and rounding down and if there had been proper foresight, the rounding up to the extent of 29 per cent should not have been allowed happen.</P>

      <P>Another example given in the article I have mentioned was that a survey showed there had been an increase of 6p in the price of coffee during one week and that a <Col N="1731" /> brand of tea increased from 36p to 38p.  We have been so used to talking of pennies that we are inclined to forget that the pence referred to here are more than twice as valuable as the old penny and we have been blinded to some extent by the adverse effects of decimalisation.  The Department of Industry and Commerce, as the Department charged with operating price control and as the Department, together with the Department of Finance, who are in the front row in the fight against inflation, should have been very conscious of the difference between the decimal penny and the old penny.  They should have been in a position to have effective controls introduced so as to ensure that traders, when they were changing their prices, took into account the difference in the value of the penny.</P>
      <P>Another novel development in this Bill is the intention to control the costs of services, including professional services. As Deputy Fitzpatrick has pointed out already this will impinge on the legal profession.  I wish to make it clear that the legal profession have no objection whatever to their costs being controlled and supervised but what they ask is that control be exercised ultimately by the Oireachtas. They do not wish their remuneration to be in the hands of the Executive. Having regard to the weak Government we have experienced here during the past number of years, when we say &ldquo;in the hands of the executive&rdquo;, we mean, in effect, in the hands of the bureaucracy behind the Executive. Our reason for requesting that ultimate control of legal costs be vested in the Oireachtas and not in the Executive is based on the nature of our Constitution.  In this country we have the classic type of democratic constitution which has within itself the separation of powers.  These are the three powers of State which are the legislature, the Executive and the judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These powers, while they are separate, are interlocking.  Our Constitution follows general constitutional practice in this regard.  The reason for the separation of the powers <Col N="1732" /> is to ensure that no one power will ever become too strong in such a way as would diminish the freedom of the citizen.  The judicial power ensures that the legislature does not enact harsh or oppressive laws.  The legislature, in turn, is a check on the Executive in the sense that it should reject any movement by the Executive to introduce such laws.  It is well recognised that the most effective and most potent check on both the Executive and the legislature is the judicial power of the State.  The independence of the judicial power is enshrined in the Constitution in the sense that judges' salaries cannot be reduced by any Act of this House once the salary of a judge is fixed.  Consequently, the other powers of the State, the Executive and the Legislature, cannot exert financial pressure on a judge and a judge cannot be removed from office except by very drastic means&mdash;by the entire House voting by a vast majority for his removal.  The judicial arm of the State comprises more than the judges on the bench.  It comprises also those who operate the courts&mdash;the lawyers who practise in them and to that extent the legal profession must be considered as part of the judicial power of the State.  If the Government have a proper appreciation and concept of the doctrine of the separation of powers they will be careful not to introduce any legislation which might in any way impinge on the judicial power or might in any way lessen its independence.  There is no more potent way of getting at the judicial arm than to control the costs of part of the judicial arm, namely, to control the costs by action of the Executive.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise again that the legal profession do not reject and are not against their costs being controlled, supervised or decided on by whatever type of structure is set up. However, the legal profession want the ultimate decision on costs to rest with the Oireachtas, the Dáil and Seanad.  The legal profession want this to be done in order to give practical effect to the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>I know that commentators and other <Col N="1733" /> people are cynical when it comes to matters relating to legal costs.  The costs are attacked as being excessive, as being hidden and it is claimed that they have built-in inflationary tendencies. The legal profession are quite prepared to recognise that their costs may require review.  They would welcome such a review and would welcome a situation whereby their costs are determined by an independent body with fair representation of all interests.  However, if such a body should be so constituted as to come up with an unfair decision in regard to the legal profession, if it should come up with a decision that would allow the State from time to time or over a given period to determine what the costs of the legal profession should be, then the State would, in effect, be transgressing the doctrine of the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>All that we ask is that the ultimate control would rest with the Oireachtas so that if the legal profession, being part of the judicial arm of the State, considered they were being prejudiced in a way that could affect their independence <i>vis-à-vis</i> the State they come to this House and to the Seanad and make their case and rely on the constitutional feeling of these Houses to support them and ensure that they are not treated by the Executive in a way that could take from their independence. I want to emphasise that the legal profession do not ask for or require extra privileges in relation to rates of remuneration.  All that the legal profession ask is that the ultimate control of their remuneration should rest with the Oireachtas, not with the Executive.</P>
    <P>Because they do not come into contact with the law, people generally are not fully cognisant of the buffer position of the legal profession between the State and the citizen.  As a practising lawyer, I can assure the House that this situation arises quite regularly. The lawyer's task is to protect the citizen from excessive administration and it is a duty he has to discharge regularly.  One can visualise a situation where that duty might be difficult to discharge, or could be rendered impossible to discharge, if the <Col N="1734" /> remuneration of lawyers was controlled by the Executive.  If the Executive thought that this profession was a nuisance or was getting in the way of the administration by keeping the administration from infringing on the rights of the individuals one can imagine the situation where the Executive would tend to try to denigrate or diminish this interfering body.  This House, being one arm of a democratic constitution, should not allow this situation to arise.  Having regard to its function in the operation of the judicial arm of the State, the legal profession should be left in an independent position and should be left in a position where the ultimate control&mdash; which is financial&mdash;should be in the hands of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister makes the point that where charges are a percentage of the price obtained for property or of the value of the contract they have grown out of proportion having regard to the inflationary increases in the price of property.  I concede there is validity in that point. The solicitors' profession also concede this and are willing to have the system of charges revised in order to obviate this apparent abnormality.  However, this must not be considered in isolation. Like any other sector of the community, the solicitors' profession also suffers from the other side of the coin.  When I point out that the wages of general law clerks in the period 1964-71 have increased from 62½ per cent to as much as 130 per cent, the other side of the coin can be seen.  In that period the cost of living index showed an increase of 46.7 per cent but the wages of male law clerks increased from 62½ per cent to 130 per cent and for female clerks the increases have ranged from 52.3 per cent to 125 per cent.  I doubt if any other sector of the community has had to bear such vast wage increases.</P>
    <P>When it is pointed out that costs have increased because they are tied to increasing property values, equally it should be pointed out that wages have increased to an even higher proportion. Similarly, rents have increased tremendously and there is no need to remind the House of the enormous <Col N="1735" /> increase in postage charges.  This is a high element in the overheads of any solicitor's office.  Likewise, the many increases in the cost of court stamps have contributed to the overheads.  It can be argued that the cost of court stamps, court fees, Land Registry and Land Commission fees are recoverable ultimately but a significant proportion get lost in the general administration of a solicitor's office.  Therefore, in fairness to the legal profession it is necessary to point out all the extra costs they have had to bear.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is only proper to point out that it is in only one aspect of operations that there has been this built-in increase as a result of increasing property values.  Similar increases have not taken place in the vast area of litigation, and if an examination were to be made it would be seen that, having regard to the length of time since costs were fixed, there is a lessening of the charges available to solicitors.  But, as I say, it is not the wish of the solicitors' profession to be in a position where their costs are not subject to control or revision.  All that they ask is that the ultimate control be exercised here in this House and in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>How the Minister proposes generally to deal with professional or other services or to control them I do not know.  It puzzles me as to how charges can be regulated so as to take into account differing levels of expertise. Again to take a legal example: you go to an eminent senior counsel for an opinion; you choose him because of his education, training, intelligence and expertise in a particular field.  Because men are not born equal some professional persons will be able to offer a better service.  How to exercise control over the cost of such services while taking that factor into account is to me an insuperable problem.  The same must be true of other spheres, veterinary, medical, engineering; within these professions there are varying degrees of expertise and they will be rewarded according to the standard of the expertise offered.  No matter what check or control it is sought to apply, I do not see how it will take into account the <Col N="1736" /> different value a client is getting or is looking for.</P>
    <P>By and large, however, the Bill is welcome to me as an effort to introduce control and to get to grips with inflation.  Wages and prices are the two main factors contributing to inflation. If this Bill is an indication of an intention to get to grips with prices it is welcome, but I have my doubts as to whether it will be really effective or not.</P>
    <P>Another part of the Bill I do not greatly like is the power whereby the Government, by order, can put different matters to different Government Departments.  There is far too much legislation by order at the moment.  The growth of administrative law is not a very happy development, because administrative law, by its nature, is not subject to the same checks as legislation passed by this House.  There is something hidden about it; it is foreign to our tradition of common law whereby the courts are the ultimate arbiters as to the rights of the citizen.  Legislation by Government order gets over that difficulty&mdash;if &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; is the right word &mdash;but removes the executive from being answerable to the courts to quite a large extent.  Therefore, I never like to see Bills before this House which give potentially wide powers of legislation by order.  It means that laws can, in effect, be made, even though they may be called regulations, which are nevertheless binding on the citizen, without coming before this House and can be made in such a way that it might not be possible to bring them before the courts.</P>
    <P>The question of price control, if it is to be really effective, must bring into the arena of public discussion the general philosophy of State interference in the private sector.  This is where the Bill falls down, in that it indicates a necessity for control but it is not prepared to grasp the nettle that control means State interference in the life of the country.  There cannot be effective control until such time as the State is prepared to interfere in all aspects of the economy.  To make recommendations, to have advisory committees, to appeal to manufacturers or retailers or <Col N="1737" /> persons offering services to exercise restraint, is all very commendable, but our experience so far has shown that, unless the Government take teeth actually to interfere in the operations of private enterprise in cases where private enterprise has shown itself unwilling or unable to act responsibly, then there can be no real price control; and until there is real price control there cannot be a successful battle against inflation.  Until that nettle is grasped there will be mavericks whose only motive is private profit, going their own way without caring what damage they may do to the economy. The Government and this House have a duty to the people generally to ensure that no private operator so conducts his affairs as to do harm to the economy.</P>
    <P>I hope that when price control comes into operation it will be operated vigorously, on a wide scale, but at the same time individually so as to ensure that individual pressure points that I mentioned earlier, such as undue prices for land or houses, will not be allowed to continue.  It is distasteful in a democracy to have the State interfering to the point that it may be necessary to interfere, but it may be a measure of our immaturity as a democracy or our lack of responsibility as citizens that such a Bill is necessary.  One has always to weigh up the common good against the private good.  In such a situation, so long as the liberties of the individual are not infringed, the common good must take precedence.</P>
    <P>If this Bill adopts that philosophy I welcome it.  If it is only going to a form of well-meaning appeal or supervision without teeth it is still welcome but I must say it is useless.  It will be interesting to see it in operation in the areas I mentioned, of housing, the price of land and of professional services and personal services of one kind or another.  As I say, its implementation in those areas will cause considerable difficulty.  It is a pity the Minister in his speech has not given some indication of how he proposes to operate in those areas, or is the position, as I suspect, that the power to operate in these areas is taken in the hope that the public recognition of this power might ensure <Col N="1738" /> some control?  If that is the thinking behind the lack of fact in the Minister's speech, then I believe it is mistaken thinking.  It behoves the Minister to indicate to us quite clearly how he proposes to exercise control over these new areas now being brought into the ambit of price control.</P>
    <P>It may be that various parts of the Bill will be hived off to other Departments and that it will be for individual Departments to make up their minds on how they will operate it.  That would be a bad development.  We should be told in the debate on the Second Stage of the substantive Bill how the controls will be applied.  If the powers under the Bill are, by order, passed around to the various Government Departments, the actual exercise of them will be formulated and put into practice without the Minister in question having to come back to this House for a debate.</P>
    <P>I could see constitutional difficulties arising.  As I say, there is the delicate area where the public good and private rights meet.  This area will be invaded to a fairly serious degree in exercising price control as envisaged in this Bill. This House should have an opportunity of debating any radical changes in that area.  I do not like to see in a Bill such as this, power to do so much by Government order.  This can lead to an unconstitutional situation&mdash;a situation where the actual operation legislation, being a bureaucratic exercise, might not be such as to end up before the courts to test its validity, thereby causing considerable injustice.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, too, an advisory committee is to be set up with power to call for information and power to punish by way of fine and finding of contempt.  I have no doubt that this has been looked at with a view to considering its constitutionality having regard to the fate of the Bill which set up the present sittings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It would be a pity if price control legislation were introduced and the teeth were found to be unconstitutional.  It is important that when this Bill becomes law it should become effective law immediately and that the public should be aware that it is effective, and that there should be no question of its <Col N="1739" /> operation being held up for the length of time a constitutional action in the High Court, and an inevitable appeal to the Supreme Court, would take.  It would be worse than useless to go through the exercise of introducing a Bill if it were to suffer that fate.  I commend to the Minister that a very careful look should be taken at the powers of the various tribunals which can be set up under this Bill.  He must ensure that they are constitutional.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise what I said in regard to the legal profession.  I have grave fears that our apprehensions might be misrepresented.  Our apprehensions are not directed towards any desire to be in a privileged or protected position.  The legal profession are anxious and willing that their costs and cost structure should be determined by whatever body the Government or this House should set up.  All they ask is that the control of their costs should ultimately rest with the Oireachtas.  They ask for that in full recognition of their position as part of the judicial arm of the State and in recognition of the doctrine of the separation of powers as enshrined in our Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year certainly saw prices spiral to such an extent that it has been a cause of serious concern and serious worry and anxiety to a great percentage of our people.  If you are in the upper income bracket it does not bother you.  You can take it in your stride.  If you are a person on a fixed income or an ordinary worker you feel the pinch.  You become impoverished. We have over 200,000 people living at or below the poverty level.  These are the very people who are affected by price rises.  These are the people who are finding it more and more difficult to live.  These are the people who are unable to afford the basic necessaries of life.  These are the people who are suffering from malnutrition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came into the House in 1965 feeble attempts have been made by the Government to impose price controls. They knew in their hearts and souls that the Bills they were introducing <Col N="1740" /> would be ineffective.  They were ineffective and they were left aside.  The proof is that we have galloping inflation, spiralling prices, and no real attempt to bring down the cost of living by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his predecessor, Deputy Colley.  Time and time again we in the Labour Party pointed to these rising prices, and we were told that they did not exist, that we were imagining them, and that there was full and effective surveillance by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Now the Government are admitting failure and they are now bringing in another Bill to try to deal with rising prices.</P>
    <P>I believe that this attempt to impose some kind of control over services is just a whitewash job.  I cannot see it working.  An attempt is being made to delude the working man into believing that the professional man will be watched.  The Minister and the Government know that they cannot impose any controls on the services given by professional men, and I am speaking as a professional man.  There is no way in which they can do that.  If the Minister can spell out how they can I will certainly stand up and apologise.  I cannot see it happening.  If a doctor says: &ldquo;The service I am offering you at the moment is a little different because I have changed my diagnostic methods and I have changed my therapy methods&rdquo;, how can the Minister impose controls over that?  The Minister knows he cannot.  This is terribly important, so let us not delude ourselves into thinking that this Bill will be effective.  Unless the working-class people are aware of this fact they will be deluded into thinking that control on services will be operated by the Minister under new legislation.</P>
    <P>How can we control the price of new houses?  We have seen an increase of over 20 per cent in the price of new houses year by year.  I have said to people: &ldquo;If you could save £400 you would be able to put a deposit on a house.&rdquo;  They found when they had saved £400 that the deposit had jumped to £700.  These are facts and the Minister knows them.  Other Members of the House know that when people thought they had enough for a deposit <Col N="1741" /> the deposit had jumped.  All I could say to them was to keep on saving and hope that things might improve.  It was a lost cause because they could never get the deposit.  They were beaten time and time again by spiralling prices and by the big profits that were made on those houses.</P>
    <P>The handing over of new houses to auctioneers was another gimmick to shove up the price of houses.  Why should those houses be handed over to the auctioneers? They add on their fee and this increases the price still further.  We have all seen the plush offices of auctioneers.  Dawson Street can be called the auctioneers' street. Those are the people who are the parasites in our community, who are not playing their part.  We talk about patriotism but these people do not know what it means.  They have no regard for their country.  All they want is to take what they can out of it, bleed us to death.  Those people are not interested in the poorer sections of the community.  They consider that this is the law of the jungle and they will survive no matter what happens to the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Many people come to us with tears in their eyes over an increase of 3p in their rent.  Their social welfare payments have been increased by a moderate sum and they, therefore, have to pay increased rents.  This causes those people great anxiety.  The 5 per cent of the population who own 71 per cent of our wealth have no regard at all for these poor people.  We have a very inequitable distribution of wealth in the country.  I deplore this farcical attempt to remedy the situation because I know it will not be effective.</P>
    <P>There was an interesting editorial in today's <i>Irish Press</i> on the first anniversary of decimalisation.  Decimalisation was a psychological confidence trick perpetrated on the people.  The lowest currency was ½p, which is the highest currency in any country in Europe.  Even the United States have a cent which is 100th part of 8s. Attempts are even now being made to eliminate this ½p.  When increases take place they do not take place by the old penny but by the old 1½d. which is <Col N="1742" /> the equivalent of ½p.  The article in today's <i>Irish Press</i> stated:</P>
    <P>It was widely held at the time of their introduction that they would push up prices, although it was equally strenuously argued that there was no reason why they should.  The fact of the matter is that the past year has seen a very big rise in the cost of goods to the public, and it cannot be pure coincidence that this took place at the same time as the changeover in currency.  If not responsible for all the rise in prices, it must have played an important part.  That, at any rate, is the popular view and the economists have not so far proved it wrong.</P>
    <P>Further on it states:</P>
    <P>Between mid-November, 1969, and mid-November, 1970, there was a rise of 18 points in the Consumer Price Index.  A year later there was a further rise of 21 points.  The latter should not have taken place against the background of the National Wage Agreement and the strict government control of prices. Indeed, one would have expected a relative stability which would have been reflected in a much smaller increase.  This is a matter for very serious inquiry if, in fact, the changeover to decimals was partly the cause.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged that an increase of 7½ per cent would take place having regard to the national wage agreement. This was stated in March, 1971.  In fact, an increase of almost 9 per cent in prices took place in that time as against any increase in wages, so workers are now much worse off than they were a year ago, despite the national wage agreement.  Would you blame workers for being wary about any new wage agreement in the light of that spiralling cost of living which took place between the time this national wage agreement was negotiated and now?  Workers were fooled into the national wage agreement. There was no honour observed by the industries or by the Government.</P>
    <P>All sorts of devices have been used to increase prices.  There is no protection for the consumer against the <Col N="1743" /> manufacturer who introduces a smaller package.  He can introduce a smaller package and charge the same price. That is what happens time and time again.  It has been shown in the so-called &ldquo;special bargain&rdquo; offers that the contents of the package have been smaller.  We have no proper legislation to prevent this.</P>
    <P>I get many letters about price increases even from shopkeepers who do not get adequate notice about price increases.  The manufacturer just tells them on the invoice after they have purchased goods that the price has been increased.  When a manufacturer applies for a price increase why can his application not be made by way of a public notice in the papers?  Does the Minister think that one month is adequate for an investigation into an application for an increase in prices?  I was interested to read the National Prices Commission Monthly Report No. 1 of November, 1971, which stated:</P>
    <P>If price increases are prevented, the increased costs would have to be met from profits or improvements in efficiency.</P>
    <P>Why should our industrialists and our manufacturers not meet the increased costs from profits or improvements in efficiency?  I see the Minister grinning as if he has come up with some inspiration on this matter.  I hope he will answer this in a rational way. Paragraph 6 of this report states:</P>
    <P>If we must take increases in the price of materials, indirect taxes and wages and salaries as data (as must individual firms), then our job of price surveillance requires us to take a view about profits.</P>
    <P>I have been asking time and time again for an investigation into profit margins. The report further states:</P>
    <P>But there is no universal norm for profits that we can use.</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission admit their failure to investigate that because there is no universal norm for profits that they can use.</P>
    <P>Price increases are too readily granted.  They take place before the <Col N="1744" /> investigation can take place.  Even in restaurants they can shove up prices without ministerial approval.  If you look at any menu in a restaurant you will see a 5 per cent turnover tax added, which did not exist before, but the 2½ per cent which existed was embodied in the price.  We know the turnover tax imposed only another 2½ per cent.  That 5 per cent was added to prices when only 2½ per cent should have been added.  This was done openly and no measures were taken by the Department.  Did those people reduce prices first?  I have no indication that they did and I certainly will not buy that story.  I will quote again from this report.  It is in paragraph 4 where it is stated that the level of profit should sustain a firm in industry.  I agree with this.  The report says that the commission would have to have before them expert advice when making any judgment on what rate or level of profit is appropriate in any case where the issue is in question.</P>
    <P>I was wondering what measures the Minister will take to provide this expert advice.  They are the answers I need.  The report I have been quoting from is the monthly report of the National Prices Commission, No. 1, November, 1971.  I do not think that a monthly investigation is adequate to give detailed examination to profits. The report states at paragraph 4:</P>
    <P>When an application for a price increase reaches us, increases in these have already occurred.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what detailed examinations have taken place.  The report states in paragraph 11:</P>
    <P>Each notice of intention to increase prices is passed to us and we must indicate whether the increases proposed should be accepted in whole or in part, or subjected to detailed examination.</P>
    <P>We need answers to these questions because the report goes on:</P>
    <P>Unless the increase proposed is to be subjected to detailed examination, it may be put into effect one month after the date on which all the particulars required in the notice <Col N="1745" /> of intent are received by the Prices Division of the Department.</P>
    <P>In what proportion of cases did detailed examination take place?  If it does not take place the prices are automatically increased within one month of notice being given to the Department. Why cannot investigations be held in public in the same way as planning appeals are held in public?  This would provide public surveillance on behalf of the inarticulate public who cannot properly defend themselves against spiralling price increases.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting article in today's <i>Irish Press</i> dealing with decimalisation. It states:</P>
    <P>It was significant there was no blatant price increase on February 15th or reasonably near that date. The increases crept in gradually after about three months and it may be assumed that consumers' vigilance was relaxed.</P>
    <P>There had been an inquiry to Mr. Michael Curry of the Department of Finance and he gave a few figures from the consumer price index about the general cost of living increase on Decimalisation Day.  He said that from a survey he had done in four shops on that day and again five months later, 30 per cent to 50 per cent of items sold showed an increase in prices.  It seemed to him that the price increases were due to decimalisation.  The fact remains, however, that in a period of three to five months there was a considerable increase in prices.</P>
    <P>The people were fooled through decimalisation and it became clear to the public that the Government were indifferent. It seems to me that the Government allowed prices to increase so that there would not be any great difference between prices here and in the EEC countries when we enter, if we do so.  The trouble is that prices are very much higher in the EEC countries, but in reply to a question last week in the House the Minister said that wages were far ahead in the EEC. There is no intention to bring wages up here.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to an American last week.  He lives in a flat in Dublin and he told me he found that prices here <Col N="1746" /> are higher than in Washington, that he found it cheaper to live in Washington. He does not eat in hotels or restaurants: he cooks for himself and buys his own food.  On the other hand, he said that wages here are much too low, that they are inadequate to cope with the cost of living.  This is the opinion of somebody from outside who has had no experience, who is looking at the position here for the first time.</P>
    <P>Now we are to be subjected to the value-added tax.  Of course the Minister will say the same thing, that there will be no change in prices.  Earlier the Minister corrected himself and said there will be no appreciable change. We all know that VAT will have the same effect as decimalisation, that it is a further excuse for a prices spiral. From discussion with a number of people in my constituency I have support for the idea of a national prices freeze.  There are 15,300 signatures for the proposal that prices be frozen for a mandatory period of at least three months.  If we could get the Confederation of Irish Industries and the employers' bodies and professional people to agree to this, to show a new patriotism, this galloping inflation would be stopped.  They could agree to adjust profits for a period and this would have the effect of bringing about orderly price rises.  We should have an assurance from the Government on this issue.  Maybe the Minister can laugh.  Maybe he is not concerned.</P>

      <P>Dr. Kiernan said last year that there would be a price rise of 7½ per cent with the National Wage Agreement.  Prices went up by almost 9 per cent.  Does the Minister not think, in the light of that, that the worker was badly treated, suffered as a result of the National Wage Agreement? I am asking for a national price freeze for a mandatory period of three months.  We could then see how things would go.</P>

      <P>I am asking that we should make some attempt to compensate the workers by a national price freeze for a period of at least three months.  There is public concern over the rise in prices.  People are genuinely worried about it.  I know the Minister is not out of touch with the lower income group&mdash;the people on pensions, on fixed incomes and low wages.  The Minister is not that far removed from these people.  He knows the problems. Would the Minister consider this freeze?  It would be a sincere gesture on his part.</P>
      <P>If people who are making very big profits, professional people and others, were to sit back and say: &ldquo;We have an obligation to the country&rdquo; it would be what I would call patriotism&mdash; people willing to make sacrifices for their country and their fellow human beings.  We should talk to these people and ask them whether they can seriously call themselves Irishmen if they are not prepared to do something for their country and not to bleed it.  I would appeal to these people to consider the people who are living in poverty, and there are almost a quarter of a million people in the country at or below poverty level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something radically wrong when one can see, as I did the other day, in a shop in Dame Street, a pair of men's shoes for £9.  The profit must be colossal.  Even the Minister is surprised. I do not think these people have a right to these high profits.  They are indulging in the law of the jungle&mdash;survival of the fittest.  They have not got the interests of the country at heart and we need to have the interests of the country at heart at present because we are going through a very difficult period.  These people may be the losers in the long run, but unfortunately people such as these readily leave the country and bring their money with them.  There are too many people making money like <Col N="1748" /> that while the people who make the sacrifices, the people who never get a look in, are the productive workers.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how the Minister will control the price of new houses.  Will he set a figure on them?  I appreciate that it is a difficult task but it would give some hope to young couples buying houses to know that we might curb prices.  It is annoying to find that the price of a new house includes the price of the site and that the builder now becomes the new ground landlord.  We heard this the other day about one builder and we worked out that the house price included £1,000 for the site.  Then he charges an annual ground rent.  This is very unfair.  I thought we were getting rid of ground landlords but instead we are perpetuating this system.  The owner is now expected to pay the builder £20 a year even though he has paid for the site in the price of the house.  The Minister should have an inquiry to see whether the builder is entitled to this or what kind of control could be introduced.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider a public inquiry into prices.  I should like the Minister to say that an application for a price increase should be announced in the newspapers by the firm concerned to alert the shopkeepers and the public.  I would support my colleague, Deputy O'Leary, in his demand for a weekly television feature giving price trends in essential goods especially.  The housewife is the least protected member of the community.  She must cope with illness, clothes, rent and rates and everything else.  It would be a good thing to give her some idea of price changes.  This might make for a more orderly state of affairs and perhaps a greater public awareness of price increases.  At present we only hear of them when it is too late.  I have a question on the Order Paper as to why an increase took place in the price of sausages without any notice to the shopkeepers.  The small shopkeepers have to explain about price increases to the people.  The system of turnover tax was never explained to the public. When a person sees a packet of tea marked 13p she forgets that turnover <Col N="1749" /> tax has to be added to that.  The small shopkeeper is then told he is overcharging when the problem is at manufacturers' level and Government level.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider seriously the questions I have raised.  I should like him to consider a national price freeze as a gesture on the part of the Government to show that they are making a determined effort to control rising costs.</P>

      <P>I propose to speak briefly and exclusively on the aspiration in the Bill that an effort will be made to control the price of houses.  I am concerned specially with the situation in Dublin. A number of developers, builders, legal men and others have been rocketing into unbelievable and vulgar affluence over the past ten years.  They have done so on the backs of young people who are answering the natural and, indeed, supernatural call to increase and multiply.  I am sure that this has set even the Lord wondering on the wisdom of His instruction to humanity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past ten years people anxious to get married and industrious enough to save money have been robbed by the people who control the building industry.  I mentioned the developer and the legal men but I would not exclude the worker.  We cannot hope to solve the problem by indicating that the cause of the high house prices is the price of land.  This is not the only cause.  Neither the builder nor the developer nor the legal man is responsible. These four agents whom I have mentioned are collectively responsible. It is not outside the Minister's competence to examine the situation bearing in mind that land must be paid for and that builders are entitled to reasonable profit and workers to a fair return for their labour.  I question the <Col N="1750" /> value of the service of the legal men but if they provide a useful service they are entitled to a fair reward but they are not entitled to profits which put a burden on young people getting married.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware of the profits that have been made to date.  A new situation has arisen in Dublin where a young couple, having saved £600 to £800, approach a builder or his agent who indicates to them that he will book a house for them.  The young couple feel pleased.  The builder then takes their £800 and indicates broadly the rest of their obligations in this matter and tells them that they will have to approach the local authority or a building society in order to get the balance of the money which they will be expected to pay to him.  The builder does not tell them that a State grant is payable.  He gets them to sign a form which automatically hands it over to him.  The grant does not seem to figure at all in the price of the house.</P>
    <P>There should not be any ambiguity at all about a builder selling a house. Other manufacturers are required to indicate their prices, as are shopkeepers. They often indicate prices of consumer commodities in the 5p bracket.  I cannot understand why a builder is not required to state exactly what the price of a house is; not just give net and gross prices.  The builder should indicate clearly what the grant is.  Abuse occurs when a builder takes about £800 from a young couple and quotes a price of £5,500 for a house, indicating vaguely that there may be a price variation clause.  A builder may have other callers looking at the house and if he finds someone with a little more money than the couple to whom he is already committed, morally if not legally, he may change his mind. When the original couple return to him, perhaps three months later, inquiring about their house and indicating what they have done to raise the money they may be told that, unless they have got the balance of the money from the local authority or the building society within a month, the deal is off.  This is happening all the time on the perimeter of Dublin.</P>
    <P>A builder or developer, not happy <Col N="1751" /> with normal profit from the sale of the house, may have had the use of the £800 interest free over four or five months.  If that money had been in the Post Office or in the bank it would have earned money for the young couple.  When the young couple realise that the deal is off their immediate concern is about their £800.  The builder, pretending to be magnanimous, will tell them they will get their money back after deduction of a slight fee of, perhaps, £5 for some solicitor who will look after the matter for them, but he does not tell them about the fraud in which he has been engaged and the wrong way in which he had the use of their money for some five months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney is a Deputy to whom I listen with great pleasure.  He is always enlightening.  However, that will not deter me from telling him that members of his profession are getting a profit which is not justified by the services they render where housing is concerned.  A solicitor acts on behalf of a developer buying a 20-acre field and he makes sure that his client is in the clear; he does everything to safeguard his client's interests.  On that 20-acre field 200 houses are erected, identical for all practical purposes.  All the solicitor has to do is to draw up an agreement and run off 200 copies of that agreement and each house purchaser will pay him a fee of anything up to £100.  Now I think that practice utterly indefensible.  The house purchaser has to borrow hundreds of pounds and pay 9 per cent or 10 per cent interest on every hundred.  For the life of me, I cannot see how any solicitor could justify charging the fee that is charged for the services he renders.</P>
    <P>We have at least half a dozen big developers operating in and around the city of Dublin.  A prospective purchaser is invariably told that he will get better value if he employs the solicitor who is acting for the developer. I believe this is something the legal profession does not condone.  I believe they are not happy about this practice.  They do not think it right that the same solicitor should act for the vendor and the purchaser.  But this <Col N="1752" /> is happening.  The result is that a solicitor who should be bending his efforts to defend his client's interests &mdash;that is, the interests of the purchaser&mdash;is more concerned to defend the developer's interests.  The unfortunate purchaser has to pay the solicitor a fee of £70, £80 or £90.  I suppose it is only natural that the solicitor should lean more heavily on the side of the man who will give him more business as against the client who will pass his way but once.  I hope the Minister will look into these aspects. He is aware of the situation.  I can confirm his fears.  As I said earlier, robbery is taking place in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell appealed to the Minister to be rational.  With all due respect to the Deputy, it is he who should be rational.  I wish he would give us his formula, the formula under which we can keep down prices and, at the same time, increase wages. If we had his formula many of our problems would be solved.  But, so far, none of us has either seen or heard the formula.  Problems will not be solved by talking.  They will be solved only by firm decisions.</P>
    <P>I detest the expression the &ldquo;ordinary worker&rdquo;.  We are all of us workers and the man who refers to the &ldquo;ordinary worker&rdquo; must regard himself as &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo;.  In relation to the group in the £5,000 to £5,500 house category, I would hope that the trade unions would make a certain contribution.  I have asked that the builder should do with less profit, particularly where anything up to £400 or £500 can be saved.  Young people who have not got all the financial resources others have will wait for the local authority to house them.  A housing emergency exists and desperate ills need desperate remedies: would the trade unions not consider a policy designed towards reducing the cost of houses to their own members?  Perhaps they could make their contribution in the matter of certain skills, the matter of demarcation.  Perhaps they could do so by not insisting that only a qualified carpenter with five years apprenticeship and four years subsequent operations can nail down floorboards, or by not insisting that only <Col N="1753" /> he can perform certain other construction work that could be performed by a semi-skilled man.  I am not advocating that this situation should continue indefinitely but if the Labour Party and the trade unions wish to make me believe there is an emergency housing situation in Dublin I ask them to make their contribution along with the contribution which I hope will be made by the Government in the form of increased grants and by restricting the profits of the developer and the builder and, if possible, eliminating legal charges.</P>
    <P>Perhaps trade unions would also consider whether they would&mdash;again they would have the expertise and the knowledge of how to handle labour&mdash; on an experimental basis in a situation such as in my constituency where there are thousands of trade unionists, invest some of their money or&mdash;and they would have good collateral&mdash; borrow money and build houses and show us how houses can be built at a price trade unionists can pay.  This would be well worthwhile and would not be beyond the ingenuity of the unions who are forever telling us how all problems should be solved.  In this case they have the capital, the labour and the knowledge.  They ask us to believe that they know how every worker's problem can be solved; they know what is a just wage for every man in every activity.  I should like to see them doing this&mdash;as the old adage says, actions speak louder than words &mdash;and indicating how the housing problem in Dublin can be solved by the trade unions.  At the least it would indicate that they are prepared to make their contribution towards a solution.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I intended to confine myself exclusively to the matter of housing and especially housing in Dublin because I understand from other Deputies that the situation is not as serious elsewhere.  You will always have a housing problem in a growing metropolis but that is no reason why people should exploit the situation as it is being exploited. Deputy Cooney referred to it and mentioned the number of new millionaires <Col N="1754" /> who have appeared within a very short time within the housing industry.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for what he is attempting to do in this matter and in other matters but more especially in regard to housing because to me there is nothing more vital and important. No other purchase that anybody makes affects his life and that of his family as much as the purchase of a house.  I hope there will be a climate created in which it will be possible for all the people of Dublin to purchase their own houses and that we can eliminate the position where people after marriage are required to wait ten years, during which they suffer depression and frustration, before ultimately qualifying for a local authority house.  I hope it will be possible for the type of people about whom I have spoken, the young industrious people wishing to buy a house and prepared to make sacrifices, to have the co-operation of all the agencies concerned so that they can look forward to owning their own house and having their interests protected. I hope we can look forward to the time when some of the sins now being committed under the mantle of housing will be eliminated.</P>

      <P>There are a number of factors responsible for the large increase in the cost of living in the past few years.  Some speakers have mentioned decimalisation as a contributing factor, if not one of the prime factors, for the cost of living increase and the fall in the value of money.  I agree that decimalisation contributed and very few will argue otherwise.  I wish to make a suggestion to the House. Because of the scope of the Bill I believe it is relevant although perhaps it might be more appropriate to make it to the Minister for Finance than to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I believe the Minister for Industry and Commerce should consider this suggestion which I think is relevant to this Bill because of the power it contains to transfer functions.  Decimalisation reduced the number of coins.</P>

      <P>I am moving this Bill for the second time.  The previous occasion was in 1964.  It is the same Bill.  May I first say that I should like to express my gratitude to the Deputies who have supported the Bill.  I do not believe this is a political issue and for that reason I was anxious that the Bill should preferably be sponsored by Deputies from the three parties because there is a difference of opinion in all three parties, a difference among Deputies about the desirability of introducing a Bill of this kind.  However, the difference cuts across party lines.  I had hoped to get some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies to support this Bill.  For their own reasons, however, which they explained to me, they could not do so although those reasons do not seem as valid now as they were then.  Two Fine Gael Deputies, Deputies Cooney and Harte, very kindly agreed to try to give the Bill a non-party character and so far as my own party are concerned I was permitted, rather the same as in the case of the Bill last week, to introduce this Bill on the understanding that it is not a piece of Labour Party legislation. Deputy O'Connell and I have put forward the Bill on our own accord and the Labour Party Deputies will be free to vote on it as they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister assured us that steps were being undertaken to deal with the problems of the sale of tobacco.  The main purpose of the Bill as set out in (a), (b) and (c) of section 2 is simply to ask that the Minister shall ensure that the manufacturers of cigarettes carry on the labels of containers and in their advertising material a notice to the effect that cigarettes contain substances likely to cause injury to health, and then to specify the deleterious nature and the origin of the substances. In spite of the undertaking given by the Minister it is worthwhile discussing this Bill again because whatever <Col N="1756" /> doubts there may have been in 1964 regarding the dangers of the cigarette smoking habit, from the scientific point of view, such doubts have been eliminated completely.  I asked a question about this matter first in 1958.  The problem was noted first in 1954 when two brilliant London GPs carried out a retrospective study of the deaths of people from lung cancer and, consequently, became interested in the possibility that there might be some link between lung cancer and cigarette smoking.  Consequently the interest extended to countries all over the world.  Various countries have carried out their own investigations and each confirmed satisfactorily the findings of the others.  In nine different countries, 23 different investigations have been carried out and there is no doubt now in anybody's mind as to the serious problems of lung cancer and other diseases that are associated with cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that neither of us who sponsor this Bill is putting forward these proposals lightly or with any intention of gaining satisfaction from depriving people of this simple pleasure and, God knows, there are few enough pleasures available to humanity.  The reason for putting forward the proposals is that these people need help.  First, they need help in finding out about the seriousness of the cigarette smoking habit and, secondly, the Department of Health must become involved in re-education in order to make it possible for people to give up the habit of smoking.  I know this is a difficult task and I understand the Minister's difficulty in relation to revenue.  There is a conflict between the revenue from tobacco sales on the one hand and, on the other, the Government's responsibility to inform the public of the dangers of cigarette smoking.  Also, from the point of view of the community, cigarette smoking is very costly in the amount of disability and in the number of avoidable deaths that it causes.  The Bill distinguishes between cigarette smoking and the smoking of cheroots, cigars, pipe tobacco and snuff because so far as is known these other forms of smoking are not dangerous.  It is important that this distinction be <Col N="1757" /> emphasised because it may be of help to many people who have found themselves addicted to nicotine and its products to know that they can smoke cheroots, cigars, pipe tobacco or take snuff without subjecting themselves to the dangers associated with cigarette smoking.  As one who gave up cigarette smoking some years ago I know how difficult it is for people to do this.  Therefore, every possible help should be given to people who are endeavouring to discontinue the habit.</P>
    <P>My approach to this whole question is rather different from that of the Minister's.  On the whole, I find his approach rather punitive although he is tending to be rather more sympathetic to the problem than was the case in the early days of the drug scare.  Whether they are users of heroin, hashish, morphia, cocaine or nicotine who are involved, I do not think we should indulge in any kind of moral judgments in relation to these people.  One hears of various punitive proposals, including long terms in prison, and many angry speeches are made by Deputies in all parts of the House about people who are drug dependent&mdash;these are the drugs other than nicotine.</P>
    <P>I should prefer that our approach should be that these are individuals with emotional problems of varying degrees of severity, and this includes the cigarette smoker.  Most people smoke a cigarette when they are in a state of anxiety or emotional stress. They do so because of some defect in their personality for which they are not responsible, and they should not be blamed or punished for this.  For instance, the idea of locking up a cigarette smoker for two years or a tobacco manufacturer for 15 years for pushing cigarettes would be an irrational act.  I am not going to digress into what one should do in relation to drug control because this is a special and separate problem, but in the general approach to this difficulty that people have in their need for support, whether it be hard drugs, pot, alcohol or cigarettes, society should have sympathy for them and should try to help them rather than have this <Col N="1758" /> tendency to hunt and punish them.</P>
    <P>During the years a powerful and expensive campaign has been conducted in the Press, on radio and television, in magazines and papers by the cigarette companies.  Equally, it has cost an enormous amount of money through the repercussions of people who have become ill as a result of cigarette smoking.  Knowing what we know now about the dangers of cigarette smoking, how can society continue to tolerate any kind of incentive to smoke?  It would be quite unthinkable to propose the suppression of all cigarette smoking&mdash;it just would not work.  It did not work when we were at school and now the problem is too big to be dealt with in that kind of authoritarian manner. People have to be persuaded, to be informed and educated into taking the difficult decision themselves.</P>
    <P>One of the most interesting things about the effectiveness of this kind of approach is demonstrated in the smoking pattern among doctors.  Doctors are not more noble, more independent-minded or mature in their personalities than anyone else; they are exactly the same as the rest of society.  It is interesting to note that there has been a dramatic drop in the use of cigarettes by doctors.  This has nothing to do with any special qualities the medical profession might have but we have access to the very frightening reality of the individuals who get the diseases which are now widely, and indeed nearly universally, associated with cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>I suppose the main and most horrible and frightening disease is lung cancer.  Anyone who has ever seen lung cancer in its terminal stage would find it very difficult to smoke another cigarette.  Then, there are the coronary diseases, arteriosclerosis, various blood vessel diseases, now agreed to be associated with cigarette smoking.  Dr. Risteárd Mulcahy produced interesting information on this matter in the Irish Medical Association Journal some years ago.  There is also the disease of bronchitis which is crippling; it causes difficulty in breathing and acute attacks of respiratory distress during the winter months.  Associated with this is the <Col N="1759" /> horrible complication of emphysema, which is the destruction of lung tissue; this leaves the person with no facilities with which to breathe.  A person with an acute case of emphysema would find it very difficult to walk for any distance without gasping for breath. Those are the three main problems associated with cigarette smoking.  The disability and distress which is caused is inestiminable.  There is no way of knowing the amount of suffering which results from the continued use of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The Government have a grave moral responsibility in this matter.  They cannot ignore the fact that the findings of successive, very distinguished scientific bodies are quite incontrovertible. To me the odd thing is the near hysteria involved in the anti-drug programme at the moment.  The Minister is very active in this regard.  He disallowed Deputy Byrne's Bill last week because he himself wanted to bring in various stringent proposals, apparently, in relation to the control of drugs, that is, drugs like pot, morphia, cannabis, LSD, or any of the other drugs that he feels are beginning to be used here widely.  I agree with the Minister's attempts to control these drugs. Although I do not share his approach to the problem, I know something must be done about it, but how can he impose all these restrictions, prohibitions and all these various penalties in regard to a relatively minor problem like drug addiction and not deal adequately with the enormous universal habit of cigarette smoking which exists among a very high proportion of people?  All he appears to be proposing to do is to put a notice on the packet and publish advertisements.  I was not very impressed by what the Minister said, but I would hope he would take an opportunity of telling us precisely what would be the content of the notice to be put on the packet and in the advertisement warning people about the cigarette habit.</P>
    <P>The Department must be faulted very seriously for its completely dilatory approach to this whole problem. Take a country like the United States which has a very big stake in this <Col N="1760" /> industry.  In 1964, when the American surgeon general's first report was published, they began to take the matter seriously and I think they were the first, but certainly they were among the first, to insist on the packet containing the notice which the Minister is now thinking of introducing.  I was quite astonished at the behaviour of the United States Government at that time. I thought it was particularly enlightened of them to do that in view of the fact that they had a very big financial involvement in the whole tobacco industry.  They did it at any rate. Various other countries followed, and then Britain did it recently.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us whether he has been able to resolve this conflict between his moral responsibility as Minister for Health in a Government which have a financial commitment to the continued popularisation of a very dangerous habit, cigarette smoking, by media other than television. What does he intend to do about it?  These unfortunate people who find it very hard to give up cigarette smoking have to combat the wonderfully clever ways in which the advertising industry are able to put across the safeness of the habit.  The usual thing is its association with heathy outdoor sports; nothing will happen to you if people like this smoke, so it is all right. Will the Minister allow this to go on? Will there be any further restriction in relation to advertising?  Again I refer to the American surgeon general's report.  I must ask the forgiveness of the House for dealing with this subject in such detail, but its results to many thousands of people are serious.  One of the major conclusions of the report is:</P>
    <P>Cigarette smokers tend to die at earlier ages and experience more days of disability than do comparable non-smokers.</P>
    <P>This is just non-smokers, not heavy smokers.  One of the things that fascinates me about my colleagues, and friends, people whom I do not bother to proselytise about cigarette smoking, is the individual's capacity to rationalise his decision not to give up smoking because he cannot.  The obvious one is: &ldquo;I will die from something or other; <Col N="1761" /> people die of lung cancer who do not smoke at all.&rdquo;  Another rationalisation is: &ldquo;I am not a heavy smoker and therefore it does not include me.&rdquo;  There are various escape hatches which people use in their attempts to justify their continuation of what they know to be a dangerous and, in fact, a lethal habit.  The second conclusion is that:</P>
    <P>If it were not for cigarette smoking practically none of the earlier deaths from lung cancer would have occurred.</P>
    <P>The third conclusion is:</P>
    <P>If it were not for cigarette smoking excessive disability from chronic respiratory and cardio-vascular diseases would be reduced.</P>
    <P>That is, angina, coronary, bronchitis and emphysema.  The fourth conclusion is that by quitting or significantly reducing their smoking people could delay or avert a substantial portion of deaths which occur from lung cancer and the other diseases.</P>
    <P>Part of the conclusions were based on facts they got from a series of deaths which they investigated.  The analysis of these figures showed that among smokers 1,329 persons per 100,000 population died from general illnesses of one kind or another; and the death rate for non-smokers was 70 per 100,000 population.  The deaths from lung cancer alone were 87 per 100,000 for smokers and 11 for non-smokers. This epidemiological information was confirmed by various animal experiments which I will not bother to go into.  They showed that it is possible by painting the products of smoke on to various animals to develop skin cancer of various kinds.</P>
    <P>Tobacco smoke contains at least seven known cancer-producing substances. As well as known cancer-producing substances in nicotine and in cigarette smoke there are also other cancer-promoting substances.  This is the kind of information which makes it very difficult for anyone who knows about it to continue smoking.  The risk of death is 70 per cent higher for men who smoke cigarettes than for men who do not.  The risk of death from chronic bronchitis and emphysema is <Col N="1762" /> three to 20 times higher.  The risk of death from coronary artery disease is 70 per cent higher for smokers than for non-smokers.</P>
    <P>We have not got very good figures, I am afraid, in Ireland and I have to use United States figures.  I think they can be accepted as being applicable here.  An attempt was made to suggest that in some way or another we were different&mdash;but I do not think it has ever been substantiated to the satisfaction of anyone&mdash;in our reaction to cigarette smoking.  It was estimated in the United States that the number of working days lost from cigarette smoking was 77,000,000 each year, that 88,000,000 man-days were spent in bed and that there were 306,000,000 man-days of restricted activity because of the cigarette smoking habit.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the incidence of lung cancer could be greatly reduced if the general population tried to reduce the smoking habit or eliminate it altogether.  Cancer deaths in the United States went from 3,000 in 1930 to 59,000 in 1969.  Quite obviously they had a very serious problem and we have much the same problem here.  All of these facts were confirmed later on in autopsy findings.</P>
    <P>The American report was then supported by the Royal College of Physicians in London.  In 1959 they were asked to investigate the problem and in 1962 they reported and confirmed the United States findings. There is very little information here in Ireland, I regret to say, but in 1963 the Journal of the Irish Medical Association, mainly because of the interest of Dr. Risteárd Mulcahy, produced figures.  The Minister will probably bring the findings up to date or correct them if they are wrong.  The findings I have for lung cancer were: 1925, 56; 1950, 298; 1960, 648; 1962, 697; 1965, 716; 1970, 961.  From 298 in 1950 to 961 in 1970.  In order to be quite fair one must remember that the diagnostic process since 1951 is reasonably comparable because there has been ready access to X-rays, and so on Before 1956 probably many people who died from lung cancer were not recorded because it was not diagnosed. <Col N="1763" /> It is fair to take the 1950 and 1970 figures and show that, in spite of a considerable drop in population, the figure has gone from roughly 300 to 961.  Dr. Mulcahy said that the coronary incidence was five times higher in smokers than in non-smokers.</P>
    <P>Eventually the Government started to take action.  I should be glad to know what detailed action is being taken.  The Minister replied to a question by me in May 1970, in regard to the recommendations by the Director General of the World Health Organisation in a report entitled &ldquo;Limitations on Smoking&rdquo; submitted to the 23rd World Health Assembly in May, 1970.  A number of recommendations were made about health workers giving an example by not smoking, discouraging young people from starting to smoke, demonstrating the ill-effects of smoking, urging action against smoking forming part of all medical and all health care programmes, discouraging cigarette-smoking in hospitals, in clinics, out-patient departments, establishing anti-smoking counselling services in hospitals, encouraging all health workers to refrain from smoking, discouraging smoking in public places and conveyances and giving the maximum publicity to health hazards. It was recommended that the health authorities should collaborate with the education authorities in schools, teacher-training institutions, universities and other educational establishments, that research should be intensified and that consideration should be given to the establishment of statutory upper limits for various constituents of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>I wonder what has the Minister done in detail about this.  Has he taken any action?  The simplistic approach is simply to say to everybody to stop smoking and then prohibit the importation of tobacco.  That simply would not work.  It could not be thought about seriously.  I am not suggesting that at all.  The wiser approach is to keep on trying to convey to the people whatever information people like ourselves in the medical profession appear to have obtained from our own experience and from what we have ready or what we <Col N="1764" /> have seen, and to try to convey to the people the extreme urgency of the need to take some action.</P>
    <P>For a long time the Department adopted the extraordinary policy of telling us it was useless to advertise. When one thinks of the enormously costly, and predominantly wasteful advertising superstructure in our economy, or in any capitalist economy, it seems extraordinarily irrational for a Government Department to say there is no point in advertising, that it has no effect, that it does not reduce the incidence of smoking, and so on.  This runs against the experience of all of us in relation to advertising.  In relation to most of the propaganda for which I was responsible when in the Department, for things like diphtheria and TB it quite obviously is particularly valuable. Therefore, I could never understand the <i>rationale</i> of that kind of approach to the use of advertisements. The Department, having deserted that position, in recent times have adopted a rather more effective programme.  I remember complaining to the Minister that I had not seen any of the new advertisements.  I now want to congratulate him on the recent advertisements of various athletes who have been persuaded to go on television to say that they relate their fitness to the fact that they do not smoke cigarettes. The advertisement featuring Tom Kiernan&mdash;this is a very important basic point: example is the best way of persuading young people not to smoke&mdash; is a very good one.  For many years I found this very hard to get across.</P>
    <P>The whole process of a child assimilating attitudes, values and standards is by watching the two most admired people in his life&mdash;his mother and father.  Most lifestyles of a young person growing up are an agglomerate of the mother and the father or the teachers in the school&mdash;any person whom a young person admires.  We will have to try very hard persuading parents that it is no good telling the child to stop smoking if they smoke. Therefore, the emphasis must be on the obvious.  The Department are sending leaflets to schools; they are concentrating on the children.  I believe one has to concentrate on the parents because <Col N="1765" /> to the child smoking is an adult habit, it is a component of growing up, it is a sign of being like the father, the mother, the people the child admires. It is very important that the Department's advertising be directed to adults to persuade them that they are the most important advertisement a child sees for smoking.  If the people smoke, who the child knows do nothing but good, honourable things, then it must be all right to smoke.  We feel that children will imitate their parents and we should try to persuade the parents in our advertising campaign that they should give up smoking.</P>
    <P>Dr. Flynn of Westmeath produced very interesting figures on this when he showed that 24 per cent of boys and 12 per cent of girls smoked where there were non-smoking parents and 44 per cent of boys and 18 per cent of girls smoked when both parents smoked.  His figures of a survey of a school were particularly disturbing and showed that 22 per cent smoked at the age of 11, 23 per cent smoked at 12, 40 per cent at 13 and 48 per cent at 14 years of age.  This was a very enterprising investigation carried out by Dr. Flynn which showed the age at which youngsters start smoking.</P>
    <P>The Department have at last decided to do something about this advertising. More money is spent on advertising today than ever before.  I cannot see why we should spend public money in a counter-advertising programme.  Why is the whole process of advertising not eliminated?  I am glad to see that the Minister has put an end to it on television, but why not stop the whole advertising process or make them carry the facts about cigarette smoking?  I will be interested to hear what the Minister says on this.  The Minister's statement that cigarette smoking may constitute a danger to health is a rather anaemic one.  Why do we permit any cigarette advertising at all?  If we allow it, why do we not insist that the facts should be stated clearly and unequivocally by the advertiser?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Bill does not go as far as I would like it to go.  I should like to know to what extent the Minister is prepared to put a notice into <Col N="1766" /> the advertisements or on to the cartons which would be so convincing that in fact people would not smoke. That is what I would do if I were in the Minister's place.  It would, therefore, not be worth the tobacco companies while advertising at all.  From what we have seen here and in other countries we can have no doubt whatever that serious remedial action should be taken in regard to this very serious health hazard which affects tens of thousands of our people.</P>
    <P>I do not see why we can on the one hand become positively hysterical about the relatively small drug problem in the community and at the same time continue to tolerate this very much more dangerous&mdash;certainly as dangerous&mdash;and from the point of view of trying to get rid of it as difficult a habit.  As long as our people can see advertisements telling them it is all right to smoke, minimising the dangers involved, glossing over the great hazards to health which are inseparable from continued cigarette smoking, the Minister is betraying his trust to the people.  His difficulty probably is in relation to revenue, but surely one should offset that against the enormous cost that must be involved to our society if we would only consider the American investigation into man working days lost, disability, reduced activity, death rate and the cost this involves to the community.</P>
    <P>We have on the one hand the Minister continuing to get his revenue from taxation on tobacco and on the other a very considerable amount of it spent on dealing with the results on people who smoke cigarettes and who suffer from these terrible, crippling, disabling diseases.  From the point of view of the tobacco companies, anything they have done they appear to have done simply because the Minister has insisted they should do something about the problem.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would try to make up now for the failure of the Department of Health to act in a responsible way since 1964.  In this as in nearly everything else we are behind everywhere else in the world and I should like the Minister now to make the sacrifice.  There is a sacrifice <Col N="1767" /> involved but it is in a good cause.</P>
    <P>People who smoke cigarettes tend to ridicule the practice, to underestimate its seriousness, to minimise the appalling consequences which many of them suffer out in isolation in their hospital beds long after anything can be done to help them because by the time they get lung cancer nothing can be done about it.  I am glad to see the things the Minister has done, and I welcome them, but a lot more remains to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief.  It is seldom Deputy Browne and I agree on anything but tonight I agree with his outlook on this matter and if any words of mine can strengthen his case I will willingly utter them.  Perhaps this Assembly is the last place to which we should look for a solution to this problem.  The means of smoking are so readily accessible that it is almost impossible to stop any person who wants to smoke.  They will not be stopped by legislation but by education.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne complimented the Minister on his publicity efforts against smoking.  In recent times the Minister has shown refreshing activity.  The use of Mick Dowling and Tom Kiernan to bring home to young people the dangers from smoking was an excellent idea.  Of course the whole problem rests with the young and we have a duty to them to show them that if they want to have a normal healthy life one of the things they must not do is to smoke.  Therefore, I suggest that the start be made in the home.  Secondly, there should be concentration in the schools.  Deputy Browne said we all smoked at school, either for a dare or as an experiment.  The schools and the parents have the key to the solution of this problem rather than the Department or any Member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In saying that, however, I urge that we unite the various factors and the various sections in our society to try to bring home to people, the young especially, the terrible dangers associated with smoking, not merely because it is a vicious habit but because of the final results of persistent smoking.  It <Col N="1768" /> is shocking to think that we should have to consider the revenue lost.  This would be unworthy of us.  If we are convinced that smoking is injurious to health it would be hypocritical of us to continue to seek revenue from such a source, which is therefore evil.</P>
    <P>Forty years ago in America they thought they could stop people drinking by prohibition.  We know the terrible result of that.  We must encourage people not to smoke rather than prohibit smoking.  The only people we can prohibit are the children.  Under existing law it is an offence to sell cigarettes to a child but this is honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  One sees many youngsters smoking.  I believe many middle-aged and older people have given up smoking but there seems to be a tremendous increase in smoking among the young.  One can see this on the streets or at social functions. I hope I am wrong about this but this is how it appears to me.  Some of them may smoke cheroots but cigarettes are still the most popular form of smoking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne mentioned morality. Perhaps there is a moral issue here just as there is in the abuse of drink. In regard to drink many of us belong to an organisation which gives Ireland probably the biggest percentage of non-drinkers in the world.  If smoking damages the body there is something immoral about it.  I wonder could we have a sort of &ldquo;temperance&rdquo; association for non-smokers.  The association of which I and thousands of Irish people are members has been frowned on and jeered at by people who say that we took a pledge when we were very young and did not know what we were doing and that we were too stubborn and pround to start drinking later. If we could have young people at school taking a pledge not to smoke would we not be well on the way to overcoming the problem?</P>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy knows that many young married couples smoke. Even a lower paid worker and his wife may spend over £100 a year on cigarettes.  This could be used for clothing their children or buying food but because of the weakness of human <Col N="1769" /> nature it is spent on cigarettes.  Our task here is to show people, not by any threat of punitive measures but, as Deputy Browne has done, from a medical point of view, what can happen to a person as a result of smoking. When people get these diseases it is too late for them but other people should benefit by their sufferings.</P>
    <P>Even though we may speak here and the Minister may carry out a marvellous campaign some people will still not be convinced that smoking will harm them.  Last week a member of the British Parliament said that he had smoked for 75 years and would continue to do so, though he could not guarantee that he would do it for another 75 years.  I wonder what effect this had on people in England or even over here.  This is a man of 83 years of age.  We must tell our young people that he is the exception that proves the rule.  He was lucky in some way but there are millions of others who have suffered.</P>
    <P>When Lent meant more to our people than it does now thousands of people gave up smoking.  That may be looked on as an old-fashioned habit but tomorrow is Ash Wednesday and I believe thousands of people will still don the sackcloth and not the ashes.  I think the Minister could encourage people who do not smoke for seven weeks to stay off cigarettes for at least another seven weeks.  Whether they do it as a spiritual exercise or on the Minister's advice is not a big issue.  If some doctor could come up with a medicine which would make it easy for people to give up smoking the habit would not last very long.  Cigarette manufacturers over the years with their advertising campaigns have built up the idea that the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing is to smoke just as the drink manufacturers are doing.  If the Minister and his Department by this campaign can show that the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing is not to smoke by having athletes on television and on the newspapers who have come to the top because they do not smoke we will get somewhere. I would be against any kind of punitive measures except that the law in relation to selling cigarettes to children should be enforced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne mentioned putting <Col N="1770" /> a notice on the packet that cigarettes are dangerous to health.  This will work for a while but then people will stop noticing it.  Most smokers do not know what is written on the packet.</P>
    <P>There should be a strict control on the sale of cigarettes to children. Parents should be exhorted to show good example by not smoking and we should try to get the co-operation of school authorities and teachers for a massive campaign against smoking. We should have an expansion of the Department's television and general advertising campaign and some research into a means of making it easy for a smoker to break his habit. Unless these things are done we can look forward to thousands of our people continuing to smoke because they just cannot stop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to be associated with this Bill.  I rise, of course, to speak in support of it.</P>
      <P>The kernel of this whole question is now the weight of medical evidence. It is so strong that the case against cigarette smoking has been proved to the hilt.  It has been proved beyond any doubt that cigarette smoking is actually lethal, not for everybody but for the majority of cigarette smokers. Once that fact has been proved&mdash;and it has been proved&mdash;it becomes a matter for amazement that the Government, being responsible for the common good of the people, do not act accordingly and eliminate that practice from the public.  We cannot force people to give up cigarette smoking. It is not possible to interfere with the rights of the individual to that extent, but the State can do more to persuade people to give up smoking.  As Deputy Browne pointed out there is illogicality in the Government spending large sums on advertising rather obliquely the evils of cigarette smoking while at the same time permitting advertising encouraging smoking.  Those two positions are so ridiculously incompatible that they must cease forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been progression in having cigarette advertising eliminated from television.  We still have cigarette advertisements on radio and in colour magazines.  The magazines carry coloured <Col N="1771" /> advertisements and the ad-men, with their themes of sex, glamour and adventure, come into their own in this regard.  Cigarette advertising should be abolished immediately.  Once the medical case has been proved beyond doubt it must follow that the Government must discourage cigarette smoking.  We must have a complete ban on cigarette advertising.  If there is loss of revenue as a consequence, that revenue loss must be endured by the Exchequer. Loss of such revenue cannot carry any weight in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>The cigarette companies themselves are diversifying.  This is a stock market euphemism for letting it be known that they realise it is now unsafe to have all their &ldquo;eggs&rdquo; in one basket.  The cigarette companies realise that their day is fast approaching an end.  Any lobby which they might be able to mount would be comparatively weak and in any event could be safely disregarded.  Cigarette advertising should be abolished instantly and completely from all the media.  There are publications coming into the country over which we have no control and we cannot prohibit their importation just because they carry cigarette advertising, but such advertising should be abolished in all our home media.  We could give a lead to Great Britain in this regard.  If we abolished cigarette advertising from all the media we might find a similar practice quickly following in Great Britain.  That would be a first and very active step which the Government could take to discourage cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>The Government must take positive steps in terms of their own campaign. Their own campaign must be one of propaganda.  At the moment propaganda comes under two main headings. There is the message on the cigarette package.  If the form of the message is to follow that on the packets in Great Britain the message itself will prove innocuous.  In Britain the message is printed in small, harmless typeprint. After a while the message becomes unnoticed by the user of the cigarettes. The message should be printed on cigarette packages in bold type, standing <Col N="1772" /> out clearly.  The message itself should be quite dramatic.  It is pointless to have a message which does not fulfil its purpose.  The message will become as unnoticed as the name and address of the maker or the trade mark.  It will not have any impact.</P>
    <P>Regulations should provide that the message on cigarette packages should have impact.  The colouring used and the wording of the phrase should be devised so as to ensure that the message is the first thing to be noticed by a person buying cigarettes.  The colour of the print used should be changed from time to time.  The message should stand out clearly on the packet.  The second positive step which the Government should take is that of using television to show sportsmen as examples of young people who have not smoked.  This has been done here but I suggest that the psychology used has not been correct.  The young people who are rebelling and who are smoking will not have as their idol the clean-cut young sportsman but rather the hairy, weird pop fan.  It is essential that the advertising should get across to the young people but the present type of hero-worship will not appeal to many of them.  Nowadays sport and all that goes with it is disregarded if not actually sneered at by quite a proportion of the modern adolescents.</P>

      <P>To show prominent sportsmen as being against cigarette smoking is naïve.  Cigarette advertising should show the horrors following cigarette smoking.  The end results of cigarette smoking are quite horrific.  In this day and age of exposure we should not be coy about showing such results. Advertising and propaganda should lay more stress on the actual harm which can result.  Media men have been slick enough to produce attractive advertisements to encourage smoking; these very men can produce advertisements showing the vices of smoking.</P>

      <P>We ought to show by anti-cigarette advertising that cigarette <Col N="1773" /> smoking can be fatal.  We want to frighten people off cigarettes.  I myself was a cigarette smoker until recently. I was aware of the medical reports but always felt that others would get lung cancer and not myself.  The only propaganda which discouraged me were the reports of the findings of research in America which I read in the news columns of the papers and followed up for a time.  There was no sustained propaganda, but the effects of their findings in medical terms made me acknowledge that I could be a victim to the disease attributable to cigarette smoking.  Consequently, I think that propaganda should be more positive, more horrific, more dramatic and should confront one at every turn. At the moment the war between the pro- and the anti-cigarette smokers is obviously being won by the pro-cigarette smokers.  There is no doubt about that.  Having regard to the undeniable medical evidence there should be no question as to who wins the war when the control of the war lies in the hands of the Government.  The Government should ensure that the war is won by the anti-cigarette lobby.  We cannot physically prevent people from smoking.  We would be infringing human rights.  We can, however, try to persuade them in terms of positive propaganda and if this Bill is accepted, it will provide the vehicle for disseminating this propaganda.</P>
      <P>I would endorse Deputy Moore's plea to ensure strict observance of the law in the sale of cigarettes.  It may be a serious inconvenience for a parent to have to go out and buy his own cigarettes rather than send a small boy down to buy them for him, but he should be put to that inconvenience. The law should be strictly enforced; the shopkeeper cannot know whether the cigarettes are for the parent or for the child who is making the purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cigarette smoking is on the increase. Deputy Dr. Browne quoted the figures given by the MO in County Westmeath.  The whole matter will have to be looked into and more dramatic initiatives will have to be taken to reverse the trend.  Small children smoke because it is a trendy thing to do.  They will have to be <Col N="1774" /> frightened off.  I suppose they are too young to be attacked through the media but, if propaganda can be got through to the parents, it may filter through to the children ultimately.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to be recommended. The philosophy behind it is commendable. The Bill should be accepted and implemented in its entirety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, first of all, to thank Deputy Dr. Browne for his excellent exposition of the dangers of cigarette smoking.  I fully agree with what he said.  Tobacco is, of course, not comparable with either drugs or alcohol because it has no halluciogenic effect. It simply shortnes people's lives.  It does not result in people going into psychiatric homes.  There is that distinction.</P>
      <P>I have already given the House the programmes initiated in respect of smoking.  These are directed in the main towards young people.  There is advertising in magazines for young people.  There were three separate TV campaigns.  There was a poster competition. There are articles in women's magazines and other periodicals and we have had 1,000 film shows in which the horrific sides of smoking have been shown.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House would not have the effect of banning cigarette advertising.  I do not know what exactly the Bill proposes to do because we have already got the voluntary consent of the tobacco manufacturers to issue warning notices on cigarette packages.  The size of the warning has been agreed: &ldquo;Government Warning.  Smoking can damage your health.&rdquo;  There will be new posters carrying warning notices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had evidence from countries which have cancelled advertising that there has been a recovery in cigarette sales, following a fairly considerable fall, and it is my belief, my unshaken belief, that we should concentrate on trying to prevent young people starting to smoke.  I do not believe one can alter the habits of adult smokers to any significant degree.  I may be wrong in that, but that is my opinion.  There has been a levelling-off <Col N="1775" /> in consumption but there has been no remarkable fall.  The report of the Royal College of Physicians for the years 1961 to 1968 shows that there has been no very remarkable change. I doubt if any notice will deter adults. There has been a great deal of propaganda already and results would indicate that it has not been entirely successful.  In the United States it was reckoned that 2 per cent gave up smoking as a result of warning notices. There is nothing to indicate that it would be worthwhile spending money on a concentrated campaign addressed to adults.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned, I was dealing with increases in the cost of living, some of which can be attributed to decimalisation.  Much of the blame for the increase in the cost of living revolves around this.  The £ is our basic unit and changing the £ from 240 pence to 100p has had the effect of reducing the value of the £.  We now have only six coins under the £1 denomination; prior to this we had nine.  This is important.  The smallest unit now, the new halfpenny, is not being used to any great extent: the new penny is used.  In this connection I believe either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce should initiate some amendments. Prior to decimalisation the farthing was, perhaps, almost gone but at that stage the farthing was nearly equivalent to the new halfpenny at present.  We had the farthing, the halfpenny, the penny, the 3d piece, the 6d piece, the shilling, the two shillings, the 2s 6d and the ten shilling note.  We now have the halfpenny, the penny, the 2p, the 5p, the 10p and the 50p, totalling six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I suggest it would be very <Col N="1776" /> wise to consider issuing a 50p note. At present the 50p piece is being treated as a piece of change.  A note is subconsciously put away in one's pocket and left aside.  The approach to a note is somewhat different.  This factor should be borne in mind.  When a 50p coin is produced to pay for goods of any description it is considered as just change and sometimes it is difficult to discover what coin exactly is needed.  The subconscious act of taking a wallet out of one's pocket and producing money in itself is effective in helping to emphasise the value of money.  Also, people would know more easily by looking at their wallets how much money they had.  This might seem to be a somewhat hypothetical arguement and it might be difficult to tie it up with the cost of living but I think it would be advisable to have a 50p note, perhaps along with the 50p piece.  I believe the 50p note is essential.</P>
    <P>I think it would also be wise to have a 25p piece because at present the gap between 10p and 50p is too great, although it can be made up with coins. Although the new halfpenny has not &ldquo;caught on&rdquo;, I believe we made a mistake in not having a coin below the halfpenny.  The halfpenny has not been used as much as it should be used. Small adjustments in prices are difficult for supermarket owners and other business people with the limited coinage now available.  It would be a good idea to have a coin somewhat less in value than the new halfpenny so as to give business people more room to manoeuvre in adjusting prices.</P>
    <P>If there was some sort of agreement on prices this coin I am suggesting would give the Government a much broader basis on which to level price controls.  The change-over in coinage has involved considerable expense and I can well understand that elderly people especially have difficulty in becoming accustomed to the new coinage and that a further change now or in the near future might cause further confusion.  However, I believe we should have a coin somewhat lower in value than the halfpenny and I particularly urge the introduction of a 50p note because it commands more <Col N="1777" /> respect.  One pays more attention when using a note to pay for a purchase than when using silver or coins.  This would help curb the idea nowadays that when you go into a shop to purchase any item you hand in a £ and get back very little change.  The use of a ten shilling note would place more emphasis on the value of money and for that reason I would ask the Minister to pay special attention to this suggestion.</P>
    <P>I think these suggestions are particularly relevant on this Bill and the Minister should consult with the Department of Finance with regard to having a 50p note.  When this matter was being discussed when Deputy Haughey was Minister for Finance I was here on that particular morning and it was proposed by, I think, Deputy FitzGerald that we should have a 50p note&mdash;I think Deputy Keating was here also&mdash;but the Minister, in his wisdom, decided against it.  Now that we have hindsight and can see the position as it exists it would be wise to adopt my suggestion.</P>
    <P>While there may be one or two points of merit in the Bill I cannot agree with the provisions of it.  The only section of it that can be commended in any way is section 3 but even that does not go far enough.  As proposed, the Bill is an effort at locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.  There has been a huge increase in taxation during the past few years and it is this increase that has led to an enormous increase in the cost of living.  When workers realised the enormity of the increases in taxation they made sure, when seeking wage demands, to ask for increases that would be sufficient to counteract the tax increases.</P>
    <P>Postal charges have increased by leaps and bounds during the past few years.  Postal and telephone charges are very important in so far as any aspect of business life is concerned. The various semi-State bodies concerned have allowed prices to get out of hand.  However, the reduction in CIE fares under their &ldquo;Great Train Robbery&rdquo; campaign is to be welcomed especially in so far as the carriage of goods to Dublin from rural areas is <Col N="1778" /> concerned.  It is good business to have goods carried by rail and the policy of reducing rail charges will help to keep business going in the towns where there are railway stations.  This, however, is the only area in which the Government have made any attempt to reduce costs.</P>
    <P>The greatest mistake made by the Government was the increase in turnover tax from 2½ per cent to 5 per cent. This increase was responsible for the subsequent huge increases in the cost of living.  It is one of the reasons why our economy is now going through such a difficult time.  Of course, there are other reasons for this also but I regard that 100 per cent increase as being the major one.  It is rather late now to try to change the situation.  In fact, it would be impossible to redress it.  It is easy for anybody to say that wage demands have been outrageous but when one considers the rate of income tax and considers also the differential rent system, a system that I consider it to be grossly unfair in that overtime and bonuses are taken into account, these wage demands could hardly be considered as being outrageous.  Then, too, there is such indirect taxation as the wholesale and turnover taxes.  While this Bill is a late effort to curtail price increases, it is not sufficient.  If the Government are serious about the situation, they will ensure that the Ministers concerned look into the question of income tax, wholesale and turnover taxes and the differential rents system all four of which I believe to be responsible mainly for the increased cost of living during the past few years. I understand that there are vast sums of money outstanding in respect of rents because of the objections of people to the taking into account of overtime money and bonuses in assessing rent under the differential rent system.</P>
    <P>At Question Time this afternoon the Minister for Finance told us that at present the Government are not considering restricting the amount of money that holidaymakers may take out of the country.  There has been <Col N="1779" /> talk of a big drive to attract tourists into the country and also of encouraging our own people to spend their holidays at home this year.  Every effort should be made in this regard.</P>

      <P>This gives authority to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to transfer from his Department to any other Department powers in relation to price control.  In this matter wages and taxation are interwoven.  Because of the taxation system it was necessary to bring this Bill before the House.  This afternoon the Irish Hotels Federation recommended that we provide petrol coupons to tourists in Ireland.  The prices of beer, spirits and cigarettes do not provide any attraction for tourists. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has power to delegate to the Minister for Finance the matter of the prices of beer and spirits and I believe that is relevant to this Bill &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons many Irish people go abroad for their holidays is because of the much cheaper beer, spirits and tobacco prices obtaining in other countries.  The rate of taxation charged in Ireland for these items is much too high.  If this were curtailed it would lead to increased revenue to the Government because consumption might be increased. The Irish Hotels Federation wish the Government to consider for the coming summer months some system where by the prices of beer and spirits would be reduced.  This would be an attraction for Irish people working in England who might be considering returning here for a holiday. At the moment prices of beer and spirits are cheaper in England.  On the continent such items are not taxed.</P>
      <P>The recommendation by the Irish Hotels Federation that petrol coupons be provided for tourists is commendable and I hope the Government will consider this matter.  This would come within the province of the Department of Industry and Commerce and they should make every effort to do something about this matter for the summer.  The target figure set by the tourist industry was £100 million.  I realise that it is difficult for the tourist industry in the present circumstances to hold our tourist business.  However, if we wish to keep in employment all the people who are engaged in the hotel business, it is essential that we make some effort to attract tourists this year and to encourage Irish people to spend their holidays at home.  Any reduction in the price of beer and spirits would help to keep in employment many workers in the brewery industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support wholeheartedly the recommendation made by the Irish Hotels Federation.  This recommendation need only be enforced for a period of three <Col N="1782" /> or four months and if it is considered necessary to revert to the present system later that can be done.  However, it would be a desirable measure to adopt for the coming summer.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of this Bill will have serious and far-reaching consequences because it seeks to regulate prices and fees charged by different professional bodies.  Section 2 (c) states:</P>
    <P>charges for services wholly or partly of a professional character and remuneration under a contract of service for work wholly or partly of a professional character, and</P>
    <P>I wonder what is the scope of that phrase &ldquo;wholly or partly of a professional character&rdquo;.  There is the danger that if professional and skilled or semi-skilled workers are included, they may find it more rewarding to earn their living outside this country. Furthermore, this section would be very difficult to enforce.  For instance, if it encompasses the professions I do not see how, for instance, the Department of Health will decide the amount of remuneration to be paid to a doctor for an appendix operation or for attendance on patients.</P>
    <P>If the incomes of doctors are to be regulated a very difficult situation could arise.  I am from Offaly and I know that in many rural areas in the midlands and the west of Ireland, it is difficult to attract newly-qualified young men and women.  Many of these graduates prefer to stay in Dublin or go abroad.  Such control as is envisaged in this Bill might increase emigration.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I hope he will tell us whether this Bill applies to skilled and semi-skilled workers.  If so, I believe it could have a detrimental effect on our economy, particularly when we are facing a referendum on entry into the EEC.  People might be inclined to view this matter more from the economic than from the patriotic point of view.  Therefore, the provision to which I refer is one which the House should seriously consider.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney mentioned builders and Deputy O'Connell referred to ground rents.  Over the years there has <Col N="1783" /> been opposition to ground rents, a system whereby a builder can develop an estate, sell the houses but retain the right to extract ground rents.  There are certain places in Dublin in respect of which, over the years, people have been paid ground rent, for instance, Lesson Street, Dartmouth Square, Leeson Park.  These ground rents were considered unfair.  Certainly in regard to new houses they should be abolished.  When a person buys a house for a sum of money and the title deeds are handed over, that should be the end of the transaction.  It is not proper or fair that there should be a further charge by way of ground rent.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in consultation with the Minister for Justice, should devise a scheme to abolish ground rents.  The relevant Ministers should ensure that no further ground rents are allowed to be created. That in itself would be a start.  It would show that the Government were in earnest in trying to rid this country of ground rents.</P>
    <P>A Bill should be prepared and brought before the House to enable people who are paying ground rents to purchase them for a reasonable figure.  Having said that I believe there is one merit in having ground rents. The ground landlord can retain a certain amount of control and he can prevent the occupier in a good residential area from starting an iron-mongery or a forge, or some other business that would devalue the houses next door.  I would ask the Minister and the Minister for Justice to make some provision whereby people in residential areas could be prevented from starting up a business which would infringe the rights of their neighbours, while at the same time doing away with ground rents. This would be difficult but it is desirable.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the application of Acts to new houses.  Newly-married couples are finding it more and more difficult to purchase a house.  The price of sites has rocketed out of all proportion.  It has become outrageous. It would be in the public interest for the Government to purchase land in <Col N="1784" /> towns and cities and to service it for building.  Birr Urban Council are operating such a scheme.  I know that in parts of Dublin the corporation have acquired land for development and building.  In many rural towns the price of sites varies from £800 to £1,500 or £1,600.  I am speaking of towns in my own area of which I have an intimate knowledge.</P>
    <P>I am told that in a number of larger towns the price of sites goes over £1,600.  It is impossible for a man on a salary of £20 to £30 a week to pay this amount of money for a site and pay for the house as well.  Therefore, these people are forced to live in flats or with inlaws, and so on, for years. They have to pay rent for these flats and, while they are trying to save, the price of sites is going up and the cost of houses is going up.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill has a certain amount of merit.  Flats are not specifically mentioned in it.  There are many serviced flats specially designed for families and I think they should be controlled under the Bill.  Subsection (2)  provides:</P>
    <P>In this section &ldquo;new house&rdquo; means a house that has not previously been used as a normal place of residence and includes any outoffice, yard, garden or other land appurtenant thereto or usually enjoyed therewith and any part of a building suitable for use as a place of residence.</P>
    <P>The section should cover flats specifically. The books of almost all the building societies are closed to new customers for loans.  If you have an income of £1,500 or over you will not be given a loan by a county council or a corporation.  That is a reasonably moderate figure.  I know quite a number of people in semi-State jobs whose income is over the £1,500 level and they are prevented from obtaining loans.</P>

As long as the Deputy keeps to the price of the sites inclusive in the price of houses the Chair has no fault with that but we cannot go on to deal with the availability of loans, income ceilings and so on.  We could not do that on such a Bill as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling on this particular point.  In the development of new houses builders at the present time&mdash;this is common practice&mdash;obtain the grants that are paid for the building of houses.  Where a builder provides a house there should be a fixed price for it.  If the price is £4,500 and the State grant works out at £500 I believe the builder should receive £4,500 and the person purchasing the house should obtain the £500 grant.  As far as I understand the situation a price is fixed for the house, the builder builds the house; he obtains his price and as well as that he obtains the corporation grant or the county council grant.  This is a very undesirable practice.  The Minister should see that this does not continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see, it is a widespread practice for those grants to be kept by the builders.  The grants are paid to help newly-married people to obtain houses for themselves.  When these <Col N="1786" /> grants are added to the price of the houses and kept by the builders it means the price of the houses is outside the range of the ordinary married people.  Those young people find if they obtain a loan from a council and they obtain the Government loan as well the house is in a particular range but when the builder gets the State grant and the outside grant the house is outside the range of an ordinary man or woman.</P>
    <P>This legislation applies in relation to a hire purchase and credit sale agreement. The interest rate in regard to hire purchase and credit sale agreements allows far too much discretion to the hire purchase company.  This should be curtailed.  At the present time building societies are closed to new applicants for loans.  The Government should ensure that they reopen for loans.  It is almost impossible for people in the £1,500 income range to obtain a loan because building societies are closed to them.  They do not come within the ambit of county councils and corporations and most of those people have to seek short-term loans.  They find that the rate of interest charged is as high as 12 or 14 per cent.  This puts a millstone around the necks of these people.  Many of them may never be able to get out of the clutches of these companies.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce should ensure that building societies grant loan facilities to those people.  Something will also have to be done in regard to the interest rates on hire purchase and credit sale agreements.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything in the Bill in relation to motor insurance.  There is a committee investigating motor insurance at the present time.  The ordinary man in the street finds it almost impossible to obtain motor insurance at the present time.  People get exorbitant demands for motor insurance from such companies.  I hope this will be remedied when we get the full report of the committee.  I remember coming across a case where a demand for £250 a year insurance was made for a school mini-bus.  The Minister may have had representations in regard to this too.  A demand for £250 from a person who never had an accident was <Col N="1787" /> exorbitant and completely out of the question.  The present demand by those companies are outrageous and the sooner something is done to curtail them the better.  People find it almost impossible to obtain no claim bonus certificates because companies are afraid that if they give these certificates, people could get a cheaper rate from some other company.  This is something this Bill does not cover and I believe it should cover it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This covers it to a certain extent.  So long as it covers the points I have mentioned I will be happy.  I am sure the Minister has had numerous representations about this. There is much justified criticism of motor insurance at present and if this can remedy the problem of exorbitant increases it is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now wish to make a point in regard to which it may be considered that I have a vested interest.  I believe that what I am saying is true, although I admit that everybody looks at things from his own point of view.  The point I wish to make is in relation to legal costs.  Solicitors' remuneration is controlled in two ways.  There is a statutory body under the Solicitors' Remuneration Act, 1881.  It is a body composed of the Chief Justice, judges and so on and it deals with non-contentious business.  The Minister has no direct control over this body.  The second body is controlled by five rules committees.  In regard to remuneration for work done the Law Society were in touch with the Department of Justice in 1962 and they proposed that a central costs committee should be set up and that this body should consist of members of the judiciary, chartered accountants and representatives of the public interest.  I believe that if a committee were set up to investigate legal remuneration it should <Col N="1788" /> be under the direct jurisdiction of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is essential.  On a point of principle it would be dangerous if a situation were to come about in which any Government Department, especially the Department of Justice, would have complete control over the fixing of costs.</P>
    <P>One reason is that the State is perhaps the biggest litigant in the courts of justice.  In the vast majority of criminal cases the State brings the action.  In most aspects of litigation the State is involved in many ways.  It would not be desirable for any Government Department to have control over the Law Society.  It would be much safer if the control of the Law Society in regard to costs were specifically related to this House.  The fixing of costs would then come under this House only.  This is what the Law Society wish.  If the Department had complete control it might be in a position to dictate to the Law Society and they would not be in a position to argue.  In this country one of the buffers between the individual and the State is the legal profession and to take away its independence would not be in the public interest.  This is something the Minister should reconsider.</P>
    <P>I believe the powers given under this Bill are very wide.  They delve into the lives of many individuals.  They are extraordinarily wide powers under which any Minister can fix prices to the extent envisaged in this Bill.  Section 7 states:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Government may by order, whenever they so think proper, transfer from any Minister of State having charge of a Department of State to any other Minister of State having charge of a Department of State any power, duty or function that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  relates to any specified commodity, specified service (including a service wholly or partly of a professional character), specified work or specified process,</P>
    <P>This means the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have his powers; the Minister for Health will have his powers; the Minister for Justice will <Col N="1789" /> have his powers; the Minister for Local Government will have his powers.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce fully appreciates the vast powers this gives to him. People come and people go, Ministers come and Ministers go, but these wide powers will exist over the years, right down along the line, and they will apply to each of the Ministers I mentioned.</P>
    <P>It will mean that the Minister for Health will have powers over specified services and work.  He will have power to go into payments for work done by doctors, dentists and nurses. The Minister for Local Government will have powers in regard to a very wide aspect of the work of builders.  A lot of this is desirable and some of these powers should be retained, but some of the powers envisaged here could be very dangerous.  We should consider them very briefly because they will affect the lives of thousands of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now concerned with amending the Prices Acts of 1958 and 1965.  In his introduction to this <Col N="1790" /> Bill on 9th February, the Minister is reported at column 1413 of the Dáil Debates as follows:</P>
      <P>While the powers given in the 1958 Act may be exercised only in certain limited circumstances, the amending 1965 Act gave me wide powers to investigate and control prices.</P>
      <P>I am glad to know that the Minister in the 1965 Act had wide powers to control prices.  I can only say it is a pity he never used them.  I do not think Deputy Enright need worry too much because I do not think the Minister has any serious intention of operating the powers conferred on him here.</P>
      <P>I say the Minister did not use the powers conferred on him in the 1965 Act because, of course, it can be argued that the extraordinary price rises, which reached their climax last year, were not peculiar to us.  I shall be arguing in a minute that in an economy as open as ours there are certain peculiar factors in regard to price control, anyway.  When that has been said, we can look at price rises here and agree that in 1971 a lot of the world was experiencing this extraordinary inflation, a new phenomenon of inflation at a period of stagnation. There was the coining of the word &ldquo;stagflation&rdquo; to describe this.  The table about inflation I choose to quote from is from the <i>OECD Observer</i>, No. 53, for August, 1971.  It gives inflation rates in terms of the gross national product deflator for seven major countries.</P>
      <P>I have chosen the first quarter of 1971 to illustrate my point.  I will quote the rates for the first quarter, but it is an annual rate.  In the first quarter, the annual rate was rising in the US by 5¼ per cent, in Canada by 3½ per cent in Japan by 4 per cent, in France by 5¼ per cent, in Germany by 7¼ per cent, in Italy by 5¾ per cent, in the UK by 8 per cent.  They are OECD figures.  In Ireland at that time they were rising at 10 per cent.  We were away at the top of that league at a time when the Minister had, because of the 1965 and the 1958 Acts, wide powers to control prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly the Minister was not using <Col N="1791" /> those powers at all.  It was not a matter of keeping pace even with Britain's 8 per cent per annum during that quarter.  We outpaced Britain.  I do not think we led the league in that period&mdash;I think we were No. 2.  Certainly we were inflating faster and with greater need for price control than any comparable countries around us.  It was in response to that situation that we have this trivial Bill showing such masterly concentration on the inessential things.  There are some nice little things in it, some little bits which are fine, but it is irrelevant to the problem of controlling prices.</P>
    <P>Therefore it would be a great mistake for anybody, particularly in the labour movement, to think that a serious attempt at price control is the intention.  This Bill is something the Government can brandish when accused of inactivity in this field.  They can say: &ldquo;Look at what we are doing.&rdquo;  What they are doing in this Bill is irrelevant in a number of ways which I propose to point to in a minute.</P>
    <P>What is extraordinary to me in the light of the past 18 months of rolling inflation, of fantastic price rises, is that people have been so quiescent about it.  We have had major demonstrations, and indeed rioting, about price rises at periods in our history when the rate of inflation was much less.  This time, people have accepted them with, of course, private grumbling, but there has been an extraordinary lack of public protest.  There are several reasons for this.  I think decimalisation codded people profoundly in the way that has been mentioned already but particularly in the way that has been criticised recently by a British consumer report as being hypocritical, because the unit of money is called the same although it is three times larger.</P>
    <P>If I see that something is priced at 6p I say to myself that that is right, but, of course, that price is 2.4 times more than the price I regard as right. Everybody is making that same mistake at present.  In that sense we are all too quiescent.  We are quiescent about prices because during the period <Col N="1792" /> of the most rapid price rise we have been too occupied with the problems of the North and with the closeness of our decision with regard to the EEC.  People were diverted also by the continuing political crises in this part of the country.  I now paraphrase one of the heavyweight boxers of the past who replied when told that boxing was a hard life &ldquo;every clout has a silver lining&rdquo;.  In regard to the Government every clout had a silver lining in the past year because people were distracted.  Between the problems in the North, the crisis here, EEC and decimalisation people have been quiet too long about the debasing of their wages and the debasing of the incomes of the old people and of the lowering of the standard of living of the small farmers.</P>
    <P>Because of the factors I have mentioned people have not been sufficiently angered and have not reacted with demonstrations and otherwise against price rises.  We must look at this Bill in that light.  People are expected to believe that something significant in regard to prices will happen as a result of this Bill.  I do not propose to enter into a discussion about what influences a mixed economy like ours.  If we wanted a filibuster this would be a suitable subject on which to have one because I, like others, could talk relevantly for hours on this subject.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one aspect which seems important and about which the Bill is silent.  Our economy depends to an enormous extent on exporting and also on importing.  A large percentage of what we purchase is manufactured outside this country.  We probably have the most open economy in Europe.  We are most open in our economy to the UK, with which we have a free trade agreement.  One can read in <i>The Economist</i> any week the tables showing the rises in Britain's export prices as compared with a month ago, a year ago or even a week ago.  One will see that prices have gone up by about 9 per cent.  That is striking because it is the same as the rate of our inflation.  What Britain exports is what we import at prices which have risen by 9 per cent.  No legislation like this Bill can have any effect on the price of stock <Col N="1793" /> delivered at the docks.  Inflation is being imported in a way that cannot be controlled.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we should have free trade.  We are not yet fit for free trade with the EEC.  It is no pleasure for me to say that these are the factors which cause our inflation.  An economist could establish how much of a price increase is the result of wage claims, Government borrowing, the taxation policy and import prices.  We have no influence over prices of goods delivered to our borders.</P>
    <P>If our economy was a closed economy like that of the US measures like this would be of some benefit, but they are not of any use in our open economy.  I mean that as a fundamental criticism of this Bill, if we are to believe it would have anything other than a marginal influence.  We import inflation particularly since we have the misfortune to import so much from Britain.  Britain has had astronomical rises in prices of exports.  The Minister in introducing this Bill spoke about something that looks interesting&mdash;the right to control price increases for imported products.  It looked as if we were facing up to the problems.  Under the Bill wholesalers would be required to give advance notice about any intention to increase the margin which they take on goods in which they deal. That is not much help.  If an importer can mark-up the goods by 20 per cent he only has to follow the import prices in order to increase the amount of his mark-up in £s.  He does not have to increase his percentage.  If he bought goods at £100 he could sell them at £120 but if the goods go up to £200 he could sell them at £240 which would give him extra money for himself. His profit can go up even if his rate of profit is frozen.  The Minister has no power to diminish this profit. He can see that the importer does not increase the rate of profit but that power is of very little use in terms of reducing prices.  It has no effect at all. It cannot reduce prices.  If the rate of profit of importers remains constant&mdash; and the Minister accepts in the Bill that it may do so without penalty&mdash; and if the delivery prices increase by 20 per cent the final prices will be <Col N="1794" /> increased by the same amount.  Since it is a percentage increase in absolute terms it is a bigger profit, but not a bigger rate of profit.  We could go on with this for hours.</P>
    <P>I would applaud the fact that the Bill proposes to extend the existing legislation to cover interest charges. This is a good thing.  At the moment interest charges are very low and seem like going lower still in the money markets of the world; 18 months ago, or less, in New York and London and in the other European markets interest charges were at an historical high.  We are part of the sterling area.  We have an open economy and we have no control over the price at which one can borrow money.  That is decided in London and London is influenced by New York.  We have no control over London or New York.  If interest rates go up again those who want to borrow from banks or building societies have a simple choice; they can pay the going rate or they can borrow and no legislation here will alter that one little bit because we have not got economic sovereignty.  If our interest rate drops by one half per cent below what it is in London, then the money will go to London.</P>
    <P>We have no control over interest rates and taking power will have no effect on interest rates.  If I could flap my arms quickly enough and strongly enough I could fly up to the Public Gallery this minute and there is no legislation to stop me doing that.  But no one has ever succeeded in flapping his arms hard enough and quickly enough to fly and taking power to control interest rates is just as irrelevant as taking power to stop people flying of their own volition.  One may control the enormous profit of some particular outfit.  There is little competition between different borrowing and lending sources and interest rates are not wildly out of line with London or other places.  What makes them high is not the extreme profiteering of some particular outfit and what determines interest rates has nothing to do with our economy and a small country like ours which wanted to lower interest rates would have to dam up its capital inside its own country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> It is provided in section 5 that the &ldquo;Acts shall apply in relation to interest charged and any other charges made under hire purchase agreements&rdquo;. I am not the greatest admirer of the market place.  I suppose I am one of the least admirers of it, but the existence of a market place ensures that nobody makes vast profits and this Bill will have no effect at all.  Let us not cod ourselves.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear my immediate predecessor being worried, as a professional man, about the powers the Minister is taking to control professional fees.  Section 2 (b) and (c) makes provision for charges for services wholly or partly of a professional character.  Deputy Enright is a practising solicitor.  I am a non-practising veterinary surgeon.  But I did practise at one time and I do not think Deputy Enright need worry.  No two bills for professional services, be they those of a doctor, a dentist, a veterinary surgeon, a solicitor, or anybody else, are identical because there is no flat rate and, even if there were, there could be slight additions, so that the section then has really no meaning.</P>
    <P>At column 1415 of the Official Report of 9th February the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Furthermore, trade union representatives have sometimes argued that while their members are required to negotiate increases in remuneration with employer bodies or through conciliation and arbitration machinery, some professional people are in a position to a large extent to achieve an increase in their remuneration without having to justify the need for the increase.  The present Bill, accordingly, proposes to give power to the Minister concerned to require advance notice to be given to him of proposed increases in professional fees, and where necessary, to control such fees.  The powers now proposed can be exercised even in cases where there may already be machinery of a kind in operation for the determination of professional fees.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not get any advance notice of this, except now and again, <Col N="1796" /> perhaps, from professional societies. The idea is all right, but it is not operable.  It may sound well in theory but it cannot be put into practice.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss the efforts made since the late 1950s to control incomes, but even in the United States of America they have not found it possible to control professional fees. It is easy to control wages and, possibly, prices.  It is very difficult to control profits and professional fees.  This Bill is nothing more than window dressing and this particular section need impress nobody.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of section 3 provides that the &ldquo;Acts shall apply in relation to new houses&rdquo;.  I shall not waste time teasing out all the arguments on this, but there are a number of inputs which determine the price of houses&mdash;the price of land, of materials and of labour.  If one is serious about controlling the final output of the building operation then one must control the price of the inputs and, if one does not do that, then one does not control the price of the final article.  I see no serious effort at controlling the price of land.  Indeed, I see no effort at all at doing so.  With regard to the price of labour, one can have an incomes policy, which will take a bit of persuading, or else the price of labour will be decided, as it is at present, in the market place.  Many of the materials used in modern housing are imported and one can do nothing about their price.  If the builders are told they can charge only a certain price, then they will stop building houses.  If the builders are not squeezed, then prices will go up.</P>
    <P>This power may exist on paper, but it means nothing and anybody who believes it does mean something, must be a little simple.  We have seen the sharpest rise in the price of houses in the UK in the past year.  Without bringing in documentation to prove it, it was certainly the sharpest in a long time.  This results from handing housing to a private sector.  A simple rule applies to the price of houses: if they are provided by the private sector, by the market, when there is a desperate demand and you can screw a lot of money out of people for them and <Col N="1797" /> they are very profitable, people rush into the business.  When demand for houses is nearly satisfied margins drop sharply and people stop building until the demand opens up again.  The market place is continually manipulating the price of houses to get as much money as possible from every section but they lean hardest on the poorest section, in the course of their striving to satisfy the need for houses.</P>
    <P>Anybody who does not want to interfere with that market place mechanism for house prices should not cod people with this sort of Bill.  &ldquo;The Act shall apply in relation to new houses...&rdquo; I have no doubt it will but the 1965 Act gave the Minister wide powers, to use his own words, to control prices.  I am interested only in powers that are meant to be, can be and actually are used.  This is not a power that has any meaning in our society in relation to the building industry.  It is just useful to brandish as evidence of good intention to control prices, nothing more, and it should be taken as window dressing.</P>
    <P>I want to pursue one example which, I think, indicates better than any other the inadequacies of this Bill and its unreality in regard to a real assault on price increases.  The amount of income people spend on the products of the big oil companies was not very important 50 years ago but it now is.  It is spent on fuel for motor cars and by farmers for necessary fuel for machinery and by transport operators and now people are also spending it on fuel for domestic heating in which there has been a great growth even among people who are not so rich. There is no competition in regard to the prices of these products in Ireland. There is one big British company which is Shell-Mex and BP and Burmah, which in many ways of looking at it, is a subsidiary.  There is Standard Oil, the Esso Group and Jet and there may be a few other little ones.  They work out the market among themselves and are able to determine the prices at which the product will be put into the country from outside.  They can determine delivery prices in discussions among themselves and once they do that we do not know the rate of profit on those <Col N="1798" /> prices.  The internal accounting devices of these big, multinational companies can successfully conceal the rate of profit.  The market is completely controlled by those people and the control exercised by three or four big multinationals will enable them to drive their own price regulations through any Act.</P>
    <P>Only one country that I know in the developed part of Europe has dealt realistically with this problem, and not by an Act but by breaking the monopoly through a co-operative.  The Swedish Oil Co-operative wrecked oil and petrol price-fixing.  There is no effort to tackle price-fixing by multinationals in this Bill.  I have quoted oil which is a particularly simple example as there are only three or four big cartels to deal with.  Incidentally, joining the EEC will not help us in this regard but the assertion of some economic sovereignty here in the Twenty-Six Counties, small as it is, would help, but until we face up to cartelisation in the market&mdash;I have instanced oil but it applies very widely&mdash;and until we face up to the accounting manipulations the multinationals can use to fiddle the price at the frontier we cannot approach a solution to this problem.  If they want a price rise they just deliver the oil dearer and if they do that this Bill can do nothing about it.  The price to the producer must go up.  So, in regard to the multinationals which control so much of our economy now, this Bill has no meaning, no validity.  I could document this argument in regard to other matters but it is a rather depressing and joyless exercise.  Whether it be imports which are mentioned, whether it is professional fees or interest rates you find when you read the small print the Bill does not purport to control them.  Yet, to the great Irish public at whom this will be brandished as a serious effort to show what we are doing about prices, it will appear that, yes, it has something about professional fees, the price of imports, interest rates and houses. There is something for everybody but none of it has any meaning.  None of it has any real impact on prices.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that these piddling <Col N="1799" /> extra powers are being taken by the Minister: it is better that he should have them than not.  They may be of some conceivable use in the future when you get a Government resolute enough to use them for the people's protection.  But let us not take this Bill as a serious contribution to controlling inflation in Ireland.  Control of that inflation with an open economy and without economic sovereignty is not in our hands.  Let us not play games on a serious issue with the population and deceive them into thinking that since our economy is so open we can have a significant impact on prices.  We are dealing in subterfuges.</P>
    <P>In fact, this is a bit of patronising of the public on a serious issue.  It says: &ldquo;What stupid people they are; they will take this as a serious effort.&rdquo;  It is contemptuous of their perception, knowledge and insight to believe that a bit of window dressing like that will make any difference.  It will not.  Since there is no serious effort in the Bill or anywhere else that I can see or any serious using of the 1958 and 1965 Acts to control prices, what we see, in fact, is inflation causing a deterioration in the real living standards of the poorer section of the community.</P>
    <P>I offer this to the Government to be distorted, taken out of context and used in any way they wish on future occasions and I know how dangerous it is in view of their cavalier way of dealing with what people say but, personally, I believe that an evolved, modern economy of our size must face the issue of an incomes policy.  It is very difficult and the Labour movement hate it because they see it is a trap.  I have said here that if somebody can show me where it has worked, I would have faith in it.  I cannot indicate anywhere it has worked.  Neither can I see the need to avoid doing it sooner or later if we are to have any sort of civilisation in our relationships in regard to prices and wages.  I offer that although it will be hurled back at me on some future occasion, preferably at election time when there is nobody there to explain exactly what I said. There is nothing in this Bill to indicate a serious effort at such a policy.  That <Col N="1800" /> policy must be real and has to go all the way across the board.  Little bits of window dressing such as this are merely depressing and until there is real effort at formulating a real policy produced by real discussions and until there is a consensus about that, the only way the weakest and poorest sections of the community can defend themselves is by getting more wages.</P>
    <P>Increased wages may be a minor contribution to inflation and to price rises but they are not the cause of inflation in our economy.  I would like to be able to say: &ldquo;Come on, fellows. Be sensible.  Hold off because all you are doing is hurting old people, widows or those on fixed incomes.&rdquo;  However, there is nothing in this Bill that is of a degree of seriousness that would induce me to urge any trade unionist or any section of organised labour to hold off.  Should they hold off in response to the window dressing in the Bill, all they will be doing is accepting a disimprovement in their already too-low standard of living.  I would like to see a serious Bill on this subject.  It is much better that prices be controlled by Parliament in a rational way rather than that they be controlled in a savage and disorganised way.  Until we have a real Bill on prices we will not be deceived by proposals of the kind now before us and we will not accept the seriousness of the Government's intention to control prices in the areas mentioned.</P>

      <P>With the introduction of this Bill it appears to me that we have reached the situation where this country is to be run by higher civil servants in so far as the Civil Service are to tell each businessman what he should or should not do.  I do not think the civil servants are either in a position to run or capable of running the country just as I am not capable of being a higher civil servant. If, ultimately, the Government are to employ everybody, let them do it now and absorb all of us into the Civil Service.  We are now to be dictated to by civil servants.  It is they who are to have the ideas on business.  In saying that I am not criticising any particular civil servant nor am I criticising any particular Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that <Col N="1801" /> prices marked on goods offered for sale should be inclusive of taxes.  I agree with that.  The position at the moment is that an article offered for sale in one shop may be marked £2, but the customer finds that this does not include tax, while in another shop the same article may be offered for £2, including tax.  I would advocate the Government insisting on labels being affixed to such items as cigarettes, for instance, indicating how much the Government were getting out of the total cost and how much was going to the wholesaler, the retailer and the manufacturer.  I would advocate also the inclusion of turnover tax in the prices stated.  If a person has a meal in an hotel or restaurant he may find that there are two additional charges, one of 10 per cent and one of 5 per cent added to a bill of, say, £2.  I wonder whether these charges are to be controlled. The Minister told us at page 3 of his speech that:</P>
    <P>A feature of trading at the importing, wholesale and retail levels is the adding on in many cases of a customary percentage mark-up on buying prices.  This practice, taken in conjuction with inflationary trends over the past number of years, can mean an increase in absolute margins to the trader concerned out of proportion to increases in his labour and overhead costs.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that when wages and costs increase a trader is only to be allowed add on those particular costs? If that is to be the case, there will be very few in business.  In 1932 if a person took a Ford 8 to the Mansion House and sold it for £100, his profit would have been £10, but, today, £10 would not be sufficient to pay a man to drive the car to an auction.  Let us not forget that under the 12 per cent increase some senior civil servants received as much as £800 extra.  If the Minister wishes to be fair to everybody, profit margins must be maintained in proportion to what they were in the previous year.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Keating said about the multinational companies. The Government are afraid to interfere with these companies while, <Col N="1802" /> at the same time, they hammer the Irishman who is in business in a small way.  Regarding insurance companies there were two Parliamentary questions addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as reported at column 1647 of the Official Report for Thursday, 10th February, 1972.  These questions and the Minister's reply were as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. Hogan asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the percentage increase in insurance premiums over the past year.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tully asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that insurance companies have increased the premiums for fire and public liability, <i>et cetera</i>, by over 100 per cent and if permission for each increase has been granted by him.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lalor: With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
    <P>Motor insurance premium rates are subject to my control, and I have authorised no increase in basic rates of premium during 1971.  I am aware that several companies have applied loadings to premium rates for certain categories of risk in the light of adverse experience but the loading varies widely from company to company and it would not be possible to estimate an overall percentage increase.</P>
    <P>There is to be no control of these big companies who can afford to build office blocks for which they can charge more than £2 per square foot now although the charge originally was 18s. They are able to pay any price for sites.  Some of these big companies are English and some are Irish in which the Minister for Finance has shares but they are not to be touched.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating made a very good point in relation to the oil companies. Mussolini committed some awful atrocities but he also did some good in Italy and I think it was during his time there that there was imposed a law whereby there was a minimum price that oil companies could charge. As Deputy Keating pointed out, they charged their prices internally and got <Col N="1803" /> their correct profit which looked all right but Mussolini would not accept that.  He forced them to charge a certain price.  The companies can make their profits in the country of origin.</P>
    <P>I know that petrol is taxed in most countries but we must consider the volume of business the large companies handle.  I am not saying that they make too much money because I do not know the facts but a serious effort should be made to find out the real profits of those large companies.  Some of the subsidiaries of British and American companies in this country are allowed to write off advertising against their profits.  A certain amount of advertising is carried out in Ireland but they can claim for an enormous campaign which they may have conducted in other countries.  In this way they get considerable tax relief.</P>
    <P>The causes for the increase in the cost of living are manifold&mdash;wages, increased prices and decimalisation, but the largest increase has been due to the introduction of turnover and wholesale taxes, particularly when those taxes are greater than the purchase tax in England.  There is a tremendous difference in the price of a car bought in the Republic of Ireland and that bought in the United Kingdom; I realise that some of the increase is due to the cost of assembly here but there is a very considerable Government tax also.  The cost of a Mini in the North of Ireland is £600 odd but the cost in the Republic is over £900&mdash;a difference of £300 on one of the smaller cars and the amount varies having regard to the price of the car.  The Minister has talked quite a lot but he has done nothing to try to get alternative jobs for the workers in the car assembly business.</P>
    <P>With regard to price control, if one investigated the books of a person who supplies goods to a hotel one would find that as tourism dwindles the volume of goods he supplies will decrease.  How can such a person get a fair increase in order to keep business going when his books are investigated and it is found that his deliveries to hotels and other establishments have decreased considerably?  The <Col N="1804" /> Minister and his Department delay about six months before they come to any decision and eventually they have to give the person concerned the increase involved and also payment for the period during which they delayed in making their decision.  When the millers looked for an increase they did not get it.  There was an inquiry set up and eventually they received their payment for the period during which they lost money.  There must be such compensation because otherwise firms will be bankrupt.</P>
    <P>The commission the Minister has set up is worthwhile, at least when compared with the Fair Trade Commission. On the latter there were three individuals selected to decide whether a person was getting too much profit or not enough profit.  I do not know how these people were selected.  On one commission with which I was concerned, there was only one out of the three people capable of doing the job.  What I could say about one of the members would be derogatory but everyone knew he was not capable of judging cases.</P>
    <P>A Minister or a civil servant may be quite an able businessman but this is the exception.  In fact, accountants and solicitors might be more highly educated than businessman but they have not the same flair for business; their job is to advise the businessman.  If one looks at the top companies in England quite frequently one finds that they are run by businessmen with the advice and help of solicitors and accountants. It might be asked how far the commission can control the prices of State and semi-State bodies, such as CIE and the ESB, of the health services as far as they affect the rates and post office charges.  All of these add to the costs incurred by the workers.</P>
    <P>With regard to our hotel business one of the biggest mistakes we made was that we concentrated on the provision of luxury hotels.  Admittedly, when comparing Grade A hotels in this country with a comparable grade in other countries one finds that our charges are quite cheap but most countries make their money on the medium-priced hotels because there are more customers in this category.  We have <Col N="1805" /> not done this.  Are we going to wait for Bord Fáilte to grade the hotels and then control the prices?  How are we going to grade and operate the various charges for bed, food, drink and so on?</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating referred to the necessity of finding out the cause of the enormous price of houses.  I believe that it is possible to do this.  He pointed out that all taxes, including turnover tax, must be included in the price advertised. While I disagree with Deputy Cooney in regard to control of old houses, because it is practically impossible as there would be so many ways of getting around it, I believe that in the case of the sale of new houses the advertisement should include the square footage: for example, a house costing £5,000 would be advertised as having 1,100 square feet.  What happens now is that the customer inspects a house and sees some trellis work, a nice piece of wrought iron or the addition of a small hall which makes the house look that much bigger.  However, it is an inferior house in size, costing more money than one up the road.  The purchasers are usually newly-married couples who have been saving for a few years.  They want a home and if the house looks nice they will not notice that it is smaller by, say, 100 square feet.  It should be compulsory for the builder to advertise the square footage of the house.</P>
    <P>Of course, as Deputy Keating and other Deputies have said, the price of land is a great difficulty.  One may say that the Minister could bring in price control and say: &ldquo;You may sell land at no more than £2,000 an acre&rdquo; but if a man is in a company and owns the land he can get around that without any trouble.  The only way to bring down the price of land in cities like Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway, or even in a place like Abbeyleix, is to service more land.  In Dublin, for instance, the land should be serviced for two or three miles beyond where it is required within the next ten years. In that way there will be cheaper land and cheaper houses.</P>
    <P>In the last number of years there has been control of money in the sense that money could be obtained from banks or insurance companies for exports, <Col N="1806" /> or for some priority businesses like building.  Irish Life, which is practically a Government company, have done a tremendous amount in this connection. They have given money to builders who have built up land banks all over Dublin, Cork and other cities. If builders had not got this money they could buy only two or three years ahead, and the land outside that area would be that much cheaper.  With this money on which they can make big capital profits they but ten years ahead.  I would say that, apart from small pockets of land which are owned by other builders, about 20 individuals own most of the serviced land around Dublin.  The fact that money was made available so readily put up the price of land which, in turn, led to an increase in the price of houses.</P>
    <P>I agree with those speakers who referred to the difficulty of controlling professional fees.  Some ten or 12 years ago an operation was done on a stallion worth a couple of hundred thousand pounds and which lived and eventually produced more foals.  The veterinary surgeon who performed that operation got a cheque for £20,000. How would you control that if no other man could do the operation?</P>
    <P>How can barristers' fees be controlled? I remember a case in the late twenties in which a big English company wrote to a famous solicitor here, Arthur Cox, and stated they wanted the best counsel.  They got three of the best counsel at the time and the solicitor requested a certain fee for the services rendered.  He got a wire back: &ldquo;I said employ the best counsel.&rdquo;  They were too cheap.  How do you control this?  A good solicitor will do the work properly.  There will be no risks and no mistakes.  A man will crib if he has to pay £1 to a bad solicitor but he is prepared to pay a good solicitor well.</P>
    <P>However, there is one practice in relation to solicitors which I would like to see stopped, that is, when a solicitor gets into property and when a client requires him to take a case he will say to the client: &ldquo;I do not want your case because you cost me time, and that costs me money.  I will get only £20 or £30 from you for two days work whereas in my office for less work <Col N="1807" /> I get more money.&rdquo;  This is happening in many solicitors' offices and I disagree with it.  Another point about controlling solicitors' fees is that a person may go to a solicitor for advice and if his fees are limited the solicitor may say: &ldquo;You should get a barrister.&rdquo;  Therefore two of them get a cut out of it and it will cost the client more.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of accountancy.  As Deputy Keating said, no case an accountant will do is the same as another.  Cost accountants, I believe, are very scarce and people will pay any money to get one.  Tax experts also command substantial fees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney referred to Irish Distillers paying £120,000 for 65 acres in Midleton.  This is a smallish town compared to the city from which Irish Distillers came.  They wanted a big area and they were probably taking the last 65 acres of serviced land in the place.  Here again there is a shortage of serviced land.  All these prices would come down if the Government could provide the money to service these areas.  At the moment a site for a semidetached house with normal-sized front and back gardens, depending on the area, will cost between £1,700 and £2,500.  In 1964 it would cost between £350 and £400.  This is where a great deal of the money is going.</P>
    <P>If a businessman is advised by the Minister or his Department that he must cut back on his prices and if he goes broke at the end of the year, has he any comeback on the Government? He may have been running his business perfectly.  Can he take any action against the Government?  I know many businessmen who brought in efficiency experts from London.  One big printing works brought them in. They told them how to run their business. They did what they were advised to do and within a year they had to change back to their old system. These experts are not the greatest things on earth either.</P>
    <P>A businessman running a business or an importer running an import agency starts off at the beginning of the year by working out his overheads. Nine times out of ten, if he is a businessman at all, he owes the bank <Col N="1808" /> money or he owes somebody money. Suddenly there is a big wage demand or a big increase in overheads&mdash;if he is in the haulage business the price of petrol may go up, or CIE charges may go up&mdash;and he finds that he has misjudged the situation.  He is not allowed to increase his prices.  He is then in trouble with his bank manager and his bank manager has to face his directors.  How will the Minister and his advisers look on that?  Are people allowed to get 10 per cent or 12 per cent on their investments, or on what their property is worth, or will they be told they bought the property in 1922 for £2,000 and if they make £300 now that is sufficient because it is over 10 per cent?  If you do not pay out the proper dividend and if you hold on to the money you are bought out.  Somebody takes you over.  If you do not make sufficient money on what your property is worth it will be bought and sold and the profit will be kept.</P>
    <P>We must have some idea of what percentage a businessman will be allowed so that he will know that if he goes for that figure it cannot be objected to until he has been heard by the commission.  Can we control all businesses fairly?  The Minister said that the professions should be controlled. Can all the luxury trades be controlled?  Can the sale of furs be controlled?  This does not matter to the normal working person who is not buying them but what happens if they can make huge profits and if they can pay a wage which will react down the line?  If you want controls everything must be controlled.  How can anyone going into business have control on himself or be controlled by the Government if he does not know what business he will do and what his overheads will be?  Even if he has been in business for a period he does not know what next year will bring.</P>
    <P>How could the hoteliers know two years ago that they would be in trouble this year and probably worse trouble next year?  To control prices in advance is unbusinesslike, impractical and wrong.  I am not looking for extra prices, extra charges, extra costs or inflation for any business but, if prices go up, there should be some system <Col N="1809" /> of taxation on exorbitant profits.  There should be an equalisation tax or a surtax. The abnormal profit should be taken back in whole or in part.  This would tend to prevent people from trying to get an exorbitant profit at the start.</P>
    <P>To control prices before rather than after the money is made is wrong in another way.  I will probably have to exaggerate this argument to a certain extent to make my point.  If a businessman could sell a product manufactured in Ireland for 2d and could sell it on the export market for 1s, should the Minister control it at 2d?  This would affect our balance of payments.  If he had to charge 2d in Ireland the people buying it on the export market could buy it retail in Ireland and export it. If a manufacturer is making big money on exporting an article he is setting a headline and he is picking the best men for his industry.</P>
    <P>The only way to control prices is to tax the person who has made too much money by putting up prices too much.  To tax a man before he knows what he will make is wrong.  While the hoteliers may have made a profit last year, this year if the tourist market fails, as the papers have intimated that it will fail, they will suffer a great loss. If the cancellations are as great as the papers have said in Dún Laoghaire a loss of 1,000 is expected and a loss of 2,000 people who were coming for a function is expected in some other place.  This will have some repercussions here.  If a hotel, instead of working at 100 per cent in the summer is down to 70 per cent, it means that all the wholesalers supplying the hotel will do the same number of deliveries but will only deliver 70 per cent of what they delivered the previous year. I hope we do not end up with the country being run by civil servants who tell businessmen and professional men how to run their business or profession. Very often these top civil servants, and the Minister, might have sons and daughters in these professions too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be said that the House generally has welcomed this Bill.  One could even go far as to <Col N="1810" /> say, with a specific exception in relation to one aspect of the control of professional services, that it was very much welcomed.  On the other hand, a number of Deputies said that it was a case of closing the stable door when the horse was gone but as the arguments developed each of the Deputies who opened with that remark found advantages in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan, who opened for the Fine Gael Party, said clearly that he was in favour of the Bill.  He also pointed out that price control in relation to a number of articles that are sold on the retail market, particularly wearing apparel and various other things, is almost impossible.  Deputy Belton also outlined difficulties of that nature.  This Bill has run into more criticism from the point of view of its proposals to enable me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to extend the net of service control.  It has been criticised from this aspect by a number of Deputies who spoke.</P>
      <P>The Bill was criticised in that it did not spell out in detail the steps I or any Minister, to whom the right of control might be transferred, could take.  In fact, it is a natural development that Deputies contributing to this debate should point out that the Bill did not explain this, that or the other, or that I, when introducing the Bill, had not gone into detail as to how I intended to control the price of new houses or how the Minister for Justice would effectively control the fees of solicitors or members of the legal profession. I said specifically in my introductory remarks that the control of new houses would be exercised by the Minister for Local Government and that the functions in this regard would be transferred to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not normal to write into a Bill the manner of exercising powers taken under the Bill.  In this Bill, in fact, I am proposing to take power to control the prices of almost all commodities and a wide variety of services.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Enright, who went through the Bill pretty exhaustively, despite the fact that the he dealt with a number of matters which might not specifically arise on it, overlooked the fact that I was, in section 2 (1) (d), <Col N="1811" /> taking power to deal with charges for services rendered in connection with insurance.</P>
    <P>Even Deputy Keating, who was extremely critical of the Bill in so far as he described it as being ineffective to a great extent, compared it with the curate's egg in so far as he suggested that it was good in parts.  He still did not seem to assess the value of the Bill in certain respects, certainly from the point of view of claiming that the Minister had no power to reduce the rate of profit by an importer of any imported article.  When he was dealing specifically with our open economy he claimed that the cost of living cannot be controlled when we are importing articles that we are using in our daily lives and that, in fact, we are suffering from the inflation which affects other countries.</P>
    <P>He went out of his way specifically to say that if there was some article imported here for £100 and if the mark-up was £20, that is 20 per cent, and if the imported price of that article were to increase to £200 automatically the 20 per cent increase would carry over on to that a straightforward profit margin of £40 and that the Minister had no power under this Bill to control it.  The fact is under section 4 (a) I have this power and not alone the power to prevent that from occurring but the power actually to effect a reduction. When I moved the Second Stage of this Bill I specifically mentioned that I was taking this power to control the margin of profit by importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Possibly the best way to reply to this debate and to be as fair as possible and as exhaustive as possible in my reply is to go into the points made by the various speakers during the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>As usual Deputy Donegan, leading for the Opposition, took a rational view of this and having come out initially in favour of the Bill went on to criticise various aspects of the administration of price control as it has been effected up to now.  He did say, however, that as he saw it price control on professional fees might have the effect of increasing charges and instanced charges like <Col N="1812" /> those of doctors and vets and legal fees. I think he arrived at this conclusion by reason of the fact that he assumed that in any sort of investigation that would be carried out any of those professional people might be able to establish that they were entitled to more than their standard basic fee at present.  I know he was not even visualising the type of situation which Deputy Belton mentioned in justifying the non-application of any sort of control on the vet from the point of view of the value of the animal that he might be dealing with.  Deputy Donegan said that the operation of price control on services was a step forward but he doubted if it would be 100 per cent successful.  He went on to say that it might well result in an increase in the cost of services.  One can say that but, taking into consideration the contributions of Deputies T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan), Cooney, Enright and Esmonde, the general feeling from a professional point of view seems to be one of fear of the effective operation of the powers to be taken under this Bill.  I find the reaction from those representatives of the professional people quite encouraging in so far as it appears that the legislation will certainly be effective from that point of view.  Deputy Donegan said:</P>
    <P>It would be quite unfair to expect a working man to accept that he must pay a certain price for a certain article or accept a certain emolument for his services while at the same time those in the higher income group are not expected to accept the same stricture upon their incomes.</P>
    <P>That covers to quite an extent the objections raised by the representatives of the professions.  Deputy Donegan also said:</P>
    <P>I am glad that services are included in this Bill.  There is no objection to it.</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>I do not want to criticise the legal side in any way except to say that that problem may exist.</P>
    <P>This was the problem of the variation of work of solicitors and the manner in which they can be compensated for this work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1813" /> I have said already that Deputy Donegan is usually pretty fair in his criticism but when he spoke about the manner in which I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, dealt with the application for the increase in the price of flour I thought he was a little bit less than accurate.  He said I had prevented an increase in the price of flour for political reasons.  I quote:</P>
    <P>I will not comment further on why the flour millers have a permanent staff working on their cost increases. I will only say that information was presented to the Government that the industry was losing £26,000 per week and nothing was done.  By-elections were pending in Longford/ Westmeath and in Kildare.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donegan said that flour was one of these political things and that it never suited the Government to have an increase.  I admit frankly to that but I think Deputy Donegan stressed more than once the fact that the flour millars are in a monopoly situation and when you have people in a monopoly situation you have to deal with them more closely because they have not got the normal run of competitiveness that some other industrialists have. They have to be watched more than other firms that would be dealing competitively. Deputy Donegan said more than once that the flour millers have a permanent staff working on cost increases. I agree.  It is one of the reasons why any application from the flour millers' organisation, backed with all the data that their accountants can produce, needs to be examined extremely carefully.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donegan spoke about my proposal to take power to watch the mark-up on buying prices. He said the percentage mark-up is <Col N="1815" /> not wrong in itself.  I conceded that in my opening remarks when I said that the recent inflationary trends have automatically increased charges to such an extent that in certain cases they may now be out of proportion.  What I mean is that in the normal course the marking up is quite rational, the percentage mark-ups bearing a relation to the proportion of cost increases, but I am thinking particularly of Deputy Keating's point in relation to imported articles.  I should have had powers to ensure that there was not an increased profit taken by way of mark-up on imported articles but I had not power effectively to move in to reduce mark-ups.  I was frustrated in efforts to control this in the past couple of years since I became Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I found that if I wanted to tackle problems of this nature I had not the power to do so under either the 1958 Act or the 1965 Act.  This is one of the advantages I see in this legislation.</P>
      <P>In objecting to interference with the percentage mark-up, Deputy Donegan gave an instance of somebody importing Italian fashion hats or French perfume and he said there could be a profit of 150 per cent on the hats and 300 per cent on the perfume.  He also said that such cases were not of such number as should interest the Minister.  Even if the incidence is not great, the principle is there, and I should have power to act in regard to such matters, particularly such non-essential articles as were identified by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another criticism by Deputy Donegan was that there was too much delay between the time an application was lodged for a price increase and the time of a decision by the Department. When I set up the NPC I accepted this situation and indicated <Col N="1816" /> there should not be any more than a month between the application and the sanctions.  The NPC are at present operating under those terms of reference. If they are not satisfied with any specific application for a price increase they can, of course, delay it further but at the present time we are operating on the month period.  In the three reports we have in front of us, only three applications have been held up to any degree.  Deputy Donegan went on to say that smaller increases should be given more often.  Of course there is no reason why, if an application is not made for an increase, the Minister should sanction an increase.  Manufacturers do not want a series of increases. The Deputy might have been thinking about the millers' application.</P>

      <P>Sometimes when manufacturers get sanction for price increases they do not effect them for two or three months because it does not suit their business.  I must confess that the long hold up 12 months ago from the time I became Minister to the time I set up the NPC did harm a number of our manufacturers.  This is one of the advantages of being able to have the NPC to look objectively at all applications and at the same time introduce the arrangement whereby application would not be delayed for more than a month.  Deputy O'Connell spoke about our ability to hold up applications for such longer periods. He suggested a type of price freeze for a three-month period.  He was unmindful of the problems that exist from the point of view of the manufacturers.</P>
