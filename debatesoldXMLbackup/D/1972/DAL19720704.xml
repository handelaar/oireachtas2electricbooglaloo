      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the progress, if any, made at the recent meeting in Luxembourg towards the creation of an adequate EEC regional policy to benefit the more underdeveloped countries of the enlarged EEC; and if any area of agreement was reached between Ireland's representatives at that meeting and the EEC Commission on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Ten in Luxembourg on 26th June which was one of a series being held to prepare for the summit meeting planned for next October.  Decisions on the substance of the subjects which are being proposed for the summit agenda will be a matter for the heads of State or Government of the Ten.  One such subject is economic and monetary union and we and other countries have been pressing that the development of a comprehensive regional policy for the Community shall form an integral part of the discussions and decisions at the summit on this subject.</P>
      <P>There is no question, in the context of the preparatory meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Ten or the summit meeting, of agreements being reached between this country and the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach tell us what position on the agenda <Col N="484" /> was given to regional policy?  Was it given a high position or a low position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no agenda at all yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in believing that the purpose of this Foreign Ministers' meeting was to settle the agenda for the summer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the heads of State or Government will settle the agenda.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To prepare for the summit meeting and to discuss the kind of subjects that ultimately the heads of State or Government will agree upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is mystifying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite straightforward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will not get away with this &ldquo;smart Alec&rdquo; attitude.  His colleague wanted to know at what point of priority in the agenda regional policy would come.  I said that was not settled and that they were discussing subjects for the agenda so that the heads of State or Government would settle ultimately what the agenda would be.  That is quite clear.  Surely preparatory meetings are necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has protested officially to the British Government against the proposal to hold a plebiscite on the subject of partition in the Six County area.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in the event of the British Government proceeding with the declared intention to hold a plebiscite confined to the Six County area on the subject of partition, he will arrange that a plebiscite on the same subject will be held in this part of the country on the same date so that the democratic will of the Irish nation may be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the British Government have not finally committed themselves to having a plebiscite about the Border in the North at any particular time.  The Government's views on this subject have been fully explained to the British Government. If and when a plebiscite is held, the Government will consider the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the so-called Whitelaw initiatives, have the Government made any official protest against the suggestion of a plebiscite being held?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's views were conveyed to the British Government immediately after Mr. Heath made the announcement of his initiatives on 24th March, repeated frequently since then, and repeated no later than the end of last week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that, though one may well question the timing of such a plebiscite, the principle of reunion with the consent of a majority in Northern Ireland, to which, I think, all parties here are committed, does imply the consultation of the people of Northern Ireland in this matter at some appropriate time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that it was the accepted policy and outlook of all parties in this House that an issue of this nature should not be decided by a section of our people.  It is an issue that will affect the development of our entire country.  I understood that to be the policy of the Deputy's party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that reunion can and should only come with the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated frequently that we must get the consent of all the people of Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach agrees that an artificially selected area cannot be regarded as a justifiable unit for decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely. That is the point I was trying to make with the Deputy's colleague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that in the event of the British Government proceeding, we in the Twenty-six Counties would authorise a plebiscite to take place at the same time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my original answer.  I said that if and when such a plebiscite is held the Government would consider the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that with Northern Ireland in a state of incipient sectarian civil war, as is the case at the moment, talk of an all-Ireland plebiscite on partition is simply adding fuel to those flames?  Would the Taoiseach further agree that his own recent speech on his recognised right to have a say in tripartite talks and his Foreign Affairs article urging immediate moves in the direction of unity are also adding fuel to those flames?  Would he agree also that, granted the menacing situation in Northern Ireland now, we here should at least refrain from making matters worse by insisting on having our own way, whatever the cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has taken out of context parts of speeches and articles I have written.  I have always advocated reconciliation.  I believe a plebiscite would not be reconciliatory now but would be divisive. That is my opinion.  It would polarise, rather than bring people together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach doubted the possibility of a plebiscite being held.  There seems to be little doubt about that.  Would the Taoiseach agree that in the event of a plebiscite being held we should spell out on this side here, far from simply basing our line on saying that we desire unity, what the content of that unity should be in constitutional and <Col N="488" /> economic terms, because the people who may be taking part in this plebiscite in Northern Ireland know nothing about our particular desires in the matter of unity?  If the plebiscite is held, would it not be more constructive on this side that the Government here should spell out economic and constitutional implications of unity, so that any Unionists, few and all as they are, who might be interested in this plebiscite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the democratic decision of the Irish people should be ascertained so as to confirm the decision of the people in 1918?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have indicated adequately to the Deputy the mind of the Government.  There is no point in going back over matters that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>We can take it the Government decision will be to hold a referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only indicating we are keeping the situation under review.  I just want to say that a plebiscite in the North of Ireland on a matter like this is not realistic politics in terms of Anglo-Irish relations at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The net health expenditure by health authorities recognised for State grant purposes&mdash; including transfer payments to the household sector but excluding capital expenditure&mdash;expressed as a percentage of gross national product at current market prices was as follows: 1969-70, 3.4 per cent; 1970-71, 3.8 per cent and 1971-72, 4 per cent.  Figures of public expenditure on health services for recent years are not available for all the countries mentioned in the question. The most recent statistics applicable to all these countries are those contained in <i>The Cost of Social Security, 1964-66</i> published by the International Labour Office.  I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement, prepared from the data in this publication, showing total public expenditure on medical care as a percentage of the gross national product at current market prices for each of the countries mentioned.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of a report which was drawn up by members of the North Eastern Health Board regarding the serious overcrowding in the wards and dayrooms in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee, County Louth; if his Department will investigate this matter; and if he will indicate the present situation with regard to overcrowding and lack of space that exists in mental hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The report referred to in the question was not submitted to my Department.  In the period 1958 to 1971 (31st December) the number of patients in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee, County Louth, had fallen from 420 to 363.  The latter figure has since been reduced to 331 (30th June) consequent on the opening of a day centre and hostel at Drogheda and a hostel at Dundalk.  The health board hopes to provide additional hostel accommodation and thus reduce the overcrowding problem still further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I announced in the course of my speech on the Estimate for my Department, I have recently directed that in the capital building programme, greater emphasis should be placed on the provision of short stay psychiatric units in general hospitals, staffed by specially qualified nurses, which was one of the principal recommendations of the Commission on Mental Illness. Six such units had already been provided and no less than 15 further units will now be provided.  Two of these are mentioned in the statement circulated to Deputies while provision for 13 further units has been made but siting and other details have to be investigated before positive decisions <Col N="492" /> can be taken in the case of some of these projects.</P>
    <P>Since 1958, when the patient population totalled 20,046, there has been a successive reduction in the patient population of our psychiatric hospitals until at the end of 1971 the total was 14,922.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the provision of short stay units will ensure the continuance of this downward trend, and help to reduce the overcrowding which, unfortunately, still persists in some mental hospitals despite the overall reduction of 25.5 per cent in the patient numbers.</P>

Over a number of years we have campaigned actively in the United Nations for an end to all nuclear tests, and at the last session of the General Assembly we co-sponsored a resolution on the urgent need for the suspension of nuclear and thermo-nuclear tests.  At the recent Stockholm Conference on Human Environment Ireland's delegation supported a resolution condemning all nuclear weapons tests, especially those carried out in the atmosphere.  Therefore the position of Ireland in relation to nuclear testing is well known and is clearly known to the French Government, but I did not think it would serve any useful purpose to protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change in circumstances which would warrant the establishment of a harbour authority at Bantry Bay.  A very full and comprehensive explanation why a harbour authority should not be set up was conveyed to the county council in a letter from my Department dated 2nd April, 1969.  For the information of Deputies, I propose to circulate a copy of that letter with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the letter:</P>
      <P Just="Right">2 Aibreán, 1969.</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>1.  I am directed by the Minister for Transport and Power to refer to your letter of the 13th March, 1969, conveying the resolution of your Council that this Department's letter of the 18th October, 1968, on the subject of the establishment of a Harbour Authority for Bantry Bay be referred back for further consideration and enclosing an extract from the minutes of the quarterly meeting of the Council held on the 17th February, 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  I should refer in the first instance to the statement in the minutes attributed to the County Manager in regard to applications <Col N="495" /> made by the Council at various dates before the emergence of the Gulf Oil project to have a Harbour Authority at Bantry.  These applications were related to the Council's repudiation on legal advice of responsibility for dredging the approaches to Bantry Pier.  The Council applied for a grant to meet the cost of necessary dredging and subsequently to have Bantry established as a scheduled harbour.  The application for a grant was refused because, <i>inter alia,</i> it was normal maintenance expenditure which should be met from revenue and it was suggested that, though the Council could not be required to carry out the dredging, they were not precluded from doing so.  In fact, the Council subsequently met the expense of dredging the approaches to the Pier.  The Council were also informed that the establishment of a scheduled Harbour in relation to Bantry Pier would be contrary to the intentions of the Harbours Acts and that the existing and potential trade of the Pier would not provide sufficient revenue for a scheduled Harbour Authority to discharge its statutory obligations. The correspondence with the Council on these matters prior to the emergence of the Gulf Oil project related solely to Bantry Pier and its approaches and there was no question of establishing a Harbour Authority for the Bay or of the development of the Bay as such.</P>
    <P>3.  Since the Gulf Oil project at Bantry Bay was first announced, there has been criticism by the Council and others of the absence of a Harbour Authority to control the Bay.  It has been argued that there was need for such an Authority to prevent oil pollution, to ensure safety of navigation and to develop the potential of the Bay for other projects requiring the availability of sheltered deep water. The main criticism, however, has been that the absence of such an authority means a substantial loss of revenue to the country by way of harbour dues from Gulf Oil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> 4.  When Gulf Oil first approached the Department of Transport and Power and the Industrial Development Authority in January, 1966, they had been engaged in surveying a number of possible sites in this country and outside it for their proposed bulk transhipment terminal. Subject to further examination of the physical and economic aspects of the proposal and the requirements of Irish law and regulations, they had narrowed their choice on Bantry Bay.  They made official contacts at that stage in order to explore the possibility of obtaining grants and to ascertain the legal and other requirements with which they would have to comply.  Because of the nature of the project, including the small permanent employment involved, and the likelihood that the availability of a grant would not be a determining factor in the Company's decision, it made clear at once that no grants would be available but that a commercial rent would be chargeable in respect of any State foreshore required for the terminal.  On the other hand, it was considered that the siting of the terminal at Bantry Bay would be a worthwhile development in that area, provided satisfactory arrangements could be secured for safety of navigation, prevention of oil pollution and preservation of amenities.  Moreover, apart from the permanent employment given, there would be considerable temporary employment afforded by the construction of the terminal and the regular calls of tankers should be of significant value to Bantry and the surrounding area.  It was also a consideration that the existence of the terminal would incidentally provide within our territory very substantial additional oil storage capacity and a large stock of crude oil.  There was finally the possibility that the location of the terminal at Bantry might encourage further industrial development in the area.  It was decided, therefore, to encourage the Company to locate their terminal at Bantry Bay subject to the necessary safeguards being agreed.</P>
    <P>5.  The Company were, therefore, <Col N="497" /> given all necessary information as to the requirements they would have to meet under the Planning Acts, the Oil Pollution Acts, the Petroleum Acts and other relevant legislation. It was made clear to them in particular that arrangements for preservation of amenities and prevention of oil pollution would have to be made to the satisfaction of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>6.  The necessity for a Harbour Authority received very careful expert examination in the Department and the conclusion was reached that the satisfactory operation of the terminal at Whiddy Island did not require the intervention of a Harbour Authority.  Pilotage was unnecessary and enforcement of other requirements relating to safety, prevention of oil pollution etc. could be effectively secured by the Department of Transport and Power, the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the Local Authorities.  The attitude of Gulf Oil was that while they had no objection in principle to the establishment of a Harbour Authority and to the payment of dues in respect of the services rendered by such a body, the whole project was only marginally economic and there could be no question of substantial payments being made over and above what would be justified to defray the cost of the necessary facilities and services which they would expect a Harbour Authority to provide.  The Company were informed that the terminal and adjacent waters would not fall within the jurisdiction of any existing harbour authority and that, therefore, no dues would fall to be paid.  On the other hand, the Minister for Transport and Power reserved the right to set up a Harbour Authority at a later stage if that proved to be necessary or desirable.  In these circumstances, Gulf Oil would be expected to provide at their own expense the facilities and services which they would normally expect to obtain from a Harbour Authority in return for dues.  It is necessary to remember that this attitude was taken before Gulf Oil made their final choice of Bantry Bay and was, <Col N="498" /> therefore, one of the factors influencing that decision.  It would not now be in accordance with the understanding on which the project was located at Bantry Bay to set up a Harbour Authority unless there was a real need for it.</P>
    <P>7.  Apart from the willingness and otherwise of Gulf Oil to pay harbour dues there could be no question under existing harbour legislation of extracting substantial profit revenue from the Company through the medium of a statutory Harbour Board.  Under the Harbours Acts, Harbour Authorities are public nonprofit making bodies whose revenues must be devoted to the purposes of their harbours and whose scales of charges must be approved by the Minister for Transport and Power.  Comparisons have been made with the dues charged at Milford Haven in Wales.  There has been considerable development at Milford Haven where there is a large number of users.  The funds are devoted to the purposes of the harbour including the dredging of deep water for the larger vessels now coming into use.  There is no diversion of funds to national or local revenue.  Dues are applied for the present and future benefit of the users.  Gulf Oil have provided their own private harbour at their sole expense.  They are paying a substantial rent in respect of the State foreshore they occupy and pay substantial rates to the local authority.  There are no grounds for the charging of dues to them in respect of services which they provide for themselves and are not required by other users.  If a harbour authority is set up at a later stage the approved scale of charges will have to take account of the expenditure already incurred by Gulf Oil in the provision of harbour facilities.</P>
    <P>8.  As regards further development of the potential at Bantry Bay it is necessary to examine what this potential may, in fact, be and what measures, if any, are likely to attract additional users to the Bay. A number of exaggerated claims have been made largely because <Col N="499" /> Bantry Bay is erroneously compared as regards its natural features with developed ports elsewhere.  The incidence of deep water and shelter is not unique to Bantry Bay either in Ireland or elsewhere in Europe.  The Bay was only one of a number of possible locations examined by Gulf Oil and the Company's second choice would not have been in Ireland. The siting of Harbours has never been determined principally by natural features but by the needs of the traffics they serve.  Where commercial needs require it, deep water harbours have been provided in the most unpromising situations. Rotterdam, the greatest port in Europe, has few natural advantages but sits astride one of the world's great trade routes.  Many existing British and European Harbours have announced development schemes to enable them to accept vessels of up to 250,000 tons dead weight and upwards and plans have been mooted for the provision of terminals to deal with vessels up to 500,000 tons at undeveloped sites in the Clyde and at Foulness at the mouth of the Thames.  Plans to meet the requirements of the largest ore containers now in use or on order have been undertaken or announced by the principal European ports.</P>
    <P>9.  In the particular case of Gulf Oil, the adoption of the bulk transhipment principle and the selection of the site at Bantry Bay was largely determined by the particular pattern of their refineries and markets in Europe.  The Company have a number of relatively small refineries with limited markets, for which deliveries from the largest tankers, even if the necessary depth were available, would not be economic or convenient.  They adopted this system of transhipment in order to maintain their competitiveness with companies who were planning to deliver direct to refineries with vessels of 200,000 tons dead weight and upwards.  The system of bulk transhipment has no universal validity and none of the other oil companies have given any indications <Col N="500" /> of adopting it.  Most of them have committed themselves to large fleets of 200,000/250,000 ton tankers for direct shipment to refineries. Neither is there any indication that a bulk transhipment system may be adopted in connection with the supply of ore or other bulk cargo to Europe.</P>
    <P>10.  It will be seen, therefore, that the prospects of further development at Bantry Bay based on its natural advantages are, in the light of present knowledge, very limited and certainly not of a kind which would warrant substantial speculative investment. On the other hand, in these days of rapid technological change, the possibility of further desirable development in the Bay cannot be ruled out and the Government is anxious to encourage development of the right kind there. If any projected development requires the establishment of a Harbour Authority the necessary steps can be taken without delay.  It cannot be assumed, however, that such further development can be secured without Government grant or assistance as in the case of Gulf Oil and it will most certainly not be secured by transparent attempts to extract profit revenue from Gulf Oil under the guise of harbour dues.</P>
    <P>11.  The possibility of damage arising from oil pollution at Bantry Bay was one of the principal factors which were carefully examined before the project was approved.  This matter was the subject of a Press Release issued by the Department of Transport and Power on the 28th October, 1968, which dealt comprehensively with the problem and with the steps taken to obviate the danger. Briefly, the main danger of oil pollution to our coasts arises from the possibility of an oil spillage at sea even at a considerable distance from our coast and not at the installations in our own ports over which we can exercise effective control.  Nevertheless, despite the stringent precautions agreed with Gulf Oil, a relatively small but alarming spillage of oil occurred at the terminal on December, 25th and 26th, 1968. <Col N="501" /> This spillage was fully investigated by the Department of Transport and Power and it was found to have been due mainly to the fact that, owing to delays in the completion of the terminal, all the agreed safety precautions were not in effective operation. The Company was prosecuted by the Department and was fined £250.  It emerged during the hearing that the Company had incurred some £30,000 expenditure in making good the damage and paying compensation. This experience should have a very salutary effect.</P>
    <P>12.  To sum up, the position is that there is no technical need for the services of a harbour authority at Bantry Bay at present, nor is the possibility of further development there in any way inhibited by the absence of such an authority.  If any change in circumstances indicates the need for a harbour authority the necessary steps to establish such an authority can be put quickly in hands.  In the meantime, proposals to hold Gulf Oil up to ransom for dues in respect of which no necessary or commensurate services are provided are well calculated to discourage possible future users.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Civil Aeronautics Board appointed an examiner under the relevant US administrative procedures to hold a public hearing at which Aerlínte were invited to show cause why the board should not make an order which, subject to the approval of the President of the United States, would give effect to the withdrawal of the Aerlínte New York landing rights as from 18th August.  The examiner has now submitted his findings to the board in which he recommends deleting New York from the Aerlínte permit. Aerlínte had until 3rd July to file exceptions to the examiners recommendation and have until 13th July to file a brief with the board themselves. They are doing this.</P>
      <P>The CAB hearing is in this context a matter between the airline and the US air licensing authority.  The findings of the examiner do not prejudice the resumption of negotiations under the bilateral agreement in any way. Indeed informal discussions have been continuing at various levels with the US Government and it is hoped that formal negotiations will be resumed at an early date.  No decision has yet been taken by the Government on the landing rights issue but, as I have previously indicated, the Government are determined to hold out for the best solution possible.  I do not propose to make any further statement at present.</P>

      <P>When examining applications received under this scheme the National Science Council are guided by the following criteria: (a) a project must have scientific or technical merit; (b) it must measure up to reputable international standards and is in fact assessed in this regard by experts outside this country; (c) the competence of the applicant; (d) potential economic or social benefits to the community; (e) potential for greater involvement of the higher education sector in industrial and community problems; (f) potential for encouragement of interdisciplinary or inter-institutional activity; (g) possibilities for encouragement of &ldquo;centres of excellence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's reference to the comparatively low level of our gross expenditure on research and development as a proportion of gross national product, the point must be made that the Government share of this expenditure compares favourably with the level in other countries.</P>
      <P>A national science policy leading to a national programme for science and technology is being formulated by the National Science Council with particular reference to priority areas, which can be expected to include natural resource-based industries.

    <P>The loss in revenue to CIE because <Col N="520" /> of the concession fares currently charged to school children in the younger age group is recouped by means of a special subsidy from the Department.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to such legislation is now under further examination in relation to the arrangements which will be required for the application to this country of the standards of quality and grading for fruit and vegetables under EEC regulations.</P>
      <P>Under our existing export licensing system arrangements have been in operation since early in 1970 whereby exporters of tomatoes, our principal export, are required as a condition of their export licences to comply with the grading standards required in the country to which tomatoes are exported. Officers of the Department inspect export consignments to see that they conform to the standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Government made a firm promise in the Third Programme to introduce this legislation?  Can he explain why they have now gone back on that promise and, as a result, put the horticultural industry in this country at a disadvantage in so far as exporting is concerned without having commonly agreed grading standards which those who buy our horticultural produce can rely on?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to ignore completely the totally changed circumstances that we find ourselves in now with a totally new set of standards which we did not contemplate at that time.  It is also to suppose that the Government have also abandoned the idea of introducing a grading system for fruit and this of course is not so. What has changed since the 10th May is the new standards that will have to be put into operation and their application in the new European situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsequent to the publication of this programme in March, 1969, substantial expansion in the volume and value of horticultural crops, both glasshouse and field grown, took place.  Due to marketing difficulties, there has been a temporary set back in the production of field crops for processing by Erin Foods but production of glasshouse and protected crops has continued to expand. In fact, last year tomato exports reached the record level of £828,000 and for the first time exceeded the value of off-season imports.  In 1971 total exports of horticultural produce was £6.1 million as compared with £5.5 million in 1969.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for the continued payment of the agricultural grant for the five-year period covered by the Bill, thereby providing for the continuation of the existing primary, supplementary and employment allowances.  The primary allowance relieves 100 per cent of the general rate on land holdings the valuation of which does not exceed £20; this allowance effectively derates 77 per cent of all rated holdings of agricultural land.  In the case of holdings between £20 and £33 valuation the primary allowance relieves 100 per <Col N="531" /> cent of the rates on the first £20 of the land valuation and the rated occupier is liable for rates on the remainder only. Land holdings with valuations in excess of £33 qualify for a primary allowance of 80 per cent in respect of £20 valuation and a supplementary allowance of 30 per cent on the remainder. The employment allowance is available, in appropriate cases, towards the relief of the net rates payable after deduction of the primary and supplementary allowances on holdings with land valuations over £20.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill contains an adjustment of the conditions relating to the grant of the employment allowance. The purpose of this section is to give legislative effect to the change in the employment allowance which was announced by the Minister for Finance in the 1968 Budget.  Up to 1st April, 1968, when the provision came into effect, the employment allowance was not available in respect of a workman who himself was the rated occupier of land with a valuation of £5 or more.  The 1968 budget raised this valuation limit from £5 to £15.</P>
    <P>The agricultural grant affords relief from the general rate in the £.  Following on the raising of the primary allowance to 100 per cent in respect of holdings with valuation under £20, provision was made in section 8 of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1967, to enable local authorities to waive the levying and collection of separate charges on such holdings where the amounts would be so small that collection would normally be uneconomic.  The provision in the 1967 Act was however related solely to the grounds on which such charges generally arise, that is, in respect of compensation for malicious injuries.  It has since come to notice that these small separate charges can arise also in respect of other matters.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for the extension of the powers of local authorities to waive these small charges, which it would be uneconomic to collect, irrespective of the grounds on which the expenses arose.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I am standing in for <Col N="532" /> our spokesman on local government who is absent unavoidably.  I wish to say a few brief words on the Bill which is a fairly straightforward measure with not very much in it.  However, in order to ascertain what the Bill is all about one must go to the Library and look up six or eight different Acts.  In introducing a Bill of this sort there should not be reference to several different Acts of Parliament without giving some explanatory memorandum that would obviate the need for all this research into the particular Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect of the Bill which I find difficult to understand is that of legislating for a specific number of years.  Why can we not enact legislation that goes on indefinitely until we bring in some other legislation either to discontinue the allowances granted or to bring in something to amend it?  I hope the Minister will explain why this procedure is necessary. Looking back through the Acts I find that this has been done repeatedly during the years.  Initially a period of eight years was fixed.  This was increased later to 11 years.  Then we fixed a period of 13 years which, subsequently, was increased to 16 years and this is being increased now to 21 years. I notice that the legislation has to be retrospective in order to cover an overlapping period that had expired since the last specified period had ended. Therefore we are legislating now in retrospect to 1969, so far as I can see. I wonder whether the Minister can explain why he did not bring the Bill before the House prior to the ending of the period in 1969?  Perhaps he might tell us too, why the legislation cannot be made permanent at least until such time as amending legislation is brought in.</P>
      <P>The first paragraph of the Minister's brief was in Irish but as my knowledge of that language is limited I did not understand what he was saying.  I do not know why he should have begun his speech in Irish and then continued it in English.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 deals with the employment allowance.  Can I take in that this is the allowance that was brought in under the 1946 Act?  That allowance was originally £6 10s. but has been increased since to £17.  Is section 1 proposing to continue that allowance for a further specific number of years, that is, to 1975?  If it is, I am surprised that the Minister has not availed of the opportunity provided by the introduction of legislation of this kind to increase this allowance to a realistic figure.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that there has been endless agitation and discussion all over the country in county councils, in the General Council of County Councils, in committees of agriculture and in the General Council of Committees of Agriculture and resolutions have been passed going back many years asking successive Ministers for Local Government to come up with a realistic figure.  It is certainly many years since the £17 figure was arrived at and if at that time it was regarded as a figure that might induce a farmer to employ an extra man it certainly would not do so now.  It is altogether unrealistic as an inducement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to make what I consider is a wise adjustment and that is to allow a man with a £15 valuation to qualify for this relief when he works for a farmer.  In other words, the farmer is not debarred from getting relief if he employs a farmer with a valuation up to £15.  Probably this should have been done long ago.  Even £15 is a very small valuation.  I think the Minister will agree that it would be impossible for a farmer on a £15 valuation to get an income from his holding sufficient to keep him and that he must supplement it outside.  When an adjustment was being made I cannot understand why the £15 was chosen since we should be trying to give uneconomic holders of this valuation and indeed of much higher valuations an opportunity of being employed with an adjoining farmer, perhaps, with sufficient land to give the employment <Col N="534" /> without the latter being deprived of the meagre allowance of £17.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain why he did not bring up the figure to £25 or £30 valuation.  Certainly, in my constituency land is valued at about £3 an acre and in some cases more, so that a £30 valuation would represent ten acres of land and unless a man had ten acres under glass or something like that he could not possibly get a reasonable livelihood.  But because he has this valuation, if he works with an adjoining farmer who is able to employ him, that farmer is deprived of the £17 allowance.  I cannot understand why, when introducing the legislation, the Minister did not raise the valuation &mdash;not to £15 but&mdash;to £30 and why he did not raise the £17 figure to at least £50 or £60 or, say, £1 a week.  I cannot see that the present figure of £17 has any effect on employment.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the extension in various steps of the period to which I have referred and also gives the legislation retrospective effect.  Is the Minister satisfied that he should not eliminate the need for bringing this legislation to the House periodically?  I have no legal training and I do not know what may prevent this but if there is nothing to prevent it why does the Minister continue the practice that has been carried on so long and which is so difficult to understand.  In section 4 the waiver of rates with certain changes in conditions is dealt with and there is very little else in the Bill about which one could speak.  The one improvement in it is that the valuation at which a man will qualify has been increased from £5 to £15.  One wonders why the legislation is necessary when we were making such little improvement in the existing situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wonder why it is not possible to have the Bill cover an indefinite period rather than a five-year period.  Like Deputy Clinton, I live in a highly-rated area.  For various reasons the valuation of land in Meath is the highest in Ireland.  I know of land which runs across the border into neighbouring counties and the land in Meath is valued at £2 to £3 per acre while the land in the other counties is <Col N="535" /> valued as low as 50p per acre for the same field.  Surely there is no sense in that.  This means that a Meath farmer with a very small acreage is ruled out.</P>
      <P>While I agree entirely that it would be a good idea to increase the valuation which would be derated, I have mixed feelings about the large farmer being allowed off rates.  It is rather ridiculous that farmers with sizeable valuations should not have to pay the full rates on their lands while the house-owner or owner of a small business or something like that has to pay the full rates. When it comes to the man of wealth I think there is a point where this remission should not continue.  There should be an adjustment of the whole rating system which would include people who are unable to pay high rates and if this were carried out it would almost certainly remove rates remission in the case of people who have so much money that they do not know what to do with it and who have other people paying portion of their rates for them.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Clinton, I feel the £17 employment allowance is a bit of a joke, but for a different reason.  I believe there is no point in paying £17, that it is a complete waste of money and that nobody at present employs a man because he is allowed £17 off his rates.  Nobody employing a man would say:&ldquo;We shall knock him off because we do not get unemployment allowance for him.&rdquo;  This matter should be looked into.  Possibly the Minister could say how much money is involved in it. If an incentive towards employment is to be given it must be given in a different way.  Giving somebody £17 on condition that they keep a man in full time employment over a whole year is ridiculous.  If the Minister wants to save whatever small amount of money is involved he could do so and nobody would cry salt tears if they lost this £17.  All of them say they want a larger allowance and we assume the amount they are getting has no influence at all. I agree with that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always wondered why the allowance did not apply to both male and female.  There are people employing full-time women land-workers who apparently do not qualify for the allowance.  Even when the allowance <Col N="536" /> was considered worth something the conditions under which it was given were rather stringent.  I knew of people who had one man employed for a period.  He left and somebody else replaced him after a few weeks.  He found it extremely difficult to qualify for the allowance.  The Minister might forget about the £17 altogether.</P>
    <P>I know this is not the place to talk about it, but perhaps the Minister might comment in his reply as to when is he going to do something about malicious injuries?  He said here that the provision in the 1967 Act was related solely to the grounds on which such charges generally arise, that is, in respect of compensation for malicious injuries.  We are now living in the era of the vandal.  There is only one or two local authorities in the country that have not had sizeable malicious injuries claims made for damage done by vandals.  The tendency appears to be that, if people do this sort of damage, it is just as well not to bother with them, to go after the county council and in that way go after the ratepayers and make them pay.  It is the old style of collective punishment. The time is long past when this system should have been done away with.  I am not blaming the Minister.  This was handed on to him, but if he makes his name as Minister for Local Government for nothing else, changing this would allow him leave a mark in the Department which possibly he might not otherwise have an opportunity of leaving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind what you said, Sir, I think it is relevant to this debate that we should be considering the burden on people who pay rates on agricultural land arising out of malicious injuries.  What is particularly relevant is the fact that that legislation was originally introduced in what might be called an immobile age when malicious damage was likely to be done by people within their own area or certainly within an area that was reached on horseback.  It was a measure which was intended to punish a community for tolerating or permitting crime, misdemeanour or felony within their own particular area.</P>
      <P>The pattern of recent malicious injuries, particularly in the constituency which Deputy Tully has the honour to represent in this House&mdash;and most ably he does it&mdash;has been of a nature that it is committed by people who have come from a long distance away and certainly far beyond the parish or the bailiwick that is punished by the particular legislation.  It is in that sphere that we must very properly consider substantially amending the whole malicious injury code.  I do not go as far as Deputy Tully&mdash;perhaps he did not go this far&mdash;but I do not go as far as some people do in suggesting that the whole concept of malicious injury compensation being borne by the public should be done away with.  It is, over all a relatively a cheap form of social insurance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and indeed were it not on the Statute Book I would expect a party with a strong social conscience to favour it being undertaken as a social obligation.  What needs to be done is to make it a national obligation so that when malicious injury is done it is spread over the whole of the <Col N="538" /> community and that particular areas, particularly those of relative poverty, are not called upon to pay immense compensation in respect of damage that is done in their midst by people who come from a long distance outside.</P>
      <P>What I think is particularly inequitable is that where malicious damage is done, as it is sometimes done, by people from an urban area it is the people in the rural area who have to pay the damage.  That clearly is wrong. It is, therefore, right for this House to be making a generous contribution towards the relief of rates on agricultural land.  I represent a constituency which I do not believe has as much as a half acre of agricultural land within it but I am concerned with the social issue involved.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to agricultural land near towns where the boundary has been extended.  Any farmer who has land adjacent to a town when the boundary is extended cannot avail of this relief if his ground has been brought within the urban area.  I would ask the Minister to consider this as a matter of urgency.  I know of many of these cases.  I met many people in Carlow, where the boundary was recently extended with 20 and 30 acres of land.  Since the town boundary has been extended they get no relief on agricultural land and have to pay the full rate, whereas a half mile from the town their neighbours can avail of 100 per cent relief in respect of the first £20 valuation and the other benefits that are available for valuations in excess of £20.  I would ask the Minister to consider where people are inside an urban boundary and engaged full-time in farming, giving them the same concessions as if they were in the county council area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he has considered the problem in relation to group farming. If a number of farmers come together and pool their land, thereby bringing their valuation above £20, they will lose the exemption which at present operates and if their valuation goes above £33 they will lose the somewhat attenuated exemption which is <Col N="539" /> given to farmers with a valuation between £20 and £33.  I know there are probably ways of getting round this requirement but I would ask the Minister to consider in the context of the rating system the need to place no obstacles in the way of the development of group farming.  I hope the operation of this exemption would not be such as to have that effect.</P>
      <P>I also consider that it would be desirable in the case of farmers who form a group and, from being independent proprietors, become employees of a group farm co-operative enterprise, that the employment allowance in respect of such people should be very substantially increased because group farming is something we should be encouraging and this is a way in which we can encourage it.  It is worth drawing the attention of the House to the fact that the cost of the employment allowance to the Government is one of the few items of expenditure which has been going down.  This is the allowance which is given on the rates in respect of any worker employed on the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In 1957-58 this cost the Exchequer £1,272,429 and in 1971-72 it cost the Exchequer £728,248. In view of the fall in the expenditure, in view of the fall in the cost of the allowance, there is obviously room for increasing the rate of the allowance.  I feel the increase should be given in a selective way with a view to encouraging certain types of intensive form enterprise which have a high employment content.  This money which has been saved over the years could be spent in giving a very substantial increase in the employment allowance to anybody who pools their land to become employed in a co-operative farm venture.  I hope the Minister will consider that suggestion very carefully in view of the fact that the Department of Agriculture are endeavouring at the moment to encourage group farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to a matter which was mentioned I believe by Deputy Tully, that is the question of <Col N="540" /> malicious injuries.  I do not agree that the malicious injuries code should be abolished and that the cost should be borne solely by the insurance companies. In relation to this proposal one must ask if this happens who will in fact pay.  Obviously the people who would have to pay would be the people paying the insurance premiums.  The result is that, if somebody was unpopular locally or for one reason or another it was considered that his property was a bad malicious damage risk, his insurance premium could go up. People living in rural areas where their property would not be so easily protected would find that their insurance premium in respect of malicious injuries would go up because there would no longer be the present provision whereby the cost of malicious injuries is borne by the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I do not think it desirable to remove the payment in respect of malicious injuries from the community.  It is a desirable thing but I find it most inequitable that it should be borne by the local authorities.  I am sure Deputy Tully and Deputy Ryan have stated that with increased transport and so forth the people who commit malicious injuries are to a decreasing extent natives of the county in which the malicious injuries are committed.  This is particularly applicable in the case of illegal organisations.  It should also be borne in mind that the responsibility for preventing malicious injuries rests with the Garda, which is a national body.  There might be some case to be made if it was the responsibility of a local county police force but the fact is that local authorities can do nothing about preventing malicious injuries.  It seems to me to be unfair that local authorities should have to pay the bill if the Garda are unable to prevent malicious injuries from taking place.  I believe that while the community responsible for malicious injuries should not be abolished, because it would lead to an intolerable increase in insurance premiums for certain people living in exposed places or for people whose property was at risk, it should be made a national charge.  I commend this proposal to the Minister and I hope he will consider it carefully.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> I find the process whereby this legislation is introduced rather curious.  We had rates on Agricultural Land Bills here almost every two or three years and their effect has been to a great degree merely to renew existing statutes and bring them forward for another few years.  The Government complain that they have difficulty getting legislation through the House and that there are log jams and delays.  They should consider the extent to which they are creating these log jams themselves by introducing unnecessary legislation which could be avoided if, instead of introducing legislation which must be introduced every few years, they introduced a concession which could be annulled but which would continue in existence until it was annulled and would not have to be renewed.  This would lead to a situation where Bills such as the one we have today would not have to be introduced.  The Government have failed by two years to introduce the necessary legislation and they have now to bring in legislation to authorise county councils to do something which they have been doing for the last two years in anticipation of this Bill.  This is very undesirable procedure: that it is necessary to indemnify local authorities for doing something which was technically illegal because the Government failed to get a piece of legislation through.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the Minister could give some information on the other forms of incidental expenses which are referred to in section 4.  He mentioned in his speech that there were some others in addition to criminal injuries which were discovered.  It would be a help if he could tell the House what they are.  It would be desirable in regard to section 10 if, instead of all those Acts being cited together, the Minister could introduce to the House at some convenient date a comprehensive Bill which would bring the whole lot up to date instead of having people having to refer to a multitude of Acts if they want to find the legal position in regard to rates.  It would be a great help if all the legislation could be brought up to date in one Act.  In view of the heavy legislative programme which is in front of us <Col N="542" /> I can see this would not be a very high priority, but is something which should be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill for what is in it but I do not believe it goes far enough.  I am old enough to remember Fianna Fáil promises in the past when rates were between 5s and 6s in the £.  Now they are 20 to 30 times what they were then.  They are from £6 to £8 in the £.  I also remember their shedding crocodile tears during the by-election in Laois-Offaly in 1956 when the rates were from 20s to 30s in the £.  My criticism of Fianna Fáil politicians and of the present Minister for Local Government is that they are so lavish with their promises on the election platforms but are so niggardly when in office.  We know their promises in 1965, when they were to stabilise the health grant, but the moment they got back into office we heard nothing about it.  We all know that rates are increasing and they are putting a heavy burden on many people.</P>
      <P>At one time we were all concerned about one penny increase in the £, then it became shillings and now it becomes an extra pound increase every year. We are entitled to ask the Minister when this will stop.  The Minister in his speech today stated:</P>
      <P>Up to 1st April, 1968, when the provision came into effect, the employment allowance was not available in respect of a workman who himself was the rated occupier of land with a valuation of £5 or more.</P>
      <P>We have advocated that for years and as far as that is concerned it is a small step forward, but I suppose we should be thankful for small mercies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the employment allowance, if my memory serves me right I think the £17 is there since 1963 or 1964.  It is completely useless now.  I agree with Deputy Tully that no farmer employs a man for the £17 allowance. There are 10,000 leaving the land of Ireland every year and if that allowance could be increased to £60, or even £52, as Deputy Clinton suggested, it might be an incentive.  The aim of the Minister for Local Government and of <Col N="543" /> everybody in this House should be to try to stop the drift from the land, to give more employment to our own people working on the land.  If he considered making the allowance £52 a year it might be an incentive and it might help to keep more people working on the land.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the man who works 11 months a year on the land, then falls ill or is absent for another month or two.  I have been informed that in some counties if a man is out for three or four weeks it is hard to get the allowance.  I was in the Dáil when the Bill was going through and the Minister informed us that, even if a man worked for 11 months of the year, the allowance would be paid.  I have been informed that, especially in Dublin, if a man is out for a fortnight or a month they are not inclined to give the allowance.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the point raised by Deputy Nolan in regard to the relief for land inside the urban boundary.  If a town is being enlarged and takes in land outside the boundary and if the farmer is dependent on that land for his livelihood, he will not get the allowance. This is unfair.  This point should be examined.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that malicious injuries should be a national charge and not a county charge.  At present when there are anarchists and subversives throughout the country there is danger that what has happened in the North could happen here.  If a particular town was bombed, the county council would not be able to pay for the damage.  The sooner this point is examined the better.</P>
    <P>Rates on agricultural land are an outdated mode of taxation.  In the past there was much discussion when this Bill was introduced.  With the increases in rates now we cannot have as much to say about the concessions to farmers. Only a very small farm now has a valuation of £10 to £15.  With rates so high now, many small farmers are paying £80 to £125 on a farmhouse and outoffices.  We do not have so much to say about the great asset of the rates abatement now as we had in the past.</P>
    <P>It is probably not in order now to <Col N="544" /> deal with the committee which was set up to deal with the rates question. The sooner we have an answer to the rates problem the better.</P>
    <P>To return again to the allowance, the position is unfair and unjust.  Unless the Minister gets the recommendations of the committee soon he should do something about this point.  Small farms of less than £20 valuation are completely derated.  In the majority of cases a man in such a farm works with the ESB, Bord na Móna or, perhaps a garage in the local town.  In 99 cases out of 100 a man from such a farm is working and earning a reasonable wage.  He has no rates to pay on his land.  The case of a man with a valuation of £33.1 is somewhat different.  He may have a wife and ten children and he must try to stay at home and work the farm.  Very little allowance is made for him.  There should be some kind of children's allowance for such a man. The most hard-pressed man at the present time is a farmer with a young family.  The Minister should consider the whole question.  The allowance should not be given to every man with £20 valuation because such a man may be better off than the farmer with £33 valuation and a wife and ten children. The question of a children's allowance should be carefully considered in order to give relief to the people whom I believe are most deserving.</P>

      <P>There was a request on the part of Deputy Clinton for an explanatory memorandum.  There was a hint that an explanatory memorandum should have been circulated with the Bill so that the Deputies would have known of the intentions of the Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point raised was: why have continuing Bills and why not have permanent legislation? The only answer I can give to that is that, in continuing the allowances and benefits which are available to farmers and the owners of agricultural land under these Bills, the Government decide on a certain figure as the allowance and that figure applies for a certain period and can be reviewed at the end of such period.  There is an opportunity to consider the position and to look at the allowances with a view to possible improvements.  If one goes back to the series of Bills that have been passed, one will notice that the opportunity to introduce legislation to continue the benefits has been availed of to improve the allowances.  On this occasion we are validating the increase in the valuation limits for employees of farmers from £5 to £15 and they will qualify for the employment allowance from now on.  This is being validated here now, having been passed in a previous budget.  It is not really relevant whether it is a continuing Bill or whether permanent legislation should be introduced.  It would be practical to have permanent legislation, but this would not allow for any improvements and one would still be faced with the eventuality of having to bring in new legislation to improve the situation. One way or the other, there would be this kind of discussion in the House.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to Deputy Clinton that on both occasions when there were coalition Governments in the House they availed of these continuing Bills but they did not avail of the opportunity to make any improvements in the situation in those years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This might be deemed the first crack in the pending marriage of the two parties.  There is also the question of the £15 valuation limit for employees of farmers.  This has been validated here.  It has been suggested by some Deputies that the £15 should be raised to £25 or £30.  The £15 is quite a generous adjustment as compared with the previous limit of £5.  The suggestion to increase it beyond that is not very appropriate.  The £15 should be let stand for a period until we see how it operates.  The fact is that the level of £17 was originally intended to act as a stimulus to farmers to employ agricultural workers or to keep them in employment.  The validity of that is very much in doubt now.  Having said that I intend to continue it in operation, I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I would be inclined to lean towards Deputy Tully's arguments in that field. I should like to assure Deputy Bruton that in relation to group farming I did consider this and I do not envisage that it will cause any difficulty; it can be dealt with administratively to ensure that where farmers form a group they will not, because of the combined valuations, be debarred from remissions. I want to assure the House I shall deal with that administratively, but in the event of an amendment to the law becoming necessary I am fully prepared to include a proposal for such an amendment in any future legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of urban land, which was raised by Deputy Nolan, is an old chestnut.  It is one with which one could have some sympathy just taking <Col N="547" /> a look at it on the surface.  However, although it may be a worthy suggestion I cannot see my way to granting it at this stage.  The basic purpose of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Acts is to ease the burden of rates on people who occupy agricultural land and use it for agricultural purposes. The amount of agricultural land used for agricultural purposes in urban areas is insufficient to justify any amendment to these Acts.  The total land valuation of the country is approximately £7 million and of that only £105,000 is in urban areas, that is, including the boroughs.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would let me finish, the urban land comprises, in addition to some agricultural holdings, undeveloped building sites, parks, playing fields, golf courses, tennis courts, churches, schools, factories and so on.  Further allowances on the lines of those for land in counties would undoubtedly give rise to constant disputes as to whether or not particular property should qualify for rates relief on the grounds of agricultural use.  The farmer in the urban areas benefits from the services that are made available by the urban authorities, and it is only reasonable that he should make a fair contribution towards the cost of these services.</P>

Further, he has no claim to rate relief on the same basis as the general body of farmers in the county health districts whose complaint is that they are asked to contribute to the cost of services from which they derive very little benefit. Of course, as the House well knows, land in urban areas has a greatly enhanced value as potential building sites due mainly to the operation of the local authorities, and the valuations of such land cannot be increased.  In this way the occupier does receive what may be regarded as a free gift from the <Col N="548" /> occupiers of hereditaments other than agricultural land in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The original Local Loans Fund Act, 1935 under which the fund was established, fixed a limit of £5 million on issues from the fund.  Over the intervening years the limit has been raised periodically by successive enactments. The last of these in 1968 raised the then limit of £250 million to £400 million.</P>
      <P>The Bill is simply an enabling measure to raise the limit on issues from the fund still further from £400 million to £600 million.  Up to 31st March last issues from the fund amounted to £375 million.  The capital budget 1972-73 provides for issues of £45.73 million to local authorities from the fund in the current financial year. The existing limit will, therefore, be reached inside the next few months. The limit consequently requires to be raised again so that issues can continue to be made from the fund in this and future years.</P>
      <P>The local authorities depend on the fund for the vast bulk of the capital they require for the essential services which they provide, covering in particular housing, water supply and sewerage schemes and also a variety of services including vocational schools, county homes, public hospitals, libraries <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the total issues from the fund up to 31st March last, £186 million or almost 50 per cent, was in respect of local authority housing.  Of this amount £71 million was issued in the last four financial years, reflecting both the welcome rise in local authority housing output, and the deplorable spiral in building costs.  House purchase loans advanced by, and supplementary grants paid by local authorities absorbed £102 million of the total issues, of which £37 million was issued in the last four financial years.  The house purchase loan scheme is of particular assistance in facilitating home ownership by persons with relatively modest incomes, who might otherwise experience <Col N="555" /> difficulty in arranging loan finance.  The loan and income limits under the scheme were raised over a year ago.  Nevertheless the ever-rising house prices have necessitated reconsideration of the limits, and the Minister for Local Government yesterday announced substantial improvements in the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>The provision of sanitary services, mainly water supply and sewerage schemes, for housing, industry and other essential purposes is assuming growing importance and has involved expenditure of £18 million from the fund in the last four financial years. Expansion of housing output and of industrial development is likely to require greater emphasis on the provision of these services in the future, with correspondingly increased demands by local authorities for capital from the fund.</P>
    <P>Housing and sanitary services together absorbed about 90 per cent of the issues from the fund.  The balance is substantially accounted for by vocational schools, county homes, public hospitals, libraries, some harbour works and miscellaneous services.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will continue to rely on the fund for finance for all these services in future, as their capacity to raise finance from other sources is rather limited.  The limit on issues must therefore be raised so that access by the authorities to the fund may continue to be available.  In the light of experience in recent years, it is evident that a very substantial increase in the limit is essential, so as to be in a position to cover issues for some years ahead.  The Bill accordingly proposes to raise the limit by £200 million to £600 million and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing contentious in this Bill, although one can certainly argue as to whether the actual sums advanced from the Local Loans Fund in past years have been adequate for the social purposes for which they are largely required.  I think it is legitimate to say that we would have liked to see the Bill coming to us sooner and the money provided <Col N="556" /> within the existing limits used up sooner.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary refers, rather puzzlingly as far as I am concerned, to the welcome rise in local authority housing output.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be as well aware as I am that this Government have placed effectively for some years past a ceiling on local authority housing output.  That figure was fixed at 4,500 houses approximately and, allowing for the effect of the cement strike in the year before last on output&mdash;it fell to, I think, 3,800; there has, of course, been some increase this year conpensating for the strike&mdash;it is fair to say that for the last four to five years local authority housing output has remained at the level of 4,500.  It has been firmly held down by the antisocial, retrogressive policy of the Government. In so far as housing output has risen, and it has risen to some degree, it has been entirely as a result of activities in the private sector, activities which are, of course, partly financed out of the Local Loans Fund.  That we must accept and, indeed, I will have some comments to make on that later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it hard to understand why this policy of preventing the growth of public housing and depriving people of the possibility of getting a house in that way which is a retrogressive policy, it should have been followed&mdash; never mind being justified&mdash;by any Government, even a Fianna Fáil Government. There is a fact which bears repeating, although I rarely go back into the past and do not seek to make party points about what happened in past decades between our party and the other party, whether in Government or in Opposition, but there is one figure which I do take from the past and I revert to it again.  In 1950-51 local authority housing output, under the first inter-Party Government, attained a figure of 8,000 houses.  Since that time the wealth of this country has risen by something like 70 per cent. In volume terms, allowing for the increases in prices and the devaluation in the value of money, this country is 70 per cent better off than it was at that time.  Assuming that a house today <Col N="557" /> were the same as a house was then&mdash; I am sure there has been some improvement in quality&mdash;that means that we could build at the moment 13,500 local authority houses with the same proportion of the GNP as then.  To the extent that quality has risen and the cost of housing has risen somewhat disproportionately, that figure certainly could be well over 10,000.  If this Government were pursuing the policy that was pursued over 20 years ago by another Government, the scale of housing would be certainly between two and three times its present level.  This Government have put it back to something between one-half and one-third of the level which it should be at if the same policy were pursued as was pursued 21 or 22 years ago, if the same proportion of gross national product were allocated to housing, if the number of local authority houses built were today the same in relation to the GNP in real terms as was the case in 1950.  So, for the Parliamentary Secretary to claim that there has been a welcome rise in local authority housing output, when the Government have firmly held down the growth of local authority housing output and have kept it to a level which, in relation to the total level of national output is about one-half or one-third of what it was 20 years ago is, to be frank. inpertinence.  The suggestion that the House would be taken in by this kind of nonsense does not do much credit to the Parliamentary Secretary's opinion of this House.</P>
    <P>This is not specifically a housing Bill but I think I am entitled to make that point.  The Parliamentary Secretary has so oddly made this totally unconvincing comment that he has drawn down upon himself my reply on this point.  I think I am justified in commenting to that extent.</P>
    <P>Coming back more precisely to the Bill, as against the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory speech with that unfortunate comment, the Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned that the Minister for Local Government has made an announcement of changes in the loan maxima for small dwelling loans.  This change in the limits is, of course, welcome and, indeed, overdue. <Col N="558" /> As I understand it, the loan maximum is being increased by £500 in Dublin and major urban centres and by £400 in the country areas.  I have not seen this announcement yet.  I think it was made only this morning.  I would ask him to clarify whether the urban centres, where the figure goes up by £500 to £3,800 as the limit of the loan, include Galway as well as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  I ask this because I think the House will be aware that the cost of housing in Galway is as high as or higher than in Dublin, one of the highest in the country, due to the shortage of land and what appears to be an inordinate amount of land speculation in the area which the Government and the Minister in particular, who is from the area, have in some way failed to control.</P>
    <P>The increase in these limits is welcome, as is the increase in the income limit from £1,250 to £1,500, with, of course, the £100 per dependant up to four dependants allowance on top of the £1,500.  I have to ask the Parliamentary Secretary here, and it is a question which has exercised the minds of many Members of the House, why is it that the limits effectively for the loan and for the grant are different to the extent that they are?  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain in terms we can understand why a man with £1,850 a year and with a wife and three children can get a grant but not a loan; why a man with £1,750 and a wife and one child can get a loan and not get a grant.  If that distinction serves some social purpose it is, I am afraid, lost on me.  That is the effect of the different limits which are imposed for grant and loan purposes. This seems clearly undesirable.  The two should be aligned together in some more sensible way and people should not have to play skittles with the system in this way and find that as their income moves from one figure to another they become entitled to a grant but lose their entitlement to a loan. There is no sense in that.  The fact that a man with twins gets another £100 does not seem to be a reason for depriving him of a loan but giving him a grant.  There is no rationality.</P>
    <P>On the question of the way in which <Col N="559" /> these loan funds are used for housing. I have two further points to make.  One is that the inspection system is totally inadequate.  There are constant complaints about the shoddy workmanship in houses built by a small number of builders who do no credit to an industry whose standards are very high and most of which standards are maintained by the Construction Industry Federation.  Unfortunately, the Government do not exercise any control to ensure that the small individual firms which do not adhere to these standards and which are not members of the federation, maintain standards.</P>
    <P>The standards both of construction activity and of electrical wiring in some of these houses are terrifyingly bad.  There is not adequate inspection. Indeed, in so far as there is inspection and in so far as the inspector says that the house is unacceptable in that form &mdash;and he does not do it often enough in some of these cases&mdash;the only effect may be that the refusal of the grant does not hurt the builder but hurts the person who is about to get the house and has to find the extra £280, or twice that sum of money if a supplementary grant is involved.  That is not satisfactory. The Minister for Local Government should take power so that the local authorities will complete the work, as in fact they do in other cases where, say, the roof is defective and the landlord fails to repair it, and charge the builder.  They might charge him an extra 20 per cent for overheads to encourage him to do the job properly in the first instance.  It is unfortunate that that is not done.  The law should be changed to get over this difficulty.</P>
    <P>The money under the Local Loans Fund is not being used for the benefit of the purchasers but is used for the benefit of builders, not all of whom deserve to benefit from it in view of the fact that a small number of them do not maintain reasonable standards in their construction work.  Indeed, the whole system of the grants is unsatisfactory in that one grant is payable to the builder, the other, only, to the person buying the house.  In my view the grants should be payable only to <Col N="560" /> the purchaser of the house and not to the builder at all.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the system of local authority guarantees to building societies is one which tends to hive off a large proportion of the demand for loans to building societies because the local authorities, or at least some of them, operate a system under which the loan to be given can be 25 per cent greater if it is given by a building society on the local authority guarantee rather than if it is an SDA loan. This is a very clever way of pushing people away from local authorities to the building societies.  It should not be necessary.</P>
    <P>The effect, therefore, of the changes announced today will be quite possibly not so much to burden the Local Loans Fund by increasing the amount involved for loans but, because of the offsetting effect of increasing the limits further in relation to building society loans guaranteed by local authorities, the effect may be curiously to relieve the Local Loans Fund to a considerable degree because by increasing the limits in this way, many more people can make use of this guarantee because it means now that in Dublin and the other major urban centres a loan of up to £4,750 by building societies will be guaranteeable, if I understand the position correctly.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, a whole category of houses will suddenly be brought within the guarantee scheme and people who might otherwise have had to make do with an SDA loan may be shifted to a building society.  It will be interesting to see how this works out. However, it does not necessarily follow that increasing the limits will lead to an extra burden on the SDA fund.  It is something that remains to be seen. They are the main points I want to make, I could, of course, develop the discussion on housing at greater length but I feel if I did so you, Sir, would find some good reason for inhibiting me and I do not wish to test your patience any longer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill but there are some rather peculiar things about it.  In the third paragraph of his introductory remarks the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>The Bill is simply an enabling measure to raise the limit on issues from the fund still further from £400 million to £600 million.  Up to 31st March last issues from the fund amounted to £375 million.  The capital budget 1972-73 provides for issues of £45.73 million to local authorities from the fund in the current financial year.</P>
      <P>I was interested to see an unspent balance because I thought the Local Loans Fund had gone over the top and that that was the reason why we could not get money out of the Department of Local Government to do many urgent jobs.</P>
      <P>I wonder why housing schemes were held up for months and months and why sewerage and water schemes have been held up for up to a year.  I thought the reason was that there was no money in the Local Loans Fund. I realise it is not in his Department but would the Parliamentary Secretary be able to comment on why it is considered necessary for the Department of Local Government, having sanctioned housing and water and sewerage schemes, to insist on people going back again to ask permission from the Local Loans Fund.  Why is the second operation necessary when permission to submit tenders has been sanctioned?  Doing this without making money available is the same as telling a person that it is all right, that sanction has been given, but that the doors are locked and he is still a prisoner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might use his influence to have this charade removed, because that is all it is.  In my constituency, Meath County Council for several months have been awaiting sanction for a housing scheme at Donore.  They have been given permission to set the contract, the contractor has been appointed but the Minister will not make the money <Col N="562" /> available.  This is a bad joke on people waiting for houses.  The same situation applies to a sewerage scheme for Mornington and I thought the reason for the delay was that the Local Loans Fund did not have the money.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the phraseology used to announce the increase.  There is reference to the increased cost of houses while at the same time there is reference to the increased number of houses.  Just to set the record straight without going too far from the subject under discussion, let me point out that in 1970-71 there were only 3,775 houses built in the State by local authorities. There were 9,000 others built making a total of 13,000.  Despite all the trouble in the Six Counties, in the same period there were 13,916 houses built there, 2,000 odd more than in the previous year.  Of these, 4,701 were owner built and the others were local authority houses.  In other words, twice as many houses were built by local authorities than by private individuals while in the Republic only one-third of the houses built were by local authorities. Surely there must be some reason why local authorities here are not building at the same rate as in the Six Counties, about which we are so anxious.  Why cannot we do at least as good as they can.  This whole operation needs a damn good spring cleaning and the sooner it gets it the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government today announced a change in the amount of money that may be earned by people who want to borrow for housing.  Surely the place to have announced that is this House.  I agree with Deputy FitzGerald in regard to the different scale for borrowing and for qualification for grants.  Surely there must be something wrong here, or is it the old game of playing off one against the other?  Suppose somebody wants to borrow money and also wants to get a grant.  If his income is more than a certain amount, he will not get the supplementary grant.  He may do a bit of paring and he will get the grant but when he applies for a loan it is pointed out that the figures he has submitted disqualify him.  This is a game, and the onus is on the <Col N="563" /> Government to ensure this sort of thing does not continue.</P>
    <P>In years past it has been the practice that when somebody feels he is in a position to build a house, when he sets out to do so he finds he is over the top as far as a loan is concerned. However, when he finds he is deemed to be in a position to pay back a loan he cannot get the money because his income is regarded as being too high. This is not the way to encourage people to build their own houses.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may say it is not a job for him but I should like to ask him why a building speculator should be allowed to take the Government grant on houses?  Why is there not legislation which would ensure that the builder would give the actual price of the house and that the grant would go to the person who will occupy it?</P>
    <P>I am aware that quite a number of hospitals, county homes, libraries and vocational schools have to be built and that it is necessary to have money for them, but the amount of money made available each year is not sufficient to meet the demand.  Because of the tremendous number of people who are unemployed I cannot understand why it has not been possible to put into operation a full scale public works programme that would provide employment for some of these people.  When the first inter-Party Government were in office, the late Tim Murphy adopted that attitude and put in progress a public works system of house building which resulted not only in the provision of houses for many people who otherwise would not have got houses for a long time but which resulted also in the provision of much employment in the building trade.  Why could this not be done again?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he would use any influence he has with whoever is responsible for sanctioning loans to the Local Loans Fund.  If everything is in order for the sanctioning of a loan, can the Parliamentary Secretary see to it that the money is made available?  There is no use in telling some local authority they can go <Col N="564" /> ahead with a scheme and then withhold sanction to borrow the necessary moneys from the Local Loans Fund. This causes much annoyance and inconvenience.  If it is a question of shortage of staff an effort should be made to provide extra staff.  This improvement tax would do the Government much good.  However, it is not with their good that I am concerned but with the good of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of the Bill and to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on its introduction.  Perhaps the Bill, as the previous speaker said, is a little overdue.  However, it is vitally necessary to continue the valuable social work that the Local Loans Fund has made possible down through the years.</P>
      <P>If I have any criticism in regard to the Bill, perhaps it is in relation to the high interest rate.  Many years ago, when I first became a member of a local authority, we were very pleased to obtain substantial funds in the Dublin Corporation towards the provision of housing.  At that time there was a serious slum problem and also we had to try to cater for the many people who wished to provide homes for themselves. The Local Loans Fund enabled us to carry out this work.  The rate of interest then was only 2½ per cent, but today a house purchaser pays up to 9½ per cent interest on money obtained through the Local Loans Fund.  High interest rates are a disturbing element in the whole social structure today. They impose a severe burden on people who not only have to provide themselves with homes but who must provide also all the other necessities of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been criticism in certain circles regarding the profits made by banks.  Some time ago the statement of one bank indicated that their profit was £14 million.  In a country in which an organisation providing one service can make such fantastic profits it is time to take a hard look at the system that allows this to happen.  These profits are made while the ordinary citizens are overburdened in endeavouring to buy their homes.  Not only do <Col N="565" /> high interest rates affect people buying their own houses but they affect also those who are lucky enough to qualify for corporation houses.  I was amazed during the week when told that Dublin Corporation are charging rents as high as £9 under the differential rent system. That is a grave burden to impose on anyone, especially when one takes into account the very marked contrast between these people and financial organisations who are making millions of pounds.  Deputy FitzGerald was critical of the performance of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not in the least. I was critical of the Government in not providing the money to local authorities to enable them to provide housing. Local authorities do their best with the money which they receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should have said that the Deputy was critical in regard to the question of local authority housing.  I can speak only for the city and, as far as I am concerned, the Government have done their best, under the circumstances that have obtained in the past few years, to provide housing for our community. The housing problem in this city is aggravated by migration to the city. People come to the eastern region because of the job opportunities available here.  I would like to pay tribute to the Government for having made available during the past three years a sum of £3 million to Dublin Corporation, through the Local Loans Fund, for the purchase of lands in advance. The land is being purchased at relatively low rates and this has enabled many people, particularly in the private building sector, to provide houses much cheaper than they are being provided by other organisations in the city.  Also this has helped to stimulate the growth of co-operative building groups.  My only regret is that the corporation should charge something in the region of £1,000 per site.  Of course, this adds to the price of a house.  There was a time when the corporation provided serviced sites free.  I would like to see that position obtaining again.  I welcome this new assistance towards housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to a point raised by Deputy Tully, the reason for Bills such as this coming before the House from time to time is to give the House an opportunity not only of increasing the existing limits but also of discussing the principle of the Local Loans Fund.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult for me to reply to many of the points raised because most of them concern directly the Minister for Local Government and it is not for me to speak on his behalf here.  However, there are a few matters on which I can comment with safety. I would like to begin with the point raised by Deputy FitzGerald.  I gather that the Deputy's main criticism of the Bill is that it is too late and that not enough money is being channelled into the Local Loans Fund.  While such criticism may have been valid at other times, it is not valid now.  The total increase in this respect in the budget of 1972-73 is about £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that that merely takes care of inflation and that the effect of this limited growth is that there will be no increase in the volume of building construction in this country this year and that, as a result, there will be a considerable decrease in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not go along with that point because, so far as I am aware, the only sphere in the construction industry in which there is a surplus of workers is in the unskilled sphere.  In my own Department there is great difficulty at times in recruiting such skilled people as carpenters and plasterers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that the official figures, although they are not very reliable, show a 10 per cent drop in employment in the building industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This probably arises from the bank strike period when a number of people went away and have not returned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Col N="567" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that in a moment.  My own personal experience in the Office of Public Works is that not only do we have difficulty in recruiting skilled personnel but we find that the private sector is sometimes so short of these skilled workers that agreements which are supposed to exist can be broken and these people can be tempted to leave the public service.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in speaking on 28th June, was not complacent about this. He assured the House that he was having various points raised by the Construction Industry Federation examined as a matter of urgency with a view to considering what further action, if any, is required.  The Minister is on record as expressing concern about this matter and the entire problem raised by Deputy FitzGerald is under consideration at present.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald went on to say that housing output had been increased only in the private sector.  This is not borne out by the facts.  I have construction rates here from 1960 and local authority housing output in all areas in 1960-61 was 1,463; in 1969-70, which I think would be an appropriate year, it was 4,706.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  In 1967-68 it was 4,015; 1968-69, 4,613; 1969-70, 4,706; in 1970-71, there was a fall, due to the cement strike, to 3,875 and in 1971-72 it was 5,106.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was at a much higher level in the past year.  I can go into all the figures but I am sure the Deputies have them.  Whatever difficulties there may have been, the fact is that local authority housing is on the increase.  Deputies are quite entitled, if they wish, to make the fair criticism that the increase is not sufficient but there is an increase.  Deputy FitzGerald also spoke about workmanship in regard to housing and inadequate inspection of work.  I believe this has been improved, certainly in the Dublin city area, but again, this is essentially a matter for the Minister for Local Government and not one on which I should properly comment except in so far as moneys made available are properly spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of procedure in relation to local works, of <Col N="569" /> which the Deputy complains, is entirely a matter for the Minister for Local Government who will have to consider these applications not only from the point of view of the schemes themselves but also from the point of view of costs, and so on.  This is an appropriate time to raise the matter and I shall certainly bring the Deputy's remarks to the Minister's attention.  I agree with Deputy Timmons that the fund has done a great deal to help to clear this city of slums.  I agree with his remarks about differential rents but again this matter is not appropriate to this debate. The cost of money at present is a little expensive and I suppose will continue to be so for some time as long as we have further essential development to undertake.</P>
      <P>To conclude on this, I think Deputy FitzGerald asked one further question. He asked if the higher loan limit of £3,800 under the house purchase loan scheme which applies in Dublin city and county, Dún Laoghaire, Cork, Limerick and Waterford also applies to Galway.  The answer is: &ldquo;Yes, it does&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill came before us I raised the question of the drafting of it.  For some reason not explained at the time by the Minister, and which I still do not understand, instead of describing the area in respect of which transactions arise accurately as &ldquo;the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands&rdquo;, the method adopted by the draftsman was to call them falsely &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; and then to rectify this in a special subsection (3) in which the United Kingdom is incorrectly defined as &ldquo;Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands&rdquo;.  I see no merit in this; it makes the Bill longer because it is necessary to have this separate subsection.  It is true that if my amendment is accepted it will be necessary to make similar amendments in lines 21 and 22 but, even so, the Bill would be tidier and, above all, we would not have attempted by virtue of legislation in this House to suggest that the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which are not part of the United Kingdom, are part of it.  They have, of course, a separate jurisdiction and are not part of the United Kingdom any more than Malta or Gibraltar are part of it.  It is not appropriate for us to attempt in any way to suggest that the Isle of Man, a Celtic country, and the Channel Islands, which are more French than British in race, culture and language, should be assimilated into the United Kingdom.  As there is no valid reason for this, it seems to be simply loose drafting.  I <Col N="571" /> put down the amendment; unfortunately, it was not taken at the time. Objections were raised to it and so it has come before us again now.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will accept it and get this minor piece of legislation quickly through the House.</P>

The amendment, as put forward by the Deputy, would not, in any event, be adequate.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not explained why he wants the Bill this way.  He simply says that the Bill, having been drafted wrongly, in my view, the Minister sees no reason to put it right.  That is not an adequate statement in this House. There must be some reason for drafting the Bill incorrectly, some reason for seeking to describe the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as part of the United Kingdom when they are not.  The Parliamentary Secretary owes it to this House to come clean and tell us the reason.  Is there some reason?  If there is not surely we must accept the correct legal definition and should not attempt to interfere in our legislature with the degree of independence which the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands possess.  If there is some good reason for it we are prepared to consider it in this part of the House.   If there is no reason for it then I am not prepared to accept the suggestion that these areas should be considered by this country to be part of the UK when they are not.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give any reason whatever for drafting the Bill in the way in which it was drafted.</P>

Similar provisions will be found in section 1 of the Finance (Agreement with the United Kingdom) Act, 1938, in paragraph 3 (1) of the Imposition of Duties (No. 159) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1966, which is the principal order giving effect to the provisions of the trade agreement and the various other statutes and orders enacted in a similar context.  In other words, we are following the same form as we have followed in other Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1972, made on the 8th day of June, 1972, by the Minister for Justice with the sanction of the Minister for Finance under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to approve the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1972, which provides for a minor change in the Garda pensions code.  An explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This change effects 37 members of the Garda Síochána who are the only members left of those who, on the making of the 1951 Garda Síochána Pensions Order, opted to retain their old pension conditions.  This was the order which introduced the concept of retirement gratuities into the Garda superannuation system.  It was applied on a voluntary basis to those serving at the time.  They had the choice of remaining on their old pension conditions&mdash;that is a pension equalling two-thirds of pay for men with full service&mdash;or of accepting the new conditions under which they would get a pension equalling half pay plus a retirement <Col N="575" /> gratuity equal to one and a half times annual pay.  Some of those who retained their old pensions conditions later regretted their decision and it has now been agreed to give those still serving a further opportunity to opt for the new conditions.  This is the purpose of the present order. The terms of it have been agreed with the Garda Representative Body.</P>
    <P>I commend the order for the approval of the House.</P>

In difficult days they helped to build up this country when lawless elements, including members of the Minister's own party, were trying to bring down this country.  The Minister need not try to jibe at people on this side of the House because, when it comes to law and order, we on this side of the House will uphold the laws of this country.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everybody in this House this party welcome the order which is being made.  However, there are one or two matters I should like to refer to.  It seems a little harsh when an Order like this is being made that some people, who through no fault of their own had left the service, are left out of the order.  The Minister may not agree with me, but, on reflection I think he will agree that it seems fair, if an order is being introduced now, to compensate those who because of their age were able to remain in the service at this stage and that those who did not avail of the previous opportunity should now be allowed to come in.  It is rather unfair on those who because of their age had to go out before this time and are not being allowed to take advantage of what is in the motion.  the number cannot be very big and I suggest to the Minister that he might possibly have another <Col N="577" /> look at this and attempt in some way to try to deal with those people who because of what has happened are not able to avail of it.  In fairness to those people they should get an opportunity of availing of the terms of this order.</P>
      <P>I am sure there are a number of widows of such people who, because they will be covered by a pension scheme, would be entitled to certain payments which cannot be paid to them because they did not opt in or rather because they opted out at that particular time.  I may not have explained this as well as it should have been explained but I think the Minister will take the point that, whatever number of those people there are, an effort should be made to try to give them the benefit of what is being done now.</P>
      <P>I mentioned this particularly because of the fact that in a particular job which my trade union organises something like this happened.  Like the Minister, we overlooked at the time that there were people who were missed by a very short period and others who were missed by a longer period and afterwards they had to be brought in.  I suggest to the Minister that, as they are a dying race and the number must be small, he would ensure that all of those who opted out who are still alive or whose widows are still alive should be given the benefit of this particular order.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Tully, to the best of my knowledge we have had no application from anyone who retired prior to the date from which this operates, that is, 15th January, 1970. Of course the reason for that is that, if a man were out on pension already, I suppose in 99 cases out of 100 it would suit him better to keep his higher pension&mdash;two thirds of pay&mdash; rather than opt to go on to half pay and get a gratuity as well.  That of course is possibly why we have not had any application for people prior to that date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This order was made by me as a result of a recommendation made by the Conroy Commission.  They felt they had to take a particular date and the date they picked was the date of the issuing of their own report. Deputy Tully is not quite correct in saying that through no fault of their own certain people were kept out of the benefits of this order.  It was open to them to opt one way or the other.  They opted one way and some of them may now feel that they should have opted other way.</P>

It is in fact being done at their request.  In relation to Deputy L'Estrange's record, all I can say is that it was put on in such a hurry that a 45 record was put on at 33? by mistake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very interesting, prolonged debate on the health and hospital services in which a great deal of the comment was constructive and some of the criticism was quite fair in that there is no Minister for Health I know of who could make the progress he would like to make at the speed which would satisfy either his own ideas or those in the Parliament where he sits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that there was no speaker in the debate who in any way criticised the abbreviated statement of health and hospital policy which I put in at the very end of my Estimates speech.  I think this is the first time that I know of for a number of years where a general statement of policy was made indicating the priorities and there was no general criticism or even no detailed criticism of what constituted <Col N="580" /> the national health policy as devised by me as Minister for Health for the time being and as approved in the Oireachtas as a result of Health Estimates being passed during the last two years.  I was glad that no one, therefore, challenged the general type of policy which should be developed.</P>
    <P>I would have hoped that more Deputies would have spoken about the development of community services and would have, perhaps, by their speeches advertised the necessity for encouraging voluntary organisations throughout the country to come together, not to lose their identity, but to work together as participants in social service councils with a view to collaboration with the statutory authorities and the health boards, in respect of the ways by means of which people can be kept out of hospital, and people in distress of any kind assisted.  Whether the reason for failure to comment on this was that the Deputies feel that in my Department we are doing our best to encourage the social service councils, or whether their interest has not been sufficiently aroused, would be difficult for me to know.</P>
    <P>It is true that the social workers in my Department have helped to establish no less than 16 social service councils in the course of the last two years.  More councils are in progress of formation.  We now have a national council for social services on which there are experts of every kind.  The council will give me advice on the development of community services and on matters that arise in connection with the formation, growth and pursuit of social service councils.</P>
    <P>I want to say that we have a very long way to go in this regard.  The domiciliary services which were referred to by a number of Deputies cannot be fully implemented without a great deal of voluntary help and through the work of voluntary organisations supported by voluntary funds, in addition to the funds donated by the health boards.  Above all, a type of organisation which permits the appointment of more social workers in every social service area is needed, not only because of the valuable service they provide but also so that they <Col N="581" /> can help to train voluntary workers to look after those in distress.</P>
    <P>This also relates to the provision of youth services and to the very great importance of providing community centres and recreational facilities for youth.  These matters are not my responsibility. They relate to the work of the Minister for Local Government and also, ultimately, to the development of more cultural facilities and adult educational facilities in every area.  The social service councils can promote these activities in conjunction with the local authorities and with all those working in these fields.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the financial question, which arose.  I am quite aware that the health services impose a very heavy burden on the ratepayers and the taxpayers.  This is found in every country in the world.  It is true to say that the richer the country the heavier the burdens of health and hospital costs seems to appear.  I foresee that the costs here will increase still more.  I foresee an increase in the cost of providing hospital services over the next ten years as techniques become more expensive and specialisation grows, and more and more people are saved from death and brought back to health through advanced techniques.  The hospital services will become more expensive and involve us in considerable financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>If one examines the position in a country like Sweden, the second richest country in the world, one will find that the Minister for Health there stated that he did not know how he was going to find the finance for the kind of health services which were being sought by the Swedish people.  Sweden is a country where a married man with £3,000 per annum and two children pays £1,300 income tax.  It is no use for Deputies to get up and make the bald statement that the health charges should be removed from the rates.  This would involve the transfer of £35 million in the present year from the rates to the Exchequer.  It would impose impossible problems on the Minister for Finance and on the Members of this House if such action was taken.</P>
    <P>The following increases in taxation <Col N="582" /> would produce approximately £35 million:</P>
    <P>A 7p increase in the standard rate of income tax, or</P>
    <P>A 17½p increase on 1 gallon of petrol, or</P>
    <P>A 23p increase in the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes.</P>
    <P>I do not think that such a transfer of taxation on property to taxation on incomes or expenditure is really feasible.  We have limited the increase on the rates this year to 30p in the £ and we will continue, so far as possible, to give this kind of assistance in future.</P>
    <P>Deputies have made various suggestions for some new kind of insurance scheme.  I regard myself as looking pragmatically on all proposals for insurance schemes which are intended to limit the necessity for paying rates or income tax.  It is almost impossible to devise any kind of insurance scheme that would be truly equitable.  In Europe there are a number of countries which, through the growth of the co-operative societies and the co-operative principle applied on a very large scale, began their health schemes through the introduction of an insurance principle. Schemes varied from country to country.  All those countries have found that it is quite impossible to charge on a pay-related basis, or on any other basis, the full cost of health and hospital services, because the cost of hospital services have grown so tremendously.  If we look at the position in Denmark or the Netherlands, we will see that they have schemes on an insurance principle, but there are enormous subventions for hospital services from the State.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for this?  Even though it might be possible for the Minister for Finance to try to work out what the impact would be on the total expenditure of everyone concerned in an insurance scheme and charge the employers, the employees and self-employed persons compulsorily with an insurance premium the premium would either be so high that it would come to look like nothing more than a tax, or else it would be of a form that one could not be certain <Col N="583" /> whether the relief of taxation that might be afforded would impinge on the various sections of the community in a fair and equitable way.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this in order to give an easy or cheap answer to the Deputies in the Dáil.  Deputies who have been a long time in this House and who have studied the reports of committees on taxation in general will know the difficulties of coming to sound conclusions on these matters.  I do not know how to describe the means by which one arrives at a conclusion. You cannot tax a person more in relation to income tax without causing political difficulties and resentment and you cannot tax a person more in expenditure without going beyond a crisis point.  We, as the Danes and the Dutch found, cannot charge insurance beyond a certain point by itself sufficient to pay for the health and hospital services without again causing a defence mechanism to arise whereby you know that you cannot go on with the proposition. If anybody could suggest to me a form of insurance that would really be equitable, that would really work, and that would have any very large effect in reducing rates and taxation in an equitable manner for the persons who pay the insurance, I should like to hear of it.  I shall not go into detail about the Fine Gael scheme.  It would not be worth while to apply that scheme in our present circumstances.</P>
    <P>As I said, we shall go on thinking about the subject of whether some insurance scheme to replace the present system can be formulated.  I do not know how it can be done.  One of the difficulties is that if you substitute for rates a very considerable insurance scheme, it is very difficult to say whether simply relieving certain householders from rates as a result would be fair to people who do not pay rates.  We would like to be certain of that.  There might be some case for doing it, because everybody knows the rating system is imperfect in certain respects.  It applies fairly in certain respects, but in relation to people with permanent incomes it applies unfairly.  Provision has been <Col N="584" /> made by the Minister for Local Government whereby rates can be remitted, through striking an extra rate by the county council, for those persons who are burdened by an excessive rate in relation to their unchanging incomes, incomes that have not altered through the passage of time and the growth of inflation.  As I have said, it is very difficult to change the system we have.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have asked about the cost of our having the same system as can be found in Northern Ireland in relation to payment for the health services.  The position here is that 90 per cent of our people get hospital services, drug assistance and out-patient facilities either free or for the very small sum of £7 a year, and only 10 per cent of the people are obliged to pay for most of their health and hospital services.  The extra £30 million would add another £10 a year on taxation or rates to the £30 a year which is roughly being spent this year for that purpose.  No doubt if the time came when we had to consider the co-ordination of the health and hospital services as between ourselves and our kinsmen in the North, we would have to go into the question of altering the service.  However, I want to say with absolute frankness to the House that I cannot get a single statistic or fact in relation to the Northern Ireland health and hospital services which suggests that we have less good health here than could be found in the North before the terrible events took place which began in 1969. I can find no evidence to this effect in relation to expectancy of life, the death rate, the infant mortality rate or the perinatal death rate; I cannot find any evidence from looking at figures of deaths from various diseases. If deaths or afflictions from one particular malady are slightly higher down here we find they are lower in respect of others.  Therefore, although it is true we shall have to consider this whole question of the method of financing our health services if we reach the point where a reunification measure comes into operation, I still say that our system has been greatly praised by doctors who came from Great Britain and from America and <Col N="585" /> that we are not criticised by experts who come from outside in respect of our three-tiered system.  Inevitably there will be defects in any three-tiered system, but I do not think it works so badly and I doubt if there are many people who are deprived of medical services to which they are entitled through the establishment of the three-tiered system which we have today.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies made observations on the implementation of the FitzGerald Report.  Let me repeat for the nth time that there will be no change in the function of the main hospitals of this country without, first of all, there being a study undertaken by the regional hospital boards, by the regional health boards and, in so far as the matter applies to the working of Comhairle na nOspidéal, by Comhairle na nOspidéal; and that before any change would be made I have agreed to consult the county advisory committees for health wherever there is a dispute on the future functions of a particular hospital.  No hospital can be closed without my consent as Minister for Health, and under certain circumstances there must be a public inquiry held in relation to changes in the functioning of a hospital.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do want to point out to the House that the implications of the FitzGerald Report, not as applied to every recommendation they made but in general, are farseeing and, to my mind, must be pursued to the bitter end over a period of years.  I am told by the experts in the field of consultant practice and by experts in the field of medical teaching that unless there should be some quite remarkable change in the general pattern of medical teaching, between eight and ten years from now it will not be possible to recruit surgeons for hospitals.  Therefore, eight or ten years from now a number of recommendations made in the FitzGerald Report for the construction of certain general hospitals throughout the country and the closing of surgery in certain other hospitals will become absolutely inevitable.</P>
    <P>This is not something which the relatives of people undergoing surgery <Col N="586" /> like or appreciate, but it is always possible that, if a patient goes to a specialist hospital or a hospital where there are a number of surgeons and physicians working as a team with good paramedical facilities, the patients can return for convalescence, when they are regarded as out of danger, to a district hospital where they can be seen by their relatives more frequently.  That is always a possibility in relation to the purely human problem, which is of great importance, that patients like to be as close as possible to their family.</P>
    <P>Again, the FitzGerald Report must be seen in the light of the fact that there are health boards where already 22 to 25 per cent of patients go to Dublin hospitals in any event which, in many cases, are very far from where they live.  Therefore, there is already a movement of patients from a local rural area to a regional hospital area and we want to examine the question of how many more regional hospital facilities we can provide which will reduce the number of people that need to go to Dublin. The extent to which we can do this will depend on the work of the regional hospital boards who, with the aid of competent staffs, would be analysing the results that will come from the in-patient survey of the Medico-Social Research Board.  It may mean that in relation to some of the hospitals that will inevitably be developed in the country, such as Tralee, Castlebar and Letterkenny, and in relation to the more controversial proposals which have been made right through the midlands and on which there has been no decision, it may be found possible, if there is a sufficient patient workload for people living within a reasonable distance, to develop some specialties in these hospitals.</P>
    <P>All this depends on very careful examination of the patient workload in each hospital and so there is no need for people to start marching or protesting on the future proposals in relation to the FitzGerald Report. Much of the FitzGerald Report is noncontroversial and can be pursued, even without waiting for the medical and social research board's findings because <Col N="587" /> the facts are perfectly clear and evident, and this applies in particular to the development of the Cork Regional Hospital, the Tralee hospital, Castlebar, and the development, above all, of the great regional and general hospitals in Dublin where the population is increasing as in the case of other capital cities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burton referred to the position of Mallow County Hospital.  I am going to see the county advisory committee for the north Cork rural area in order to explain to them why I refused to accept the proposition that not only should Mallow retain its surgeon but that it should be expanded. There is absolutely no case for the expansion of surgical or medical facilities there in a way that would go far beyond the population in the area and go beyond the inevitable results that would accrue from a very great modern regional hospital being built in Cork city.  The action taken was to preserve the existing surgical facilities there.</P>
    <P>I must say that I sometimes find it difficult to understand why people think that surgery is of such desperate importance in a local hospital.  It is quite possible to imagine that in some hospitals where surgery, except perhaps for minor code surgery might cease, there could be expanded facilities for maternity cases, a better obstetrician&mdash;gynacological service, that some of the beds would be made available in order to conform with what I regard as one of the most correct decisions in the FitzGerald Report, that general practitioners should be allowed to take beds in county hospitals and to look after their patients. So you have the possibility of surgery stopping in a hospital but of there being better maternity facilities and above all, of general practitioners being able to find beds in the hospitals and to look after their patients there in ordinary medical cases.  At the same time, if the FitzGerald Report is finally implemented one would expect more outpatient consultant services to be provided at the hospital.</P>
    <P>This kind of service is growing, but all the emphasis seems to be on the retention of surgery as such, without <Col N="588" /> looking at the whole picture of the developing services in the area concerned. If at the same time as a hospital changes its function, there is a great expansion of domiciliary services, if more people are being kept at home and looked after, more old people are being given meals on wheels and there is a whole community service made available to everybody in the area, while you may be centralising certain kinds of hospital treatment in one sense, you are decentralising the health services in another, so that no one could say that the Minister was a concentrator, a centraliser rather than a person who believed in a combination of inevitable concentration in relation to specialties and decentralisation in relation to the growth of community services.</P>
    <P>This whole question will take some very considerable time to deal with. As I have said already in the House the Minister for Health has to face the very embarrassing proposals for the location of the general hospitals from the north midlands down to Waterford, in which Ardkeen Hospital in Waterford, Tullamore and Cavan have been chosen; we could have, even when the study is being made by the regional hospital boards and the regional health boards, so many deputations from people looking for Tullamore, on the one hand, and Mullingar on the other, for Monaghan instead of Cavan, for the preservation of Kilkenny and of Wexford, with the permutations and combinations involved in examining the proposition of where the general hospitals should go, from the north midlands right down to Waterford, that it would be enough to drive any Minister almost mad particularly after he had received a very great number of dissentient representations from people, all of whom claimed that their particular town was a better centre for the general hospital than another.</P>
    <P>However, as I say, this is going to take some time to process and I am going to continue to communicate, as I try to communicate with everybody in relation to the FitzGerald Report and the whole development of health and hospital services through the country, through the advisory committees <Col N="589" /> who can co-opt people who feel particularly keenly about a particular proposition. For example, the Roscommon County Advisory Committee could co-opt people from the Roscommon Urban District Council or from some group in Roscommon who felt very keenly about the retention of Roscommon, which is not in issue at the moment and cannot be decided for a considerable period, and so I would be able to hear from the body which is set up for this purpose.  The county advisory bodies have been set up for the general purpose of ensuring that a regional health board apply the general health and hospital programme equitably throughout the area, so that domiciliary services, community services, public health nursing, general medical and hospital services are applied in a way which ensures that every county receives the same kind of treatment and can see that the same general standard prevails there as in every other county in the regional health board area.  These county advisory committees are obviously the bodies to discuss the matters that arise when it is proposed that a hospital changes its function.</P>
    <P>Whoever may be Minister&mdash;I may still be Minister or some one else may replace me in the future&mdash;may have to get very tough on this subject and in the end when the Minister makes a decision in relation to the FitzGerald Report, if he can be absolutely certain that he is going to save human lives, and if all the expert opinion given to him shows that, or if he can be certain that more people will be restored to complete health by having all serious surgery cases go to a hospital where there is a team working, the Minister would be justified in defying all the public opinion that may protest.  That will be the ultimate consideration, and the Minister will have to be trusted, as I hope he will, by the Members of the Oireachtas and those who have particular feelings about particular areas in relation to hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister can get very good advice on this subject.  The modern consultants, those who are concerned with modern medicine and hospitalisation are all absolutely convinced that the multi-consultant hospital, <Col N="590" /> with the right kind of para-medical facilities, is the best for a great many maladies.  This does not apply to simple appendicitis or hernia or simple fractures or maladies of that kind, but as we get to know more and more about the human body we all realise that the interconnection between the various organs of the human body, can be far closer than has ever been imagined.  When a person is affected by some malady it is very often important not alone that more than one opinion should be secured but that there should be examination by more than one doctor or surgeon.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is universally agreed all over the world.  The Bonham Carter Report, published in Britain, was similar to the FitzGerald Report, in so far as the general principle is concerned of concentration for serious surgery, concentration within reasonable limits, not asking people to travel unnecessarily.  This has already been demonstrated in practice by the very great number of patients who leave all parts of this country to go to Dublin to receive very specialised treatment and care.  If I remember rightly, 29 per cent of the patient bed days in the Dublin voluntary hospitals are in respect of persons who come from outside Dublin.  This is already an admission of concentration by the medical world and by the political world that you do have to move in order to get really first-class treatment in a specialist hospital.  The FitzGerald Report examined the problem at a lower level of specialisation.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I want to indicate that I sympathise with the natural feelings of people in relation to this whole matter but at least I have provided an intelligent system of examination, the regional hospital boards, the regional health boards, the county advisory committees, Comhairle na nOspidéal, and the Minister for Health ultimately will be responsible for the final decision because it is almost impossible to imagine a single case where a decision of a major kind can be made without some financial element being involved, either from expenditure in a hospital which is to change its function in the direction of receiving more patients or a <Col N="591" /> change of expenditure in relation to consultants or staff.  So that the Minister for Health cannot get out of the responsibility which will ultimately fall on him, whoever he may be, for the implementation of the very controversial parts of a magnificent report, of which a great many elements and a great many proposals can be steadily implemented, as they are now, without this controversy arising.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the care of the aged in various ways.  I want to tell the House that a great number of hostels for the aged are being promoted and are in various stages of building.  A number of Deputies referred to this matter, including Deputy Donegan.  I circulated statistics in connection with the capital schemes in progress applying to homes for the aged.  I think we are doing fairly well.  There were 357 places for old people completed since 1st May, 1971. There were 931 places under construction on 1st May, 1972.  There are at tender 375 places and there are in planning&mdash;and I think I am right in saying that those that have been planned can be put into operation in the year 1973-74&mdash;631 places&mdash;a total of 2,294 places for the aged and that includes 14 new 40-bed hostels of the most modern type which will be built for old people who are still ambulant but who need some care, who are not chronically sick.  These will be built in places where we can be sure that these old people, if their families cannot visit them, will be visited by voluntary organisations who will help to bring a human friendly atmosphere to the place.  Apart from that, old people can be cared for in homes of this kind which compare favourably with the county homes that we had, many of which have been or are being improved. All of this clearly indicates that the object of the Government is to improve the geriatric service.</P>
    <P>A Deputy raised the question of home assistance in relation to the community service, As I think I told the House in reply to a question, there has been no final decision about the general future character of home assistance and the method of its administration.  The <Col N="592" /> Minister for Social Welfare has indicated that he is examining the problem but the Minister for Social Welfare will agree with me that, whatever decision is made, the home assistance officers must co-ordinate with the community services, with the voluntary organisations, with the public health nurses, with those in charge of the community service, the health boards, because in a great many cases persons need far more than money when they apply for home assistance. They frequently need help of one kind or another.  Frequently help can be a substitute for cash because there are some kinds of help which may be more valuable in the circumstances of the person in trouble than actual cash.  So, I can assure the Deputy who asked me about the future of home assistance that we will certainly have the form of co-ordination which already exists in relation to the home assistance officers, that that will continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to the necessity of having social welfare officers and social workers.  We hope that in regard to the community services administered by the health boards there will be considered the necessity of appointing the kind of supervisory staff which will mean more encouragement to the appointment of social workers, working with voluntary organisations, as I hope, in most cases, so that the whole field of social work can expand throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the position regarding geriatric accommodation in County Louth.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that, while the present situation could not be described as satisfactory, there has been a considerable improvement in recent years.  The situation in Drogheda was relieved by the transfer of some patients to Ardee, the former district hospital, and a new building is being made available in the Dundalk County Home for use as a sanatorium, and approval has been given in principle to the erection of homes for the aged in Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>In speaking of this whole problem of geriatric care I must, of course, make it clear that we are only at the beginning of the road, as was indicated <Col N="593" /> to us by Deputy O'Connell, in regard to providing a full geriatric service.  When I refer to geriatric service I refer to expert facilities for geriatric assessment, assessment of the capacity of an old person to live in the community or whether the person needs to be rehabilitated, whereafter he may or may not be able to live in the community, or whether a person must be regarded as chronically sick.  This examination of old people at the optimum point so far as they are concerned is of great importance. This policy is gradually being developed and it involves the appointment of either physicians who are skilled in geriatrics or of geriatricians. It is not very easy to get geriatricians at the moment although we have been able to appoint some.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the disabled persons' maintenance allowances and the implementation of section 69 of the 1970 Health Act.  I told people in reply to Parliamentary questions that this would cost about £1¼ million a year and that having provided the great majority of the new services that were recorded and reflected in the 1970 Health Act, I believed I would have to wait in order to be able to implement this scheme in which the incomes of persons other than the spouse are disregarded for the purpose of determining the disability allowance.  Certain Deputies suggested that uncles and aunts were being deprived of allowances by virtue of the means of nephews and nieces who live with them.  We have written to the CEOs of the health boards pointing out that section 50 of the Health Act, 1953, only allows cognisance to be taken of the relatives specified in section 7 (5):</P>
    <P>any spouse, son, daughter or parent of a person, or any brother or sister of a person normally resident with that person...</P>
    <P>We asked the CEOs whether there had been any departure from this practice and we also suggested to them that they should take a reasonably liberal approach to the assessment of the means of relatives other than the spouse pending the introduction of <Col N="594" /> section 69 of the 1970 Act.  Having done that, one can be certain that the vast majority of those who desperately need disability allowances are getting them.  As I have said, we hope to implement section 69 at a later date.</P>
    <P>The cost of the health and hospital services is mounting so rapidly that it is simply impossible to do everything in one year, and with the choice-of-doctor scheme and the provision of drug assistance for the middle income group and the abolition of outpatient charges and the special facilities for those with certain disabilities such as epilepsy and mental illnesses, we contribute quite a good deal to helping people who are partaking of the health services.  We have made a very good contribution in the last three years.  We are making such progress as we can and we will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I come now to questions that relate mainly to health boards.  The health boards are still in their formative stages.  There are three programme manager posts vacant, in the East, North-East and the Western Boards. Some of the programme managers who have taken up office have done so only recently.  There are some support staff posts that have not yet been filled in various areas.  I have had a good deal of experience of administration of one kind or another&mdash;I have been in charge of eight State companies over a period of ten years and I have tried to learn as best I can modern methods of management&mdash;and I say that I could not expect health boards to be in full operation and revealing the potential for improving and making more efficient the health and hospital services until 1973-74, or perhaps the year after that.</P>
    <P>I made it very clear to the House that the cost of the programme managers represented only a halfpenny in the £ on the rates and that the total cost of administration of the health and hospital services by the health boards in so far as health board expenditure is concerned is 3½ per cent. I do not think we need to be ashamed of that percentage.  I doubt if there is a lower percentage to be found anywhere in Europe.  All the remarks that were made in the Dáil that the health <Col N="595" /> boards are enormously extravagant and expensive have not been shown to be correct by any evidence that I have.  The increase in the total cost of the health and hospital services in the two years before the formation of the health boards is of a size which shows that whatever increase took place since then it certainly did not take place due to extravagance on the part of the health boards.  Before the health boards were made operative, there were a good number of medical staff appointed.  If I remember rightly, in the year 1970-71 something like 45 new consultants and psychiatrists were appointed all over the country either to do out-patient clinic work or to provide for the needs arising from a growth in the numbers of people attending hospital for one purpose or another.</P>
    <P>The idea that the health boards in the first full year of their operation were recklessly extravagant in appointing more consultant staff, with a consequential increase in nursing and ancillary staffs, is totally without foundation and if anybody wants to ask a Parliamentary question the reply will show continuous progress is being made in relation to filling staff appointments of a medical kind and a para-medical kind that were absolutely inevitable.</P>
    <P>A lot of people, like Deputy Coughlan, spoke in so loose and ignorant a way about the functions of the health boards and their purpose that I do not know whether I need to repeat the basis for their formation. It is quite simple.  First of all, it was because of the growing specialisation in the hospital services, the fact that before the formation of the health boards there were a great many counties where virtually all the patients left the county to go to a hospital and a great many of them had to move throughout a larger regional area.  In order to co-ordinate the hospital services within a health board area, the health boards were formed covering areas which for hospital purposes seemed to be reasonable in relation to the population and the number of hospitals in the respective areas and the purpose they served.  The other <Col N="596" /> reason was that if we are to get good health and hospital services where decentralisation is involved there must be expertise at the top, there must be opportunities for promotion for all kinds of expert staff dealing with the community services, and it was absolutely impossible to provide a system where there was expertise available in every one of the 27 health authorities which could be secured at a salary that could be afforded and where there were equally opportunities for promotion in those various fields.</P>
    <P>So the area was enlarged with the idea of providing the right kind of headquarter staff, the secondary staff and the tertiary staff to do the best job possible in regard to all the services which should be decentralised and in order to ensure that the decentralised services would expand.  This applies to the work of public health nurses, of the general practitioners and to the county medical officers of health, but it applies above all to the development of the domicialary services and the community services.  If they are to be run in a first-class way, the staff at the top must have the facilities and the pay to ensure that the right kind of policy, the policy approved by the health boards, will be fully implemented.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to certain Deputies who talked about the lack of information on the health services that I think this is true but I do not know how soon the health boards will be able to afford information offices for which provision was made in the Health Act.  We are about to issue a new leaflet on the health services, or rather arrange for the health boards to publish a new leaflet, which will contain full particulars of all the health services available.  I hope that if Members of the House find that local officers are slow in giving the necessary information to people about the health services they can get, they will make complaints to the health boards.  I have not had many complaints on this matter.</P>
    <P>There were a number of observations from various Deputies about the choice of doctor scheme.  All I can <Col N="597" /> say is that there will be a review after a period of operation and all the matters raised can then be examined.  It has already been decided that, if the distance limit of seven miles is impracticable, it can then be extended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley claimed that doctors must be resident at least two years in the country before being eligible to apply for appointment as a permanent or a temporary dispensary doctor. That is not so.  The Deputy is presumably referring to the provision that, for official entry into the choice of doctor scheme, all doctors must have been in practice here for at least two years.  A list of doctors wishing to participate in the scheme has been compiled on this basis and future vacancies will be filled on an open competitive basis without any residence qualification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a doctor who joins the scheme and who takes on a partner or an assistant, that partner or assistant has no right to that doctor's patients in the event of his death.  This could cause friction.  A partner, who is married and who settles in a town like Swinford, might find himself deprived of a practice as a result of this.  The Minister might look into that aspect of it.  We should do everything to encourage doctors into the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>All these matters will be examined as the scheme progress. Deputy Dowling suggested that persons in some areas are refused admission to the doctor's lists.  He mentioned people living in a particular building.  Doctors have the right to reject patients just as patients have the right to choose doctors.  I understand that in the Eastern Health Board area no eligible person has been left without admission to a doctor's list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the name of the building?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Mount Pleasant building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Eastern Health Board facilities them.  If <Col N="598" /> patients contact the board they will be helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>So I understand.  No person has been refused admission to a doctor's list in the whole of the Eastern Health Board area.  That is a splendid achievement remembering all the complexities involved in getting the system going.  Some Deputy asked whether there would be an adequate night service from doctors participating in the scheme.  The terms of the agreement with the health board obliges a doctor to provide domicilary services for patients on his panel, when called upon, and he is paid a higher fee for night calls, and the fee increases with the distance travelled.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to the fact that there were areas in the west which were under-doctored.  This is quite true. There are areas in the west in which it is extremely difficult to get dispensary doctors.  As soon as the preliminary arrangements for the choice of doctor scheme have been completed in all areas, the Department will be having discussions with the chief executive officers and the bodies representing the medical profession to determine what areas will require special inducements. Until the list of doctors participating in the scheme has been completed and patients have indicated their choice, a clear picture of the needs of these areas will not emerge.  If it is necessary to advertise for someone who must be guaranteed an income in such an area, that can be done under the scheme. There is an extra payment for doctors living in remote areas in order to encourage them to take part in a service in such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked what was the basis on which the cost of the choice of doctor scheme was calculated.  It was assumed that on a national basis each eligible person would visit his doctor 3½ times per annum on average.  It was accepted that in city areas the rate would be significantly higher because the practice has grown of more frequent visits either to the dispensaries or to the community health centres. This is because, unlike rural areas, the services are conveniently available.  In the early operation of the scheme the <Col N="599" /> visiting rate in Dublin city was higher than anticipated.  On the other hand, the rate in Wicklow and Kildare was no higher than anticipated.  It is far too early yet to say what the likely average rate will be for the Eastern Health Board area and I can say no more about this until we see what emerges from the computer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will admit this was based on the British system under which all people are on the register, whereas here it is the lower income group which makes more demands on the doctor and, in consequence, there will be more visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to wait and see.  We have a fairly good reputation for correctly anticipating expenditure on new services and I hope we will be correct in what we anticipate this expenditure will be.  As I say, we will have to wait and see what emerges from the computer.</P>
      <P>It is true that there were some excessive claims which really could not be justified.  In the arrangements we have provisionally agreed with the Medical Association and the Medical Union for the examination of these.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell suggested that the Minister or the health boards could not control the character of prescriptions. All we want to avoid is what might be described as really wasteful prescribing&mdash;in other words, prescribing a bottle of pills which in no circumstances could be fully utilised. There can be carelessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It happens more with hospitals who give geriatric patients as many as 200 or 500 tablets at a time so that the patient will not have to make too many visits.  Old people whose memories are impaired will have forgotten at the end of a month or six weeks what the prescription was.  This is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne suggested that medical cards should be made available to the lower ranks in the Army and their dependants.  This is impossible.  The income standards for Army personnel should be the same as those for other groups and a provision <Col N="600" /> like this would be neither just nor wise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy said the standards for medical cards bore no relation to average industrial earnings, which vary from about £25 to £40 per week.  There is no reason for making such a comparison. The criterion for the issue of a medical card is inability to meet the cost of general practitioner services. Most industrial workers, earning £25 to £40 per week, should be able to afford such a service, bearing in mind the assistance given towards the cost of drugs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy made a number of comments on the eligibility standards for medical cards.  I asked the chief executive officers of each health board to work out a system under which the differences in medical practices could be reconciled.  I receive clips from all the local newspapers on health subjects. The regional health board has enormously increased publicity on health problems.  It is absolutely amazing the amount of publicity that now comes from regional health board meetings as compared with that which emerged from the discussions on health in the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>And then they say doctors do not want publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Having read all these I have noticed complaints by certain members of health boards in regard to the standards that have been provided for health and medical cards but I have seen nothing like a really great volume of complaints at all.  I think chief executive officers should be allowed to work out this principle.  I think they are doing it well.  The officers in my Department have routine discussions with them in all these matters in order to ensure that there is some element of uniformity as between one area and another and in order to ensure that the whole principle is being applied properly.  As Deputies know, there is the hardship clause, which is a very vital part of the whole business, by which families who are just at the very upper end of the medical card level and who constantly have heavy costs in paying doctors can be given <Col N="601" /> medical cards either permanently or for as long as they have a great deal of illness to contend with.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully said that the standards set by the North Eastern Health Board were not realistic, particularly in relation to the allowance for children. The standards applied in this area compare favourably with those applied elsewhere and the allowance of £1 per child per week has been adopted by at least five of the health boards. The North Eastern Health Board takes into account, when computing eligibility, any excess of £2 per week in respect of outgoings on the person's house.  In so far as travelling expences are concerned I understand that the board allows £2 per week to persons who travel in excess of 20 miles per day to and from their work.  These arrangements seem to be reasonable and I think perhaps with experience Deputy Tully may find that his complaints were exaggerated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh referred to what he regarded as the poor standard of ambulances in Wicklow.  The ambulance services are being constantly improved and there is a standard ambulance provided.  Some of the older ambulances are still in use in various parts of the country but they are gradually being replaced.  I was very glad to find that the new ambulances have been so successful that the firm that assembled them is exporting them to Britain and they are in competition with all the firms who manufacture and assemble ambulances in Britain. The specification for the ambulance, council of my Department, and the manufacturer of the ambulance were apparently satisfactory.  We are gradually developing better ambulances and in practically every area they are now radio-controlled.  We still have the job of seeing what more can be done in relation to general telephone and radio co-ordination is between the ambulance, the hospital and the people who are concerned with accidents.  That matter still has to be pursued and it is a very complicated one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons said that patients requiring to go to Dublin should not have to get up at 5 a.m. to go to a <Col N="602" /> collection point and be conveyed to Dublin to be in time for a particular clinic.  He suggested that arrangements should be made to have clinics held later in the day to facilitate such patients.  We will get in touch with the health board on this matter because it does seem a rather extreme case having to get up at 5 a.m.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Burke said some terrible things about the health service in her area.  She said there was no health services in rural Ireland, that what service there is is deteriorating with all the programme managers and health boards.  All I can say is that when the county advisory committee for Roscommon is formed it will be the duty of the Deputy to ask for reports from the health board on what is supposed to be the services in the area and then to compile complaints of any deterioration of service which could be the result of poor administration or inadequate finance and to make quite sure that the county advisory committee present not only complaints but proposals for a better service to the Western Health Board.  I am sure that in that way any weaknesses in any particular area can be put right&mdash;not immediately, perhaps, but in time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley made a tremendous song and dance about a meeting of the Southern Health Board being held in the Mount Brandon Hotel.  I understand that in future the meetings of the Southern Health Board, when they take place in Kerry, will take place in the county council offices in Kerry.  There was some special reason, apparently for choosing the Mount Brandon Hotel.</P>
    <P>A number of matters of a medical kind were raised.  Deputy Ryan referred to the rats in Dublin.  All information about a growth in the number of rats affecting an area should be presented to the Eastern Health Board.  If people think that the danger is being ignored they can communicate with me and I will get in touch with the Eastern Health Board, but I have not any information that there has been a large increase in the number of rats in Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> Deputy Ryan asked me how it was that deaths from heart disease seem to have been reasonably contained.  I would suggest that the reason is the development of intensive care units in a great number of hospitals all over the country and the expansion of the consultant cardiac service.  I should like to pay tribute to the &ldquo;Mediscan&rdquo; service and the work of the Irish Heart Foundation.  The &ldquo;Mediscan&rdquo; service is an experiment conducted by asking people to come and be examined and see whether they are prone to suffer from coronary thrombosis. They are given some advice and referred to a higher level of medical advice if necessary.  What we hope is that a sufficient number of them, when they are examined three years later, will have kept to the regime so that the service can be regarded as truly justified.  If we can be certain that about 70 per cent of the people who have been told they must observe a particular regime because they are prone to suffer from coronary thrombosis keep to the regime then we can consider expanding the scheme beyond the ambit of the work done at present by the Irish Heart Foundation in various areas.</P>
    <P>In connection with heart trouble I should like to refer to the very splendid example of co-ordination between two hospitals.  I am speaking of the development which is now in progress of a national cardiac unit which could be described as a super specialist unit in the Mater Hospital with the co-operation of the Federation of Voluntary Hospitals.  I regard that as a very good example of boundaries that previously existed between one group of hospitals and another being broken.  I hope there will be more progress in that direction.</P>

      <P>Excessive smoking of cigarettes was referred to.  As I said before, I do not think it is very much use trying to persuade adults to cease smoking.  I can give as an example a recent effort made in Britain where there was a campaign of publicity and advice to women expecting a child who were very heavy smokers.  They were warned of the almost certain results of heavy smoking during pregnancy.  Even in those circumstances only 25 per cent of the women in that group gave up smoking showing how difficult it is to persuade adults to cease smoking.</P>
      <P>Although there were some observations on alcoholism I wish more Deputies would refer to it.  I should like to be plagued to a greater extent by Deputies as to what we are going to do about alcoholism, the worst social scourge of this country.  It is conveniently put under the carpet by everybody. I shall make an announcement fairly soon of the development of a service by the Irish National Council for Alcoholism on a very expanded basis.  I do not propose to give details now.</P>

      <P>I hope so&mdash;if I pos- idea if they followed the example <Col N="605" /> accommodation difficulties that have arisen in the accident and casualty department of Jervis St. Hospital.  These difficulties were aggravated by the fact that the drug advisory centre was also at Jervis St. which meant that the majority of drug overdose cases were taken to Jervis St. for treatment. The extension of the casualty department has been under consideration and planning difficulties have been overcome so that I think the accommodation difficulties there will be relieved. This is being regarded as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board found the proposal to use Usher's Island centre as hostel accommodation to be inappropriate and when the activities of the centre as a day centre have expanded to the maximum it would not be possible to provide hostel accommodation. Dublin Junior Chamber of Commerce recently interested itself in this matter and has undertaken to provide and staff a hostel.  However, the Eastern Health Board are considering a long-term plan to provide forensic services generally and this will include provision of the hostel type of accommodation recommended by the Working Party on Drug Abuse.</P>

      <P>I do agree although the success of the voluntary hostel is something that might be discussed for a long time because this is a matter of controversy.  Still, I think they should be provided.  Deputy Gibbons suggested that maternity deaths should be classified according to the social class of the deceased.  We should look into this but whether it would be possible to do this I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan and Deputy O'Connell, I think, suggested that the high admission rate to our acute hospitals reflected the possible deficiencies in outpatient, <Col N="606" /> clinic and domiciliary services such as are available.  The increasing demand in hospitals is being experienced in other countries also.  I can assure Deputies, who seem to suggest that the large numbers going to our hospitals are due to inefficiency or inadequate medical service, that they are not right in what they say.  In the US there are 150 admissions per 1,000 of the population; in Sweden, where there are superbly organised health and hospital services there are 140 admissions per 1,000.  We are in the same bracket as Norway with between 110 and 120 admissions per 1,000. Denmark is somewhat higher.  The British figures are lower but they are restrained by very long waiting lists for non-urgent acute conditions which, generally speaking, do not apply to the acute hospitals here except in the case of ear, nose and throat departments and one or two others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that figure.  I wish to make it clear also that in regard to hospital charges to private patients there is still an element of subsidisation by the State towards the maintenance of purely private patients.  That is a fact.  Even though hospital charges have gone up there is still an element of subsidisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Various Deputies mentioned the need for more hospital, county home, and mental hospital construction and so I should point out that in the list of schemes which have either been completed since 1971 or are at various stages of construction but in the case of all of which building can commence in either this or the next financial year, there are 62 schemes relating to general hospitals for additions, improvements or construction of one kind or another; there are 36 schemes affecting accommodation of old age persons, 32 mental hospital schemes, 23 mentally handicapped schemes and 41 schemes for the improvement of accommodation of staff, mostly nurses.  We are making some progress in providing better hospital facilities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore referred to the denigration of religious orders which is now a very popular form of sport in certain circles.  We owe a great deal to the religious orders in our country for their help in hospital services, domiciliary services and in connection with the mentally handicapped.  I regard as absolutely disastrous this attack on religious establishments by a great many people who should know better and who do not produce any alternative. I would suggest that anyone who wants to secularise everything overnight, as an ideal panacea for all ills, should go to certain countries where everything has been secularised. They can then come back and tell us if they like what they see.  They can come back and argue it after they have been to the countries where everything has been duly secularised.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore asked about the long term plan for federated hospitals and voluntary hospitals.  The arrangements are in train to develop a great hospital at St. James to replace Sir Patrick Dun's, Baggot Street and Mercers Hospitals. It will take a very considerable time to accomplish all this and in the meantime it is hoped to provide certain medical facilities at St. James Hospital which are urgently needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need go into the question of the disposal of the property of St. Vincent's Hospital.  All of this has been published in the newspapers. <Col N="608" /> By an agreement made with the late Donagh O'Malley the nuns were permitted to use for themselves the proceeds of the sale of some of the property and for the property at 96 Leeson Street they agreed that the funds should be handed back to the State.  That is an arrangement which I intend to keep.</P>
    <P>I am afraid it is not possible for me to change the names of hospitals associated with cancer&mdash;I quite undestand what Deputy O'Connell meant &mdash;but neither can we afford to alter the position in relation to cancer patients and have all cancer patients treated in a great general hospital. Neither of those schemes is practical at the moment.</P>
    <P>Maternity hospital accommodation is under very active consideration. We have communicated with the masters of the maternity hospitals here and a programme is emerging.  If the Deputies choose to read the census, they will find that it would have been difficult for the Central Statistics Office, in the light of the figures available between 1966 and 1969, to predict the upsurge of births which has taken place during the past three years.  If they study the history of efforts to calculate the future population of England and Wales, they will find it an extraordinarily difficult task.  We are now on to this problem and we will have the necessary maternity accommodation made available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the under-staffing of Cavan Surgical Hospital and the serious fire hazard there.  The North Eastern Health Board have been endeavouring to find alternative accommodation for the patients and staff of the surgical hospital at Cavan where there is a fire hazard.  The CEO is making arrangements to discontinue the use of the north wing comprising various numbers of beds and so forth. The intake of patients in this hospital is being relieved temporarily by referring County Cavan patients to the hospital at Navan or the County Hospital in Dundalk.  The object is to reduce the fire hazard to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke asked when a college of nursing will be established.  This is <Col N="609" /> being examined by An Bord Altranais, which is the body appropriate for this purpose.  I have expressed the view that a college of nursing will be essential with special training in management. I am awaiting the report from An Bord Altranais on this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne in a very long speech referred to the imbalance of beds between the north side and the south side of Dublin.  While it is true that it is customary to think of the hospital development being in some way bounded on either side by the Liffey, I do not think that this is necessarily the best way of looking at the entire situation.  The Liffey must not be regarded as a Berlin Wall or an Iron Curtain.  It is spanned by numerous bridges and I do not think we could continue to make comparisons between hospital developments north and south of the Liffey.  We want to make quite sure that there is a right kind of hospital development to suit the population generally in the various areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne claimed that tests of an emergency nature could not be done on Saturdays and Sundays because of the five-day week for laboratory technicians. This is actually not so.  There are and there have been for a long time on call stand-by arrangements in operation for laboratory technicians and other key para-medical staff.  When the stand-by requirements are needed, they can be put into force.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne made a long song and dance about St. Laurence's Hospital. All I can say is that the scheme of improvements in St. Laurence's Hospital, now in progress includes a new neuro-surgical theatre, a new X-ray department and ancillary accommodation, new lifts, an extension of the out-patients department, an extension of the nurses' home, electrical re-wiring and fire precaution measures and being planned is the replacement of the boiler plant and centralisation.  I can say without fear of contradiction that St. Laurence's Hospital has received very ample capital assistance as a result of arrangements which have been sanctioned by me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to patients <Col N="610" /> suffering a financial penalty by choosing their own hospitals.  He should know that eligible patients are liable for no charges if they receive treatment in a public ward in a health board hospital or a hospital to which they are admitted with the approval of the health board.  There is a choice within the range of health board hospitals and hospitals with which the health board has a deeming arrangement. There is, therefore, no question of a charge arising for an eligible patient unless he decides to be a private patient or goes of his own accord without the agreement of the health board to a hospital with which they do not operate a deeming arrangement.  I understand that in the case of the North Eastern Health Board they were in respect of certain matters going to deem Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  The Deputy is a member of the board and it is a matter of a board decision.  If certain people in the health board area have to pay if they go to the Lourdes Hos-pital&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, as the Minister is aware, another hospital in Drogheda, the Cottage Hospital and there are a number of hospitals in Dublin which treat County Meath patients.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to fire hazards in hospitals. We emphasise to health boards their responsibility in ensuring that hospital buildings under their control are examined regularly by the local fire officer.  Fire fighting equipment is inspected and tested regularly.  We try <Col N="611" /> to ensure that regular fire drills take place and that hospitals are patrolled regularly at night and proper records of all matters pertaining to fire drills kept.  We have drawn attention to fire protection standards set out by the Department of Local Government. Every year some of the capital fund of my Department is spent on improving the fire precaution arrangements in hospitals and undertaking rebuilding where required.  When we meet the chief executive officers one of our duties will be to go over with them again the whole question of firefighting and fire hazards in order to ensure that everything possible is done to obviate the danger of fires in our institutions.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell told us of the fire risks in Nenagh Hospital.  The Deputy said that there was only one nurse on night duty to cater for 40 patients.  The Deputy was wrongly informed.  There are normally six nurses employed on night duty at this hospital, which has an average daily bed occupancy of 93. In addition, special nurses are engaged to look after seriously ill patients.  The matron considers that the arrangements are satisfactory.  This is a modern hospital which was built in the 1930s.  It is built of fire-resisting materials.  Deputy O'Connell was given incorrect information in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with many of the points made by Deputies, with the major policy decisions of my Department and with the criticism applied thereto.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few comments I want to make.  I am sure that the Minister is as anxious as anybody else to get the business concluded. Earlier today we discussed a matter which came under the heading of the Department of Finance with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister <Col N="612" /> for Finance, Deputy Lemass.  I commented that there was not much point in voting extra money to the Local Loans Fund if it was impossible to get the Minister for Local Government to use it for the purpose for which it was needed.  I referred particularly to a number of schemes which seemed to have got lost in the Department, having been submitted there some time ago by Meath County Council.  If the Minister has an opportunity when replying, perhaps he would let me know what has happened to them.  The Minister might prefer to let me know in writing later what has happened. It is unfair to ask the Minister to give a reply tonight on these matters.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the sewerage scheme for Mornington, which was on the priority list submitted by the Meath County Council and timed to start in 1971.  It is well into 1972 now and it has not been found possible to sanction the working drawings in the Department of Local Government. The result is that the county council have found it impossible to advertise for tenders.  This can only be described as ridiculous.  There is no reason why the working drawings should remain unattended in the Department of Local Government for such a long time.</P>
      <P>A housing scheme for Donore, County Meath, was submitted.  The Minister has short-circuited some of the housing arrangements by allowing groups of less than six houses to be built, provided they fit into the general pattern of finance which he sanctioned for local authorities.  The Minister allows such small schemes to be proceeded with without specific sanction from his Department.  This in itself is a help.  It is no help when the schemes are held up for a considerable period when they are first submitted, or when contracts have been sent to the Department and are held up.  The Minister has agreed that the schemes can be proceeded with once they reach the contract stage.  The Donore scheme is one of about 20 houses.  It was submitted to the Department and everything was prepared for the financing of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any good reason why there <Col N="613" /> should be a delay of several months in the Department of Local Government? I understand that two queries were sent back last October.  They were simple queries and were dealt with quickly.  The Minister appreciates more than most people that, if a contractor gives a price for a scheme in September or October, 1971, and does not get permission to go ahead until September or October, 1972, he cannot be blamed if he says that prices have risen so much in the meantime that he is not prepared to agree to do the job at the original price.  The variation clause allows him to collect a substantial amount of money.  This extra money will eventually come to be paid by the taxpayers of the county.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression that the Local Loans Fund allocation must have been spent and that there was no leeway.  I felt that the Minister was possibly waiting for a Bill such as the one which passed through here today before making the money available. Deputy Lemass pointed out that that was not so and, in fact, that there was a further £37 million which had not been dealt with.  There must be some other reason.  Perhaps the Minister would let me know why he has not sanctioned the Donore scheme and why it has been necessary to leave it so long while people are badly in need of houses.  Is it not an idle boast to talk about the efforts of the Government to house people while this sort of thing is delayed so long?</P>
    <P>The Donore scheme is the biggest one we have in Meath.  There are a number of other schemes at various stages.  A report from the Meath county officials says that the schemes are awaiting sanction from the Department of Local Government.  When we asked the officials what was happening we were told that they wrote to or phoned the Department and were told the matter was under consideration and a reply would be given soon.  Is that not a ridiculous way to do business?  Is there anyone in commercial life who could carry on business under conditions like that?  Schemes are going to be sanctioned or they are not going to be sanctioned.  There is no reason why anybody&mdash;and here the Minister <Col N="614" /> must take the blame whether he is responsible or not&mdash;should prevent people being rehoused, people who badly need houses, while somebody in the Department says he has not got time simply to put the document on the Minister's table so that he can sign at the bottom of the page and let the scheme proceed.  Maybe I am being unfair to the Minister.</P>

There is no reason why it should be held up for so long.  The whole question of housing and re-housing has been debated by so many Deputies that I do not want to go into it again.

      <P>The lovely thing about Deputy Timmons is that he can have his figures exactly right but he cannot put one person into a house any quicker, and by supporting the keeping of Dublin Corporation out of existence he and his party are ensuring that nobody else will help them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Our people in Dublin Corporation were men enough to stand for their principles, but, of course, principles do not matter very much in some quarters of this House. Several Ministers, including the Ministre for Local Government, have over the last few days been giving the number of houses that have been built and talking about the records that have been created.  Somebody tried to excuse the drop in housing earlier this year because of the bank strike a couple of years ago.  Somebody else attributed it to the cement strike. One excuse is as good as another. I should like to put this on the record. In 1967-68, in the Republic, the local authorities built 4,045 houses; 7,972 other houses were built, giving a total of 12,017 houses; in 1968-69, 4,613 local authority houses; 8,420 others; total, 13,033; in 1969-70, 4,706 local authority houses; 8,938 others; total, 13,644; 1970-71, 3,875 local authority; 9,796 others; total, 13,671.  That is the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The really extraordinary thing about this is that while we criticise what is happening in the North and the unfair treatment given to people up there, in the year 1971 in the Six Counties 13,916 houses were built, which was 2,082 more than the previous year; and while 4,701 were built for owner occupation, 9,213 were built for renting. This means that there were more <Col N="616" /> than twice as many built for public renting than there were for private, while here it was the other way round in the ratio 3 to 1.  We are told that the people in charge of housing on this side of the Border are doing their share to house those who are unable to house themselves.  This I find very hard to believe.  It is only fair to give the figures for 1971-72: 5,106 local authority; 10,815 others; total, 15,921. This is a big increase on the previous year.  It is here that the cement strike comes in, because the previous year the cement strike cut down substantially on the number of houses built and the increase was due to the finishing of those houses and to the building of new ones that were built in the ordinary way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>And the introduction of the guaranteed order project which provides an additional 1,000 houses on top of the normal number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will let me finish I shall prick that Balloon for him.  The only way to get a fair average is to add the two years together.  If they went down one year, they came up the next year.  They went down because of the cement strike and came up again because the cement started to flow freely again; the houses that were half-built were completed and, therefore, the number went up. However, the average for the two years for local authority houses was less than 4,500, while in the previous full year the number was 4,706.  Therefore, despite what the Minister says about the extra 1,000 houses, the figure has gone the other way and the average over the two years shows us a smaller number of houses built than were built in any of the previous three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the Minister for Local Government is as anxious as anybody else to see everybody in the country properly housed&mdash;he would be a fool if he was not&mdash;but, in spite of that, neither he nor the Government seem to be able to appreciate the fact that since costs have gone up substantially, there is no point in talking about an extra percentage of money given for housing, because in all cases so far this has been swallowed up by additional costs and <Col N="617" /> the number of houses being built is not as great.</P>
    <P>I would ask that an effort be made to treat this as a national problem, because apparently it is not being so treated.  With over 60,000 people still unemployed, surely the logical thing to do was to put a lot of extra money into public building.  It was done here before and at that time solved the problem. The result would be that quite a lot of extra houses would be built and the economy would improve because people would be drawing a week's wages which they badly need at the present time.</P>
    <P>I notice that today the Minister notified the general public of an improvement in the facilities for getting loans for house building.  I compliment him on having made that decision, but I regret the fact that he did not make the announcement here.  We often hear it said outside the House that the authority and importance of Dáil Éireann seem to be dwindling, and that the action is on the streets.  If Ministers of State continue to make important announcements at what James Dillon, who used to grace those benches for Fine Gael, used to call every dinner and dog fight, instead of in this House, can we blame those who say that the Government do not treat this House as if it were as important as it used to be?</P>
    <P>With regard to the improvement in borrowing facilities, would the Minister not agree that over the years two things have been badly wrong?  One is that if somebody wants to build a house and has reached the stage where he feels that he cannot afford to build a house, he finds that his income is considered by the Department as being too high to borrow money.  While the Minister's assistance in this matter today is welcome, it does not go far enough because he is still precluding from borrowing from the local authorities many people who would be only too glad to build if they got the facilities.</P>
    <P>The other side of it is that, for the purpose of getting a supplementary grant, people must show a relatively low income.  Why are not the two the <Col N="618" /> same?  Why is the low income provision maintained because in order to qualify for the grant they produce the lowest possible figure and then find that they are caught when they try to borrow money, or is that the object of the exercise?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that there is £100 for each dependant of an applicant for a supplementary grant which increases the minimum income limit by another £400.  There is £100 available for each child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister knows quite well&mdash;or should know if he does not&mdash;that the man who is getting married and wants to build a house cannot find the extra four.  He has to wait a few years for them.  Therefore, he does not get that facility.  Perhaps the Minister would not know anything about that yet.  The person is stuck.  He gets the grant on his own income.  He has no extra four.  The limit is the limit and that is it.  I am talking in particular about the young man who is about to get married, or who has got married, and wants to build a house.  I believe some effort should be made to facilitate him.</P>
      <P>I wonder why the Minister has not brought in some regulation which would preclude spec builders from collaring the Department's share of the grant for the house.  Even though they may reduce the price of the house by doing that, and the Minister may say it does not make any difference, they still advertise a price which is not correct.  They have alrady collected £325 which, by right, belongs to the man who is buying the house.  They take it off the price and say they are selling the house at, say, £5,000 when, in fact, the price is £5,325.  It would be well worthwhile looking into this.  I do not see any reason why they should be allowed to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>How did the Minister deal with it?  It does not seem to have been stopped.  I would consider it was dealt with if it was stopped.  It has not been stopped.  It is still being done <Col N="619" /> and, therefore, it does not appear to have been dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as we know where we stand.  I want to deal now with the question of differential rents. Differential rents in local authority housing are a big problem.  For years this system has been in operation in the cities and larger towns.  As a result of the efforts of Deputy Blaney, it was introduced at county council level over the past few years&mdash;since 31st October, 1969, I think.  The result is that people living in county council cottages are now paying on a differential rent system. The man in my constituency, 45 miles from Dublin, who gets up at 6 o'clock in the morning and drives into town in a car on which he has to pay tax, insurance, and so on, works hard on a building site all day, arrives home at 9 o'clock at night and gets £24 or £25 a week gross wage packet, finds his rent fixed on those gross wages. Although my council agreed that the Minister should be asked to allow the first £2 to be taken off the wages before the differential rent system was operated, the Minister refused to sanction that and said £1 was enough.</P>
      <P>The man starts off with £25 and £1 is taken off that.  His rent is then £3 per week.  He is now allowed to take 10s off for each child but he still finds that he is paying that rent plus rates.  We have the extraordinary situation that people living in rural Ireland, as well as having to pay for travelling up and down to work&mdash;and if they are coming to Dublin it is expensive; it may be costing them as much as £3 or £4 a week&mdash;have to pay up to £4 per week for a county council cottage which until two or three years ago was let at under £1 and for which ten years earlier the average rent was about 2/6d. The Minister being a reasonable man should see that this is terribly unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> In an effort to alleviate the hardship which is being caused to people who feel they are throwing money down the drain, Meath County Council submitted to the Department a scheme for vesting those houses.  As he was in relation to the housing scheme and the sewerage scheme to which I referred, the Minister was so busy that, although the plan has been in the Department for about six months he has not got around to putting his name at the bottom of a sheet of paper and these people cannot purchase the houses because the scheme cannot be put into operation.  If this is not ridiculous nonsense, perhaps the Minister would like to tell me what it is when he is replying. What reason is there for holding up a simple scheme like this month after month in the Department and doing nothing about it?  The people are dissatisfied with the rents they are paying. They want to vest the houses and they cannot do so because the Minister feels it is not important.  It is not important to him and, therefore, it is not important to anybody else.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of house building, let me also refer to the fact that recently the Meath County Council and Navan Urban Council decided to build a joint scheme of 120 houses in Navan.  They were supposed to be low cost houses.  Under some extraordinary arrangement which the Department have a low cost tender submitted by a sizeable contractor in this city was for £600 more per house than the tenders submitted by local contractors for houses in the county. He got the contract and we were told that the National Building Agency would be responsible for the finances. The scheme was started and now&mdash; to use the word used by the Minister for Finance&mdash;every lumper in the country is arriving to do bits of the job. It is like a railway station with people moving in and out of the site.  They are dismissed so quickly that there is hardly time for the next lot to come in.  If this is the way the Department feel that housing schemes should be dealt with, they will have to change their ideas.  In this country trade union wages and conditions have been laid down at a fairly high cost.  Nobody wants to go back to the idea that <Col N="621" /> somebody can come on to a scheme and that it does not matter what type of work he does, and he can pull out when the job is done.  Nobody is responsible. Responsibility is passed from one to the other.</P>
    <P>This has been taken up with Meath County Council by Navan Trades Council who were very annoyed about the whole set-up and I understand that the Minister has been asked for his views by the county council.  I believe that responsibility for the running of these schemes must rest with the Department and, for the life of me, I cannot see why somebody should be allowed to call a scheme a low-cost scheme if it is costing more than the average house to build.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is being less than honest because he is not comparing like with like.  He is comparing some small scheme built for £600 less with the price of this scheme.  They are two different sites and contracts of different sizes.  There is no likeness between the two, as the Deputy well knows, and it is dishonest to give the impression that the guaranteed order project is not enabling local authorities to construct houses at a great saving to themselves because there is up to 12½ per cent saving generally on the operation of the guaranteed order project since it started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the rules of the House do not permit me to describe what the Minister has said in the correct way.  I cannot say that it is a lie but I can say that it is untrue. Not alone is it untrue but the scheme I am citing is on a level site, and if the Minister tries to tell me or anybody else that it is dearer per house to build 120 houses than to build 20 he knows very little about building construction.  He can work that out for himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken up the point I was about to make. The only difference is that the scheme of houses started now would have a slight difference over the scheme started six months earlier&mdash;I am prepared to give him that&mdash;but not to the extent of £600 per house and the houses earlier were not considered a low cost scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows well the one I am now talking about because there is only one Navan and he should not have any difficulty with that.  When he checks it out, he will know what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter I want to refer to is the matter of expenditure on roads. The Minister has had handed down to him a legacy in the form of a system which I thought he might change and I suggest that he consider changing it, if he is here long enough.  This is the system adopted some years ago by which, if a road was black-topped, it was considered to be in good order. We had in our county an excellent engineer but he had the idea that every road in the county should be tarred. Eventually we reached the stage at which he had every road tarred and as soon as that was done, no matter what the alignment was like, no matter how many turns there were on it, or how narrow the road was, the Department decided that the road was up to a certain standard and refused to give the county any further county road grants.  If he had decided to do it the other way, we could very easily have been drawing county road grants for a considerable period.  The first year <Col N="623" /> we lost £98,000 and we have been losing substantial amounts since.</P>
    <P>The bad snag about it is that this had the result that a substantial number of county council roadworkers lost their jobs.  We now have the situation that whereas 15 years ago there were 1,650 roadworkers, we now have less than 450, and this has been the pattern throughout the country.  I believe that a mistake has been made, that more than the tarring of roads should be taken into consideration, and grants should be given for the purpose of having county roads better done because we have the extraordinary situation in which main roads, arterial roads, are being brought up to a very high standard while the feeder roads, because the necessary money is not available, have of necessity to be left in a pretty bad state.  This could be avoided.  I think the Department might try to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I wonder why something has not been done about deciding on priorities with regard to roads.  It is nearly seven years since they started to decide on the roads which were the most important, but we find that some roads are carrying a very heavy load of traffic for which no grant is given because somebody has decided that they are not important.  When one asks for a decision in this regard, one is told that there are other things to be done and eventually they get around to deciding on the priority which a road should get.  The result is that these roads are left and then, in the summer time particularly, it is found that some of these roads to and from the coast are unable to carry the traffic and it does not appear to be possible to get any money to spend on them at all.</P>
    <P>Signposting is something which I have mentioned here on a number of occasions.  Local authorities should be notified every year in the spring that there is no point in having signposts of any kind&mdash;whether they are notices about the type of road, bad corners or narrow bridges&mdash;if there is an inch of dirt on the signs.  Surely it is not too much to ask local authorities to wash the signs?  If they have not got <Col N="624" /> the price of the paint to paint them, the least they could do is to wash them so that people can read the directions. I know that we have the vandals to whom reference has already been made who think it is a great thing to throw stones at signs of every kind and worse than that, and I was a victim of it myself a couple of weeks ago, to turn the signpost around and point it in the wrong direction.  Local authorities should be warned that even if there are not many tourists in the country this year, a situation in which a tourist who comes along watching for signs and follows such a signpost, only to find that he has gone ten to 20 miles out of his way, is not good enough and an effort should be made by the local authorities at a reasonable time to check these signposts and set them in the right direction.  They have officials who travel around from one area to another and they should be able to see these things.</P>
    <P>I have referred also to another very simple matter&mdash;some people may not consider it terribly important but every Member of the House who drives in the country will agree that it is important&mdash;the matter of an effort being made to ensure that, even on the narrow roads, there is a proper view provided at corners.  It may simply mean cutting down a bit of a tree, a bush or high grass.  Those of us who travel around a lot find that there are many places where the view is completely obscured by reason of the fact that whoever is responsible for the area does not cut down the grass or whatever other obstruction it may be. Many accidents can be avoided by having this done properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to place on record my appreciation of the Minister's speech which covered a wide range of matters affecting the lives of the people.  Deputy Tully was critical of the fact that a statement by the Minister was not made inside the House.  The Minister availed of a very appropriate opportunity to make his statement, the opening of an additional block to the Father Scully housing complex in Gardiner Street.  The Government subscribed towards it but it was <Col N="625" /> largely a voluntary effort.  I, indirectly, was involved in helping towards the achievement of their aims.  I have been a long time interested in public affairs. I have seen Governments come and go. When there was a Coalition Government there were Ministers speaking on various topics but, unfortunately, they spoke in divers tongues.  I do not think Deputy Tully should be critical of the Minister for Local Government for availing of an opportunity that presented itself to announce very welcome improvements in the eligibility limits for loans and grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>More recently than that I heard Ministers speaking in divers tongues&mdash;Haughey, Boland and Blaney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statement of the Minister in regard to the increase in the income limits for loans and grants.  The ceiling is being raised.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister, when replying, to deal with corporation tenants.  As the result of economic development, circumstances of corporation tenants improve and they may like to buy a new house but for that purpose they are restricted to the income level fixed by the Department and overtime is taken into account.  If their income exceeds the statutory limit they do not get the supplementary grant. The Minister should be generous and waive that requirement in relation to corporation tenants who wish to purchase new houses.  This would mean that the vacated houses would be available for those on the waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his introductory statement the Minister referred to the appalling rate of road accidents&mdash;a matter with which we are all concerned.  The events that are taking place in the other part of the country are headlined in the newspapers but there is an equivalent number of persons being killed or injured on the roads in this part of the country and that fact passes unnoticed.  The number of deaths on the road average ten per week and there are thousands being injured.  I would ask the Minister to tell us whether he envisages any positive policy being implemented to arrest these road accidents that affect <Col N="626" /> so many families.  I would ask him to consider approaching the petrol companies who advertise on television and represent speed as the optimum.  These advertisements lead to an irresponsible attitude on the part of motorists that is reflected in road accidents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>These multi-millionaire companies have a grave responsibility. I should like to see them devoting money to the promotion of road safety rather than to advertising the speed potential of their product.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully was critical of what had been done in regard to housing. I did not make an exact note of his remarks.  I am sure he will bear with me.  In the last few years there was a financial squeeze and a cement strike but considerable progress was made in the matter of housing.  We can all argue about figures but the figures for Dublin city show that while in one year a smaller number of tenancy houses were built, a large number of purchase houses were provided.  It is very desirable that people should be encouraged to buy their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A constituent of mine recently told me that the rent he was being charged was almost £8 a week, representing between one-fourth and one-fifth of his income.  It used to be accepted that one-sixth of income was the correct proportion.  There should be an examination of the high rents that are being charged.  In some cases they are as high as £7 and £8 a week.  A man and his wife must have a family in order to qualify for a corporation house.  Such a high rent is an unfair burden to impose on a man with a wife and two children.  There should be an examination of the rents structure which causes such dissatisfaction in the city.  The system of rents should be restructured so as to relieve the burden on young people with increasing family responsibilities.  In some of the more mature areas of the city the rents are not as high as they are in the new estates which are so far removed from the city centre.  Persons in these estates must also bear the <Col N="627" /> cost of transport to the city and suffer the shortcomings that new estates experience while awaiting the provision of full services.</P>
    <P>I welcome the discussions taking place today between the representatives of NATO and the Dublin city manager. I hope they will prove fruitful.  I know the corporation officials are sympathetic to the tenants generally and that they are doing their best to help them. There are anomalies in the rents structure which create problems.  I do not wish to go into the matter in any great detail except to say that I hope today's discussions will help to relieve the situation generally.</P>
    <P>There are only one or two other points I wish to raise and they affect north-east Dublin.  One refers to unfinished estates.  There are some defects in the Planning Acts and the developers do not measure up to their responsibilities.  Residents' associations in some cases take extreme action.  I have been at a number of meetings in Coolock where there has been a probblem extending over the past seven years.  I did not advise the residents to do so but others did and extreme action was resorted to with the result that a number of cases are to come before the courts arising from unfinished development.  I suggest that the Minister should arm local authorities with sufficient powers to prevent such situations arising.  I might say it is very embarrassing, particularly for a member of the Government party, to attend these meetings at which other people who have a different point of view seem to hold one responsible for some defect in legislation which went unnoticed at the time.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of open spaces in corporation estates.  Dublin Corporation have power to provide generous open spaces in housing estates but there is a defect regarding the provision of facilities for young people to undress.  Many of these open spaces lack pavilions and I was approached some months ago by responsible people in Coolock where there is a fine open space but no facilities for young people who have to undress in the open because of the absence of a <Col N="628" /> pavilion.  I hope this will be provided immediately.  The official view of the Department is that this is a long term matter.  It took many years to provide such facilities in Fairview Park and the same applies to Donnycarney and other localities.  I suggest that pavilion facilities should be provided and that they should be included in contracts.  This would eliminate a lot of discontent in the communities concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the housing programme.  In Dublin there has been consistent progress but we have had the backlash of migration from the provinces which has aggravated our problem.  We are doing our best to deal with it, notwithstanding the present lack of a platform&mdash;there is no city council&mdash;to discuss the matter. The corporation are making great inroads in the matter of housing not alone in the provision of houses for people with young families but also on a purchase basis.  They also provide sites on which people can build their own houses.  I understand 1,500 have already been provided and that large areas have been made available in Finglas, Tallaght and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In this respect nobody can point a finger of criticism at the Government's record in regard to housing in this city.  As one who has been in public life for many years and who has witnessed the slum areas of Dublin, I can say that the Government's record has been excellent.  I listened to James Larkin at a public meeting at the corner of Cathal Brugha Street congratulating the people on their patience at that time and on how they brought up their families in such appalling conditions.  There were great families brought up in those areas, ten of them to a house.  Thank God we had Fianna Fáil Governments through the years to eliminate all of that from our city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a few points that affect my constituency, County Mayo and the west of Ireland in general.  The county rate in Mayo this year is £8.25 in the £.  We have to pay £2.80 in the £ for roads, 26p <Col N="629" /> for public assistance, 23p for sanitary services, 63p for general purposes and so on.  The rate in Mayo is very high. Mayo is an isolated county, far removed from this capital city.  Last night I attended an estimates meeting in Castlebar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham) Liam Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy was there on Sunday as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we had something in the region of £45,000 which could not be collected.  We had given relief in rates to the tune of £51,000. The ratepayers in Mayo face an impossible burden.  I do not know how small shopkeepers will survive.  The supermarkets are helping to kill them just as the burden of the rates is helping to kill them.  The policy seems to be &ldquo;super&rdquo; everything&mdash;in commerce, in health, in education and everything else.  All this must have a deleterious effect on a county like Mayo.</P>
      <P>We have the worst roads in the country.  We have 950 miles of untarred roads.  Because of the increased cost of machinery, labour, materials and everything else less work is being done on the roads.  Every week I have anything up to ten young lads coming to me looking for work.  I write to the engineers but there is no work available. The only solution for these young lads is emigration to do seasonal work in Britain.  That is how they manage to survive and how they manage to help their families.  That is the pattern all over the west of Ireland, including the Parliamentary Secretary's county, over which I travelled extensively during the by-election.</P>
      <P>The Minister's family originated in County Mayo and I should like him to give a little more consideration to the people in Mayo.  Outside the county one can travel at 60 to 80 miles an hour on the road; inside the county one has to reduce speed by at least 25 miles an hour if one wishes to survive. The grants given are utterly inadequate. Recently on radio I had occasion to speak about the condition of the roads leading to Knock shrine.  Thousands of pilgrims and tourists visit this shrine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> Access roads to the shrine are in a shocking condition.  Recently a decision was taken to change the primary roads. On whose authority was this decision taken?  The road to Roscommon and Ballyhaunis was a first-class primary road.  Why has it been changed?  I doubt if any other part of the country carries the number of pilgrims and tourists that Mayo carries to Knock shrine.  Every year the number is increasing. Special grants should be given for the roads in this area.</P>
    <P>The roads at the moment are in a dangerous condition and serious accidents have occurred despite the care taken by motorists.  The Minister will have to insist that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, gives him sufficient money to have the roads properly surfaced.  The Minister may say that increased grants are available.  Really these grants are useless.  They are barely sufficient to scratch the surface.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal from the Government about the marvellous work Fianna Fáil Governments have done in the matter of housing.  Our houses in the west are as good, if not better, than houses in many other parts of the country.  A great many of the houses in Mayo were built with the money sent home by emigrants from Britain and the United States of America.  The Government did not help in any way to provide those houses but, thank God, in the west of Ireland we have a great number of them.  Yet, we have many people there needing houses but the people to whom my sympathy goes out now are the young men wishing to get married and set up homes for themselves.  How can a young man who gets a job at £20 or £30 a week and has so much income tax deducted buy a site and build a house and face a debt of £3,000 loan on a small salary and also rear a family?  Let us be realistic.</P>
    <P>The grants the Minister's Department are giving are nothing more than a bonus to a contractor and until the Minister realises that at least £1,500 in grants should be given in those cases, particularly to a young married man prepared to build his own house, the situation will not improve.  It is that type of man who is determined to live <Col N="631" /> in this country who is an asset and should be looked after.  Raising the figure from £3,000 to £3,400 is not sufficient.  I have five young lads and I wonder what will be their situation when they grow up.  How will they fare if they have to go to the Department or the local authority, first raise a loan of £3,500 to build a house, then pay interest on that loan, pay rates which at present are £8.30 and which will be £10 in a few years in County Mayo? How can they rear families there?  It is completely beyond their capacity.  The Minister is a west of Ireland man and knows all these problems and he should consider this.  I consider it a most appalling situation into which to put our youth in the future.  I do not know what will happen as a result.</P>
    <P>While we have accepted many modern American ideas, if a young man wants to marry, no matter what debt he incurs or how he will pay it, he must get a house.  If he has to wait to save half the amount of money needed to build that house he will be an old man before he will be able to save it under modern conditions.  I am not satisfied with the grants that are payable which are only a bonus to a contractor. The young man with the wage to which I have referred does not get the increased grant, even though he has an extreme housing problem, until he gets married but it is not so easy to marry until your house is built.  Regardless of the extreme housing problem you cannot get this increased grant, this £900, until you have your house built and, further, until you are married and in that house.  This is poor help for the young man who has to provide a home, get married and live on a small salary when he is crippled with income tax at the beginning.  There is no time in a young man's or woman's life when he or she needs money more than in the first four or five years after starting work in order to set up a home.  This is and should be the ambition of every young boy and girl, as I am sure it is.</P>
    <P>We have several housing problems in County Mayo.  The amount we have paid out in reconstruction and supplemental grants in the county is nobody's <Col N="632" /> business.  All these have been availed of but we have a declining population and as a result there are many old people and essential repair grants have to be given.  Also, prefabricated houses have to be provided for these old people for the few years left to them.  I must tell the Minister there has been a slight delay in his Department in sanctioning some of these things, particularly the prefabricated houses for elderly people in Mayo.  There was also a delay in regard to local authority housing in my town, Claremorris.  A few years ago we applied to the Department for sanction to build ten council houses and the Department would sanction only six. We have three industries there at present. A tender was accepted for the six houses a year ago and then the contractor pulled out.  Therefore, the six houses are now as far from being built as they were three years ago although the land was acquired about five years ago.</P>
    <P>If this is the system we are asked to tolerate it is about time there was some way of dealing with a contractor who tenders for houses and then pulls out in three or four months if he is dissatisfied.  There should be some penalty.  We are only depriving young men with large families of housing. This sort of thing must stop.  We are trying to provide serviced sites in Kiltimagh, Swinford, Ballyhaunis, Foxford and Charlestown.  The Minister has made a regulation against ribbon development and has said that you must not have extra access to first class primary roads or second class primary roads.  How can you expect a young man, where there is not a serviced site available, to go into a town or urban area and pay £500, £600 or £1,000 for a site when he can get one in the country for a few hundred pounds? The Minister will insist on implementing the county development plan.  How can he expect this man to buy a site for £1,000 in a town in County Mayo?  Nobody matters as much as the young man who is prepared to get a job, live in this country and get married.  He is the man who should be looked after.  He has my sympathy because he is facing the future with a great burden.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> I come now to the question of water and sewerage.  The Minister for Local Government gives us a certain amount of money for water and sewerage. Kilkelly, in my constituency, has a population of 900 people.  They have been looking for sewerage for 12 years and still have not got it.  The Minister will probably say the local authority are responsible.  I can assure him they are not responsible.  If the money were given to us we could do these things. I would like the Minister to say: &ldquo;We have not got the money&rdquo;.  I discussed a similar matter with the Minister for Health in the House last week and he said: &ldquo;We have any amount of money for health&rdquo;.  I do not want any Minister to say something that I believe is wrong.  He should give us the facts and not play a political game. We are all public representatives and we must be honest with the people who support us.  If the Minister responsible is honest with us and if we get the facts we can go back and our people will accept that the money is not there but there is no use in bluffing.  It is the duty of every local authority to provide those services.  If they fall down the responsibility must rest with the Minister or with that local authority. There are many delays in the sanctioning of group water schemes too.  I should like the Minister to sanction group water schemes as quickly as he can.  He has generously increased the grants.  I must compliment him on that. There is no use in criticising a man, a Government or a Department all the time.  Water is the most essential thing.  We need it first thing in the morning and last thing at night.</P>
    <P>I come now to the local improvements scheme.  In Mayo last year we got £140,000.  The Minister's allocation to us this year is £60,000.  We provided no money for drainage in the last few years.  That was a majority decision of the county council.  This year we allocated a quarter of the money for drainage. A sum of £15,000 for drainage in Mayo means nothing.  We got no grant towards arterial drainage.  We are facing entry into the EEC and the farmers have to buy expensive manures which can be washed away because the land is not drained.  I cannot understand <Col N="634" /> why the Minister reduced the amount this year.  This is something that affects our economy.  If we do not get sufficient money for drainage there is no use in farmers putting manure on their lands because it will be washed away.  All political parties on Mayo County Council are sadly disappointed with the Minister.  I would ask him to increase that grant so that the farmers in Mayo will benefit.  The country as a whole will benefit from this scheme and it will be money well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention the Minister's announcement in relation to the increase in loans and the raising of the ceiling for supplementary grants and loans.  I should like to hear the Minister indicate that money will be available to meet the demand that now appears to be stimulated and which has, according to the Minister's figures, increased substantially over the past year.  It is very heartening that more people now tend to purchase their own homes.  The only regret I have is that more tenants of local authorities, particularly of Dublin Corporation, have not up to now purchased their homes.  However, the tenants' organisations are responsible to a large degree for inflicting severe hardship on quite a number of tenants. In the early stages of the scheme, there was a desire on the part of political parties and individuals in this House and in Dublin Corporation to ensure that the tenants of corporation houses would have an opportunity of purchasing their homes at a reasonable price. At that stage a very attractive scheme was launched by Dublin Corporation. Many people availed of it but not as many as members of the corporation at that time hoped.  The tenants' associations indicated that people should delay the purchase of their homes.  It is regrettable that many of these people are now asked to pay £1,000 more for their homes than they would have had to pay if they had purchased earlier. This is due to the stupidity of the tenants' organisations at that time, who tried to ensure that the scheme would be a failure.  The people who listened to them are now at a loss of something in the region of £1,000.  That is quite a substantial amount of money for a <Col N="635" /> corporation tenant to pay out of his own pocket.  Nevertheless, many of these people have now decided to purchase at the higher price because they consider there is still an amount of good value to be obtained.</P>
      <P>I want to say to the people who have made their applications to Dublin Corporation in the last few days, prior to the closing date, that it is in their interests to complete the purchase of their homes as soon as possible and so become owners of their homes and no longer hear the cries of people who wanted to wreck this scheme and deprive people of an opportunity to purchase their homes, namely the tenants' organisations.  I am sure many of these organisations have had second thoughts now.  Many of them are aware of the stupid mistakes they made and are aware that they created a great hardship for the weaker section of the community, the people who were offered houses at very good value at that early stage.  I want to say, nevertheless, that there has been a substantial number of applications for the purchase of houses in the corporation schemes which have been widely publicised recently, before any further increases take place.  As a public representative I would urge them to accept as soon as possible and ensure that they get this particular service and the opportunity to purchase their own homes at a reasonable rate.</P>
      <P>It is regretable that this happened. Every effort should now be made by responsible public representatives to ensure that when local authorities introduce realistic purchase schemes the tenants are advised of the merits of the schemes before it is too late, taking into consideration the type of situation which has been brought about by people who tried to wreck a particular scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is heartening to see so many people trying to purchase their own homes and to see the local authorities with this house purchase schemes.  The one which was launched by Dublin Corporation recently has, I understand, attracted several thousand applicants for the houses available on small deposits.  This further increase given <Col N="636" /> by the Minister will make the position even more attractive to corporation tenants, people on the approved waiting list and young people getting married in the future will have the opportunity of having a realistic loan available to purchase a house together with the other aids of the the local authorities and the State.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to point out in the city at the moment the operation of the land bank which has been of great benefit.  I hope it will continue and that it will get further support from the Minister.  Every effort should be made to ensure that a substantial land bank is available so that there can be continuity of the housing programme. Some houses now on the land bank are being sold at £4,700 and £4,800. People on the local authority waiting list, or existing tenants, have the opportunity of receiving a special grant of £200 and a special reduction of £200 in regard to the site.  They will also have the supplementary grant, which in general is £243, plus the larger loan which is now available.  This leads to a small deposit on houses started in recent times or on those about to start. Deposits in the future will be in the region of £600 to £700 for modestly priced houses.  I believe a number of those will be built.  The Minister should urge the city manager and Dublin Corporation to purchase more land which will be available for houses. There will thus be continuity in the building trade and we will have houses at a reasonable rate for those who need them.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, however, that the loan increase is a little bit late.  With the rise in wages which is likely to take place in the future this may be a way of short circuiting the situation because many people will get wage increases in the next few months and they will only qualify for the additional house facilities which are now given.  It is in the interests of those people who will qualify for a short period, for houses built between now and the time they get the increase, to ensure that they make their stand and purchase their own homes.  Those who feel they will go over the limits now set have at least the opportunity of <Col N="637" /> assessing the situation and purchasing at this stage.  While the increase was a generous one I would like to have seen it come some months ago.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the supplementary grant will be increased.  I have no more information than what I read in the paper.  It did not indicate any increase in the supplementary grant.  I hope this aspect of the situation will be reviewed from time to time and that it will not be allowed to drift on a long-term basis.  The last review was not too long ago but nevertheless there were substantial increases in living costs and also in the wages of the applicants.  There were some people outside the scope of the scheme because of that.  I hope the houses will be within the reach of people who could not purchase them before.  I fully support the corporation scheme for the purchase of houses and I urge people to avail of it.</P>
    <P>In relation to other factors there is the question of the planning authorities and the problems that impede this kind of development of which we have a number.  The most important is in relation to a two-months period which must elapse before the planning authority give a decision.  Some decision could be arrived at in 24 hours or 48 hours.  I do not see any reason why local authorities insist that they must take two months to consider a planning application.  Some planning applications should be considered within the two-months period.  The situation which has developed of looking for additional information makes the whole planning situation farcical. If they are not able to cope with the situation further personnel should be employed.  When there is greater production of houses and there is the desire of builders to build more houses they should not be impeded by the planning authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take serious consideration of the situation which has impeded many people.  Two months makes a big difference to a small builder but it also can make a difference to a big builder where sites are at stake.  If a man is held up for two months, and then a further two months, <Col N="638" /> because of additional information being required, the price of the site can go up considerably.  We often find that for some frivolous reason a planning application is turned down because two officials in the same Department do not see eye to eye with each other.  The person who makes the planning application suffers because of this. The consequence of that is that the price of houses rises simply because of a disagreement between two people working in the planning office.  One person does not want to go to the other in relation to some problem and it is knocked right away.  The whole situation in relation to planning applications should get urgent attention.  The situation where two months is insisted upon, together with this additional information, which now becomes part and parcel of the whole set up, makes the whole position, as I said before, farcical. Where small builders are concerned two or three months can be very damaging.  Attention must be given to this point.  Local authorities which have their own land banks and who are the planners in an area, where permission has been given to develop, should be able to give permission in hours rather than months.  The period for objections would be the only relevant one in such a situation.  Legislation should be introduced to ensure that where local authorities decide on a land bank project, where they own and develop the land, and lease it to small builders on a local authority basis, the housing concerned should be regarded as local authority housing and the third party objectors should not be able to impede the developments.</P>
    <P>In this city there were cases where people objected to every single planning application made in certain areas. Every application was opposed by one or two individuals for the purpose of impeding development or because a petty hobbyhorse of theirs was not getting the attention they felt it should get. Where third party objections are deliberate, the result is to keep people out of homes.  The Minister should ensure that this cannot happen.  People who need homes have been adversely affected by such third party objectors. Where land banks are concerned, the <Col N="639" /> Minister should ensure that third party objectors should be treated in a different manner to objectors to ordinary planning proposals.  Where there are land banks the land development is usually complete.  A lesser period of objection should be laid down where local authority housing is concerned. The longer period of objection results in a situation in which a person may have an unfair opportunity to object to some development because he does not like a particular contractor or a person who wants to carry out an addition to his home.  Amending legislation should be brought in to eliminate such delays.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have made great progress.  People have criticised their developments in recent times but they have a substantial programme under way.  At present they are building 2,194 houses.  It is desirable that we should indicate the type of progress being made in Dublin with the assistance of the Government, the Minister for Local Government, the city manager and the housing department. The situation is somewhat in hand.  I had hoped that the number of tenancy developments would have increased somewhat.  Nevertheless, the corporation have a fairly creditable record.  At the moment there are purchase schemes in three areas&mdash;Tallaght, Donaghmede and Finglas.  They represent a total of 1,024 dwellings.  Tenancy houses are being built at Kilbarrack East, Tallaght and Kilbarrack West 1 and 2.  They are also being built at Holylands, Rathfarnham and at Tallaght East and at Howth 4 and 5. They are being built in Finglas and at Kilbarrack 3 (a) and Kilbarrack West. A total of 2,316 dwellings is involved. There are flat schemes at Tallaght East and North Circular Road, Grangegorman, Fenian Street and Popular Row.  They account for another 358 dwellings.  That makes a total of 3,698 dwellings.  That is a fairly creditable record which indicates clearly the progress made since many of us who were members of the corporation tried to ensure that people who were unable to purchase houses of their own would have an opportunity of getting homes from the local authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> There is a population problem in the city.  The housing reports show that housing due to commence at Kilbarrack and Baldoyle accounts for 306 houses and 16 houses respectively. Building tenders submitted to the Department of Local Government in respect of Gardiner Lane and Francis Street relate to 24 flats.  Building tenders were also received in respect of 20 flats at Power's Court and in respect of 37 flats at Convent View, Cabra. There are plans for 12 flats at North William Street and for 12 flats in Rathfarnham.  There are plans for 60 dwellings at Rathfarnham and for eight dwellings at Cappagh, Finglas.  Plans exist for 102 dwellings at Rutland Street and for 66 at Kilbarrack.  There are plans for site developments in two stages at Darndale 1 and Darndale 2 for 469 and 359 houses respectively. Development works are due to commence in Finglas and the South Tolka Valley for 1,445 houses.  There are development plans for 344 houses at Cherry Orchard and for 612 houses at Ballycorus.</P>
    <P>This represents several years' work for operatives in the building trade. The corporation development ensures workers of continuity of employment for a considerable number of years. There are CPOs before the Minister in connection with the acquisition by the local authorities of other lands.  People who work in the building trade know that there will be work for them for years to come.  Additional sites will be made available.  Developments will take place.  People in the building trade need have no worries about the construction programme of the Dublin Corporation.  There will be a reduction in the waiting lists shortly.</P>
    <P>The population of Dublin in 1966 was 795,000.  The forecast for 1986 is 1,125,000.  That represents an increase of 42 per cent.  The money spent on housing should be increased on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  Dublin is carrying a large load from other counties.  I do not wish to see the amount of money allocated to other counties reduced, but Dublin will require a very substantial amount of money to meet the housing needs for the population which has been forecast.  It is agreed <Col N="641" /> that the forecasts of population are realistic.  We must get an assurance that money will be available to Dublin for the development of the city.  With a greater population we will need more money in order to meet the housing needs.  From the figures I have mentioned for private site development we see there is a very substantial programme in progress here, but with the population change the effectiveness of this programme will diminish if it is not stepped up further.  Certain Deputies here like my colleague, Deputy Seán Moore, have devoted much time and energy over the years, together with other members of Dublin Corporation, to this work of ensuring that the weaker sections would have homes in five or 10 years by long-range planning.  I hope we shall have the assurance of the Minister that this long-range planning and stepping up of production will not be impeded for lack of finance.  If he does not give that assurance there is a doubt about ever reaching the stage of easing the housing problem at local authority level.</P>
    <P>Short-term housing schemes have their usefulness and meet the requirements of the times.  We have one such short term scheme in Ballymun which met the requirements of a particular time.  It is regrettable that some people come into this House and condemn a scheme in relation to present-day requirements and pressures.  The pressures today are completely different from the pressures of that time.  The efforts of the Minister and the Department to relieve the situation which resulted from the demolition of a substantial number of derelict houses in the city, when there were 3,000 families on the waiting list, met the requirements of that time but people who at one stage applauded this scheme under certain conditions now condemn it by reference to present-day conditions.  I do not think that is justifiable.  Experience has shown us that short-term schemes are not always the answer and that schemes must be on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other ways in which building is impeded at the moment.  The ESB are the biggest <Col N="642" /> blackmailers in this country in relation to building development.  They apply all sorts of pressure on builders before service will be provided.  This is something the Minister must examine in great detail.  House prices have been increased as a result of these pressures, and I hope the Minister will ensure that monopolies like the ESB cannot blackmail people by providing fittings and services that are not required.  In Tallaght a person has been living in a house for two months without electricity, notwithstanding the fact that the house had been finished for six months.  There is another case in Nutgrove, Rathfarnham, where not so long ago Deputy Moore and myself were told that a builder wanted a supply line to houses in order to let tenants in; on one side of the road there was a group of ESB workers putting in a temporary supply line at a substantial cost to the builder, which the people who went into the houses had to pay eventually; while on the other side of the road another group of ESB workers were working on permanent power lines to the same houses. This is a farcical situation and is one of the things causing distress among people who are making an effort to solve the housing problem.  If this is a scheme designed to derive further income for the ESB, the Minister should tell them to halt and provide the service for which they are being paid.  If they are not getting enough for their services they have the remedy of increasing the charges but not blackmail of this type.</P>
    <P>There are many other factors impeding building, and I am quite sure the Minister is aware of them; they have been mentioned all too often in many places up to now.  I have not seen any action taken and I hope action will be taken now.  One impediment is in relation to sewerage services. I refer particularly to the Grand Canal in my own constituency.  I am glad the Minister has indicated that the scheme will now proceed.  All that the delay in commencing this scheme has done is to keep more people out of homes for a greater period than was necessary, at a colossal cost to the State.  Whether the canal could be maintained or not was <Col N="643" /> another matter.  If it was used at that period it could have been reconstructed in a much better and more substantial way than at the moment.  I hope the Board of Works who are to take it over will do a better job than has been done by other authorities in recent times.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that this scheme should have been delayed for ten or 15 years.  There were two types of people involved.  On the one hand, there was the person with the fur coat and the pleasure boat and, on the other hand, there was the person with no home.  I would back the person with no home every time.  These people got their way to the extent that the scheme has been delayed, and now that it is about to start I hope there will be no further impediment to the development which is both necessary and desirable if we are to have more homes. The same delay occurred in relation to the great industrial development in Ballyfermot, Walkinstown, Bluebell and Tallaght, merely because of the cries of a few people.  This is one of the disgraceful features of the fifties, that a small group of people who were comfortable themselves, who did not live in a two-room or single-room flat but lived in nine or 10-roomed mansions, probably far removed from the city, could influence people to hold up a desirable scheme of this nature.  It was held up by those people and by a few politicians too.</P>
    <P>This had a big bearing on people in my constituency from an employment point of view.  In the Ballyfermot industrial estate and the industrial estate in south County Dublin only certain types of industries could be developed.  Many industrialists examined the sites.  The sites were suitable and there was a large force of suitable labour in the Ballyfermot, Inchicore and Drimnagh areas.  When they discussed the matter with the planning authorities or the local authority, the industrialists found that the amount of space available in the sewer was not large enough to meet their requirements. If it was an industry with a high acid content in the waste it could not be developed in that area.  The <Col N="644" /> industrial estates in Ballyfermot and on the south side in general have a low employment content because of the type of industries that had to be set up there.  Far more people could be employed nearer to their homes had they been developed on a long-term basis.  There is no use providing sites unless services are provided.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the future development of large housing estates. In a very short space of time it will not be possible to get into Tallaght or Blanchardstown and other areas because of a lack of roads.  Unless the roads are there to take the traffic generated by large scale industrial estates and housing developments, the position becomes unreal.  I am quite certain that within the next 12 months the road from Tallaght into Templeogue will be unable to take the traffic and we will have large traffic back-ups. We now go to work by radio rather than having a free and easy passage along the highway.  We have to switch on the radio to find out where the traffic jams are.  Unless roads are provided on the perimeter of the city, immediately and as a top priority, all these schemes will be ineffective and transport costs will be increased.  To get to and from industrial centres it is necessary to have roads.  The Minister should examine the decision on the by-pass road from Tallaght and have this work started at an earlier date than is now anticipated.  I understand that it will be several years before this by-pass road is provided.  Several thousand dwellings are being erected in an area at the moment and what have they to service them?  One small road.</P>
    <P>We do not want a situation in which newly-built roads have to be ripped up week after week by the ESB, the Post Office, the Gas Company or other concerns which are supplying services.  We should ensure that when the roads are provided they are not tampered with, making some of them very dangerous, as they are at the moment.  New roads which were provided six months ago now have to be cut with mechanical cutters to lay services that should have been laid when the road was being laid.  This is a farcical situation.  Who suffers?  The people living in the houses.  The roads are lifted up in front <Col N="645" /> of their houses and there is large scale disruption for a considerable time.  The Minister should pay particular attention to these by-pass roads.  Sometimes people have to live in houses without electricity for two months.  Perhaps in two months time I will have to tell the House that people have been living without electricity for four months. This should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>Normally they are told: &ldquo;Your application is lost.  Did you put one in? There is some mix-up somewhere.&rdquo; You ring up another department and you are told: &ldquo;No, we do not deal with that.&rdquo;  I rang this morning the station that should service the Tallaght estate and I was told: &ldquo;As soon as we get word from the people above we will be able to proceed.&rdquo; I asked: &ldquo;What is their number?&rdquo; and the answer was: &ldquo;He is not in today so there is no point in ringing him.  Ring him tomorrow.&rdquo; This is not the type of thing that leads to comprehensive development.  These people should have their services dovetailed. They should ensure that their services are provided without blackmail. I should like to impress upon the Minister that roads are just as important as sewerage, water supply and the other services necessary for large scale developments.  If we are realistic about it these developments will take place in conjunction with one another.  I understand that it will be several years before there is sufficient development in Tallaght to meet the problems there.</P>
    <P>The traffic problem to which the corporation have given quite a considerable amount of attention in recent times is made more difficult by another section of the corporation or the local authority.  One section are devoting all their time and energy to keeping the traffic flowing and another section, because of a lack of long-term planning, are ensuring that the first section are kept going at full speed at all times because of their backlog.  This is unreal. Maybe there is consultation but there should be more consultation.  The long-term needs should be examined to see how all the problems should be dovetailed.</P>
    <P>This sewer will satisfy me because it is in my constituency.  It will service the land adjacent to my constituency <Col N="646" /> and it will enable people to work near their homes.  While that may satisfy me, there are probably Deputies in other areas who will have the same problems in five or six years time as I have now.  I hope they will ensure that the services will be provided within the shortest time possible.  I said that one goes to work by radio now.  Soon, unless you have a radio in your car, you will not be able to get home at all, and everybody has not got a radio. You have to tune in in the evening to find out where the hold-ups are.  They are many and they are fairly substantial.</P>
    <P>The pollution problem in my constituency will probably be eased to some degree by this scheme which will take a couple of years to complete.  In the meantime, people living close to the River Camac, which is an open sewer and a disgrace to our city, have to suffer.  I understand from Dublin Corporation that the Camac will not be culverted because of the expense involved. The Department of Local Government should try to influence the corporation to carry out some sort of culverting on this open sewer.  When I was a member of the Dublin Corporation, members had many motions before the council asking the corporation to ensure that the Camac would be culverted.  The health of many people living on the banks of the Camac has been affected as a result of pollution.  It is rather regrettable that the pollution from one local authority area can float in and be harmful to the health of those in another area.</P>
    <P>The people in the areas of Inchicore, Mount Brown and right down to the Liffey should not have to endure the odour that comes from the Camac.  On a hot summer's day if one set out from Leinster House one would not need a map to get to the Camac.  One would get to it if one had any sense of smell at all.  People over a wide area far removed from that river can get the fumes that come from this sewer in the hot weather.  Foodstuffs have been contaiminated in the past.</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion asking the city medical officer to do something because of the high incidence of pollution. <Col N="647" /> He had the matter examined and said that it was not dirty, notwithstanding the fact that there is no fish life there.  I am certain that even the rats cannot live in it.  The colour of the Camac is an indication of its high state of pollution, but the city manager told us at that time&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that the water had been examined by three different experts, both from this country and from outside it, and all agreed that it was extremely dirty&mdash; that it was not dirty; but the fact that there is no fish life there, that the water is blue in colour, that the banks are full of slime, coupled with the terrible odour from it, are indications of its state.</P>
    <P>I do not think any community should have to suffer this condition and another effort should be made to ensure that this river gets the attention it deserves from the point of view of industrial waste.  I do not want to see long-established industries closed down because of the discharge of industrial waste.  I know that efforts are at the moment being made by the planning authority and the Minister's Department to ensure that new industries will provide adequate safeguards against the pollution of rivers but, nevertheless, I think that now, with the technical advances made and the services and knowledge available in other countries, some system could be made available which would eliminate this terrible problem in this river, and more especially so by reason of industrial pollution.  Pollution of this nature breeds other types of pollution in that people have foul sewers and other materials are drained freely into the polluted river.  If the Camac was not polluted, many of the drains and inlets to it, with their injurious materials, would not be there because they would be detected at an early stage, if the water was pure, and appropriate action would be taken to ensure that the water remained fairly free.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and his Department to have another look at the Camac.  I can produce to the Minister a number of reports made to the corporation over a number of years which indicate that this work should <Col N="648" /> and must be done.  Notwithstanding these, the corporation have now decided to take no further action because of the immense cost.  One should not measure in terms of money problems of health hazards and the local authority, and possibly the Government, should be generous in relation to these highly polluted streams such as the Camac and ensure that the hazard is eliminated.  If it is not, I will be back again next year, le cúnamh Dé, and I will have much more to say on the Camac because I will come well prepared with the reports on this matter.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Housing Act of 1966, I want to mention a matter which I raised here on many occasions over the past five or six years.  It is in connection with section 63 of the Act which relates to overcrowding in houses.  It is about time the Minister amended this section because it is a section which needs to be amended. In fairness to him, I should say that I probably have not raised the matter with him but I did raise it with other Ministers.  The section means that a person with a two-room flat who is sleeping in one room, a small room which is regarded as sleeping accommodation. can qualify for local authority accommodation while a person sleeping in one room of the same size as that room is not taken into consideration.  There have been many occasions on which this section has been interpreted in this manner.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that a person living in two rooms should be able to get accommodation as against the person living in one room, but this is what the Act sets out.  We know that in tenement houses the person living in the large room there is also sleeping in it, eating in it and living in it and has no other accommodation.  The size of that room is taken into consideration as being the room in which the family sleep.  If, on the other hand, the person upstairs has a room, plus a smaller room, the smaller one is deemed to be the one to which the free air space relates.  This seems to be completely ridiculous, that because a person sleeps in the particular room, having only one, he should be at a disadvantage as compared with the person who has two rooms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> This is completely wrong and the section should be amended at an early stage to ensure that justice is done to many people who are being deprived because of it.  I was assured by Ministers in the past that an amendment would be made and I wanted to put down a Private Members' Motion at one time and I was told: &ldquo;We will do that; you do not have to bother,&rdquo; but it is still not done and people are being victimised.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with a group called Associated Properties.  In the area I represent, and particularly Drimnagh, we have an organisation which owns houses.  Some of these houses are let and others are for purchase. If you purchase your house, you can put your car in the garden but if you are a tenant, you cannot. This type of discrimination arises from two distinct problems.  One is the design of the area.  It is a very high density area and one which is not suitable for present-day traffic because of the narrowness of the roads, particularly in the Upper Drimnagh area.  It is not suitable for the volume of traffic or the traffic flow.  It was badly designed, the density being very high. The developers at the time were certainly on a good thing.  They got this high density and were able to let the houses but now with the development of the motor car and people being able to purchase them, and with motor cars being a necessity because of the positions they hold, it is regrettable that this organisation insists on cars remaining on the road notwithstanding the fact that those who purchase their homes can park their cars in their gardens.  This is discrimination.  Appropriate action should be taken to deal with the traffic hazard created, particularly in the Brandon Road area and the Upper Drimnagh area.  This action should be taken, not against the tenants or the Garda authorities, but against Associated Properties.  The Department should examine this matter realistically.</P>
    <P>I put down Parliamentary questions about this matter and received the nonsensical reply that the elimination of the traffic hazard is a matter for the Garda Síochána and the local <Col N="650" /> authority.  That reply does not satisfy me.  Organisations that have received State grants and local authority grants towards building development are under an obligation to provide reasonable facilities for their tenants.  It would be impossible for an ambulance or fire brigade to get through in some parts of this area.  I challenge the Minister to say that an ambulance or fire brigade could get into some of the <i>culs-de-sac</i> that are jammed with cars because Associated Properties will not allow tenants to park their cars in their gardens.  Dublin Corporation decided as a matter of policy to put double gates on the gardens of their houses so that people can take their cars off the road where garages are not provided.</P>
    <P>Not very long ago a man had to be carried a considerable distance to an ambulance which could not get near his house.  If an ambulance was unable to get through, a fire brigade engine would be unable to get through. This is a serious situation.  An association that has been drawing rents over a period of years is under an obligation to ensure the free flow of traffic. I do not want the people to be victimised. The people have to suffer the consequences of badly planned roads in a high density area.  There is plenty of garden space which could be used to park their cars.</P>
    <P>In the event of a major disaster the local authorities, the Garda Síochána, the Department and others will provide a remedy but in the meantime the people have to suffer.  Vandalism occurs to cars parked on the road. There is parking on only one side of the road.  When one writes to Associated Properties about this matter, if one gets a reply, it is to the effect that efforts have been made to relieve the situation at corporation level and departmental level.  The Garda Síochána have been helpful on every occasion in remedying the situation to the best of their ability without causing any great disturbance.  The Department in conjunction with the corporation, or the corporation of themselves, should be able to devise a scheme to ensure that irresponsible organisations who victimise their <Col N="651" /> tenants will be dealt with.  This is bad estate management.  In one section of the Drimnagh area the corporation allow tenants to park their cars off the road because of the traffic hazard that might otherwise be created and in another section the tenants are not allowed to do this.  It would seem that Associated Properties want to force tenants out of their houses so that they can sell the houses at a profit.  The market value of the houses has increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a traffic hazard.  Roads are the responsibility of the Department of Local Government. I want to ensure that the area is examined at an early stage.  The traffic study group have carried out an examination and have agreed that there is a traffic hazard and have approached Associated Properties to allow the tenants to park in the gardens. Notwithstanding the fact that the study group, on which the Garda Síochána, CIE and Dublin Corporation were represented, agreed that there is a traffic hazard, Associated Properties still do not allow their tenants to park in their gardens.  By pressurisation they want to dispossess people of their houses so that they can sell them at a substantial profit.  Such an attitude should not be tolerated.  I would ask the Minister to have the matter examined immediately so as to prevent a disaster.  In the event of a disaster a solution will be found to the problem.</P>
      <P>The acquisition of the road by the local authority would not solve the problem because this would mean a reduction in the size of the gardens and the cars would still be parked on the roads.  The corporation should not be put to the expense of acquiring and widening the road.  If Associated Properties were reasonable they would solve the problem.  They have suggested that the corporation can solve the problem; the corporation have replied that they cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> I have already stated in correspondence with the city council that the traffic hazard is caused in order to induce people to leave these houses.  It was suggested that these houses were not made for people with motor cars. There were no cars at the time these houses were built.  How could they have been built for people with motor cars? This is the mentality.  I want the Minister to examine the situation in the Brandon Road and Mangerton Road area.  If the traffic study group were realistic in saying there was a traffic hazard, something should be done with unreasonable organisations such as Associated Properties.  I have no axe to grind when I say that Associated Properties are acting unreasonably. They are creating a situation which may result in loss of life.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the progress in housing output to date.  A record number of houses were developed.  The development last year in the housing programme was substantial and the indications for the future are good.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to the points I have made, to ensure the elimination of the traffic problem in Drimnagh and to deal with the other problems I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There are a number of developments in the city being carried out by the local authority.  In the case of flat schemes it would appear that some people can do what they like while others have to suffer.  This applies particularly to persons on ground floors. A change of plan and layout is necessary and desirable.  The planning authority should take notice of this aspect.  Consequently many old people suffer hardships.  The pattern is to accommodate them in flats at ground level and they are kept awake at night until long after the pubs have closed and the vandals have left the streets.  I would suggest one means of easing the position of those old people.  The corporation might appoint caretakers to supervise the flats until such time at night as it is possible for those people to get to sleep.  It is a problem peculiar to nearly all corporation developments in Dublin.  We all know that pressure has been brought to bear on the corporation <Col N="653" /> by one political group who apparently want to allow football to be played in the streets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine my remarks on the Estimate to problems affecting my constituency.  In County Monaghan we have a number of housing schemes. One is at Carrickmacross and the proposal was that the scheme would be completed in 1967 and the tenants were expected to take up occupation in the autumn of that year.  Unfortunately, they will be lucky if they go into occupation this autumn.  This is not the fault of Monaghan County Council but of the Minister for Local Government to whom plans were submitted years ago.  Tenders were advertised for and received and when they were submitted to the Minister for sanction they were rejected on the grounds that the houses were much too costly.</P>
      <P>If I recall correctly, the cost of the houses at that time was estimated at £3,500 each.  The Minister said the council should reconsider the whole scheme with a view to erecting cheaper type houses.  New plans were submitted for his approval, they were considered and the National Building Agency were consulted.  Work was begun on some 114 houses.</P>
      <P>I carried out a detailed examination of the houses recently.  Many of them are nearing completion and I can say there is absolutely no comparison between them and the houses that were designed and submitted for tender originally.  But the cost is roughly the same because of increases in the price of building materials between 1967 and this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to complain seriously about this.  We in local authorities are prepared to build houses for young men and women many of whom have got married, many of whom have to live in rented flats if they are able to avoid emigration because of lack of suitable accommodation in the areas where they were born and bred.  Local authorities go through all the rounds of designing houses, preparing plans and submitting them for sanction.  They come back unapproved from the Department of Local Government, the local authority have to go through the same procedure, <Col N="654" /> finally submitting them for sanction a second time.  Again, they are returned, possibly with the comment that the colour of the tiles should be different, that a door should be in one corner of a room instead of another or that there should be six panes on a window instead of five.</P>
    <P>We all know that county councils employ staffs of excellent engineers.  It is they who design and plan houses. They are fully qualified to do this and their work should not be continuously rejected by the engineers and architects in the Department.  I suggest that the purpose of these rejections is not to ensure better class houses but because of a shortage of funds in the Department. Quibbles about the design and planning of housing schemes are just another way of shelving housing schemes.  Would it not be much better if the Minister came out and admitted frankly to the local authorities that there was not any money at the time, that the schemes should be postponed and proceeded with later when money became available?</P>
    <P>We are the people who are entrusted in local elections with the task of drawing up schemes for houses.  We are the people in whom the electors have confidence.  Yet, when we submit schemes to the Minister, for reasons best known to himself, he rejects them and very often we find ourselves ending up providing inferior houses for our young men and women.</P>
    <P>There was one particular scheme of superior quality houses designed for Carrickmacross.  Had that scheme been carried out many people would not have been driven into paying high rents for flats for the past three or four years.  Indeed, some who were compelled to emigrate, mainly because of lack of housing, would now be living in these houses and contributing to the national economy; but, because the houses were of a superior type, the Minister decided they were too costly and the scheme was rejected.</P>
    <P>What is the position now?  We find ourselves with rows and rows of bleak looking houses with a small pipe on the roof as a chimney.  And the real tragedy is that these houses cost roughly the same to build as would <Col N="655" /> the houses of superior quality on the original plan.  It is a shortsighted policy to reject a plan just because the money is not easily available at the particular time.  There should be none of these delaying tactics, asking the local authority to reconsider the scheme, to cover the whole ground all over again, ground that it took two years to cover in the first instance.  Apart altogether from the question of the deterioration in quality and design, or increased cost, this throws unnecessary work on to county council and Department of Local Government officials, officials who, one is led to believe, are already overworked.  The plan is sent up to the Custom House, examined, sent back for re-consideration, resubmitted, rejected because of cost, delayed for four or five years; then a cheaper house is designed but, with the passage of time the cost of materials and wages has gone up and the cheaper house works out as dear, or dearer than the original superior quality and design house.</P>
    <P>The whole system is ridiculous.  I appeal to the Minister to take heed of what I say.  The tactics I have outlined result in a completely false economy, to say nothing of our compelling people to live in inferior quality houses.</P>
    <P>We have then the problem of water. Some time ago the Department of Local Government suggested a water supply scheme from a lake at Laragh, Castleblayney.  We were told this lake <Col N="656" /> would supply water to Carrickmacross and Iniskean in south Monaghan.  The county council were quite prepared to go ahead.  A couple of years went by and the whole thing seemed to fall through.  Then it was suggested that the council should try to have a borehole well to augment the water supply. A substantial sum was spent.  The project was unsuccessful because of the limestone content in the soil.  The local schoolmaster has built a new house but he has no water supply.  There are 114 new houses for which we have no water supply.  The council are arranging to take water from a nearby lake but, as many of the 114 houses are practically finished, they will be without water for some considerable time to come.  This is all because everything is put on the long finger. First, the water is to be piped from an adjacent lake, then a borehole is to be sunk, then some other lake is to be tapped.  All this chopping and changing results in delaying tactics. The way in which people have solved their personal problems is worthy of note.  The first thing they do, before going to work in the morning, is to journey out the country to a farmer's pump or well and bring home their own private supply of water.</P>
