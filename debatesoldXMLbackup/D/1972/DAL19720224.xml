      <P>The Taoiseach will agree that it is a serious development when retrospective legislation of this nature is introduced.

      <P>The retrospective nature of the legislation is naturally a cause of some concern.  The fact that it now appears that many of the activities of the British Army in the North <Col N="326" /> in the past two years have been illegal will be an important factor, I believe, in the presentation of the case we are bringing before the Commission on Human Rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I stressed the seemingly all powerful role of the full-time secretariat of the Department of Education.  I stressed, in particular, the very influential, dominant role of successive secretaries as distinct from the temporary political heads of the Department.  I also stressed the need for a white paper on education and for a permanent select committee of this House on education.  I am strongly of the opinion that the children of this nation deserve something more than the power struggle between the politicians, the educational <Col N="327" /> administrators, the churches, the teachers and the parents.  We must take education out of the straitjacket into which it has been put.</P>
      <P>On the question of community schools, the Minister suggested that his proposals have been deliberately misrepresented by Members of this House and he charged certain Members of this House with playing politics on the subject of education and particularly on the subject of community schools.  He wants to know where these Deputies now stand in relation to recent statements by the Catholic Hierarchy on community schools.  I want to leave the Minister, the House and the Catholic Hierarchy under no illusions as to my views on this particular subject.  I bitterly resent the Minister's charges and I propose now to refute the allegation that we are merely playing politics with community schools.  If one wanted to play politics on this issue, all one need have done was to back to the hilt the various power interests involved, thereby leaving the Minister out on a limb.  Instead of doing that, we strongly supported the idea of community schools.  We differed from the Minister on how this principle should be implemented.  That is where we parted company with the Minister.</P>
      <P>We welcome the working paper proposed and we endorse the need for a unified post-primary educational system.  That is on record.  We support the elimination of overlapping and duplication in the provision of teachers. buildings and equipment.  We want to see any such duplication ended as quickly as possible.  We want to see permanent education in this country, not just sectionalised education, until the age of 18 or 20.  We want to see provision made for education for groups of workers and adults generally. The proposals for the community schools were a step in that direction and we supported the broad concept behind the Minister's working document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some spokesmen in the churches of this country appear to be under the impression that politicians should not talk so much about education and one gets a reaction from some professional <Col N="328" /> educationalists that politicians should keep out of education.  Few people with a liberal and progressive attitude to education think that social and political aspirations can or should be kept out of education.  Politicians have the right to point out that the structure of education has a profound effect on the social structure of the country.  It has a major impact on the degree of equality of education and on general equality in society.  The structure of education has a major impact on the degree of equity in society and it has a profound impact on the degree of social opportunity and social mobility.</P>
    <P>I do not think that politicians talk sufficiently about the content and character of education.  We are obsessed about the control of education and the conditions of employment of teachers but we neglect to speak about the character and content of education. These influence profoundly the values, the social class structure and standards of an adult society and therefore politicians have every right to be deeply involved and concerned about these aspects of education.  They are not the privilege of any teaching order or of any trade union, and they are not the privilege of any managerial group of administrators.  The character of education, the social structure and the content of our system are matters that should be discussed by the people.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the social structure of education has a profound impact on the demand for education. It is admitted that the primary school system as it exists is, generally speaking, creaking at the seams.  Successive Governments have failed miserably to appreciate the fact that unless one has a sound, firm base for education, namely in the primary sector, it is impossible to build the other levels of education.  If there is an ineffective or poor system of primary education, inevitably the demand for education and the pool of ability in the pirmary sector will be affected.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a need for a national attitude towards education.  In the past successive generations of parents in effect have told the teaching orders: &ldquo;It is your responsibility; educate our children for us&rdquo;.  As long <Col N="329" /> as the children could get jobs at 17 or 18 years and as long as they were reasonably literate and intelligent, parents were satisfied.  Most parents are not deeply concerned and involved in their children's education and I say that as a parent who has children at national school.  We have been spoonfed by the religious teaching orders and by the national teachers.  They have taken over the responsibility of educating the children and the parents have gladly handed over the educational process, lock, stock and barrel to the parish priest, the school manager, to the local religious orders, and have more or less forgotten their responsibilities after that.</P>
    <P>One of the most beneficial and laudable aspects of the community schools proposals was that it was a further democratisation of education. It was a movement towards real comprehensive education in its true sense. It was a reflection of the strong and irresistible pressure of society for a more democratic system of education, for a system in which the citizens would be involved to a greater degree than ever before.  In the past half century we have seen the extension of political rights in this country, the extension of rights of personal liberty and the extension of rights with regard to social equality and social welfare.  This is beginning to develop slowly in the educational sector.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Minister and the House that we stand full square behind the demand for the provision of free post-primary education for all children in the State.  The Labour Party seek the elimination of all class barriers in education, but many such barriers still exist.  We seek the elimination of social barriers in the educational system.  We seek the elimination of curricula barriers but many such barriers exist between the different sectors.  They have existed between the so-called secondary stream and the so-called vocational stream.  That barrier has been bridged, very quickly and correctly.</P>
    <P>We want to see the elimination of all the barriers between the various trade unions in the educational field, the barriers between secondary teachers, and primary teachers, and teachers at the university level.  It is <Col N="330" /> tragic that the system of education has split the professional teachers into a number of different trade unions when we urgently need a federation of teachers representing all those involved in education.  Instead we have had this organisational barrier arising out of the system of education.  The secondary teachers are in their own trade union, the vocational teachers are in their own trade union, and the national teachers are in their own trade union, with a consequent divisive approach in the educational field.</P>
    <P>Our policy is to have a unified, integrated and democratic post-primary system of education.  We have yet to achieve that.  The Minister said that we have been playing politics with the community schools.  We have not.  I was chairman of the Labour Party education committee in 1964, through the general election of 1965, and the general election of 1969.  When Deputy FitzGerald took over as the Fine Gael spokesman on education&mdash;and thank God Deputy Ryan never got that job &mdash;he transformed the Fine Gael policy on education and made it much more progressive.  The Labour Party consistently stood for a policy which would provide comprehensive educational facilities in each area, and which would cater for the various aptitudes of the pupils and eliminate duplication of teachers, buildings and equipment at local level.</P>
    <P>It was in that setting that we welcomed the first outline proposal on the community schools as published by the Government in October, 1970.  We felt that it was an extension of the socialist aspirations of the Labour Party down through the decades.  As far back as 1896 James Connolly advocated the public control and management of our national schools. He spoke of free education up to the highest university grades.  Twenty years later, speaking about the reconquest of Ireland and the democracy of Ireland he said that among the first of the steps necessary for the regeneration of Ireland must be for Ireland to address itself to the extension of its ownership and administration of the schools of Erin. <Col N="331" /> Whatever safeguards were necessary to ensure that the religious faith of the parents would be respected in the children would surely be adequately looked after by the representatives of a people to whom religion is a vital thing, he said.  Connolly's words were quite prophetic.  We had to wait for a long while for the Government to bring forward proposals for community schools.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach was correct and most welcome.  Some Members of the House are like the silent backbenchers of Fianna Fáil on the question of Northern Ireland.  They say nothing because, if they speak, they may lose a couple of hundred votes at the next general election.  Some Members of the House do not approve of the concept of community schools or comprehensive education.  They want the <i>status quo</i> and, given the opportunity, they would defend that opinion quite vigorously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan spoke on 12th February of dangerious tendencies in the field of education in Ireland and said they were to be guarded against.  He said:</P>
    <P>Dangerous tendencies in the filed of education in Ireland need to be guarded against, if educational ends are not to be sacrificed to transient political objectives and administrative convenience.</P>
    <P>That was not lauding the introduction of educational changes.  According to a supplied script he said:</P>
    <P>People must not allow their vision to be clouded by the attachment of emotive labels like &ldquo;community&rdquo; or &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; to structures which bureaucrats seek to impose upon unwilling communities.  What is economically justifiable and politically irresistible may sometimes be educationally unsound.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to have a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at any Deputy he has a ready-made target there in Deputy Ryan's attitude to community schools.  I suggest that his attitude is conditioned largely by the fact that he is not at one with Deputy FitzGerald in the matter of a liberal approach to education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> It must go on the record that all the reaction does not necessarily come from the Fianna Fáil benches.  The most disturbing aspect of the whole approach to the community schools was that it developed in a typically Irish way on the basis of a journalistic scoop.  We would never have heard of the behind-closed-doors negotiations on the community schools if it had not been for a journalistic scoop in <i>The Irish Times.</i> It is a rather odd way of developing educational policy, that one has to depend on a document being leaked to a newspaper before one can get down to having a public debate.</P>
    <P>The working document on community schools was a scoop which surprised even the Minister for Education. In traditional Fianna Fáil style he reacted to that working document in the now familiar words of the Minister for Transport and Power and a few of his colleagues: &ldquo;What crisis?  What problem?&rdquo;  He said at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that there was no problem in relation to the religious in education. He said there was no question of the brothers, nuns or priests being asked, much less compelled, to move out of education.  He told the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in 1971 that he knew there were some people in some way-out groups who would like this to be so, and who were only too anxious to jump on any bandwagon which they felt would advance their cause.  He said there was no question of confiscation of property even though there had been a lot of talk about it.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree that that was the beginning of the confusion which started in February, 1971, and worked through last year.  That confusion has not yet been cleared up.  At that time Deputy FitzGerald pointed out very quickly in Dáil Éireann that great difficulties were involved in the community schools proposals envisaged in the working document.  We in the Labour Party also felt that those difficulties could not be swept under the carpet and that they had been ignored by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As reported at Column 1719 of the Official Report of 31st March, 1971. Deputy FitzGerald said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> No service is done to education by producing a document which, after reading it, one would think there was no such thing in Ireland as religious education.  There is religious education and there is a problem between two co-existing systems of education one of which is ... nonsectarian, the vocational system... We also have the secondary stream which is predominantly religious.</P>
    <P>As early as March, 1971, the Minister was fully forewarned of the difficulties facing him in relation to the working document.</P>
    <P>This problem of the role of the religious in education was bound to be a topic which would capture public attention.  There was a great danger that public discussion of the document would not get further than the emotional arguments.  This danger existed in February-March, 1971.  I was acutely conscious of it but, somehow or other, things just bumbled on and the thing became a major crisis later on.  The whole document, unfortunately, began to get caught up in the classical clash between the Churches' interests and the State.  In such a situation the Minister should not have been the least bit surprised to discover that many of the arguments became almost hysterical; some of them became exaggerated, bloated generally, and the merits as to whether or not we should move towards a multidenominational system of education of a comprehensive type or should try to stay in a feudal and authoritarian condition, bound by some kind of Thomistic theological version of education, was lost when the Minister threw the Thomist theologians into the fray and off we went on yet another confrontation which, fortunately, now, 15 months later, is slowly being sorted out, largely to the credit of many of the Opposition Members of the House who have been constructive, helpful and who, above all, have exposed some of the inherent weaknesses in the original community schools document.</P>
    <P>The circumstances surrounding the issuing of the working document, therefore, were quite extraordinary. <Col N="334" /> The Minister must accept a great deal of responsibility for being extraordinarily slow in clarifying and publicising the basis of the document.  He made one major error.  He was seen to be, and in practice actually was, in total prior consultation with the Catholic Hierarchy on the whole question long before he consulted with the other legitimate educational interests.  This, again, was a typical departmental, Fianna Fáil, approach.</P>
    <P>However, one can say that there are a number of features which perhaps, make the story not as bad as it might seem.  It is important to appreciate and to put on record in the House that the working document on community schools was never intended to be published at all.  Everybody seems to have missed this point.  The document was essentially a private matter between the Department and one Roman Catholic bishop.  It was sent to the Catholic Hierarchy for information and in response to a request by the Catholic Hierarchy for information on a particular school case.  This needs to be stressed.  I would repeat that it was a negotiating document, a working document, between the Department and one bishop and then the Cardinal requested a copy in relation to a particular school case and a copy of the document was sent, I gather, to him. When the Minister was pressed in this House, he replied&mdash;column 1737 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The normal procedure would have been to have full discussions before the matter was made public and then to make it public and to allow anybody else who wished to discuss it to do so.</P>
    <P>That was in reply to the charge which we made in this House that other educational interests had not been consulted in relation to the document.  He said that the document was prematurely published and, had it not been so, the Minister maintained, at column 1738, we could have had a reasonable and unemotional discussion on the document.</P>
    <P>This is the way things developed.  It was unfortunate and tragic that that should have been so because it was a <Col N="335" /> disservice to the House and to the public Press that the public Press should have had to depend on a leak in order to advise the National Parliament and the parents of this country as to what was in store for them.</P>
    <P>Equally, it should be stressed that there was absolutely nothing in the working document on community schools that had not already been said on many occasions in this House and in the Seanad and in public speeches by the Minister that had already been printed.  This is important.  I remember when the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 1970 was going through the House, enabling vocational education committees to enter into joint management arrangements, it was quite clear that this was the kind of thinking in the Department on the reorganisation of post-primary education, particularly in relation to the management of schools in that area.  Yet, despite all those statements from the Minister, up to October, 1970, he had made almost no reference to the concept of community schools as such.  So, we had to depend on the leak.  Very little has been expressed, particularly about this famous figure of 400 pupils which was to be considered as the minimum size for a post-primary school.  These were unusual features, certainly, in the debate.</P>
    <P>The third point I would make in relation to the working document is, of course, that it was meant for rural Ireland.  It finished up being applied to the suburbs of Dublin city.  This is the great irony of the community schools document.  The document was essentially, from what we can now gather, one in relation to the rebuilding of post-primary schools in rural areas. The Minister did say on 5th March, 1971, in talks with the Irish Vocational Education Association, that at the moment he was only concerned with 15 school centres where there were particular problems regarding the rebuilding of post-primary schools.  At that stage the Minister accepted that the major problem was the provision of capital in those areas and that it would be much more economical for <Col N="336" /> him, the Minister said on that occasion &mdash;Michael Heney fully reported it in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash;to build one central school rather than three or four separate schools with limited capacity.</P>
    <P>We accepted that view on the part of the Minister.  The community schools document, therefore, envisaged the financial solution to the problem of rebuilding two or three small schools.  It was also an educational solution to the problem of the lack of co-ordination and co-operation between secondary and vocational schools in rural areas.  We welcome that aspect of the approach of the working document.  I am dealing with this at length because the Minister says we are merely playing politics in relation to community schools.  The Minister will find that in whole areas of his approach there is very considerable support within the Labour Party for his general attitude.  In the light of those statements by the Minister the peculiarities of the document are highlighted. It helps to explain why the document was so concerned with the management system of the schools with almost no effort made to deal with the educational and social principles behind the working document. It was produced in a rather bureaucratic manner typical of the Department. This has been admitted now by the Department and one of the originators of the whole approach, a man for whom I have the greatest respect, Seán O'Connor, the assistant secretary of the Department, spoke at the Vocational Teachers' Association seminar and he was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying that the document was not designed to impress or to win over people.  He said it was designed as an instrument of negotiation. He said:</P>
    <P>This working document was not intended to spell out to the last what a community school might be.  It was left in such a manner as to be developed.  It was even ambiguous, he said, in the sense that it is there for discussion and you can change it.  You can decide which way it goes, not you (the teachers) but the people who are going to have to live with it in every centre, and they will <Col N="337" /> change it to suit them not to suit you.</P>
    <P>That was frank talk from the assistant secretary of the Department of Education and one can admire him for it. He also went on to suggest that the document was only a lead-in to the fundamental concepts of education which we had yet to consider in an Irish context.  He said:</P>
    <P>We have not yet come to the heart of the matter in education.  We are too concerned with academic evaluators as predictors of life success... and the effective goals of education are mainly ignored.  The effective goals, he felt, were the social and personal dimension of people and the love which people have for other people.  If we do not develop this we do not develop the community at all.  All we have is a sprawl of 300 or 300,000 houses but there is not any community.  I know that academic evaluators are needed but they must be put in perspective. If the community school should be no more than another&mdash;even perhaps much improved&mdash;vehicle for job attainment then you can have it as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>This is how he explained to the vocational teachers what he meant by a community school and what he was envisaging.  I want to assure the Minister that the approach was one which merited full support and one which we in the Labour Party would not cavil at.  We agree that there is a need for relatively large sized schools to provide a broad range of subjects and to allow a large element of choice particularly in sixth form subjects.  We also feel that there should be a balance between the scientific, the technical and the academic courses to provide on the one hand skilled manpower for the economy and on the other for the overall development of and specialisation by the child.  We also welcome strongly the approach that community school buildings should be designed on a multi-purpose basis which would allow a much more informal and creative approach to education and would cater for the social training of <Col N="338" /> young people and relate education directly to the community.  Above all, they would provide facilities for after school hours, education for youth groups and adult groups.</P>
    <P>If properly developed in Irish society, the community school will be a focal point in the community and many of the local public and welfare services will be integrated with the school itself.  There will be a library, a swimming pool, a health centre, a citizens advisory bureau, a gymnasium and so on.  This is my concept of a community school.  It is not original but there will be tremendous difficulties in ensuring that it will be brought to full fruition.  Otherwise we will have primary and post-primary schools, isolated areas of social development from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m., locked after that and not really involved in the community after 4 o'clock in vast tracts of concrete canyons in suburbia with the school being merely concerned with the production of technical ability and there will be no social integration.  If we take the proposals of the Minister and implement them properly, it could transform the whole structure of local participation and, indeed, of community development. It could ensure that town planning and local government planning would be properly developed and this is a great need.  The tragedy is that while the Minister has been sorting out the faith and morals of everybody we have not sorted out anything in relation to the social and human engineering of education.  There should be much greater discussion in this House on what exactly we want community schools to do.  Do we want them to be a kind of half way house between a vocational and a secondary school?</P>
    <P>If that is what we want I think it will not be very effective.  Do we want it to be a school of 400 or 500 or 600 children all streaming out at the end of the period with their leaving certificates and perhaps going into jobs for which they will be ill-trained and in which they may suffer extreme frustration? This could be the development unless the Minister properly defines the approach to community schools.</P>
    <P>One definition, not particularly good, was that in the Plowden Report, children <Col N="339" /> and their Primary Schools, published in 1967:</P>
    <P>We need a school which is open beyond the ordinary school hours for the use of children, for the use of their parents and, exceptionally, for other members of the community.</P>
    <P>That is a rather utilitarian definition and simply throws up a sort of timetable to keep the school open from nine in the morning to nine at night. To me a community school is readily identified with a large neighbourhood where it becomes the focal point of almost all community activity.  Therefore in an urban area it should be in the centre of or readily accessible to the community.  In a rural area it would need to be very close to the rural centre of population.</P>
    <P>We must not think of a community school in an exclusively post-primary context.  This is very important.  I am appalled that there was very little discussion in Tallaght or Blanchardstown about primary school facilities in both areas.  Had I the opportunity as Minister for Education of thinking in the context of Tallaght, with 100,000 people there, I think I should say that the logic of the community school is to include primary and post-primary education and let them work that out between them in the Tallaght area. Surely this is the logic of a community school in which children would grow and develop their talents from an early age in the primary school and progress through that school.  Why do we not have a situation in which a child need not go to a different school in order to avail of a swimming pool?  A child of ten or 11 can certainly use a swimming pool in a community area as effectively as an adolescent.  The same pool would serve both; the same educational structure should serve both.</P>
    <P>My concept of a community school is that it could apply to both post-primary and primary education or possibly at a lower level.  Ironically, primary schools are really meant to be community schools.  One sees this if one goes back to the 1830 Primary Education Act and if one bears in mind that the parish priest was asked <Col N="340" /> to be the school manager in the original approach.  One might point out in regard to the 1830 Act that the local community, if we are familiar with the trustees in the primary schools sense, was asked to appoint a manager to the local school.  In rural Ireland the primary school was very much a community school and it was tragic that the <i>de jure</i> position of primary schools as the original community schools was not properly developed and extended into a community setting. This point might be made strongly.</P>
    <P>The distinguishing feature of the community school is that in a rural area where there is low density of population, and one must have a fairly broad catchment area, one can have a community school for 300, 400 or 500 pupils and, where people are much more integrated than in urban areas, three or four townlands together can form a local community school.  It is more of a possibility in the rural areas to have that approach particularly if one amalgamates primary and post-primary structures.  This should be possible and should be fully considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In England the urban community school received a great deal of impetus from 1966-7 onwards after publication of the Plowden Report which pointed out&mdash;this was the one great feature of the report, a very simple feature which politicians tend to ignore&mdash;that in socially and educationally deprived urban areas community schools can have a revitalising effect.  How can one possibly provide education, for example, in whole areas of Dublin where families of two, three, four or five children share the one living-room with the parents and elder brothers who are at working age?  They have no hope of doing any study in their own homes.</P>
    <P>Coming from a working-class home I know from personal experience that, it is quite impossible for a young child to sit down to work in the evening, especially with the modern intrusion of television which is on permanently in many homes from 5 p.m. to midnight, in the &ldquo;ticky-tacky&rdquo; local authority houses, where there is no open plan and everybody is jammed into one <Col N="341" /> room while there are two empty rooms upstairs called bedrooms and that is the total space available to the family. How can a child do any effective work after school hours in regard to educational preparation for the following day?  The answer is that in these socially deprived areas the environment of a community school would enable the child to stay later in school and avail of the school's facilities to finish off his lessons or do some further work.  This will be of major benefit to him.  If we had proper community schools parents would be encouraged to take an active interest in what was going on in the schools.  This would be most welcome.</P>
    <P>Those areas most in need of such schools are the areas in which there is a high proportion of skilled, semiskilled and unskilled workers, an area in which there are large families living in overcrowded homes.  A local community school would help to get rid of basic environmental defects in such areas.  When the Plowden Report was published in Britain, Mr. Crossman acted immediately on the recommendations and he designated five priority areas.  One such area was in Liverpool in which many Irish people live.  Densely populated neighbourhoods were selected and in these areas community schools have now become the centres of community learning and social activity.  These schools have been highly successful in Britain and there is no reason at all why they should not be highly successful here.  I do not think the finance needed to implement such a policy would be all that great. There are many socially deprived areas in Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Galway.  Community schools could play a vital part in community development in these areas.</P>
    <P>We believe such schools have tremendous potential.  The environment in certain housing estates is not all that it should be.  There is no sense of local community conscience.  If community schools were set up in such areas they would generate a dynamic community life.  I assure the Minister I welcome the idea of community schools.  There will, of course, be certain problems.  The community school <Col N="342" /> concept will pose considerable difficulty where the traditional Catholic management of schools is concerned. This has been admitted by Church leaders.  Cardinal Conway published a booklet recently on Catholic schools. In that booklet he wrote:</P>
    <P>The fact is the child's basic formation for life, whether social, moral or religious, is likely to be gravely affected if the two great formative influences, the home and the school, do not collaborate and support each other.  The formation of the child is a continuous process between the home and the school and one should be, as far as basic truths and principles are concerned, a continuation of the other and, if it is not so, the preparation of the child for life may be greatly weakened, if not rendered schizophrenic.</P>
    <P>Now the area in which disagreement arises is on the question as to how the child will be formed.  Some people, adopting a narrow, religious approach, would interpret this formation as being largely the moulding of a child into an almost purely religious pattern and way of life.  Others would interpret it in terms of the development of the child's personality and potential.  There is a difference of approach and this has been one of the major issues.  I do not know if many Members of this House pay much attention to a colleague of mine in Cork, the Rev. James Good, but I attended a meeting last year in Maynooth at which he spoke on community schools.  His remarks are interesting, coming from a well-known Catholic priest.  He said:</P>
    <P>Many of you will have read the document &ldquo;Community Schools&rdquo;, issued to the Irish bishops and subsequently leaked to the newspapers. Educationally speaking, it is dynamite. In a little over 1,000 words it topples the structure of second level education as we know it, and introduces a whole new series of concepts which are new and as yet untried in Irish education.  The typical unit created by the new proposal will be the result of the amalgamation of boys from the Brothers' school, girls from the Sisters' school, and the vocational <Col N="343" /> schools' pupils, all now joined together in one single school, coeducational, comprehensive in its facilities, and controlled by a Board representative of the community generally, and available for adult education classes in the evening.  It is of course an arrangement which bristles with difficulties, and that is possibly the reason why so many people have already bristled at the mere mention of the term &ldquo;community schools&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a pretty straightforward statement from the Rev. James Good, a man of deep understanding and with very radical views as to the role of the Church in society and the role of the Catholic Church in particular in education. Twelve months ago at Maynooth he said:</P>
    <P>The main fact here is that in the matter of control of schools at the secondary level we are fighting a losing battle,&mdash;</P>
    <P>by &ldquo;we&rdquo; he was referring to his fellow-religious</P>
    <P>&mdash;in that we are trying to spread an ever-thinning number of Religious over an ever-growing number of schools with the inevitable result that the layman must ultimately stand up and say &ldquo;I will not serve.&rdquo; The alternative is, in my mind, quite clear.  As I see it, it would occur in two phases.  The first of these would be a phase in which Religious would hand over control of the schools to the Community Board as envisaged in the Department's document, and continue to teach in the schools for the present as ordinary teachers.  The second phase, which I would not envisage occurring for some years, would be the transfer of Religious to noneducational projects where the need for their presence has been clearly demonstrated.</P>
    <P>This was straight talking by Dr. Good.  As we know, he has been rather ostracised by certain members of the Hierarchy at local and national level for stating these obvious truths in relation to education, truths which people will have to face in the years <Col N="344" /> ahead.  The Minister should examine carefully all these problems.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has set a building date for construction of the community school at Tallaght.  On 12th February an announcement was made by Mr. Noel Lindsay of the development branch of the Department of Education that construction work would start in August.  The first phase, which will cater for pupils up to intermediate level, is expected to be completed by August, 1973.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he has given any real consideration to the kind of school that will be built.  Will we have yet another typical, conventional secondary school, which may have the words &ldquo;comprehensive school&rdquo; or &ldquo;community school&rdquo; over the front door but inside it will be yet another post-primary school?  Will any real imagination be displayed with regard to the construction of the new school?  Has provision been made for playing fields in the grounds?  I hope there will be a swimming pool attached to the school.  Many of the educational buildings being erected are out-of-date already and they do not meet modern educational requirements.  The present revolution in educational thinking demands that the layout of buildings, particularly for community schools, be radically changed from the conventional design.  There is great need for much more flexibility in the design of schools; otherwise the schools will not be able to meet the heavy demands that will be placed on them.</P>
    <P>I shall give one example.  In south county Dublin a typically conventional post-primary school is used by the local community.  However, if a residents' association meeting is held in the school the adults spend half the night taking out desks, setting out chairs for the meeting and, generally speaking, the building is cramped and unsuitable.  If a community school is to serve the community's purposes in the evening, and if we wish to have less of a formal classroom approach in such schools, it is imperative that more flexibility be displayed with regard to the layout of the building.  If the school is to be a central meeting place for the community the structure <Col N="345" /> must be different.  The addition of an assembly room or a room in which seminars might be held generally are afterthoughts because the Department do not make provision for them in the design and planning of the building. The design and external structure should be planned so that the future activities of the community can be catered for adequately in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There would be less need for a standard size of class, except for social or recreational activities where there might be an average of 30 persons involved in project work.  I hope that there will be greater facilities available for teachers.  In many of the schools I have visited, the teachers' rooms, the assembly rooms and rooms for preparing visual aids are totally inadequate and do not help the teachers to prepare properly for their work.  There is nothing utopian in the proposals I have made and I hope the Minister will inform the House of the approach he intends to adopt on this matter.</P>
    <P>The primary sector has been much neglected because the community schools have taken over in the past twelve months.  In many respects the real problems are in the primary sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hardly so.  The community schools may have taken over in the debates in this House but the Deputy obviously has not heard of the positive work being done in the primary area. Perhaps it has not been clouded with the same misrepresentations as the community schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the primary sector later.  In my opinion this is the area of real neglect.  With regard to community schools, in respect of the original document of October, 1970, the criteria of section 1, A, B, C and D, and sections 2, 3 and 4 were acceptable to the Labour Party. However, we do not support the Government in relation to sections 5, 6, 7 and 8.  In view of the present controversy it might have been better if the Minister had dropped the whole concept of his approach rather than <Col N="346" /> allow it to develop the way it did.  A new Minister for Education in a new Government, which we must have, would start afresh and would probably put the matter into a better perspective. It is obvious now that the Minister is protesting too much about his views on the community schools.  No matter how he may perspire on the platform of the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, and shout at the delegates, the fact is that responsible opinion on this island was shocked at what the Minister had in mind originally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to the secondary and vocational schools and the proposed new structures.  We were utterly opposed to these proposals because, as originally framed, they were quite regressive and they took no account of the magnificent contribution made by the vocational schools, in particular, to the development of a modern Ireland.  They were contemptuous of the rights of the teachers, the rights of parents, and the rights of the minority in our community above all, as originally drafted. That must be said and it must go on record.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has changed his mind on the original proposals of 1970.  I can now count five different changes of policy in relation to the community schools.  There are five different areas where the Minister has not just climbed down but has jumped down in an effort to recover some balance.  In many respects it is hard to know who is railroading whom. In 1971, Cardinal Conway adopted a pretty hard-line attitude on the community schools.  In a statement which was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12th May, 1971, he said:</P>
      <P>What is important to remember is that the Catholic school authorities cannot be expected to consent to arrangements which would legally deCatholicise their schools.  This is the essence of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Michael Heney went on to predict a confrontation and, of course, this came about.  There seems to be a very peculiar process of consultation on <Col N="347" /> these developments.  I gather it is now going on once again in relation to the deed of trust.  I gather that representatives of the Department, the secretary and his colleagues, go to see the Cardinal and he tells them what he thinks should be done.  An interpretation is put on that, brought back to the Department and mulled over.  It is regarded as a negotiating posture on his part and it may be or it may not be taken seriously.  Something then emerges in another document which is thrown into the stream of negotiations. I gather that is the way educational policy is formulated.</P>
    <P>We had the statement by the Vocational Teachers Association.  They went to see Cardinal Conway and what they learned from him was radically different, apparently, from what the secretary of the Department learned. I do not know who is misinterpreting whom or who is codding whom.  The whole process is totally disedifying and it inevitably finishes up in a welter of confusion.  The secretary of the Department and his colleagues have my sympathy.  I fully appreciate the terrible problems of the jobs they are given to do.  My comments are not made in any personal sense.  In these behind-closeddoors negotiations no one really learns what the true feelings are because they are in a peculiar area of an educational vacuum in terms of policy formation.</P>
    <P>It is disastrous for the Catholic Church in the context of the reaction it will get from the electorate; it is disastrous for the politicians because inevitably they come into conflict with the Church and with the electorate and, above all, it is disastrous for education.  You finish up with a negotiating posture which is the outcome of what each power interest wants and whether that is for the benefit of the child, or for the benefit of the educational system, seems to be rather irrelevant.</P>
    <P>No sooner do the negotiations start than we get this kind of hysterical reaction, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 5th June, 1971, that the heads of the religious orders in Ireland last night broke their silence.  Urging Irish parents to raise their voices now loud and clear against those who in the <Col N="348" /> name of some unspoken liberal ideal would wish to deprive them of their inalienable rights to send their children to Catholic schools.  Off we go with more hysteria, more power reaction, from various groups and we finish up driving one another around the bend and talking in purely educational polemic terms which mean nothing to anyone.  By and large, you get an hysterical reaction on both sides.</P>
    <P>In an area where there is enormous sensitivy and where Church interests are deeply involved, and where their involvement cannot be treated in a casual manner, and where any politician who tries to play politics with their involvement would get short shrift, it behoves the Department to display considerable caution and considerable circumspection in bringing forward this kind of proposal.</P>
    <P>My ideal in education would be a multi-denominational system.  I do not regard myself as being a non-denominational fiend.  The community on this island is overwhelmingly a Christian community.  If we are ever to have a united Ireland I should like to see a form of co-operative multi-denominational educational development. There is nothing madly socialist about this.  Some of my colleagues want a pure, secular, undenominational type of educational structure.  I should like to see a multi-denominational structure. This is the logical development for the kind of society we have.  I very much resent what I call the throwing of the prayer book at the Opposition. In the recent community schools conflict, from what the Minister said, particularly talking at a Fianna Fáil meeting, from which I got a feedback, not from what he said in this House, but what he said locally, we were almost asked in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Constituency, when did Barry Desmond last go to Mass.  It had almost reached that level of confusion among Catholics.  The tragedy that developed in relation to this debate was unnecessary. The Minister could have avoided a great deal of that confusion.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any confusion on the question of what I would call denominational education, I ought to make my own personal point of view <Col N="349" /> quite clear.  Should the Catholic parents in this Republic want Catholic, diocesan, post-primary schools for their children, as far as I am concerned, they have a democratic right to support such schools, to have them and to pay for them.  I would also make the point that, so far, most parents have never been generally consulted as to whether they want that system or not. They have it and, if they want to keep it, that is the democratic right of parents.  I would extend the argument and say that if the Church of Ireland &mdash;Protestant parents&mdash;want Protestant post-primary schools for their children, they, too, have a fundamental right to have that system.  I am not going to take it from them.  I would not deny people their right to have that system if they want it.  But nobody in this country has the authority or the right under the Constitution to have set up by legislation and to have enshrined in the decisions and regulations of the Department an exclusively denominational post-primary system for one Church and for one Church only.  This is the nub of a great deal of the argument.</P>
    <P>We have an entitlement, and should have an entitlement, under the Constitution to a choice between schools which would be exclusively owned by a particular religious denomination and, for example, our vocational schools which are multi-denominational. That choice should be open to all citizens in the Republic irrespective of creed or class.  That, as far as I am concerned, has been the real issue in regard to the community schools.</P>
    <P>I might add that, particularly the Catholic Church authorities, in their reaction on the community schools question did themselves something of a disservice because, if a Church has to ensure that its influence in society and its role in education has to be defined and regularised by a rigid, almost ecclesiastical, diocesan system of control, particularly in a community which is overwhelmingly Catholic, and has to copperfasten it in that manner, then we see exposed a sorry lack of trust in their own community and in the Christian commitment <Col N="350" /> which people have in regard to their children's education, and the Christian commitment of the teachers and of elected public representatives. As a public representative who happens to be a Catholic, although not elected as such, I always get the impression that lest B. Desmond might some day get some mad notion in relation to educational reform, all approaches and avenues are controlled. I am afraid the Churches themselves are displaying a very sorry lack of trust and lack of commitment. This is unfortunate and undesirable. It is particularly undesirable in relation to a united Ireland.  My colleague Deputy Cruise-O'Brien made this point in his contribution yesterday.</P>
    <P>I might remind the House of what Brian Faulkner had to say about this kind of approach.  It is very interesting to hear Brian Faulkner.  If it had not been reported as having been said by him in London on the 4th June, 1971, one might almost think it was Pádraig Faulkner who was speaking.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Successive Governments in Northern Ireland have taken the view down the years that if the Roman Catholic Church wants to have separate education for its children, it is entitled to do so, because it does represent approximately one-third of the population.  Since the 1930's Northern Ireland Governments have given special financial assistance to the Roman Catholic Church for its schools and this assistance is on a more generous scale than is available for Church schools in any other part of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Take Pádraig Faulkner's attitude to the Protestant schools in the Republic and Brian Faulkner's attitude to the Catholic schools in Northern Ireland and you have precisely the same partitionist exclusive mentality in terms of reaction.</P>
    <P>Brian Faulkner went on on that occasion to say:</P>
    <P>We would like to see a greater integration and this is present to some extent in the technical schools in Northern Ireland and there is a possibility that we may see more integration in the sixth form in <Col N="351" /> schools but the Catholic Church still says very clearly, both in the North and in the South, that it wants to maintain its own separate schools. We take the view and the Northern Ireland Government takes the view that it is entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>This was the view of Brian Faulkner and we had precisely the same attitude being followed through, in reverse, by the Minister for Education here.</P>

      <P>
        <i>The Irish Times,</i> 4th June, 1971&mdash;the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland at an interview in London.</P>
      <P>To complete my comments in relation to community schools, I want to assure the Minister that I go a great deal of the way with the community schools proposals.  I thank the Minister for climbing down quite recently on the proposals.  As we know, the original proposal was four representatives of all religious orders and this was modified by the proposals that the religious orders would appoint two persons as parents' representatives.  This was a change to be welcomed.  The second change was that parents in all the other areas would be allowed to elect directly their own representatives.</P>
      <P>I am glad also that the Minister admitted in this House that the proposal in relation to faith and morals was dropped.  Thanks be to God, that was out of the way before it became the talking point of Western Europe.  It is amazing how people react.  If this kind of proposal is made, inevitably there is a reaction.  Consider one reaction. The Right Reverend Monsignor John O'Regan, Chairman of the Dublin Education Council for Secondary Schools, on 3rd February, 1972, in a long statement which rejected the criticisms, said about the faith and morals aspect of it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a period of much sex permissiveness, of drug addiction in this city even among children of the age of 13, of unscrupulous exploitation of <Col N="352" /> young people, this is an ultimate safeguard which the Minister, in his concern and wisdom, saw as desirable, especially in very large schools.</P>
    <P>The faith and morals clause has been dropped.  Monsignor O'Regan was all for it.  I do not know what is going to happen now in Tallaght and Blanchardstown.  I presume we will have a total outbreak of sex permissiveness in Tallaght and Blanchardstown now that the faith and morals clause has been dropped.  I presume the incidence of drug addiction will rocket and I presume the unfortunate children will be unscrupulously exploited.  This is what was predicted if we did not have this clause.  Now the Minister has dropped it.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that if one has an interest in education one must go around with a whole lot of newspaper clippings in one's pockets because it is from the newspapers you learn of the Government's intentions.  There was an announcement in <i>The Irish Press</i> on 16th February of the preliminary draft on the Tallaght community school.  I shall not bore the House by reading it; it is available in the Library.  Two days before the Ard Fheis the Minister ran for cover and there is a statement&mdash;I do not know whether it was leaked or not; it does not say it is a public statement&mdash;but the draft does say on religious freedom:</P>
    <P>The school shall include a department of religious instruction and formation. Religious instruction given to pupils shall be in accordance with the wishes of their parents and as provided for by the religious authority concerned.</P>
    <P>Three cheers.  At long last the Minister recognises the objections of this side of the House to exclusiveness and the failure to have this kind of regulation properly drafted.  I would have relished some of the libel actions that would have developed if the Minister had persisted with the faith and morals clause. Listen to what Monsignor John O'Regan had to say about it and this is in relation to the appointment of teachers:</P>
    <P>There is one exception&mdash;the sole instance where the latter board, <Col N="353" /> which actually makes the appointments, considers a recommended candidate to be a positive danger to the faith or morals of the young children, of whatever religious persuasion, attending the school.  This prescription is enacted in favour of children for whom the school exists.</P>
    <P>I should love to see some members of the INTO, the IASTI and the VTA taking the Minister to the cleaners.  It would be reminiscent of damages claimed against the British troops in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Slowly but surely and in a typically Irish sense, with everybody talking at great length and wasting valuable hours when we should be talking about more vital areas of education, we have stopped the Minister from going berserk in relation to community schools.  There are still a number of areas where we hope and pray the Minister will amend his approach expeditiously.  In the Tallaght area parents are still not directly elected to the board.  This is a negation of democracy; it is a total inversion of democracy, a peculiar twist in logic and I am certain it will be amended by the Minister.  He should have the commonsense to get the roll, hold the election and appoint them.  The problem will then be solved to the delight of the people of Tallaght.</P>
    <P>There is a disgraceful and absolute exclusion of teachers from participation in the management board of community schools.  The teachers have been told they can be members of the advisory board.  Nobody knows what they are going to advise on.  Nobody knows the function or terms of reference of the advisory board.  In an age when we talk of participatory democracy and we say that people have a right to share in decision-making in society why does the Minister persist in an autocratic concept of administration and management of community schools, a totally authoritarian concept which excludes the right of participation of teachers in these schools?  This is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>I do not know what to say about the deed of trust because if one makes predictions one may only make the <Col N="354" /> situation worse.  I gather there has been a meeting in Dundalk.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this.  It has been suggested by John Horgan in <i>The Irish Times</i> that there was another meeting in Dundalk between the Cardinal and the representatives of the Department of Education with allegedly&mdash;I do not know whether this is true or not&mdash;the Cardinal having with him English lawyers in relation to the deed of trust. Would the Minister, in the name of God and of educational development, publish the deed of trust immediately it becomes available?  I think he has already assured us that he will.  Will he assure the House that this document will not be regarded as an absolutely final document about which nobody can say &ldquo;Boo&rdquo;, that it will be subject to amendment?  This was the basic fault in the original proposal for community schools.  The working document went off at half cock, the other documents followed merrily and everybody took up a posturing position.  Unless we are assured that the deed of trust will not be regarded as a final document I am afraid we will again have battle lines drawn but at the moment I am quite hopeful that we will have an opportunity of reviewing it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must do some plain talking on the question of co-education. If we are to have real community schools we must have co-education.  I gather we are to have that in Tallaght and Blanchardstown.  If we are to have comprehensive education in rural Ireland it must be co-education.  With the development of community schools and comprehensive education the traditional single sex system is not likely to remain an outstanding feature of our educational structure.  This sex segregated system should never have been encouraged by the Department of Education.  In a country where the population is widely dispersed it has never made sense to me.  I know that the religious teaching orders will have considerable difficulty in adjusting to co-education but they will have to adjust pretty rapidly because the education of children is much more important than the organisational structure of either the politicians or the religious teaching orders.  Co-education <Col N="355" /> is necessary.  Socially it would be much more healthy to have co-education at post-primary level.  There is no social, moral, psychological or physiological justification for the continuance of this now universally outmoded system. Many of the nuns I have met have got sufficient imagination and confidence and many of them are extremely progressive. In many areas they are far more progressive than the lay secondary teachers.  I find that they could and will adapt readily and are very willing to do so in many areas.</P>
    <P>The other adaptation that must take place will be on the trade union side. If we are to have real community schools with comprehensive education, if the traditional secondary and vocational structure is to be abolished, we must also ask the trade union side to rationalise its organisation.  I know how difficult this is, having worked in the ICTU and having seen the teaching trade unions at close quarters.  I should not care to tell the House what they tend to do to each other.  With the 15,200 primary teachers, 7,500 secondary teachers and 3,741 vocational teachers we have a total teaching population of 26,441.  A federation amalgamating and rationalising into one single large public service trade union primary, secondary and vocational teachers would be a major step forward in educational development.  I think the primary teachers would have nothing to fear in that set-up.  Inevitably, we shall see the qualifications of primary teachers rapidly enhanced and they will have full graduate status in the very near future.  I would hope to see for all teachers the same basic educational degree to be supplemented by specialist diplomas at teaching level. I have no doubt this will come.  That kind of rationalisation of the trade union structure would certainly be welcome.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy O'Brien spoke about the formation of true nationalist attitudes in the classrooms. We in the Labour Party want our children to have a real sense of pride in modern Ireland.  We want them to have a sense of dignity and a respect for all that is best in modern <Col N="356" /> Ireland and, contrary to what some sections of the British press think, there is still much good left in this country. Some of our lunatic fringe are not helping at this stage.  We want our children to have a true sense of national identity.  Every Irish parent would wish for this.  I can share in the strong criticism by Deputy O'Brien yesterday in regard to some things some children in some schools are taught regarding the historic aspirations and desires of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>In the past fortnight I was in a national school in Dublin and a teacher there responsible for teaching music was teaching songs.  There are 600 boys in this school&mdash;the Minister might be interested&mdash;and the three songs that every child knew were:</P>
    <P>

      <P>I have spoken to those children and their sole capacity of appreciation of Irish ballads now rests on these three songs.  They have them in their copies which I saw. When one looks at the song, <i>Seán South of Garryowen,</i> and when one sees and hears children of ten and 11 years old singing it, one wonders.  One also finds them singing</P>
      <P>&ldquo;God Save Ireland,&rdquo; said the heroes</P>
      <P>God Save Ireland said they all;</P>
      <P>Whether on the scaffold high</P>
      <P>Or on the battle field we die</P>
      <P>Oh, what matter when for Erin dear we fall.</P>
      <P>That is a fairly useful way in 1972 of starting the next civil war.  I wish my children to have a deep sense of national pride and I hope they will grow up as young Republicans, but I do not want to read in any child's copybook, as I did in the past week in the case of a national school in Dublin, the following words from <i>Seán South of Garryowen:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> As they moved along the street</P>
    <P>Up to the barrack door,</P>
    <P>They scorned the danger they would meet,</P>
    <P>The fate that lay in store.</P>
    <P>They were fighting for old Ireland</P>
    <P>To claim their very own</P>
    <P>And foremost of the gallant band</P>
    <P>Was South of Garryowen.</P>
    <P>In the current, difficult political situation I honestly question whether we should be encouraging children of ten or 12 years old to go marching up to a barrack door on the other side of the Border.</P>

      <P>I do not think this is a particularly fruitful educational exercise.  In the past fortnight I met in the streets of Dublin young children singing the song they were taught at school by some teacher, the song which goes:</P>
      <P>I'd like to join the IRA</P>
      <P>And furnish it with guns</P>
      <P>Throw gelignite and dynamite</P>
      <P>And kill the British bums.</P>
      <P>This is the song the children of Dublin are singing and I know some of them were taught that at school.  An enormous responsibility devolves on educationists in the current political situation. I was appalled when I saw and heard children come out with what I regard as a very narrow, perverted, fanatical form of republicanism.  I do not suggest for a moment it is republicanism; it is a throwback to fascism to teach children this kind of approach to nationality generally.  It brings me back to the very old days in Cork city during the war.  We were young children attending the local convent school when the Protestants walked on one side of the street down the old Blackrock Road and we walked on the other side.  I remember as a child that they used sing to the La Rochelle girls with a nice touch of sectarianism:</P>
      <P>Proddy, proddy greencoats,</P>
      <P>How do you do?</P>
      <P>Proddy, proddy greencoats</P>
      <P>We'll do you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> This was the favourite song of the children in my national school in Cork when the girls were coming home from Rochelle School in the evenings.  We were Catholics and they were Protestants. Because we were Catholics and they were Protestants, does it, in that context, really matter?</P>
    <P>Our educational system must ensure that the current political strife will in no way be exploited in developing attitudes, but is it any wonder that there should be this divorce when we have a system of education which is both sectarian and segregated?  Presumably this system will continue until, according to the Taoiseach, all these things are negotiable.  Not until then can we do anything about having a non-denominational system of education in a united Ireland.  A system of education in which children do not even share a song is intrinsically wrong. Under such a system children grow up regarding one another with suspicion and end by throwing petrol bombs at one another at different ends of the same street.  If we are to get rid of sectarian strife we must adapt our educational system to multi-denominational education.  Protestants and Catholics alike will have to make their contribution.  There is hope that they will do this.</P>
    <P>A very strongly worded statement was made recently at a meeting of the Association of Principals of Vocational Schools in Athlone.  These people were extremely critical of the selection procedures in post-primary education.  The report of the meeting appears in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2nd February.  That report states:</P>
    <P>One of the underlying points at issue is the effect that selection procedures have on the &ldquo;free post-primary education&rdquo; scheme launched by the late Donogh O'Malley.  Secondary schools which opt into the scheme are not under any obligation to have an open admissions policy, or to admit all applicants within their catchment areas.  The operation of a selection test in these circumstances can mean that pupils living nearby are excluded and have to pay bus fares to other post-primary centres, while <Col N="359" /> school places in their own area are taken by brighter pupils from other areas.</P>
    <P>This is a serious criticism by a responsible organisation and the Minister must come to grips with this problem.  The report goes on:</P>
    <P>A number of post-primary schools run by religious Orders have, for the past number of years, organised their enrolment procedures in such a way as to ensure that the most talented of those applying for admission were, in fact, granted places.  The method most favoured by these schools has been to hold their entrance examinations early in the year and to notify those obtaining highest marks that places would be offered to them provided they declared their intention of accepting before a specified date. This has the effect of causing apprehension among pupils and parents, and consequent on this pupils are virtually compelled to commit themselves to enrolling in these schools through fear of being rejected.</P>
    <P>Post-primary schools run by local authorities, on the other hand, do not adopt such selective procedures, and indeed would regard them as reprehensible.  In many cases pupils are taken from outside what the Department of Education designates their own catchment areas, and, because they are more socially acceptable or get better marks in the entrance examination, are given preference to pupils living nearer those schools.</P>
    <P>I regard these selection procedures as detrimental to the best interests of education and the Minister should insist that we do not have this kind of apartheid in our educational system. The Minister should also publicise the fact that there is now available in most vocational schools a wide range of general subjects.  The terms &ldquo;vocational&rdquo; and &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; should be dropped.  Both are post-primary systems and should be known officially as such.  The use of these particular terms is misleading.  To give an idea of <Col N="360" /> the wide range of subjects available, let me quote what the headmaster of one of our vocational schools, had to say in reply to an article by Father Peter Troddyn, S.J.  The headmaster in question was Mr. Tom Carney and he gave a list of the subjects being taught in the vocational schools: Irish, English, Latin, French, Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Civics, Religion, Metalwork, Woodwork, Drawing.</P>
    <P>In almost all vocational schools in the country the curriculum contains most of these subjects, or may contain them with the possible addition of history and geography, and, in the girls' schools, commerce and home economics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>From the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 25th March, 1971.  Mr. Carney is quite correct in what he says. The terms &ldquo;vocational&rdquo; and &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; are quite misleading.  Vocational education is secondary education. Since it is part of the function of the secondary school to prepare pupils for employment, then it is also vocational in purpose.  Mr. Carney suggests that the schools should have jointly a common unambiguous name.  I strongly support this suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the curriculum and its future development, we must remember that the children at school now will a decade hence be at work and faced with the explosive forces of modern technology and changing demands for modern skills and the curriculum must now be geared to the employment opportunities which will be available a decade hence.  I do not think the Department are geared for this anticipation of necessary curricula changes.  I would urge that there be some form of academic public commission which would consider the curriculum and, with the guidance of international experts if this is necessary, anticipate the changes and thus avoid teaching children obsolete skills. If a survey were carried out on the children receiving post-primary education now, children who will be starting their careers in the mid-seventies and <Col N="361" /> early eighties, it would be obvious that they will have legitimate complaints to make about the decisions made by their parents, churches and politicians with regard to the curriculum.  We should make every effort to ensure that a full review of the curriculum is carried out.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to set up educational study centres for teachers.  This is a necessary and imaginative proposal and it is a constructive innovation.  The Parliamentary Secretary made the point some time ago that we all tend to ignore the fantastic strides made in the primary sector.  Anyone who read the survey of national school terminal leavers prepared by Joy Rudd of the development branch of the Department of Education, and who appreciates the implications of that survey, could not be complacent about the national schools system.  The Department deserve to be congratulated on this survey.  It showed some rather alarming trends and with regard to national school leavers it made the following point:</P>
    <P>All the children concerned came from working class homes or were the children of very small farmers or street traders.  There were a few children of skilled manual workers but none of professional parents, office workers, managers or business owners.  This might be expected. Studies in early school leaving in other countries have shown that there is a close correspondence between father's occupation and school leaving age.</P>
    <P>However, this socio-economic division does not tell the whole story. The bulk of these children were not from ordinary working class homes. Only 34 per cent of them had fathers in steady employment at all, a further 13 per cent of them had fathers described as farmers or with an independent trade.  The rest either had no father, their father was ill or disabled, unemployed, retired, irregularly employed or an itinerant.  Subsequent interviews with parents confirmed this picture.  The teachers described a quarter of the families as &ldquo;poor&rdquo; or &ldquo;very poor&rdquo; compared <Col N="362" /> with only 4 per cent of the families of post-primary leavers so described. It should be remembered that the sample of post-primary leavers was taken from the same schools as the Terminal Leavers and is not representative of all post-primary leavers in the country.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House but I should like to stress that there are factors we tend to ignore and areas which we tend to gloss over, particularly in relation to the terminal school leavers.  The survey also stated:</P>
    <P>The families of these children were large.  The average number of children given by the teachers was 7.2. It was possible to break this down in the interview areas.  The average size of a family in the poor city centre area was 6.7, on the corporation estate 8.2, in the midlands rural area 7.4, and in the western rural area 6.2.  Separate breakdowns for boys and girls were almost completely identical.</P>
    <P>These are facts with regard to our school leavers about which we cannot be complacent.  The survey also stated:</P>
    <P>Although the assessments of Terminal Leavers were heavily weighted in the direction of below average and very much below average, it is worth nothing here that teachers assessed the general attainments of 133 Terminal Leavers in the sample as good or excellent.  This suggests that there are about 700 children annually leaving National Schools who would be well able to do a conventional secondary course.</P>
    <P>This survey makes fairly sobering reading for those who want to eulogise our national schools system.</P>
    <P>What happened to the terminal leavers?  The survey makes the following observation:</P>
    <P>10.1% of the boys and 6.8% of the girls were unemployed at the time of this survey, 3 to 6 months after they had left school.  8.6% of the girls were looking after the family and 17.5% of the boys were working on the family farm, but this is probably an underestimate because of the under-representation for rural <Col N="363" /> schools.  The others were ill/disabled, occupied in family business or had emigrated.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the statement made seven or eight years ago by the late Donogh O'Malley.  At that time there were 17,000 children finishing primary school and they did not receive further education.  He said it was a dark stain on the national conscience.  A close examination of the position regarding school leavers would show that that stain is not obliterated and we should not rest until it is wiped out.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some comment on facilities at the primary school level. In 1970 I asked the Minister a question regarding the condition of some of our national schools.  At that stage he estimated that approximately 900 of the schools were not equipped with electric current and that 1,600 were heated with open fires.  I know that an intensified effort has been made by the Office of Public Works to try to improve the position; some of the national schools were closed, some were repaired and an effort was made to equip them with electricity and heating.  However, it is a national scandal that there are still hundreds of national schools that are not equipped with electric current and that 1,000 of the schools are still being heated by means of open fires.  This is a disgraceful position.  Many national schools are very poorly equipped in terms of heating, lighting and ventilation.</P>
    <P>The INTO, the primary teachers' union, are not militant enough in this field.  Some years ago, in no uncertain manner, the INTO made it clear to the school managers that they would not tolerate these appalling conditions. They and the parents should campaign much more vigorously on this question. Many parents do not bother to go down to the schools in the rural areas, and in many of the urban areas, to see the classrooms in which their children are receiving their education.  These schools should be immediately and thoroughly repaired.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact of over-crowding in our schools.  The Parliamentary Secretary feels that considerable efforts <Col N="364" /> have been made&mdash;and I would accept this on the curriculum side&mdash;in relation to primary schools.  The second gravest national scandal&mdash;and I do not use these terms lightly&mdash;in education is the appalling over-crowding in our primary schools in many of the major urban areas.  For example&mdash;and this is quite a horrifying figure&mdash;there are 61,000 pupils in the Greater Dublin area, in classes of more than 45 pupils. Who could expect that these children will get a decent primary education? This is a disgraceful situation.  I do not think that the INTO should put up with it any longer.</P>
    <P>The House will be horrified to learn that there are 1,300 classes in the Greater Dublin area with more than 45 pupils.  The members of the INTO who are teaching in those classes must be very subservient because any teacher teaching a class of more than 45 pupils should react very strongly. There is also a very large number of classes with between 40 and 44 pupils. Yet we are all talking about an average of 35 pupils.  There are 689 classes in Dublin of between 40 to 44 pupils; there are 30,000 children in those classes.  Therefore, there are 90,000 pupils in the Greater Dublin area in 1,900 classes of 40 plus.  This should not be tolerated by anyone.  Primary education in the Greater Dublin area cannot be in a healthy state because, out of a total of 114,000 primary school pupils in the Greater Dublin area, 90,000 are in classes of 40 plus.  Can anybody say that these children are getting a decent primary education?  I certainly do not think they are.  This scandal should be dealt with as quickly as possible.  The Minister and the INTO should deal with it as an emergency.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of nursery schools.  I live in a constituency in which there has been a proliferation of private nursery schools and private play centres.  Many of them are grossly overcrowded and inadequately supervised. Very often they are supervised by people who are totally unqualified. Parents put their children into these private kindergartens which are run, very often, for nothing but the money. Many pre-school play centres are ungency <Col N="365" /> hygenic, cramped, unhealthy and badly ventilated and children spend a good part of the day in them while their parents go to work because, in many cases, they have to go to work.  They should be properly registered, and planning approval should be demanded by the Department of Education and the Department of Health.  They should insist that they are properly supervised and adequately maintained in the best interests of everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in the next 12 months.  He has had an appallingly difficult year.  Some of the difficulty was of his own making and he inherited a great deal of it.  If we in the Opposition have been in any way vicious in our reaction, it was not personal. We want to see a better, more progressive, more modern, comprehensive system of education.  In this long and valuable debate we are now having on education, we are giving this Estimate its proper place and its pride of place.  I am quite sure that our words will not be in vain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all very anxious, as Deputy Desmond has said, to give this Estimate its proper place in the affairs of the country.  We must be concerned to give the various aspects of the educational programme their proper place in this discussion.  Sadly, it was a characteristic of Deputy Desmond's contribution that the broad range of the educational programme, and aspects of it, were not given their proper place. One could be forgiven for coming to the conclusion that we were discussing the traditions of education of 20 years ago, or the traditions of social behaviour.  Much of Deputy Desmond's contribution was on the basis that what has been achieved must be overlooked, and that we must continue to remind the House, the country and those outside it, of the attitudes of various people, whether they be lay or clerical, over the past 12 months or two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One sometimes gets the impression that there is a sense of frustration and disappointment in the Opposition benches because so much common <Col N="366" /> ground has been reached due to the careful and painstaking consultations which have been taking place between the Minister and his Department and the various interests concerned at every level.</P>
    <P>If I may quote Deputy Desmond briefly before coming on to the main points, he did quote from Michael Heney of <i>The Irish Times</i> when he suggested that there was an inevitable confrontation. The fact that the inevitable confrontation that was suggested then, as alleged&mdash;I do not accept that &mdash;and that the interests concerned, apparently, were, according to that and according to Deputy Desmond, ranging to face each other in battle, has not happened and that, in fact, now a programme in that particular area has been developed, accepted, is now under way, and is, apparently, of much less consequence, if one is to judge from this debate, than the various attitudes that were mentioned in the course of the last year, and particularly the attitudes and misunderstandings that were promoted from, indeed, the Labour Party here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond can happily, fairly confidently, say that he himself takes a certain view about denominational education, for instance.  He knows, too, of course, that some colleagues of his do not share that view.  They have a view of, apparently, secular education. One welcomes the honesty in that statement. But, Deputy Desmond must recognise that if even within his small party, which would hope to be a constituent part of a multi-party government, such differences arise, those who are charged with the responsibility of meeting all the wishes and needs of all the various people have, indeed, quite a responsibility and that this responsibility must be met in a rational fashion.</P>
    <P>I did interrupt Deputy Desmond just once, in the course of a long discussion on the history of the negotiations and the consultations and the stories that emanated about various meetings on the community schools issue, which went on for over two hours this morning.  Deputy Desmond made a passing reference to the primary <Col N="367" /> school and said: &ldquo;God help the primary school side of it.  We have all been inclined to overlook it.  Most of our consideration has been with something else&rdquo;.  I suggested that, in fact, it was because of the cloud of misunderstanding that had been developed from this House that the progress that was being made in the various areas could be said to be overlooked. I asked Deputy Desmond then to have a look at the primary sector as well and to look at it and any part of it and the whole educational programme in a rational, reasoned way. As far as I can recall his look at the primary sector, it first of all dealt with his experience as a child in Cork chanting songs of one sort or another and secondly, with verses that he has seen in, I think, his children's copybooks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, not his own.  People do take what is said here and by the representatives here as being said responsibly.  If this does appear in one child's copybook and if Deputy Desmond is implying that a particular teacher dictated this, then he has an obligation to state who it was, when it was and, if he was not going to say it publicly, he should say it privately, because there is a grave danger that not only this nation but the world would think that that is the programme of history that is being, in fact, developed through our schools and that our teachers are, in fact, encouraging that type of approach to history.  It is fine to say and to get the headlines this morning or some other morning that we are rearing up little IRA men because some kids are coming home with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I made no such suggestion. Even for it to appear in one child's copybook is to me abhorrent. I am not saying it is general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Deputy <Col N="368" /> would spell out whether or not this was done at the direction of even an individual teacher because, if it was not, children have been known to write verses, children have been known to sing songs, children have been known to have certain views and the fact that they write these verses does not mean that it has either the sanction of a teacher, much less teaching organisations, and it certainly does not mean that it has the sanction of the Minister and the Department of Education or of this Government.</P>
      <P>Let me at this juncture refer particularly to the section on civics in the curriculum for primary schools, Part II, page 116 and which relates in this instance to the study of history, where it says:</P>
      <P>Anything which savours of chauvinism or any form of excessive nationalism tends to blur the child's awareness of the common bond of humanity.  The more violent aspects of history should not be stressed and the real value to humanity of men of peace and progress, such as Edmond Ignatius Rice, Madame Curie and Mahatma Gandhi should be placed in proper perspective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that that, at least, will get as much prominence as being the official policy and common view, not just of the Government but of the teaching organisations and the Department of Education and is what is being promoted, as is given to some of the statements that would appear to derive from just what is in one child's copybook, for whatever reason it may have been inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because, we must be concerned when we discuss this or any other aspect of affairs that at least our education programmes would not be discussed under the cloud of emotion or misrepresentation and that anything that would be said here would be specifically stated to be an isolated instance, if it is such, and, as well, in the interests of our children, in the interests of this programme of education, that we would not leave them or their parents with the impression that <Col N="369" /> they are being subjected by virtue of policy, or omission, to this kind of approach.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to make this, as Deputies seem to be tempted to do, an occasion for a discussion on the need for a re-awakening of each other and towards each other's rights and attitudes in this country.  This goes without stating, in any event.  I would hope that when discussing education, we would not bring in red herrings to imply that these isolated instances represent total policy and programme. Far from it.  They are totally abhorrent to such programme and entirely inconsistent with it.</P>
    <P>One of the matters that were referred to or discussed in this debate has been the use of facilities in schools and particularly the use of the facilities for recreational purposes out of school or for recreational purposes by community groups.  It is fairly evident to anybody who has heeded the development of public opinion in the last couple of years here and the attitude of the Minister and the Department in this area that, indeed, great strides have been made and great strides are continuing to be made and must be made.  No longer is the school looked upon as being an isolated unit separate from the community. That being so, no longer can the school facilities, as such, be regarded as isolated units separate from the community.  I want to say here, in fact, this is a matter on which the managers&mdash;here I speak of the primary schools&mdash;and the people concerned have not only shown a great awareness of the need but have shown a great determination to make these facilities available to responsible groups, subject to responsible control.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise, in the inquiries to, for instance, the National Youth Council with which my section of the Department is in very close consultation, the National Sports Council which was established by me over a year ago, that the reaction we have got from the various authorities concerned, and our function has been simply to inquire and not to direct, has been one of readiness and one of <Col N="370" /> encouragement.  It is evident that with the resources available to us and with the immense investment in education in recent times we have to utilise to the fullest possible extent the facilities we have, both for the schools and for the community.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some very exciting developments in recent times that involve co-operation between the Department, the local authorities, community recreational organisations and all people interested in integrating the school with the community and availing of the facilities in the school or in the community.  The House may be aware that some time ago the National Sports Council started a survey of the recreational facilities in the country and conducted meetings on a regional basis as a result of which regional recreation councils have been nominated to me for appointment as the regional arms of the National Sports Council.  I hope that within the next couple of months I shall be able to announce the composition of these various councils.  The main concern of the National Sports Council itself, and, indeed, of these councils, has been to utilise the existing facilities wherever they may be, to do a survey of the present and future needs and to meet those needs in a rational and economic way.</P>
    <P>Arising out of that, certain developments have taken place even before the survey has been completed.  I shall refer in particular to a development that has taken place in Tralee where the local authority both at urban council and at county council levels, and the other interests concerned, trade unions and chambers of commerce, have come together to develop a recreation complex around and in association with the technical school area in the town of Tralee.  I am glad to say that the facilities which would possibly have been restricted to the use of the school and the school children, if one were to rely on the old pattern, will now be pooled into the common centre and the complex will be financed jointly by the local authority, by the vocational education committee, by grants from the Department of Education, by the local trade union organisation and by <Col N="371" /> the local industrial involvement.  This is a pilot scheme in the type of development that all of us are anxious to see expanding.  The people of Tralee who had consultations with me through their representative&mdash;I would embarrass individuals by making specific reference to them&mdash;are now aware that they are giving a great headline and I am aware from the reaction to it that many other local authorities and other organisations are anxious to pool resources in this very desirable way.</P>
    <P>We only have limited resources to provide all these facilities.  There is no use expecting that every school that goes up can have a gymnasium or recreation hall if it is not within the structure of a community and if it is not viable in size to justify such expenditure. Deputy Desmond raised the issue of the design and planning of community schools.  I am glad to say, as has already been said, but apparently Deputy Desmond has not heard it or has overlooked it as he has overlooked many other things that have been said, that the design and planning of the community schools in the Dublin area, in particular&mdash;in Tallaght and Blanchardstown&mdash;are such that they leave provision for further development of recreational facilities for the school and the community within the complex of the community school in each case.  I am glad to say, too, that officers of the Department have been in active consultation with representatives of Dublin County Council in this area and once again the pooling of resources is emerging very clearly.  I do not want to anticipate what might happen or to suggest that this should be stated by me at this time beyond saying that Deputy Desmond appeared to be suggesting that this was not being thought about as if he was getting this brilliant idea for the first time that this must not be just a school, that it must be in the community and its facilities available to the community as if this had not been thought about and, in fact, been the basis of the whole programme or one of the major factors in the programme. The officers of the Department who have been in consultation <Col N="372" /> constantly on this with the Minister and who have informed me also from time to time have received every consideration from Dublin County Council in regard to the provision of facilities around the new community school.  The pupils in that area, or any area where such co-operation is forthcoming, can expect to enjoy facilities and to have an integration of education through, among other factors, recreation which will break down many of the barriers that have existed in the structure of education not in the recent past but possibly in the rather remote past.</P>
    <P>There has been a great emphasis placed on the need for development of the study of physical education particularly in the last year or so.  Very real progress is being made.  I do not want to repeat what I have already said in this House beyond saying that the first phase of the new National College of Physical Education will be ready in January of this coming year.  If it is to be recognised that physical education is an integral, important part of the curriculum at primary, post-primary or any other level, it must be recognised by those who would make easy, facetious criticism, that if you are to draw up a curriculum of physical education it is not equitable and it is not proper to do it on the basis that the small school units can carry on but will not have physical education for the children in them and that those who have a school unit sufficiently big to justify recreational facilities or outdoor play areas can include physical education in the curriculum.  This goes to the bottom of the whole question of facilities and range of choice and subjects to which every pupil should be entitled on an equal basis.  It cannot be and will not be accomplished overnight but the Minister, the Department and the Government have as a matter of major priority the provision of equal opportunity in education in every area for every child, irrespective of locality or background.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note from the Council of Europe Newsletter of 1.9.1971 that at page ten, the Danish Minister for Education suggested that one of the most important tasks in his <Col N="373" /> country would be to provide sufficient educational facilities to enable all young people, as well as all grown-ups needing new or continued instruction, to acquire an education which would ensure that they could occupy a decent and useful place in society and that economic, geographic or social conditions would not prevent them from taking advantage of these opportunities. That is precisely in line with the policy of the Minister and the Government here.</P>
    <P>I want to stress this.  There has been a certain amount of emotional argument against what are called big schools or big units which are supposed to be planned just for the sake of size. It must be recognised by all concerned that there is a limit of pupil accommodation and of size under which you cannot go and provide all the facilities, scientific, recreational and others, irrespective, as the Minister has said so often and as the Danish Minister has said, of geographic or other conditions. If we are to be allowed to continue to develop our programme to provide equal opportunities and facilities as far as possible for every pupil in the same sphere of education it must be recognised that the child in the country, as the Minister said very recently, must be given special consideration. He cannot be penalised for the fact that the taxpayer cannot provide these facilities in school units as small as some of them have been up to now and the children and the community must have the same range of choice and facilities as those who will now be fortunate enough to attend the new community school in Tallaght or Blanchardstown or other schools that have such facilities.</P>
    <P>I am, and the National Sports Council are, and anyone with an awareness of the importance of physical education in the curriculum is very anxious that as soon as possible&mdash;we realise this cannot be done overnight&mdash; we must reach a situation where these facilities can be provided in each educational complex.  It would be living in cloud cuckoo-land to expect that small units will be capable of providing such facilities either voluntarily or through the taxpayers.  If we talk of <Col N="374" /> equal opportunity in education for all our children I am very concerned that in the areas of health and social attitudes and capacity for enjoyment each will have the same facilities.  For that reason, I look forward to continuing development and sharing of facilities. I hope that those who sometimes want so much will recognise that in order to provide it, particularly out of the resources available to us, you must have planning within units of a certain size and that this sometimes involves dropping the emotional attachment to certain small units in certain areas if the same ranges of facilities and subjects are to be provided as are available in other areas.</P>
    <P>The first graduates in physical education will be coming out very shortly. Already there are 15 in their third year in St. Mary's College, Twickenham. They will complete their fourth year next year.  I must mention that these are male graduates; we have always had these two very excellent colleges, the Ling College and Sion Hill which have been conferring diplomas for a considerable time.  The real gap is on the male side and if we want to provide maximum opportunities for these teachers throughout the country as the college becomes fully operative we must ensure that facilities will be available to enable them to implement their programme.</P>
    <P>In this connection the reaction we have had in the Department from the student public has been immense.  Over 2,500 inquiries and applications for admission to the new College of Physical Education have been received. I do not want to discourage in any way boys and girls who are so committed to this programme by mentioning that figure but it is a very definite indication that the young people are inclined in that direction and are aware of the great potential in that direction.  The programme will be a four year one which will involve, apart from curriculum studies in physical education, curriculum studies of a broad nature also and graduates from the college will be fully qualified teachers.  A very definite element of pedagogic training, instruction and philosophy will be built into their <Col N="375" /> course.  Some of them will specialise in one other subject, some of them will take a broader range of two other subjects and they will be teachers specialised in physical education.</P>
    <P>The importance of this is that as children communicate with each other through play and recreation they will also communicate with a teacher of physical recreation, not with a person whom they see for one hour a week. The teacher will be able further to cement the liaison and the consultation which is very obviously developing between teachers and pupils in schools nowadays.  Such a teacher will be a very important part of the school life in the same way as are teachers of English, Latin or any other subject. This programme has immense potential not only for liaison between pupil and teacher but for the development of a new philosophy in education.</P>
    <P>Most of us realise we need to make great strides in this area because up to now we have had to depend on Sion Hill or on graduates who had been educated elsewhere.  One of the great objects of this college is that, particularly in summer, it will become a holiday area, a meeting place for students from every corner of the world involved in the same type of activities as our own students.  To varying extents, if there is a common language in this country, and, indeed, throughout the world, it is the language of sports and recreation.  There have been some sad exceptions in recent times due possibly to fear or apprehension, because some people could not understand the other's position or were afraid of the other's point of view.  In this new context they can at least meet each other and get to understand each other through the language of sports and recreation.</P>
    <P>There is evidence of this in our own country.  I do not want to make special references to specific sports but it appears at every level, and let me say I have got every facility and encouragment from the CCPR operating in the North.  I have had advice from them, we have had exchanges of views regularly. We all appreciate this is an area of immense potential in breaking down <Col N="376" /> the barriers in our society and I look to the students of this college who become graduates further to develop this programme, to launch themselves into other countries and to make contacts in the common interest of sports and recreation.  We hope that these new contacts will be a new step in the meaningful breaking down of the many barriers that exist not only in Ireland but throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased that the Government saw fit to include the new college within the scope of grants for higher education so that students who will attend the college, if they reach the required standard, will be entitled to higher education grants in the same way as if they were attending a university or any institute of third level education.</P>
    <P>Turning to another aspect of the recreational scene, I am glad to say that in recent times we have been finding great awareness even in small rural communities of the need to develop community recreation centres. Many of these centres have developed in or around old halls which had fallen into disuse.  Many of them have developed in old schools that had been closed.  In rural Ireland when the programme of primary education rationalisation began people became apprehensive about the old school being closed.  It had been an integral part of community life and they considered its closure a blow to activities within the community.  I did not agree with that view and recent history has proved me right.  Education was and is the only criteria in our rationalisation programme.</P>
    <P>In many areas in the country where schools were closed it has been found possible to make them available as community centres, as the nuclei of community centres.  They have been made available at nominal cost to appropriate properly constituted local bodies.  I am glad to say the Department of Education were ready to cooperate with this development and while many of the children learning lessons may be absent from those areas, the sound of men and women and children enjoying themselves in these new <Col N="377" /> centres has become a feature of the rural scene.</P>
    <P>I do not assert that all or even a majority of such centres have developed around old schools.  Some have developed around old halls or around newly constructed buildings, but they are becoming one of the most exciting things in rural Ireland.  I am particularly pleased to see that the various sporting associations, particularly those with the closest links with rural Ireland &mdash;I do not wish to refer to any particular body&mdash;have involved themselves totally in this development and have not excluded the rights of others who might not be members of their organisations from using the centres subject to appropriate conditions and satisfactory supervision.</P>
    <P>Last year, as an earnest of my interest in this development, I initiated a scheme of grants towards these community recreation centres.  They were not major grants because the resources available to me were limited.  They were not grants such as would enable the centres to be started without assistance from local sources but they helped to guarantee the PT equipment and so forth would be provided when the local effort had completed a building programme.</P>
    <P>I regard this as one of the most important functions I can discharge in this respect.  I welcome particularly the activities and the co-operation of the Community Recreation Council groups and I welcomed the opportunity presented in recent times of advising them on the dimensions of halls and on the facilities that can be made available having regard to the size of the halls available to them.  I hope that, when the regional sports councils become fully effective, they will take full advantage of the advice available to them. Sometimes, because of lack of consultation or advice, we find that an extra three or four yards in the length of the recreation centre would have provided, for example, two badminton courts instead of just one.  As a result of consultation at home and abroad, we have now a proto-type plan available and I invite all interested parties to examine this and ensure that they get the maximum return from the facilities. <Col N="378" /> This is very important when it comes to planning and construction because, for want of an extra yard or two in length, the adaptability of a centre can be diminished.</P>
    <P>When we come to resources we must think in terms of limited resources and precise planning within those resources. I am glad we have to think in terms of limited resources because there has been far too much haphazard planning. To ensure maximum utilisation of facilities planning must be done in a constructive way.  I know the National Sports Council, together with the regional sports councils and the local authorities, will both encourage and ensure this development.  If we were to continue the present haphazard pattern of development we would ultimately find some towns with an indoor recreational centre in a boys' school, an outdoor recreational centre in the vocational school and a mere assembly hall in the girls' secondary school.  That was the characteristic development and that is something we can no longer afford.  Development will have to be planned, not accidental.  The country cannot afford accidental development. The children cannot afford it and neither can the school authorities.  In the interests of all concerned there must be constructive planning.  Location will be very important.  If, for example, a swimming pool is being provided, then it will have to be located in an area which makes it convenient for the children to avail of it to the maximum extent possible.  On the other hand, facilities in the schools themselves can be made available to the community at large, subject to responsible management, of course.</P>
    <P>It is now time for us to take stock before launching into new developments to ensure that any facilities provided will be availed of to the maximum extent.  All who have been consulted recognise the vital importance of this and in future, we will, I hope, see a rational, co-ordinated development which will ensure that our people can indulge their great capacity for playing and, in the course of their playing, find a better understanding of one another.</P>
    <P>Hand in hand with the development <Col N="379" /> of recreational centres goes the development of youth centres or community centres.  These will be co-ordinated centres catering for both youth and age.  Because of commercial exploitation there has been a somewhat unfortunate evolution in our society in which teenagers were literally forced to think that they were the only group with special problems and were, in fact, a group apart in the community.  The characteristics of teenager problems are also characteristics of pensioners' problems, as they are of those in middle age or any other age.  The youth council and the various youth organisations are fully aware of this and they now see their contribution not just that of providing opportunities for keeping the young off the streets but also one in which they are involved in the betterment of conditions generally for themselves and, in particular, for the aged and the disabled.  They do not want to be isolated from the rest of society.  They certainly do not want to be deprived of the opportunity of bettering conditions for those who cannot effectively help themselves.  From now on I hope we will stop talking about &ldquo;keeping the youth off the streets&rdquo;, as if that were an end of the problem; from now on I hope youth will be fully committed in helping themselves and others.</P>
    <P>I was gratified to note that in the various seminars promoted by the National Youth Council and its constituent organisations the issues discussed were issues which affect the whole of our society.  I would instance the seminar which was held recently at Dún Laoghaire on the environment and the manner in which youth organisations can help to preserve the national environment.  This is one of numerous examples I could give to illustrate the concern that is felt by the young people.  It is important that the public would think in terms of the youth organisations not as young people who want to get their cut for themselves to the exclusion of others but as young people who are impatient to give their energies and dedication in the service of others.  I should like to tell the House of the good work that <Col N="380" /> is done by the youth organisations but it would involve too lengthy a catalogue of what has been done by them in helping old people and in other areas and I will not detain the House.  However, for the information of those who wish to know, the National Youth Council and its organisation has been working on a professional basis.  I was glad that I could give them an increased allocation this year and I hope that I can increase it next year so that they can have the benefit of the best professional advice available and of full-time services for themselves and their constituent organisations.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I am thinking of full-time youth officers, particularly in city areas.  Because our cities are more densely populated there are greater social problems for the young and for every age group.  There may not be the same constant communication one finds in rural Ireland, the personal human concern that is evident in areas where people know each other.  This is not to say that there is lack of such concern in the character of the city dweller but some people live alone and are isolated.  I have been pleased by many developments that have introduced these deprived young people to the healthy air of the country.  I know that many organisations such as Óige Chorcaí and organisations in Dublin, because of the assistance I have been able to give them, have been able to employ full-time youth officers to reach the deprived children and others and I hope that even within these limited resources we can expand that programme.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note the number of people of different backgrounds and traditions who are prepared to spend so much of their time in giving their services. In this House and elsewhere we criticise each other to a considerable extent but we should stop and consider the great work that is being done, not in words but in deeds.  Unfortunately, deeds are silent so far as the immediate reaction is concerned but in the long-term they are more eloquent than words.  There is much worthwhile work being undertaken throughout the country.  I should like to assure those who are engaged in this work that we <Col N="381" /> shall do everything possible to ensure that their potential and effort are utilised to the fullest extent and put to the benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Department were able to involve themselves in the provision of facilities for some disabled people.  Our concern is that every person of every capacity, whether full or limited, will develop and enjoy that capacity to the utmost.  Last year for the first time the Department made grants available to certain organisations representing sports associations of disabled people.  We are not stressing this as a great achievement on our part but it is an indication of the awareness we share of the fact that sport and recreation are not just for the very young and healthy&mdash;they are meant for all.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few comments on the programme of &ldquo;sport for all, fitness for all&rdquo;.  For too long we have thought that sport and recreation are only for the young but have no relevance for the rest of the community. Member States of the Council of Europe have been promoting a &ldquo;sport for all&rdquo; programme and national sports councils have been keeping in touch with this development in Europe and elsewhere.  I am glad to say they have decided to launch a COSAC &ldquo;fitness for all&rdquo; week in July, 1972, in conjunction with an exhibition and conference which will be held in Dublin, at which prominent people from this country and abroad will attend.</P>
    <P>It is not the purpose to promote more organised games because the various sports organisations involved are capable of doing that themselves. Its objective is to create an awareness in the community, at every age group and at every level, of the need for fitness, not only from the physical fitness point of view but from the point of view of mental and psychological health.  It will encourage each family to do a little more, to take recreation together, and to set guidelines that will make their recreation more enjoyable. I do not want to anticipate what will be announced later but I am confident that it will be an effective way of reaching the community and of persuading <Col N="382" /> them of the real benefits not only for themselves but for society in general which can be derived from meaningful recreational activities.</P>
    <P>Man is not only an animal with reason, he has the capacity for exercise also.  One aspect of his personality will not develop fully if the other aspect is not cared for equally.  I hope this programme, to which I have referred, will create that awareness.  In Ireland there is a tendency that when we pass the stage of being active participants we become active spectators and active talkers.  This is enjoyable and important because without the spectators it would not be possible to have the participants in many games and without the talk there would not be the enjoyment which is traditional in our case.  However, it is important to recognise it is one aspect of enjoyment.</P>
    <P>The other aspect is that when the great hurler, or footballer, or rugby internationalist, has reached the end of his days of glory, it is not very healthy for him to say: &ldquo;It is all over for me now.&rdquo;  I am very anxious that people who are prominent in the sporting area should realise that they must continue to maintain a programme of exercise and to give a good example to the rest of the community. I do not think there is anything else I want to say on that area of the general programme which I have the opportunity to implement in some little way on behalf of the Government, that is, the area of recreation and youth work.</P>
    <P>We have had very useful assistance from the various other Departments and particularly from the Department of Local Government.  We are endeavouring to ensure that there will be no over-lapping and no lack of coordination. I am quite confident that this co-operation and consultation will continue.  I have recently been engaged in discussions with certain educational institutions&mdash;I cannot put it any further than that at this time&mdash; with regard to providing diploma courses for youth welfare officers, apart altogether from other discussions I have had about week-end courses or shortterm <Col N="383" /> courses for youth leaders.  I look forward to development in this area in the future and, as soon as there are such development&mdash;and I think they are inevitable and desirable&mdash;I will be very glad to inform the House of them.</P>
    <P>School transport has been mentioned in this House.  Sometimes one could be forgiven for thinking, from the comments made here and elsewhere, that it is the responsibility of this State, or of any State, not only to provide education at every level but also to ensure that the child gets to school. This is and must always be the basic responsibility of the parents.  I will qualify that by saying that, where circumstances of distance or of age are such as would prevent the child from attending school regularly, the State must and does ensure that those handicaps are removed.  We know from surveys we have done that that is the attitude of the Department of Education and Science in Great Britain and of departments in Canada and other countries.</P>
    <P>There is no free school transport right as such in Great Britain but, where circumstances arise in which a child could not attend school, the local authority concerned, through the Department of Education and Science, provide free transport facilities.  Sometimes the State can be asked to do things that are not its immediate responsibility. It can do its best to relieve cases of genuine hardship but it cannot take over the responsibility of the parents to get their child to school except in the type of case I have mentioned.  That is what is being demanded to an increasing extent.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the regulations are that children under the age of ten years who live two or more miles from the school can qualify for free transport to the nearest suitable school if there are ten or more children in one school area.  Children between the ages of ten and 14 years can qualify for free transport in similar conditions if they live three miles or more from the nearest suitable school.  This applies at primary and post-primary level.  I recognise the frustration of many people when they see empty or half <Col N="384" /> empty buses, as they see it, passing school children on the road.  In introducing those regulations we have provided a service which is very definitely on a par with, and in many ways in advance of, the services available in Britain, Canada and many other countries we have surveyed.  The services are provided within the resources available to us.</P>
    <P>Before we start to talk about any changes, I should like to remind the House of the cost of this service since it was introduced in 1967.  In 1967-68 total expenditure was £1,286,644, catering for 61,000 pupils.  In 1971-72, the figure had risen to £3,770,200 catering for 121,500 pupils.  While the total expenditure in the past five years was of the order of £12½ million, even at today's prices, having regard to the increasing school population and the normal extension of the service, over the next five years, even if we maintain the same regulations and the same conditions, that figure will jump to £25½ million.  That is the first thing that must be borne in mind by those who would say that we must change the regulations, we must shorten the distance, or whatever it is that is suggested.</P>
    <P>People seem to forget that you can only extend the service either by reducing the distance limit, or by reducing the minimum number of pupils necessary to warrant the establishment of a transport service.  In the operation of the school bus service, CIE charge the Department the direct operational cost plus the indirect and administrative costs.  On this basis an overall fare per pupil is computed.  At present that overall fare is 74p per week for primary pupils and 68p per week for post-primary pupils.  It is self-evident that any variation in this scheme which would increase the number of pupils would have a direct and a very significant bearing on costs.</P>
    <P>The Department have been very conscious of the need to carry out a survey not only at home but also abroad.  A survey which was carried out indicated that to limit the overall distance regulation to two miles for all pupils would have involved £750,000 at that time.  The figure would now be nearer to £1 million, for <Col N="385" /> the same purpose, allowing for price increases since then and would, in fact, be £30 million over the next five years instead of the £25 million to which I have already referred.  So, in the whole programme of education, one must look at all the areas and, within the limit of resources available, say whether one can reasonably ask, as often is asked for in this House, the extensions that seem desirable.</P>
    <P>I want particularly to state that we have always looked at hardship cases, as I hope any Deputy would recognise, with special sympathy.  It is for that reason that we have provided that where children, on certification from a doctor, are unfit or are unable to get to school, even within the distance prescribed in the regulations, we would pick them up by the school transport service as if they were fully qualified under the age and distance regulations. As Deputies know, that facility is being availed of by many children. There is no point then in suggesting that we are, in fact, imposing hardship on children, particularly children who are unable to get to school, as they say, under their own steam.  Nobody is imposing hardship.  Far from it.  Everybody is endeavouring to ensure that hardship will be alleviated and that all children will be enabled to have the same facilities and get to school in the same conditions as far as possible.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes suggested that where there is room on a bus children could be picked up even though they may be within the distance of one to two miles and should travel free on the bus. There are many objections to this. Where there is room on a bus, as every Deputy knows but sometimes forgets to state, we are and have been ready to pick up any children until such time as the bus is full on the basis of fare paying, not simply for the sake of what that contributes to the budget, although it does contribute something, but to ensure that there will be some balance in standard applying throughout the country.  Were we to endeavour to operate a system that you would run the bus on the basis of free transport until such time as the bus was absolutely full, and that was the end of it, it becomes immediately obvious that an injustice operates, which has <Col N="386" /> been recognised in every other country also; that the last child who happened to be lucky enough to get on before the bus was full was all right and the next child along the road just had to take what was coming to him or her, because the bus happened to be full.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see immediately that because of various problems of population throughout the country some children will be getting free transport on a school bus, let us say, in County Kildare, perhaps, one and a half miles from school.  Deputy Power can very fairly make the comment that he has because County Kildare is one of the areas where, due to the good standard of the roads, the regulations are being applied according to a rather strict standard by comparison with some other areas in the west of Ireland.  I just happened to mention County Kildare. Children in a particular county will be getting free transport, shall we say, from one and a half or one mile simply because the bus was not full up to that point, while children in another county or in another part of the country, perhaps, in an adjoining parish or some other catchment area, would not have the facility because the bus became full immediately after two miles.  Is anybody going to suggest to me that that is the kind of transport system we are to operate?  We must recognise that the regulations which sometimes seem to irk and to irritate so many are there, first of all, in the interests of serving the children and particularly also as being reasonable and fair within the resources available to us.</P>
    <P>I recognise, for instance, even within the limited concern I have directly in the Department of Education, that there are other areas in the educational area and every other area that could do with whatever resources we have and there are great demands from such areas.  I feel quite satisfied that, in fact, on that basis, the school transport system as at present operated, far from not meeting the needs, is in fact more than adequately meeting the needs by comparison with the needs that exist in other areas that we still need to tackle.  We will continue as much as possible to take account of hardship and special cases.  It is for <Col N="387" /> that reason that some time back I sent a circular to all Deputies informing them of the general conditions of the transport system in the hope that there would not any longer be confusion as to how it operates.</P>
    <P>In the course of this discussion considerable reference was made to the general direction of the education programme. Simply by virtue of the fact that some people do not want to see references such as the one I referred to this morning in the curriculum for primary education and do not want to note the attitude contained in these programmes, sometimes it is said that the programme in education is developing in a haphazard fashion.  That is a very unfair and unjustified comment both on the officers of the Department of Education and indeed on the Minister and on the Government because it is very evident that, allowing for the history, the structure and the development of education, there is, indeed, a very clear policy and a very discernible philosophy.</P>
    <P>There are some people shouting about the need for a white paper.  I do not know if they understand what the function and the purpose of a white paper is.  I have before me the white paper on educational reconstruction presented by the Board of Education to Parliament in England in July, 1943.  This white paper deals only with headings of certain developments in certain areas, just as basic headings. In fact, it is a very small document of 33 pages and, as a white paper, it was intended to be a preliminary to special legislation in a special area.</P>
    <P>The major assessment of <i>Investment in Education</i>, what is contained in volumes 1 and 2 of <i>Curaclam na mBunscol</i> and the reports of the Higher Education Authority and the consultations that take place on them, in themselves cover a much wider field than any white paper as such from any other country.  Possibly it is being recognised now that a white paper is simply, in a special area, a statement of your programme and intentions.</P>
    <P>If anyone can tell me that he does not know what the direction of the primary school programme is, then I say that he has not for one reason or <Col N="388" /> another chosen to concern himself.  It is for that reason that when Deputy Desmond was talking this morning he talked for so long about issues that were well done and past, attitudes that were well done and past, about, particularly, the community school programme. I got the clear impression that the man is suffering from frustration, disappointment and almost a sense of pique that the inevitable differences that he seemed to point to have been healed by virtue of consultation and patience on the part of all concerned. He did then, as I say, make some reference to the primary school sector.  He said, God help us, we all ignore it, because he and other Deputies did not choose to take the trouble to look at it.  They found it much more convenient to talk about some incidental issue on a particular part of the programme or a particular section of post-primary schools, that of community schools, and to noise it abroad.  It is the old story of he that has ears to hear let him hear and those that want to open their eyes let them see.</P>
    <P>Let me state briefly for those who think we should publish a white paper that education begins in the home.  This has been recognised by philosophers and teachers as far apart as Gandhi and the late President Kennedy.  It begins in the home and nothing that happens afterwards will alter the effect of the general environment of the home.  The State steps in in this country at an earlier age than in most countries to provide a basic primary education which is built on the foundation which has been provided in the home and the values that have been developed in the home.  The State here steps in at the age of four. It is evident to anyone who has taken even the most cursory glance at any of these documents or the thinking behind them or the programme leading up to them for some considerable time that they are child centred.  They are particularly directed to introducing the child to his environment, to the world in which he lives, towards creating an awareness in him of the world and the creatures in that world and generally developing his capacity to be a fully integrated human personality at a later <Col N="389" /> stage and a vital and active member of society.  That is there for all who want to see it and for those who do not want to see it is not there and nothing I can say will change it.  Anyone who pays even a casual visit to any primary school at this time will see&mdash;sometimes I think that when people are talking about schools as Deputy Desmond was they are talking about what they remember themselves as if that were a criticism of what is happening at present&mdash;that the exciting activity going on in every classroom in every primary school is clear evidence of the way the children and the teachers are whole-heartedly reacting to this programme of awakening the child to his environment. Just in case it is asking too much of people to go into detail on this, at page 12 of Part I of the Teachers Handbook, <i>Cúrsa na Bun Scoile</i>, there is the following precise summary:</P>
    <P>The aims of primary education may, therefore, briefly be stated as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  to enable the child to live a full life as a child with all that that involves, and,</P>
    <P>(2)  to equip him to avail himself of further education so that he may go on to live a full and useful life as an adult in society.</P>
    <P>Then it mentions the factors that must be taken into account.  That priority is fairly evident in our programme of primary education.</P>
    <P>One turns then to the post-primary sector.  Here it is evident, as has been stated so often by successive Ministers for Education, that the fundamental priority, though you are still concerned always in education with developing the personality&mdash;I do not want any omission of words of mine to convey any other notion when I start to emphasise this aspect of it&mdash;the fundamental priority is equality of choice, equality of opportunity for every pupil in the post-primary sector.  This means equality of choice within the range of subjects at pass or honours level available whether he lives in a remote part of the west of Ireland, in the centre of Dublin or in Dún Laoghaire or Rathdown. Every child is entitled to the same equality of choice.  For that reason <Col N="390" /> one has to look at the provision of school facilities within certain educational units.  If one saw that within certain dimensions you are not capable of providing that range of subjects so as to give each child a maximum opportunity of developing his talents, then you launch on a programme a logical consequence of which is community schools.  It was a logical consequence. It was not, as is sometimes suggested for the sake of progress, for the sake of the Department and Minister imposing their will on all concerned who, according to Deputy Desmond, were at loggerheads with each other at any event.  It was not for the sake of imposing new strictures on people who would prefer to be free in their own areas or for getting rid of the vocational sector.  It was for the sake of combining all within one stream and particularly ensuring that the imbalance which has been so much a part of our educational programme, the imbalance towards what is rather loosely called the academic side of education, might be corrected.  This programme of community schools represents a breakthrough in that direction.  That imbalance is in direct opposition to the imbalance that exists in Europe.  While 70 per cent of our pupils got academic type education up to recently and 30 per cent got what might be called technical or technological education, in Europe the figures were the other way &mdash;70 per cent technical and technological and 30 per cent academic.  This programme of post-primary rationalisation which will allow every pupil to get the best facilities available from any aspect of this programme is at the root of the community schools policy.</P>
    <P>Those who would ask: &ldquo;Why are you closing the small schools and building bigger institutions?&rdquo; should ask themselves whether they are ready to keep a child in a smaller unit and thereby possibly deprive him of the opportunity to have as wide a range of subjects, so as to develop his capacity at pass or honours level, as his counterpart in a bigger educational unit.</P>
    <P>I shall turn now to the third level sector, university level or higher institutional level.  Here a child who has developed his capacity through guidance <Col N="391" /> in a post-primary sector is coming to a stage where he will graduate or qualify in a particular sector having regard especially to the needs of the community and the needs of society. Our universities, in structuring their courses, must take account of the economic and social needs and climate of society.</P>

The figure for January, 1972, is provisional at this stage and is subject to amendment.  An export price (unit value) index is not yet available for January, 1972, and it is not possible, therefore, at this stage to compile the January, 1972, figure at constant prices.  Details of the January, 1972, exports are not yet available but preliminary indications are that the decrease was mainly due to a fall in exports of meat.</P>

It would have a bad effect on our own line of action to begin thinking of following other lines at the same time.

Reducing the incidence of bail is not necessarily the only way to do something to solve the problems that have arisen from the wider granting of bail in recent years and it was legislation in this broader context that I spoke of.

While my Department did prepare a Bill which, in my view, would have dealt adequately with the matter, I was advised that, in the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court, it was likely to be found unconstitutional.  As a result, as I indicated recently, I have had to approach the matter in a different way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question primarily relates to the provision of adult school wardens. Under section 96 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, the provision of school wardens is a matter for the local authority concerned, subject to the consent of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, following a pilot experiment carried out in Carlow, several local authorities have appointed, with the agreement of school authorities and the consent both of the Garda authorities and the parents involved, teams of junior school wardens who are senior pupils of primary schools to operate outside their own schools.  A gradual expansion of this scheme is taking <Col N="417" /> place, but before a junior warden scheme is introduced, all the circumstances must be carefully examined and the full agreement of all parties involved secured.  Any assistance I can give in promoting this work will be given gladly.</P>

      <P>Every type of dwelling which is accepted by me under the guaranteed order project must comply with the standards set out in an outline performance specification.  This lays down minimum standards of accommodation and provides that pending the issue of the new Irish building regulations the house types (unless specifically approved by my Department) must comply with the general or &ldquo;deemed to satisfy&rdquo; clauses of relevant parts of the Building Regulations, <Col N="418" /> 1965, which apply to England and Wales.</P>
      <P>The actual degree of fire hazard as respects any house type would depend on many factors, including the form of construction, the layout and density of dwellings, location of site, adequacy and availability of water supply.  In general, lighter forms of non-traditional construction require a greater degree than average of fire precautions.  In the case of dwellings of timber construction, for instance, there are additional requirements which include compliance with a special memorandum (H.A.10) issued by my Department in relation to timber housing.  In a number of cases where unusual types of houses have been offered, prototypes are being built which will be the subject of consultations with all the interests involved, including fire advisory personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning of the national housing programme is proceeding in accordance with the proposals and projections of need set out in the white paper&mdash;Housing in the Seventies&mdash;which indicated that about 15,000 to 17,000 new houses would be needed each year by the mid-1970s. In 1970-71 a total of 13,671 new houses were completed and I expect that about 15,000 will be completed in the current financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic objective of the Government's housing policy is to ensure that, as far as the resources of the economy permit, every family can obtain for their own occupation a house of good standard at a price or rent they can afford.  To this end, the Government have steadily increased the allocations to housing in the public capital programme from £9 million in 1960-61 to about £38 million in the current financial year.  This growth in expenditure, supplemented by increasing <Col N="419" /> contributions from building societies and assurance companies, has enabled output to rise, virtually without interruption, over the past decade so that completions this year will be about 2½ times, and should soon be three times, the level achieved in the early 1960s.</P>
    <P>Amongst the steps taken by the Government to achieve the best possible use of the resources that can be devoted to housing each year are the guaranteed order project, which I launched in the autumn of 1970, the recasting of the private housing grants scheme that year, the steps taken to secure better organisation of demand in the private sector, the advance land acquisition programmes adopted by local authorities, and the measures to promote greater efficiency and capacity in the building industry.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his Question No. 287 of 28th October last on the subject.  I expect to receive in the near future the report of An Foras Forbartha, which was referred to in that reply.  Work has been started on a scheme of prototype system built dwellings in Bray which were specially designed by the National Building Agency for smaller families.  These prototypes will be available in about a month for inspection by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation have welcomed my proposal to make a special capital allocation for a project to provide housing for the smaller families on their waiting list and have promised their active co-operation.  They have agreed in principle to the inclusion of precincts of smaller dwellings as <Col N="422" /> part of all future major housing developments and have already submitted proposals for the Balcurris area which include 40 two-roomed houses. Proposals have been submitted also by the corporation for eight two-roomed flats at Cappagh Road and tenders will be invited shortly for these flats: 120 two-roomed flats are being built for the corporation by the National Building Agency in their Tallaght east scheme.  Normally each block of corporation flats includes a proportion of dwellings suitable for smaller families&mdash;for example, 935 of the 3,265 dwellings provided in Ballymun are one-or two-roomed dwellings.  The corporation have already provided 338 temporary dwellings which are mainly occupied by single persons or elderly couples.</P>
    <P>The corporation have pointed out that the availability of suitable serviced sites is a major difficulty in developing a special project for housing smaller families.  They have agreed, however, to carry out a special survey of sites in and around the city which might be suitable for this type of housing.  Their normal operations of the housing programme for smaller and medium type families&mdash;such as draws for newlyweds, and private site and co-operative housing&mdash;will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong of the Deputy to insinuate that.  I have explained this in the House and on many occasions outside.  Local authorities and the community in general benefit substantially because of a considerable saving of capital expenditure. This is possible because of the greater degree of efficiency which can be achieved by using this method.  It has been competitive in so far as advertisements were placed in the <Col N="432" /> public media inviting interested people to submit design and construction proposals with their price.  These were examined and those which complied with the specifications and were found to be generally satisfactory were put on a list.  This list was circulated to the local authorities and they can make their selection from it.  If they decide not to do that, they can use the normal procedure of inviting tenders by way of public advertisement.</P>

I was referring in particular to timber-frame houses. It is not necessary that persons making proposals under this scheme should first of all build a prototype house before qualifying.  If I were to do that the scheme would never get off the ground.  In fact, some of the houses built under this scheme are occupied, or are about to be occupied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, because our average family size is larger than in any other European countries, we need fewer dwellings per 1,000 inhabitants.  The dwellings that we build are, however, among the biggest in Europe and, as I indicated in my <Col N="435" /> reply to the debate on the Estimate for my Department on the 27th October, the number of rooms which we had in 1966 for each 1,000 persons averaged 1,118 compared with figures ranging between 435 and 699 for eastern European countries.</P>
    <P>International comparisons in housing are futile unless they are set against the background of the economic, social and demographic circumstances peculiar to each country.  In so far as we are concerned, relevant factors, apart from the average family size, are that about one-third of our population is married compared with up to half in other countries; that our annual marriage rate while increasing, is still low internationally; that our rate of population increase is slow; and that our dependency ratio is high.  Apart from these factors, we have not had the high rate of non-family household formation or the high level of activity in the building of holiday homes experienced in other countries.</P>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 31 today.</P>

      <P>The financial aids available for the purchase or building of new houses include in addition to long-term loans, State and supplementary grants, remission of rates and exemption from stamp duty.  Generally, these non-repayable aids have a total value, in cases where the special rate of grant provided for in section 16 of the Housing Act, 1966 applies, of about £1,400 and in other cases of about £1,250.  Persons who are not able to provide houses for themselves even with these aids are eligible for local authority housing for which the rents payable are related to income and family circumstances.  I do not consider that the giving of private housing grants equal to the full cost of a house could be justified on financial or other grounds.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to an increase in the rate of reconstruction grants I would refer the Deputy to my replies to Question No. 120 of 16th December, 1971, and Question No. 57 of 18th November, 1971.</P>
      <P>The present level of reconstruction grants become operative in respect of reconstruction commenced on or after 30th June, 1958.  It is estimated that the cost of building materials and labour have increased by about 90 per cent since 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of new house grants was fully considered in conjunction with the Housing Act, 1970, which became law on 5th August, 1970.  I do <Col N="437" /> not propose a further review of these grants at this stage.</P>
    <P>I issued statements on 21st January, 1972, and 4th February, 1972, that the Government had agreed to increase the maximum grant for group water supply schemes from £60 per house to £100 per house.  No further review of the water and sewerage grants is contemplated at present.</P>

If that is so, is it not about time that the new house grants and reconstruction grants were reviewed?  In the case of new house grants the figure is still £325.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, as a result of his failure to raise the reconstruction grant level in line with the increased cost of building, the <Col N="438" /> number of houses being reconstructed per year has been halved over the past decade?  They were reconstructing about 13,000 houses per annum at the beginning of this decade, and they are now down to about 7,000 houses per annum.  This is a direct result of the Minister's failure to adjust the grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to imply that because the number has dropped in recent years that is related to the size of the grant.  It could also be caused by the fact that such a large number of houses which had been in need of reconstruction have, in fact, already been improved by way of these grants.  The percentage of houses in need of reconstruction in this country is probably the lowest in Europe and certainly the lowest in these islands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The qualifying income limit for local authority house-purchase loans was increased last year from £1,200 to £1,500 a year for houses commenced on or after 1st March, 1971. Local authorities are free to advance house purchase loans without reference to the income limit to tenants of local authority houses who surrender their tenancies on getting such loans or to borrowers in areas where commercial agencies do not normally operate provided the loans are financed from sources other than the Local Loans Fund.</P>
      <P>Since the limit was increased to its present level of £1,500 a year, the value of unpaid applications held by local authorities has increased from £11.8 million at 31st March, 1971, to £15.5 million at 31st December, 1971.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the scheme is achieving its primary objective of helping people of modest means to buy their own houses but I am nonetheless keeping the income limit under constant review in the light of trends in incomes generally and other relevant factors.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that the operation of the Housing Authorities (Loan Charges Contributions and Management) Regulations, 1967 is proving to be a great disadvantage and hardship to prospective purchasers of local authority <Col N="443" /> houses; whether he has received any representations regarding this matter; if so, if he will state their nature; and if he will have these regulations amended forthwith to afford tenants a more equitable opportunity of purchasing their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received some representations regarding the prices of houses stipulated by approved purchase schemes since the Housing Authorities (Loan Charges Contributions and Management) Regulations, 1967, came into operation.</P>
      <P>A local authority which decides to make a scheme for the sale of their houses are under a statutory obligation to base the sale prices on the market or replacement value of the houses. The cost to the tenant is, however, reduced by a discount of 3 per cent for each year after five during which he has continuously been a tenant of any local authority house, up to a maximum of 45 per cent for houses which are not in a built-up area.  The discount is 2 per cent and 30 per cent respectively in a built-up area.</P>
      <P>The usual practice is for local authorities to obtain expert professional advice as to the market or replacement value of the houses included in the purchase schemes and to offer them to tenants at these prices, subject to the appropriate discounts.  The experience has been that sale prices generally have been very favourable to tenants, many of whom have made substantial profits by selling their houses shortly after purchasing them. This applies even where the tenant is not entitled to discount.</P>
      <P>No tenant is obliged to buy his house from the local authority.  He can, if he wishes, continue to enjoy the benefit of the substantial subsidies paid by the State and from the rates to keep rents down.  However, well over 10,000 tenants have already purchased their houses or are in the process of doing so on terms approved under the 1967 regulations.  This is a clear indication of the degree to which these terms have already been accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the existing purchase terms are equitable as between the <Col N="444" /> local authorities and their tenants.  I do not accept that tenants who wish to purchase are being asked to pay an unfair price for their houses and I do not propose to amend the regulations as suggested.</P>
    <P>The first priority of a housing authority is not to provide houses for those who can afford to buy them; it is to provide houses for letting to people without decent accommodation who cannot afford to buy.  By selling houses local authorities lessen their ability to do this since the more houses they sell the less they will have available for letting to persons in need.  I have, however, in the interests of the tenants with a genuine desire to purchase, encouraged sale schemes on the basis of market or replacement value less the appropriate discounts.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this scheme, which was introduced by one of his predecessors, Deputy Blaney, is a penal scheme which is having a very bad effect on tenants who like to own their own house?  Since it has been agreed that farmers are entitled to security of tenure and to purchase their farms, would the Minister not agree that there is no reason why a tenant of a local authority house should be asked, in 1972, to pay £2,500 to £3,000 for a house which cost £70 to build 80 years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not agree that the terms proposed for the purchase of houses are penal.  Where purchase schemes have been drawn up and houses have been offered to tenants, the prices have been very reasonable. This is borne out by the fact that many of the houses have been sold subsequently, at a profit of £1,000. I, as Minister in charge of Exchequer funds that are made available for housing in general, must keep in mind the interests of each section of the community when drawing up regulations of this kind and in carrying out regulations and schemes under Acts that have already been passed by the House.  Wherever purchase schemes have been introduced, there has been a bit of reaction.  If people feel that by pressure or agitation they will reduce <Col N="445" /> the price of the house, then they will certainly continue the agitation. It is very wrong for public representatives to encourage the idea that there is a possibility of these prices being reduced during the period when a scheme is available to the tenants.  I have no power in law to reduce the purchase price while the scheme is in operation.  It is very wrong to give the impression that a bit of agitation and a bit of a row can knock a few pounds off the price of the house and save the tenant money.  This is just not on.  Very wrong advice has been given to tenants in relation to this matter by some Deputies of whom I would have thought more; I thought that they would not lower themselves by these tactics, giving the tenants a completely wrong impression.</P>

While I agree that there will not be a change as long as the present Government are in office, there might be a change quite soon.</P>

      <P>With the permission of <Col N="446" /> the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper report. The mortgage arrangement to which the report refers is a commercial one between the society and the builders concerned and I have no information as to the effects it may have on the prices of houses.  As regards loans by building societies for purposes other than housing, I am aware that in the five years up to 1970, the proportion of total building society advances devoted to purposes other than housing was about 6½ per cent.  In the circumstances, I do not consider that an inquiry into this aspect of building society operations would be justified.</P>
      <P>The mortgage arrangements referred to in the questions do not appear to conflict with the Building Societies Acts nor do these Acts prohibit a society from making loans for non-housing purposes, provided the loans are secured by freehold or leasehold estate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> The resources of the Road Fund for the current year have already been allocated in full to road authorities and it is not possible, therefore, to allocate any additional grants from the fund. The latest information indicates that funds are available to Cork County Council out of the grant and rate provisions for expenditure on road works and local improvement schemes in the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering that the Minister cut £68,000 from the Cork county road grant last year, would he now consider giving some of it back, having particular regard to the serious unemployment in the county?  I am sure that by now he has got a request from the Cork County Council for such additional money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was £86,000. Deputy O'Sullivan reversed the figure. I wonder where the £20 million is going which was announced in October. We were expecting, when the Minister for Finance made that announcement, that all redundant road workers would be re-employed.  Is the Minister aware that the position in County Cork, particularly in Clonakilty, is extremely serious and that the county council voted £5,000 from local revenue, which is in very short supply, so that employment could be continued to the end of the financial year?  Would he consider, having regard to all the circumstances, giving a supplementary grant to enable the county council to continue their productive schemes and to give employment?</P>

      <P>The Deputies will understand that Road Fund moneys available to me have been fully allocated and that there is no question of my being able to increase those grants once the Road Fund allocation has been allocated in full.  There is no question of allocating any of the £20 million for additional capital works to the Road Fund.  It was never stated that it would be.  I have already, in reply to Deputy Desmond, given a full statement on the allocations given to my Department and where the money was spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>It is not.  There was a difference of £20,000 in the allocation to Cork as between 1970-71 and 1971-72. In 1970-71, County Cork was allocated £977,021 and in 1971-72 the allocation was £957,060.

    <P>The period prescribed by law for the holding of estimates meetings of county councils is from 9th February to 31st March and, in the case of county boroughs it comprises the months of March and April.  Pending <Col N="464" /> consideration and adoption of the estimates of expenditure at such meetings, the actual rate in the £ for any rating area will not be known.  The Government's proposals in relation to local finance and taxation will be set out in a forthcoming white paper on the subject. Consideration of the proposed white paper is at an advanced stage and every effort will be made to have it published at an early date.  I cannot yet say, however, when exactly the white paper will be published.  In the meantime the Government are ensuring that ratepayers generally are protected from the full impact of increases in local expenditure, mainly by means of State grants which this year alone total £90 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation proposed studies in the area of staff structure and procedures.  Consultants were employed to assist in these studies and have now reported.  A statement of their terms of reference will, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, be included in the Official Report.  In so far as the report, which, as I have said, relates primarily to staffing and procedures, has implications for local government re-organisation, these will <Col N="466" /> be taken into account in conjunction with all the other views on the white paper which have been conveyed to me by interested parties.</P>
      <P>Following are the terms of reference:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Terms of Reference (in the form of a proposal from McKinsey and Company, Incorporated to the Minister for Local Government)</i>
      </P>
      <P>1.  This memorandum outlines proposals for a study of the staff structure of local authorities.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Background of the Study</i>
      </P>
      <P>2.  As background to the study the following would be taken into account&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation,</P>
      <P>(b)  the Computer Report already published,</P>
      <P>(c)  the Clerkin Report,</P>
      <P>(d)  the decision of the Department to introduce PPBS at local level and to reorganise the local authorities system of accounts, statistics and information flow generally.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Programme</i>
      </P>
      <P>3.  During the study we would propose to examine in detail the staff structure of the local authorities in the light of the &ldquo;major issues&rdquo; set out below.  We would&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Put into perspective the problems indicated in paragraph 4 below,</P>
      <P>(b)  Develop a comprehensive programme for tackling these problems,</P>
      <P>(c)  Dispose of the more straightforward problems and permit progress on immediate implementation in these areas,</P>
      <P>(d)  Develop and present to the Department our outline concepts of future organisation proposals including an outline staff structure. If further study is necessary, these concepts would be tested and developed in detail in ensuing stages of that study.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Major Issues to be Studied</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4. (a)  We must first understand thoroughly the aims of the Department, <Col N="467" /> both as to its responsibility for the effectiveness of the local government system and also in terms of its specific objectives for each of the programmes or services for which it is responsible.  The Department's perception of its role and objectives will dictate to a large extent the kind of local organisation pattern that must be designed to help it carry out these objectives and the inter-relationship between Department and local authorities.  We will also examine the extent to which the Department's aims are achieved.</P>
    <P>(b)  Does the present staff structure of local authorities meet the needs of modern day tasks?  The tasks of local authorities and of the whole local government service in Ireland have changed considerably over the past few decades.  In particular, the emphasis in recent years on the responsibilities of local authorities for economic development in their areas raises questions about the appropriateness of the traditional patterns of staff organisation of local authorities.</P>
    <P>(c)  Does the present structure of manager/secretary/accountant/staff officer reflect the management responsibilities of local authorities for the wide range of their services in so far as county councils are concerned? In relation to urbans, what staff problems arise?</P>
    <P>(d)  What is the most appropriate way to fit the engineering responsibilities into the management structure of local authorities?</P>
    <P>(e)  What will be the impact on present organisations and procedures of the installation of the computer and of the changes proposed in the White Paper?</P>
    <P>(f)  What changes are needed in the financial accounting methods and in the management information passed from authorities to the Department?</P>
    <P>(g)  Does the standardised salary structure unduly inhibit mobility between authorities to the detriment of the service?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> (h)  How do present personnel policies affect the ability of the local government service to recruit capable people?  What changes are required to improve the recruiting position?</P>
    <P>(i)  How can the Department assist local authorities in developing and co-ordinating training programmes and providing facilities for training of local government officers?</P>
    <P>(j)  In the light of the above examinations, what outline staff structure is best for the county councils and the larger urbans?  What problems are involved in applying this to the county boroughs?</P>
    <P>5.  We envisage that the Department would establish an appropriate steering group constituted within the Department, with whom we would hold regular formal progress review meetings.  We would hold more frequent meetings with the officers mainly responsible for the management processes and structure of the service.  We would of course work very closely with key members of the Department and would rely heavily on them for our fact gathering. It is important to bear in mind that this involvement of staff will be time consuming but essential.</P>
    <P>6.  We would carry out a programme of interviewing and analysis throughout the country on a basis agreed with the steering group.  Subject to their agreement, we would envisage visiting a reasonable cross section of the counties (analysing in depth the organisation, tasks and methods of working of perhaps two representative counties) and also visiting an agreed selection of urban authorities for purposes of comparison and in order to understand the role that the urbans play in the present structure.  Finally, we would carry out an interviewing programme within the Department itself so that we would have a thorough understanding of the Department's objectives and its methods of working. In particular, we would want to follow through some specified cases in which departmental programmes have been implmented through local authorities.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say which comes first&mdash;the chicken or the egg?  Which is the more important&mdash; to have the local elections in June this year or to have the White Paper enacted before the local elections?  I should like the Minister to give me an honest answer because it is very unfair that members of his party are saying that the local elections will take place while the Minister has been fencing in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that I will have to make a decision one way or the other very soon but I am sincere in my desire to have such changes carried out and to go ahead with the local elections in this coming year.  However, it would be foolish to hold a local election for a local authority which I am proposing to abolish.  It would not be in the best interests of local democracy to hold an election in that atmosphere. I think the House will agree that it would be as well to settle these issues before holding another local election. There is also the question of a referendum being held this year.  While the date of that referendum is not yet <Col N="471" /> known it could so happen that it might be held on a date very close to the time when the local elections should be held and it might not be proper to proceed so soon after the referendum with elections that would again involve all of the electorate.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement which was issued on behalf of the Government on 19th May, 1969, when the Buchanan Report was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> The statement indicated that the recommendations in the report relating to growth centres had wide implications and that they would have to be considered further in the context of proposals for regional development generally.  My Department, with the aid of an inter-departmental committee, have undertaken a review of regional planning taking account of the Buchanan Report, of the reports on various other studies and, in particular, of the submissions made by the nine regional development organisations. The review is largely concerned with the question of aims and guidelines for the location of physical development between and within the regions, and is being carried out in close liaison with the Industrial Development Authority.  This work will be completed in the near future when I expect to make recommendations to the Government in the light of all relevant considerations, including the prospect of EEC membership.</P>

There are no other specific proposals from the Limerick Corporation before my Department.  I cannot say at this stage, when a decision on these two proposals will be issued but there will be no avoidable delay.  A general request for an increased Road Fund grant for 1972-73 was forwarded on 1st December and is under consideration.</P>

      <P>This matter has come before me by way of appeals by third parties under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 against a decision of Dublin Corporation as planning authority to grant permission for the proposed development. An oral hearing of the appeals has been requested.  All interested parties will get due notice of the date and venue of the oral hearing and any representations they may wish to make at the oral hearing will be given due consideration by me when deciding the appeals.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 and the regulations thereunder indicate the matters which I should take into account in determining a planning appeal and the procedure to be followed before a decision is taken.  In particular, the regulations indicate that, where an oral hearing is being held, a relevant matter to be taken into account should be put to the parties to the appeal so that there is an opportunity of considering the views of all parties on it at the hearing.</P>
      <P>I trust that on reflection the Deputy will agree that it would be more appropriate if the consideration he mentions were raised through the appeals procedure rather than through the procedure of Parliamentary questions.</P>

    <P>It is a condition of the permission that demolition shall not commence until such time as permission under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 has been granted for the redevelopment of the site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspector's report on the hearing makes it clear that it was not a question of adjournment but that it was concluded.  I understand that at the hearing the objectors produced an alternative plan for the development of the site and that Senior Counsel on behalf of the developers expressed interest and said the developers were prepared to examine this new plan and see if it would provide a reasonable alternative to the proposed development.  However, he made it clear that he did want the appeal resolved.  The Gallagher Group, who were the appellants in this case, had appealed against conditions in their grant of permission and they wanted a decision on those conditions. The hearing was not adjourned but was completed.  It is possible that the objectors felt their proposals would be accepted and are disappointed that the revised plans have not been accepted. But as far as my inspector is concerned the hearing was completed, and if they wish to re-open it they must introduce new information which is relevant to the appeal.</P>

      <P>Further arising out of the Minister's reply which, I am afraid, will be received as unsatisfactory by the residents and will be received with surprise by the Press who were present, would the Minister agree that in a case in which a political colleague of his has an interest in the outcome it is important not merely that justice be done but that it be seen to be done, and that it is not being seen to be done either by the residents or by the Press present?</P>

    <P>4.  The figures in columns 3, 7, 8 and 10 show the number of appeals which were unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>5.  The figures in columns 4 and 9 include appeals which were successful in whole or in part.  It is not possible to segregate these figures.  Cases a where there may be an appeal from one or more third parties against the whole development or a part of it, or against one or more of the conditions imposed by the planning authority.  Different third parties may have different grounds of appeal.  At the same time the developer may also appeal against one or more of the conditions.  In the total number of appeals any such multiple appeal is only counted as one, i.e., relating to one development. If the third party appeal is the first received, as it generally is in view of the shorter time available for such appeals, it is counted as a party appeal.  If the first appeal is from the proposer, it is counted as an appeal by the proposer.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  It was not considered either practicable or necessary to obtain the consent of the hundreds of thousands of people who use the classified directory.  The Department was satisfied in agreement with the contractor who produces the directory that the division would make the directory more convenient to users and would be advantageous to advertisers.</P>

      <P>Departmental officials correct any mistakes which have come to light in entries in the current directory, insert particulars of new and changed entries and delete entries in respect of ceased lines.  The amendments, additions and deletions are checked by other departmental officials.  The printer prepares proofs from this copy and checks it.  The Department then makes a final check of <Col N="488" /> the proofs before the new directory is printed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the mistake referred to by the Deputy will cause widespread inconvenience. The incorrect number which had also been included in a number of previous issues of the directory remained undetected until the Deputy brought it under notice.  Apparently neither the renter of the line nor any member of the public noticed the mistake or if they did notice it they did not regard the error as of sufficient importance to draw attention to it.  The reason may be that when consulting the directory they look up the main entry for the exchange line in question which contains the correct telephone number.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for drawing attention to the mistake.</P>
      <P>Steps have been taken to ensure that it will be corrected in future issues of the directory and the staff at the local auto manual exchange have been alerted in case they should receive any inquiries about the number in the meantime.</P>

      <P>About 8,000 subscribers in the Dublin 01 area already rent coinbox telephones, the vast majority of which are made available to members of the public during the day hours.  The rental and other terms for such telephones are very favourable in relation to the capital cost involved and I do not consider that the circumstances warrant a reduction.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the telephone service at Clonmel is unsatisfactory at times.  The difficulties at present are due to a shortage of switchboards which is resulting in delay to calls during the busy period of the day.  Additional switchboards will be installed in the new exchange building at Clonmel and will be brought into service by the end of June next.  When these are in service there will be a substantial improvement in the service at Clonmel.  The existing number of trunk circuits serving Clonmel is adequate at present.  Long term requirements will be met by a co-axial cable between Clonmel and Waterford which is on order and expected to be completed in the first half of next year.</P>
      <P>Equipment for the automatic exchange at Clonmel is on order and Clonmel exchange will, it is expected, be converted to automatic working towards the end of 1973 or early in 1974.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister has no intention of issuing stamps to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the State, or to commemorate the deaths of Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith, the founders of the State, or the 50th anniversary of the enactment of our first Constitution?  While the Minister agrees to issue a stamp to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the issue of the first postage stamp, he does not consider it necessary to issue a stamp to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the State.

      <P>Liability for the insurance against occupational injury of a person employed in the operation of a mail contract devolves entirely on the contractor and special insurance cover would be a matter for arrangement between contractors and their employees.

      <P>Would the Minister not agree if a mail car driven by a State employee was attacked there would be a payment made outside occupational injuries to such a person if he was injured?  Does he not consider it a bit peculiar that if a contractor who employs somebody to carry mail has his van attacked and the driver of that <Col N="501" /> van is injured and, perhaps, may be unable to continue his occupation for the rest of his life, that he is simply told he is entitled to social welfare benefit?

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when RTE proposes to erect the long-promised booster station in the Rosscarbery district, County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that because of shortage of capital RTE will not be in a position to provide the transposer in this area before 1973-74.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people in the Rosscarbery district cannot avail of our television service? In parts of the area there is no picture at all.  Is he further aware that repeated representations have been made to have a booster station erected in the district to accommodate Rosscarbery, Clonakilty and Dunmanway?  In all these places reception is exceptionally bad.  In view of all the representations made to his Department and to RTE, surely some priority should be given to the area and the booster station erected there this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are isolated pockets which do not get satisfactory reception and the only way to provide such reception is by using transposers. RTE had intended in 1970-71 to provide a transposer at Glandore, which would serve the area mentioned by the Deputy, but because of a shortage of capital the work had to be postponed and it now looks as if the area will not have the transposer until 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that it is unfair to the people in this area to leave them without the service of even one channel?  I am sure the position does not obtain in many other parts of the country.  In view of the unanswerable case which can be made for a booster station in this area, would the Minister not make funds available to enable work to commence on 1st April next?  That would <Col N="505" /> be a year ahead of the time he mentioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the second part of the Deputy's question, the gaps which <Col N="508" /> existed between wage levels in the EEC member states on the establishment of the Communities have been progressively narrowed and there has also been a general upward movement of wages, which in the 12 years ended 1970 ranged from 54 per cent to 95 per cent.</P>
    <P>As regards the third part of the Deputy's question, the expectation is that the rising trend of living standards as well as the upward movement in wages will continue in the enlarged Community.</P>
