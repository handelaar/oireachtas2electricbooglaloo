    <Title>Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1971: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 4, subsection (1), to delete lines 42 and 43, and to substitute the following:&mdash;-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;taxable period&rsquo; means a period of two months beginning on the first day of January, March, May, July, September or November;&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two problems here.  One is that we are not agreed on the question of the three months and the Minister has not, I think, come back on one aspect of it. We made the point that the British Government feel it necessary, with their much stronger industrial base, to allow three months for manufacturing industry and the Minister here thinks that two is sufficient.  We do not agree on that.  I would like to hear the Minister on that point which he has not dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did raise in my discussion last night the point that comes up in my amendment No. 10 of the desirability of the Minister having power to determine <Col N="738" /> when these periods start, to stagger them for different firms so as to maintain an even flow of work.  I thought he would come back on that and tell me whether he thought that was a good idea or why it was not a good idea.  Perhaps if the Minister could say a word or two on these points we might make further progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have, in fact, dealt with both of these points.  I tried to indicate that as far as the British are concerned their situation is quite different from ours and I do not think we ought to regard them as anything in the nature of a precedent in relation to value-added tax because they have to move much further in order to achieve value-added tax than we have.  If we want to make any comparisons I think they should be with countries which are operating value-added tax at the moment.  Quite different considerations apply in the case of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister make such comparisons?  It would be very constructive.  What is the position in the other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am saying that if the Deputy wants to make comparisons he should make them with those. I tried to indicate early on that I do not regard a comparison with Britain as valid at all but I am satisfied that, having regard to our circumstances and having regard to the consequential effect on the Exchequer, the amendment I am proposing, which is to extend the taxable period from one month to two, is as far as we can go and also meets most of the difficulties of most of the manufacturers, while at the same time conferring fairly substantial benefits on many wholesalers and retailers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of staggering the period of payment, certainly if we were having a three-monthly period this would be a matter that I think we would operate.  In fact, I have given considerable thought to this matter.  However, in relation to a two-monthly period, as I indicated last night, having weighed the pros and cons, and there are pros and cons in it, <Col N="739" /> I came to the conclusion that the balance of advantage lay with a two-monthly taxable period with a non-staggering of the payments.  I believe that the two months is as far as we can go, that it meets most of the difficulties and that, on balance, with a two-monthly taxable period it is not advisable to stagger the payments as between different classes of taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I was hoping that the Minister would clear up this morning all the misconceptions which all of us, including himself, myself, Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy O'Donovan, did seem to get tangled up in last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be honest about it.  If we start trying to make political points on this Bill we will be here not until the 1st of November but much later.  Let us try to get it clarified. What was at issue last night should be cleared out of the way before we do anything else, that is whether or not there is a recurring loss as a result of whether it be two or three months or whether it is simply a once for all loss.  Would the Minister make a clear statement on that?  I think we can offer our co-operation in trying to get it reasonably dealt with if the Minister can do that.  We are not trying to be awkward, we are just trying to be parliamentarians. I think that is our job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy is not trying to be awkward and I appreciate that this is not a matter that is clear to any ordinary person who is not involved in this, on first glance.  I did undertake to produce in writing or in graphic form an illustration of how this operates.  I have been informed that it will not be available for about a half-hour which leaves me in something of a difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy but I do not want to go back over it. We spent a lot of time on this last night.  I think the Deputy is quite right. It is of some significance that Deputy Belton and Deputy Fitzpatrick, who was speaking here last night, both of whom are practical men of business immediately say: &ldquo;Of course it is a recurring loss.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not go back over that ground again.  May I put it to the House this way?  The Revenue Commissioners, who have gone into this in some detail and who, I think it will be conceded, have a considerable amount of experience of this kind of thing, have assured me that the position is as I have told the House.  It will be some time before the illustrations are available but as soon as possible I will pass them across the House.  In the meantime, I would ask the House to take it on trust that the Revenue Commissioners know what they are talking about.  If Deputies have doubts about the matter perhaps by agreement and with the permission of the Chair at that point we could be allowed to discuss that aspect rather than hold up the debate until then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable suggestion but the mere fact that the document is not available proves we are not at present in a position to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald asked about comparisons with other countries.  I have been informed that most of the European countries, France, Germany and the Netherlands in particular, have a monthly taxable period.  I think that is of some significance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>From our experience in the past regarding turnover and wholesale tax we found that foodstuffs and drink were more expensive here than in England and hoteliers in this country found themselves in an uncompetitive position.  It is obvious that we must follow the practice adopted by England.  For many years to come there will be a greater flow of English people coming here than continentals. Further, we should introduce VAT on the date it is introduced in England and give the same period before the tax is payable.  At the moment the Government receive turnover tax when the articles are sold but now the retailers and wholesalers will have to finance the tax payment.  I know that the period of two months will help in some cases but for businesses such as chemist shops where goods do not move quickly these people will be at a considerable disadvantage in that they will have to pay the tax well in advance of the sale of the goods.</P>
      <P>We should not forget that England has a population of 57 million and that we are a small country and we should not try to get ahead of them.  I am not a person who advocates that we should automatically follow England on everything but I think we should in this case, both with regard to the date of introduction of the tax and the amount of credit given to retailers.  It is slightly like the corporation profits tax where companies were paying more in this country than they were paying in England with the result that they were not in a competitive position here.  If the cash flow is curtailed in any way our traders will not be able to compete with English firms.  I realise it is not easy for an Irish person to say we should follow England but in this instance I think it is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What bothers me is that on three occasions the Minister has been most careful not to reply to the point I made.  That always makes me think that perhaps I may have made a very good point.  I said that Irish industry is not in as strong a position as British industry and that to impose a heavy burden on it in terms of liquidity would be undesirable.  The Minister has referred vaguely to the circumstances <Col N="742" /> in which we find ourselves and the desirability of avoiding a loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  Neither of these relates to the point I have made&mdash; if the first point does relate it is expressed in such vague terms as scarcely to answer what I said.</P>
      <P>I consider I have a point here and unless the Minister can tell me why he thinks it is desirable to place a greater burden on Irish industry I cannot go along with him.  The temporary and small impact on the Exchequer does not seem to me to be a sufficient reason for putting Irish industry at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> British and Northern Ireland industry.  Unless the Minister can give me some answer on this point, other than a vague reference to the circumstances in which we find ourselves, I cannot go along with him on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in some difficulty in that I do not wish to comment in detail on what is being done in Britain or on what is likely to be done when VAT is introduced there.  I will go this far and say I do not believe that the system being introduced in Britain will for very long stay in the form in which it is brought in.  I have tried to explain to the House that the difficulties in bringing in VAT for the British Government are much greater than the difficulties we will encounter because their present system is so much further removed from VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that, but that is not the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is rushing in and not thinking about this. If he would think about it he would realise that, because it is so much further removed, the British have considerably greater difficulties to face and, therefore, they must introduce the system in as painless a way as possible. It should be obvious that when they have the system in operation that will not be the end of the story so far as they are concerned.  They will have to move further at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my view that since we are so near to the VAT system already we should aim at trying to get our system operating so that there will be the least <Col N="743" /> possible number of changes afterwards. In my view the fewer changes and the less disruption caused the better. Therefore, I do not think we should have regard to what they are doing in Britain.</P>
    <P>To suggest that this will make our industries uncompetitive is a fallacy. First, what we are proposing to do regarding the two-month period goes a long way in meeting most of the difficulties of Irish industry.  Secondly, we have been operating a different system from Britain up to now and it has not made Irish industry uncompetitive.  It is of some significance that while there is talk of making Irish industry uncompetitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain and the North, if this is so there was not any comment on the fact that what we appear to be doing is making Irish manufacturers more competitive as compared with France, Germany and the Netherlands.  There is some significance in the fact that they do not operate anything like a three-monthly period in these countries, countries which have been operating VAT for a considerable period.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on some statements made by Deputy Belton because I think he is under a misapprehension. I do not wish to go back on the ground covered last night but I should like to tell him that what we are doing will have the effect of conferring a considerable bonus in the way of liquidity on wholesalers and retailers because of the two-monthly period and the fact that retailers will get credit for the tax they have paid when they receive the invoice for the goods.  This is quite independent of the time they sell the goods.</P>
    <P>Under VAT they will get credit for tax on their purchases, unlike the situation with wholesale tax.  Further, they will be entitled under VAT to claim as a credit against the tax they owe the tax they have paid on fixed items such as renovation to premises, weighing scales and so on, and on the tax element in their supplies.  For instance, in Deputy Belton's business he will be able to claim credit on the tax element on bottles, corks and so <Col N="744" /> on.  This is an element they were not able to claim before but under VAT they will be able to set it off against their tax liability.  The position of the retailers and wholesalers, particularly with a two-monthly accounting period, will be considerably better than under the present system.  I think the argument made by Deputy FitzGerald relates not so much to that aspect about which he has slight doubts but rather to the difficulties for manufacturers.  I tried to deal with that matter in what I have said previously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to my business.  I should like to tell him that to pay an accountant to get the money back will cost me anything that I have gained.  If a businessman can avail of two or three months credit he can lodge the money involved in the bank so that he has the advantage of the interest on it but if the Government are to collect the tax earlier, the cash flow to any business will be curtailed and the gain will be to the advantage of the Government. At present turnover tax is paid within approximately six weeks.  We must remember that if a businessman is curtailed in the use of any money or if bank interest rates increase the person who would suffer would be the one buying goods from the retailer. That means that prices of commodities here will increase and that they will be dearer than they are in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the points the Minister made&mdash;first, the relevant fact is that the UK is giving three months but the reasons for giving this time are another matter.  They may have reasons for so doing that we do not have but given the fact that they are allowing three months, the Minister is putting Irish industry at a competitive disadvantage when it needs, if anything, to be put at an advantage.  The fact that industry allegedly will be at an advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the continental countries is not very persuasive because in any case the greatest volume of our trade is carried on with Britain, and, also, one would need to know what is the kind of credit period on the Continent. I suspect it is a good deal shorter than <Col N="745" /> here and this could well account for the taxable period being one month.  The crucial point here is the liquidity of industry. Each time the Minister has spoken he has dodged this issue.  He has never adverted to the point that the liquidity of Irish industry will be affected adversely.  He must face that. He is not being honest if he does not say so.  Should he stand up and say that the liquidity of industry will be affected adversely but that he thinks industry can carry this burden, while we may not agree with him we are talking about the same matter at least. If I am wrong in this regard the Minister would have said so long ago and the fact that he has not said so makes it clear that I am right.  Finally I am not persuaded by his point that the British legislation is a kind of confidence trick and that as soon as is possible for them, they will switch to two months.</P>
      <P>The British White Paper says that the standard accounting period will be three months with a month's grace for paying a quarter's net tax.  It may be that the Minister would be willing to say that in a White Paper if he intends cutting the period to two months.  I doubt if, in Britain, the Chancellor of the Exchequer would make such a statement in a White Paper if he had the intention of curtailing the period to two months at some time in the foreseeable future.  I do not think the Minister here would do so either.  Therefore, I am sceptical of the suggestion implied in the Minister's reply that the British intend, having got the legislation through, to squeeze industry by cutting the period back to two months and that we should go ahead on the basis that the period in Britain will be two months.  For those reasons it is still my opinion the Minister has not answered the point made regarding the two months and three months position relating to the liquidity of industry.</P>

In a big company where the amount involved might be as much as £130,000 there would be a willingness to pay 15 or 20 per cent on the last £10,000 so as to have that amount as a liquid asset. Under the terms of what the Minister is proposing to do now such a company would have to find this money and pay interest on it.  In the final analysis, the consumer is the person to pay for this so that costs here would be much higher than they would be in England.  We should follow England in this regard.  At this stage we should not be taking the Continent as an example because, in general, they work on a much shorter credit period than we do.  Perhaps, eventually, we could take them as an example and, maybe, this is what the Minister means when he says they will <Col N="748" /> look at the matter again there.  I never heard of that.  They may have to consider it again in relation to the terms of credit on the Continent but at the moment they are giving four months against our two.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify a point which is relevant but has not actually been raised so far.  Do I understand that in this country the manufacturer or trader will be entitled to recover the amount that he has paid in tax within one month but is only required to pay within two?  Or is he in the position that the two-month period applies both to his recoveries and to his payments?</P>

Is that the position?</P>

      <P>The second position described by the Deputy is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In Britain, according to the White Paper, it is different because we are told:</P>
      <P>When, however, a taxable person expects that his input tax will regularly exceed his output tax, for example, because he is an exporter and most of his outputs are zero-rated, he will be eligible for a shorter accounting period of one month so that he may obtain earlier repayment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country a significant proportion of industry is composed of exporters, in fact, the proportion of Irish output which is exported is significantly higher than the proportion of British output. Therefore it would be very important for export firms to have the benefit of that.  Will the export firm not be able <Col N="750" /> to recover the tax they pay until two months later?  In Britain they can opt for the one-month arrangement rather than the three months.  Is this the case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is a quite exceptional case.  It obviously relates only to people who will be paying less tax than they will be receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be true of the 100 per cent export firms and a significant proportion of the firms which are exporting a portion of their output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What the Deputy is saying is highlighting one of the difficulties of trying to follow up this comparison with Britain.  The Deputy will appreciate that in Britain there are quite a number of goods which are zero-rated.  In those cases the situation the Deputy is describing is the one that is likely to occur, because they will be claiming against a zero-rate of tax. They will be claiming credit for the tax they have paid on their input.  This is not a factor that will operate here to any great extent.  Therefore the kind of situation he is describing in Britain is not one with which we are going to be faced.  There are other quite different situations as well.  For instance, there are different rates of tax proposed in Britain.  In our case we propose 5.26 per cent on clothing; in Britain it is 10 per cent.  If one wanted to make a comparison with the British situation one would really have to compare the overall picture, and I do not think any of us is in a position to do so.  It is much more relevant for us to compare the situation with that which obtains in this country at the moment under the turnover tax and wholesale tax.  That is a fair comparison but trying to follow up a comparison with what is likely to happen in Britain is simply theorising because we have not got all the facts available and we are not in a position to compare, in fact, how the two systems will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am becoming more confused on this.  I understood that exports are zero-rated, that you do not pay tax on exports.  Is this wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not pay tax, that is true, but the Deputy would want to follow up the mechanics of how this operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but the Minister says we are different from Britain because some goods will be zero-rated; food will be zero-rated, and if the Minister does not accept our amendment it will not be zero-rated here.  That will be a valid point if exports of food in this country are not zero-rated.  Is it not the case that there is no tax payable on exports and therefore a man who is an exporter&mdash;and this is the case I am trying to make and I think it is the Minister who is confusing the issue on this occasion&mdash; has paid tax on his inputs and is paying no tax on his outputs?  He will want to recover the tax as soon as possible and I want to know whether, as in Britain, he can recover it in one month or whether he is forced to wait two months here and be put at a further disadvantage.  If that is the case I propose that at least as a modification of the two months he should be given the entitlement to opt for one month, as is the case in Britain to benefit exporters.  I want to know if I am right in the point I am making or if I misunderstood the point.</P>

That is not changing ground; it is a different point.  I read out a reference which is exclusively to exporters and the Minister, unintentionally I am sure, tried to mislead me.  What he said might have misled me into thinking that my point was invalid on the grounds that food will not be zero-rated here and will be zero-rated in Britain.  That, of course, is irrelevant.</P>

      <P>I read out a statement: &ldquo;When, however, a taxable person expects that his input tax will regularly exceed his output tax for example, because he is an exporter...&rdquo; I went on to raise the point about Irish exporters.  They are now being put at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> British exporters because the British exporter can opt for one month and get his money back quickly and the Irish exporter, contrary to the impression I clearly got from the Minister last night, cannot get his money back for two months.  When I was putting to the Minister last night a notional case it was put on the basis that you could get tax back in one month, and the Minister did not contradict me on that misunderstanding of mine, and I was, in fact, misled on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy, as I understood him last night, was talking about the present system of turnover and wholesale tax which involves a one-month arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I put to the Minister two examples, and in the second case I put it to him that in the first month the goods are bought and then in the following month&mdash;I have the piece of paper here in front of me&mdash;<Col N="753" /> he can get his tax back on what he paid.  The Minister did not contradict me. In fact, he seemed to go along with me.  Now we have the point clarified that he cannot get his tax back for two months nor can he, if he is not an exporter, get credit for it for two months.  This seems to me to be quite an important point because we have here a double discrimination between Irish and British industry both as regards the two months versus the three months and, secondly, the inability of the exporter to get his money back and the inability of the non-exporter to get his credit within one month if he wishes to do so.  I would ask the Minister at this point whether he would consider an amendment on Report Stage which would meet the point about exporters and enable, if he insists on the two months period, any firm to opt for one month rather than two months just as in Britain firms are entitled to opt for one month rather than three.</P>

      <P>It is a refund in the case of an original manufacturer if he happens to have bought some capital equipment in the month in question or something of that kind.  I am talking about the normal case.  At the moment I am not talking about the exporter.  I have dealt with that but I want the Minister's answer to my suggestion there.  I am talking about the normal case where a man is paying more tax than he gets credit for.  He buys goods and he has to pay tax at that stage.  He is out of that amount of money on which he has paid tax.  The next thing is that two months and 19 days later he has to pay his tax.  At that point, when he comes to pay his tax, he can set against that payment the credit for the tax which he paid on the final goods in the first instance. It is only at that point, in respect of a debt due two months and 19 days later, that he can have any benefit in respect of the tax he has paid.  That is my point.  He has to wait until then to get any net benefit from it.  Have I misunderstood that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the mechanics of it, the Deputy is right but I do not think he is right on his interpretation of it.  The relevance for the trader concerned is when does he get the invoice for the goods?  On that invoice he will get the charge for the tax for which he is liable.  Deputy FitzGerald has been contending that these people get three months credit.  If he is right what is happening is the person is being invoiced for the tax.  He is not actually having to pay it for three months and he is getting a credit in respect of what he did not pay from the Revenue Commissioners after two months.</P>

      <P>The Minister's analogy to the income tax is totally false because God knows there is nobody in the country who is not only entitled to income tax refunds but is entitled to them every day.  The Revenue Commissioners are faced with not giving the person his refunds at more frequent intervals than once a month.  Income tax is a thing you pay. Occasionally you may overpay and once a year a Revenue refund is due.</P>
      <P>We are talking about hundreds of business people who export the great bulk of their output and who day by day will be entitled to refunds.  The payment will be all the one way from the Revenue Commissioners to them but the time at which they get it will be of vital importance to them.  However, the Minister is not able to tell us even what kind of intervals he has in mind.  He says they will not get it daily.</P>

      <P>The British provision is one month and I would accept an arrangement for a maximum of one month.  What I want is to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners may not keep putting it off.  It is not in the nature of the Revenue Commissioners to pay out money due by them as promptly as possible because their instinct is to get money in all the time.  It is because of that that I suggest there should be legislative provision so that prompt payment will be made to people entitled to it and whose invoices are in.  The fact that the Minister cannot give us an indication of what is planned in regard to the maximum period he intends to allow makes it clear we must have some legislative provision.  At times we would be inclined to accept a Ministerial assurance but the Minister cannot give us even an assurance. Would he accept the desirablity of an amendment on Report Stage which would set a maximum frequency for repayment, but leaving it to the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners to pay more quickly?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  It shall be an offence for any person to charge a higher rate of tax on the delivery of taxable goods, or the rendering of taxable services than that prescribed under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears from the Bill that, although it proposes to lay down certain <Col N="760" /> charges, with which I do not agree, at no place in the Bill is there provision to deal with people who charge a higher rate of tax on the delivery of taxable goods.  The amendment, therefore, sets out that it shall be an offence for any person to charge a higher rate of tax on the delivery of taxable goods or the rendering of taxable services.  I should like to hear the Minister's comments on this before proceeding further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>Section 17, subsections (5) and (6), provides that where a person issues an invoice stating a greater amount of tax than that properly attributable he shall be liable to pay to the Revenue Commissioners the excess amount of tax stated in the invoice, <i>et cetera</i>.  There are also penalties.  There will not be any obligation to issue invoices or to show tax separately at the retail stage and the indications are that the great majority of retail traders will build the tax into the retail prices.  If this is so the amendment would not have the desired effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would if there is a known price for an article or service and if the person rendering the service or delivering the article included a higher rate of tax.  If such a higher rate of tax is refunded to the State it does not mean any benefit to the person who was overcharged for it.  I think my amendment makes a point and I should like the Minister to indicate that he is taking that point if it is not already covered in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as it can happen, there is provision in the Bill to deal with it.  I should also point out that in the Prices (Amendment) Bill at present before the House there is, I <Col N="761" /> understand, provision in section 4 that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may, by order, fix the maximum amount which may be added to the prices of commodities or services and a person must be accountable to the Revenue Commissioners for that tax. Other provisions control the display of prices, tax exclusive or tax inclusive.</P>
      <P>In other words, in so far as this may be covered it is covered in the Bill now before the House and in the Prices (Amendment) Bill.  The point I am trying to make about the building of tax into prices is that where it is built into prices, and where the retail price is not controlled, I do not think Deputy Tully's amendment&mdash;or, indeed, the other provisions in the Bill&mdash; can be operated effectively because the basis involved is that there should be a known fixed retail price.  Where there is not a known fixed retail price it would not be possible to effect the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the other Bill he referred to had not even been introduced when this amendment was tabled. Therefore I could not be aware of the fact that this provision was being made.  I do not think it is good law to have two sections attempting to deal with an offence under one Bill or Act. An attempt should be made to cover this by a section of another Act.  That is a personal opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that the other section deals not only with VAT but with any other form of tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what the Finance Bill should have covered.  The main point is that it has been the practice of people to overcharge.  The tendency to overcharge for tax purposes in this is going to be very great.  We will discuss that later on, when we are discussing the rate of tax, where a charge can be made which is an excessive charge.  This can happen quite easily in regard to services.  If the Minister is satisfied that he has this adequately covered, I would be prepared to accept it, but I want a firm statement from <Col N="762" /> the Minister that he is satisfied that there is no loophole which would allow the people I am speaking of to get away with something.  I am trying to ensure that people cannot get away with overcharging in any way.  Prices are high enough without people getting a little more on the side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, there are provisions in this Bill and in the other Bill which are designed to deal with this situation.  I have also pointed out that where the tax is built into the retail price, and where the retail price is not known or fixed by law, then it does not seem possible to determine the amount of tax that has been added on to the price.  Subject to that qualification, I am satisfied that the provisions in this Bill and in the Prices Bill to which I have referred are adequate to deal with this problem.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In pages 5 and 6, subsection (1), to delete paragraph (d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section defines &ldquo;delivery&rdquo; for the purpose of section 2, section 2 being the one which sets out how the liability for tax arises.  It is designed to clarify the point as to what transactions involve delivery of goods, and therefore involve a liability to pay tax. The clarification is useful under some of these headings.  The obvious one is (a)  which relates to the transfer of ownership of the goods by agreement, and (b) and (c) are clear enough.  I find myself in difficulty about (d).  I am not at all clear as to what the purpose of this is.  Subsection (d) refers to two kinds of transfers of ownership.  First, it refers to where the goods are acquired otherwise than by agreement, by or on behalf of the State or a local authority.  It refers to compulsory purchase by them.  I must ask the Minister whether that covers all possible kinds of compulsory purchase or are there other bodies?  Is a vocational education committee a local authority for the purpose of this section?  Have they got the power to acquire property compulsorily? Are there other bodies, other than local authorities as defined here, which have this power?  Subsection (d) (ii)  is even more remarkable.  I do not think there is much point in having a charge of tax on compulsory acquisition by a public authority.  The second subsection here is even odder, where you are dealing with a seizure by any person acting under statutory authority. If a person's goods are seized by the sheriff because he owes money, how could this transaction be reasonably regarded as liable for VAT?  It seems to me that what is done here is to define such a seizure, as well as compulsory purchase, as coming within <Col N="764" /> the definition of &ldquo;delivery&rdquo; for the purpose of section 2 and, therefore, there is liability for tax by the person who delivers the goods.  It is bad enough having your goods seized, but if you are asked to pay tax on them at the same time that is a bit much altogether.  This would be so odd that I can only assume that I have misinterpreted the purpose of the subsection. Without wasting time on it, I will sit down and allow the Minister to explain to me that I must have got it all wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, first of all, that the phrase &ldquo;by or on behalf of the State or a local authority&rdquo; should cover the various statutory bodies which have power of compulsory acquisition.  On the substance of this matter, the object of these two subclauses is to ensure basically that there is not unfair competition.  In the case of compulsory acquisition of land, the effect of this provision would be that the transaction would bear the tax.  That would mean, of course, that that would have to be taken into account by the valuer in arriving at the value which would be paid for the land under the compulsory acquisition proceedings. If we did not provide for <Col N="765" /> this, then the cost of the land would not be its market value.  This is designed to ensure that the market value is the same for land, whether being acquired compulsorily or not.  There is not this distorting factor of whether VAT is payable in one case and not in another.  Substantially the same reasoning applies to subsection 3 (d) (ii) but I admit it seems very peculiar on the face of it.  This could be of particular importance in relation to the goods that we referred to last night, described in the Fourth Schedule, such items as motor cars or television sets. These goods are liable to tax at the rate of 30.26 per cent.  If we did not have such a provision as we have here, it would mean that a man who had a stock of these could pay his debts by allowing a judgment to be got against him and the sheriff to seize the goods, and pay them then without having to pay the 30.26 per cent tax on the goods which could be a very substantial sum when we are dealing with motor cars or television sets.</P>

      <P>I am not happy with this because it does not say that when the sheriff seizes goods, he must credit them with having the additional value of the tax, or when property is compulsorily acquired, it must be credited with having this value.  It does not say this.  I quite understand that it is desirable that this should be done.  If a local authority is going to acquire land compulsorily and if as a result of the land being acquired compulsorily, the person concerned has to pay tax which apparently is what is intended here, the price therefore must be upped by an amount to enable him so to do, but there is nothing here to say that the State or a local authority has to pay a higher price to take account of the tax element.  If that is what the Minister is trying to do, he does not do it.  All he says is that whether or not the local authority or the State does allow for this element, the poor man must pay tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the seizure of property, it does not say that account must be taken of the fact in seizing motor cars that in fact they are taxable at the rate of 30.26 per cent and their value is accordingly enhanced and that if a debt is due of £500, the car must be valued inclusive of tax and the man must get the money to be able to pay the tax.  It does not say anything about that at all.  It simply says he has to pay the tax whatever valuation is put on it. Where is there anything which obliges the sheriff to take account of the tax in his valuation of the goods?  It does <Col N="767" /> not say that.  It simply says that he shall pay the tax in his valuation of the goods.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not at all protecting people; he is exposing them to rapacious State authorities, local authorities or sheriffs who may take no account of the tax element, and there is no legal obligation on them to do so, and to that extent the section is worded the wrong way round.  This would be permissible as a section or subsection in the Bill were there some other section elsewhere which required the people concerned in these cases so to value goods.  If that were required, it would of course be necessary to ensure that the goods having been so valued at the tax-inclusive rate, the man concerned would pay his tax.  As it stands at the moment, the sheriff can come along and say that a motor car is worth £500, that that is its value inclusive of tax, and he says he is seizing it for that and then the man having had his car pinched has to find £150 tax as well.  Where is there any guarantee that that will not happen? We cannot accept the inclusion of this subsection if we have not got another provision to guarantee the valuation of the property, movable or immovable, will in fact be tax-inclusive.</P>

      <P>The position as far as the value put on a piece of land is concerned is that that is determined under other statutes, as to how the valuer is to assess.  The basic principle is that it has to be assessed on the basis of its market value.  Putting this provision in has the effect that the market value of the land being compulsorily acquired will have to include <Col N="768" /> the value-added tax by virtue of this provision because it attaches value-added tax to the transaction, so that the valuer must take that into account because it is one of the elements in making up the market value.</P>

      <P>It is like selling in a grocery shop or a pub or anywhere else.  The seller pays and if the local authority should happen to get it 50 per cent too cheap, that is the fault of the seller.  He buys on market value or whatever he can get it at and the seller pays the 30 per cent.  Is that not what it comes to?  Why do they have to worry about the 30 per cent at all?  They are buying at market value and let the seller worry about it.  What has it to do with the fellow in between who is buying? He is not interested.</P>

      <P>The question of who has to pay it is not quite as simple as that because this gets back to the question of whether he is developing the land or not.  If he is doing it in the course of his business, he will have to pay the tax but will claim against the tax whatever tax he has borne on either purchase or on works he has done on the property.  I do not think we should go off on that tack.  The fact is that by this provision being there, we are treating compulsorily acquired land in the same way as other land and equating the two, and the valuer will be obliged, because this will be one of the expenses attaching to the transaction, to take that into account in assessing the market value, or putting it another way since if it were not being compulsorily acquired but were an ordinary private sale, account would be taken in the price of the fact that it was subject to this tax.  Then, correspondingly, when the valuer is valuing for compulsory acquisition and getting a comparable price, he will be taking this into account because the two will be subject to the same tax and it will work out virtually automatically, provided he is getting it at the right market value.  It <Col N="769" /> will include this because under this provision it will apply to both private and compulsory acquisition transactions.</P>

      <P>I still cannot understand the Minister's argument.  I know it is going to be paid, but at the moment in Dublin County Council there is a surcharge of £1,500 per acre or £500 per house for sewerage.  Everybody buying land knows he has to pay this and in his own mind he works out the value, knowing that he has to pay this. Surely the same applies here.  The valuer comes along and values in his own mind the property and offers a price.  Eventually when it is bought and the money is paid to the seller, the seller is liable.</P>

      <P>If we did not have this provision the price which would be settled by the valuer for compulsory acquisition of property would not be the market value.  It would be a special value relating to property compulsorily acquired because in that case compulsorily acquired property would not be subject to the tax whereas other property would.  The two prices would not be the same.  The objective is to have the same value applied to property whether compulsorily acquired or not.  If we did not have this provision this would not be so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are in a difficulty.  The Minister is talking about tax on land compulsorily acquired.  Land has a value in terms of what it is worth to the people buying it.  Now we are introducing a new concept that some land, because it happens to be owned by a man who happens to be disposing of it in the course of his business, is liable to tax. That land is not more valuable to the receiver on that account.  It has the same value to him if he is going to use it for some purpose.  Now we will have different categories of land, some liable to tax and some not, not because of any inherent characteristic of the land, but because of the quality of the owner and the nature of the transaction in which he disposes of it.</P>
      <P>The Minister is talking with the implied presumption that all land sold will be liable to tax and therefore all such land now goes up in value and therefore if it is compulsorily acquired account must be taken of that.  It is only the land which happens to be owned by somebody who happens to be selling it in the course of his business which is liable to tax and land in general does not change its value.  I fail to follow the logic of this.  This is a tax which is not related to the property itself but to the quality of ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy say that land in general does not change its value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of this.  This Bill does not change the value of land and say that all land will now be worth more because there is a tax on it.  It is only some land owned by some people disposing of it in a certain way at a certain time that will attract the tax and cost more.  This seems to me inherently undesirable.  I do not see how you could say that land compulsorily acquired is more valuable by virtue of this Bill simply because a particular person owns it.  It is not more valuable to the person buying it.  This will introduce <Col N="771" /> a distortion into the whole business of property transactions because hitherto land has been taxed equitably in the sense that there is stamp duty on land sales or property sales.  That stamp duty is the same for land of similar value.  There is a scale involved. I will not go into the details but basically it is a tax which relates to the land and not to the owner of the land.</P>
      <P>Now we are introducing a new and distorting concept.  In a sense I am anticipating section 4.  I am wondering is it wise at all to include land and buildings in this Bill.  They are not taxed at the moment under the wholesale and turnover taxes.  Is that not right?  The Minister is now applying a new tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I interrupt the Deputy for a moment?  Undeveloped land will not be liable to value-added tax.  Subject to other conditions, basically what is involved here is where development&mdash;I think we use that word &mdash;has taken place the value-added tax applies.  At the moment it is not true to say that turnover and wholesale taxes do not apply to building.  In every house there is a content of tax paid in respect of some of the commodities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy has looked at it.  I am not going into the details of the conditions in which this becomes liable. One of them arises on &ldquo;work done after the enactment of the legislation&rdquo;. That is one of the conditions. I am not going into it at the moment because I do not think it is relevant. What is relevant is that where the conditions apply in which value-added tax is attracted to land or building, <Col N="772" /> what is happening is that tax has been paid on some inputs into, say, the building of a house.  Tax has been attracted to some of the items in it. Unless we have a provision bringing it in under the value-added tax there is no way by which the person who suffered that tax can recover it and set it off as a credit on the next stage when he is selling.</P>
      <P>We could, as Deputy FitzGerald says, omit these, but if we do we are creating a situation in which people are paying tax in the course of their business which they cannot recover.  At the moment under the existing system they are paying tax and we are trying to disturb as little as possible the existing incidence of tax.</P>
      <P>I want to say also that Deputy FitzGerald is mistaken in thinking there is some new concept here.  I would remind him&mdash;offhand; there are probably other examples&mdash;that some years ago a special tax was introduced in relation to certain development of land, office blocks, and so on.  There is already in law a distinction between some kinds of property and others.</P>
      <P>The point I was trying to make earlier was that, assuming that the conditions are complied with by which the value-added tax applies to land or buildings, then we have to ensure that there is comparability between land which is sold privately and land which is acquired compulsorily.  The only way we can do that is by ensuring that this provision is in the Bill so that the two which are otherwise comparable will be treated in the same way.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald is quite right in saying that there are certain other kinds of land; let us leave land out of it and let us say houses where it is probably clearer.  A house sold by a private individual in the ordinary way, and not in the course of his business, does not attract value-added tax. Therefore, this provision does not arise.  Where you have property to which it does apply you will not have equal treatment and equal value as between the private transaction on the one hand and the compulsory acquisition on the other, in the absence of this provision.</P>

      <P>I am trying to follow the Minister.  Is it not a fact that this Bill will impose value-added tax on property which is owned and disposed of by people in the course of their business, property which at present does not carry such a tax?  At present people building have to pay wholesale and turnover tax on certain ingredients and Deputy Belton says that that amounts to £140.  The suggestion that this is so inequitable that you must tax them even more is a rather curious argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point is that if people are building, or buying and selling buildings, they will be taxed on the value added in that transaction&mdash;that is, on the margin between what they pay and what they sell it for &mdash;and therefore a tax will be paid in respect of that transaction by virtue of its being handled in the course of a particular person's business, a tax which would not be paid if the person disposed of it privately and had been using it for his own personal benefit.

      <P>I must have gone wrong, but I understood the Minister to say that if someone, in the course of his business, buys and sells property he must pay tax in the process.  If he buys a house with a view to reselling it as a property deal of some kind he will get a credit for the tax on the house he bought and will then have to pay tax on what he sells again and there will be a net tax claim on the difference between the two.

      <P>This is a special provision designed to ensure that the actual amount of the value-added tax related to building comes out at 3 per cent which is the amount of tax payable at the moment.  Do not ask me to explain this yet.  We are not on the particular section yet, but I am trying to point out to the Deputy that he has not got the entire concept of how property, immovable goods, are dealt with.

At present he cannot recover it.  The cost of the Exchequer is about £2 million a year.</P>

The materials cost of the house is surely only a minority of the total value including the value of the site, development work, the labour content of the house and the builder's profit.  For the Minister to say he will give him back tax on the minority element, the materials, and not mention the fact that he is going to tax the much larger amount of value added and that he gets back twice as much as he gives probably is not being entirely honest with the House.</P>

      <P>Going back to the time turnover tax was introduced, you get an allowance straight away on goods on which you paid TOT.  You do not have to pay it.  You now sell a premises for £100,000.  Somebody pays 5 per cent to an auctioneer, 3 per cent in stamp duty and you will now pay 5.2 per cent also on 60 per cent of it. First, you are depreciating by approximately £4,000 the sale value of the premises and no matter who buys anything or no matter what is paid for anything the customer pays in the long run.  I want to get this clear.  Take a person who at present owns £100,000 worth of property.  When this Bill goes through he is poorer by approximately £4,000 because he cannot claim back as the premises was built ten years ago before turnover tax came in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, £2 million.  May I interrupt the Deputy for a moment and explain?  First, this applies only to people who are in business and therefore will be registered.  It does not apply to the ordinary private house.  A is in business and he sells his property as the Deputy described.  The value-added tax payable will amount to about 3.1 per cent, additional VAT. So far as he is concerned he can set off against that any tax he has already suffered and has not recovered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Let us get the outline clear first.  It is a business premises. Almost certainly, therefore, he is selling to somebody who is registered, B. B is paying the price of the property plus this VAT of 3.1 per cent in this special case.  He claims that VAT that he has paid against his liability for VAT and in fact it is not costing A or B money although this additional money passes.  It is not costing them money because each one is claiming it as a credit against his liability for tax.  The problem arises only if it is a sale to an unregistered person which is an unlikely event, the sale of a business premises to an unregistered person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>With this legislation coming in, you will have to include your VAT in the price; so, if an auctioneer <Col N="780" /> is selling he is selling inclusive of the VAT.  There is legislation going through the Dáil providing that you cannot have a price and value-added tax; it must be included.  Therefore, if an auctioneer is selling, the price must include this VAT &mdash;is that not correct? An auctioneer cannot say that the price is £100,000 and the value-added tax is 3.1 per cent after that.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I can see Deputy Belton's point that where a person is selling his property the buyer will take into consideration that the value-added tax will be refunded and, as the Minister has stated, will be refunded in a short time.  I could see a situation arising in the case of the unregistered trader.  There will be an allowance of about £250 a week in the case of an unregistered trader. How much would that make in the public market?  Assuming it made £10,000 to £15,000 at public auction, the unregistered trader will not be in a position to claim a refund of the value-added tax.  There will be a considerable number of these small properties coming on the market all the time.  Special provision must be made for the unregistered trader to claim a refund of the value-added tax on the property he bought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>One hopes so.  At present under turnover and wholesale tax builders are not registered because building, as such, is exempt.  What happens is that the builder purchases the ordinary materials; he sells the house and the price at which he sells it includes approximately 3 per cent that he has paid in the way of turnover and wholesale tax.  Under the value-added system he would be registered and would charge the same price for the house because he would be paying the same amount of tax, but the difference would be that he would be able to claim a refund or a credit of this 3 per cent which he would have borne in his inputs, which he is not able to do at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not very clear.  If he is claiming credit how is the price of the house 3 per cent higher than it would be but for the tax?  Is this section 10 (8) (b) again? The Minister has said he may claim a refund of the tax he has paid on the materials which he cannot now do. Yet the Minister says that the price of the house will be unchanged.</P>

Under VAT he will pay the same amount of tax and he will continue to pass it on to the purchaser but, of course, in the same way as everybody else, he will be claiming credit for the tax he has paid.  In fact the amount that he will be able to claim against will be the same as at present so that his position will not change.  People who will benefit will be registered trade customers of the builder.  Let us say one of those at the moment is having an extension built. The tax which he will bear will be 3 per cent, approximately, of the value of that extension.  The builder will have to charge him that amount but he will not be able to recover it.  Under VAT <Col N="796" /> he will pay the builder as before but will be able to recover it from the Revenue Commissioners.

As we said earlier, if he purchases a house just as a private residence he does not get the benefit of this.  This is one of the defects in the existing turnover and wholesale tax system, that traders could not pass on fully the tax they were paying in the course of their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did say about two hours ago that one of the difficulties we had was that we were discussing something in connection with which certain conditions must be met before value-added tax becomes payable in respect of the sale of immovable property.  We have not yet got to discussing those conditions and we are going around in circles as a result. What Deputy FitzGerald is now talking about is one of those conditions. I would suggest that, at this stage, we have gone far enough ahead of ourselves and that we should now come back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point, but I want to understand this compulsory purchase matter now that we have got this much background to it.  Am I not right in what I said originally and what led to this discussion, that now property is going to have different values depending on who is handling it?  The Minister suggests that this provision must be here for compulsory purchase because otherwise the same property would have different values depending on who was handling it.  In fact, properties do have different values depending on who is buying them, under this new tax system.  Is it necessary to get involved in this complication about compulsory purchase, or, if it is necessary, is it not absolutely essential to acquire by some legal <Col N="799" /> enactment that the price to be paid on compulsory purchase shall be one that takes account of the tax where the tax liability arises?  I am not making it very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I know what the Deputy means.  I think he made these two points quite some time ago and I thought I dealt with them, but I shall try to deal with them again. The first one is: do we have to have this provision anyway?  I think the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, because if we do not we are going to have a distortion in the value of comparable types of property.  By &ldquo;comparable&rdquo; I mean comparable in terms of value-added tax.</P>
      <P>The second point he raised was: if we do have to have it, do we not have to have provision in this Bill to compel a valuer to take it into account? I do not think that is necessary at all, because the legislation under which valuers work in compulsory proceedings quite clearly sets out the basis on which they have to work.  What it amounts to is that they have to accept the market value.  The market value of property of the kind we are talking about, once this provision is in, will be what would now be the market value plus the value-added tax, because it will be compared with comparable property which is not being compulsorily acquired.  It will be subject to value-added tax, and therefore, the valuer has to take it into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it depends on who is selling to whom whether there is tax liability or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.  I am saying that in comparable property which is not subject to compulsory acquisition the market price would be what we call its present market value plus value-added tax.  If we did not have this provision the market price of compulsorily acquired comparable property would be its present market value with no value-added tax.  By putting in this provision, where there is a distinction between, on the one hand, privately acquired and, on the other hand, compulsorily or publicly acquired <Col N="800" /> property of comparable types in value-added terms, we are making them equal.</P>

You cannot have property values determined by the identity of the purchaser, and that <Col N="801" /> is what the Minister is purporting to do here.  Property values, in the case of compulsory purchase, must exist in their own right.  The land is worth something because it is owned by a certain individual who is selling it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now reached the point where we are discussing the amendment, the whole question of compulsory purchase. Whatever about what we were at before, we could not be more relevant than that.  I have raised a point to which I have not had a satisfactory answer from the Minister.  The Minister thinks I am wrong but he is not in a position to say why I am wrong. If the value of the property compulsorily required depends on who is compulsorily acquiring it as well as on who is selling it, then the Minister's thesis that it is necessary to put such property on a comparable basis by including this particular subsection is invalid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting himself involved in the most unnecessary complications.  Surely the thing to accept here is that a valuer who is involved in the job of valuing property, as part of his profession, knows how to do his job.  Let us assume that and not put ourselves into complicated difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that, but you are putting this in an impossible position if the property ceases to have an abstract value by virtue of its ownership and its location and acquires different values depending on who will buy it and depending on whether the local authority is buying it in its capacity as a registered trader or an unregistered trader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very doubtful <Col N="803" /> proposition.  It is abstruse, to say the least of it, and it is also doubtful.  It is an area in which a professional valuer should be left to work out the problems, not us.  We cannot do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is in the position where, depending on who the purchaser is, the property has a different value for tax reasons you are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would doubt that very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may doubt it but he has been most careful not to contradict it because he knows it can be true.  That being the case, then we are introducing a new concept into property values in regard to compulsory purchase which is unworkable because the person who is valuing it for compulsory purchase purposes no longer has any staple criterion to go on but has to consider who is buying it.  If it is being bought by one person or by a local authority in one capacity it has a different value to what it has in another.  That is something which is clearly undesirable and unworkable and it is precisely why this whole provision has to be removed from the Bill. This is my thesis.</P>
      <P>You cannot import this element of uncertainty or variability into property values, depending on the identity of the purchaser under compulsory purchase. The position must be that, whoever is buying it, the land has the same value. You cannot put the seller of the property at a disadvantage because a local authority comes along and says &ldquo;I am buying land compulsorily from you in my capacity as unregistered trader.  The land is, therefore, because I cannot recover tax on it, worth less to me and so I am paying you less.&rdquo; The valuer then, because of the fact that the local authority is acting in its capacity as an unregistered trader, must pay a man less for his land than he would have got if it was being purchased by a registered trader, whether it is a local authority or somebody else. That introduces an element of uncertainty into compulsory purchase.</P>

I can say also that I think I understand what is involved on this occasion on this narrow issue.  It is because I understand it that I am unhappy about the proposal in the Bill. Under compulsory purchase the situation will arise that the value of the property and the amount to be paid to the seller will depend on the identity and the taxable capacity, if you like to call it that, of the purchaser.  That is <Col N="805" /> something which should never arise under compulsory purchase.</P>

If that can be put down in black and white, I am happy; otherwise I cannot accept this.</P>

      <P>May I deal in a simple way with the point Deputy FitzGerald made.  At present one man can borrow money at 7 per cent and another man has to pay 10 per cent for it.  There you have a difference of 3 per cent and it is obvious why I select this example.  They both go to <Col N="806" /> buy a house on the market.  The market price of the house is not in fact determined by one of them or the other.  It all depends on what the market is like at the particular time. If houses are a drug on the market, obviously only the man who is getting his money at 7 per cent will be prepared to buy it at a price suitable for the seller or the builder.  I do not think Deputy FitzGerald's argument is correct, that what the Minister is attempting to do will upset prices in that fashion.  There are too many factors which come into it.  There are these differences.  There is the difference in relation to the man who has dry cash&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One man pays only 7 per cent for money and the other pays 10 per cent, and yet there is one price for the house.</P>

He is in a better position to pay than an unregistered trader.  If that is correct, the problem arises as to whether, with the distortion introduced by this Bill, we do not need some provision to ensure that the price will be that which the seller would have got if he sold in a free and open market and not by compulsory purchase.</P>

The Minister is suggesting that the person whose goods are seized&mdash;the value of the goods may be nothing&mdash;will have to pay tax on what <Col N="809" /> the sheriff has seized.  This is an absurd proposal.  To be acceptable at all there would have to be an assurance that the person concerned would get credit from the sheriff for the tax he paid so that he would not lose doubly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point Deputy FitzGerald made, if the value of the goods is so and so, there are other things that must be considered.  The Minister spoke about motor cars.  If the goods go for sale there is a tradition in country districts that if the person whose goods are seized is able to buy them back himself nobody will oppose him.  If he is not, nobody will buy them, or his friends may chip in. Perhaps the Minister would explain the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision is there precisely because of what Deputy Tully had said about what happens frequently at sheriffs' sales.  The goods could be bought up by the person's friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the goods were valued at £5,000 and they were seized, they could be sold for £500.  That would not get them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be paying £5,000.  A man would be free of tax at 30.26 per cent as against somebody else who is going to pay the £5,000.  He would have to pay that much tax on the goods in question, which would be substantial.</P>
      <P>As regards the point raised by Deputy FitzGerald, I refer him to section 10 (4) on page 13 which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to deliveries referred to in paragraphs (d) (ii), (e) and (f) of section 3 (1) shall be <Col N="810" /> the cost of the person making the delivery of acquiring or producing the goods excluding the tax which would be deductible under section 12 if the deliveries in question were made in the course of business.</P>
    <P>In this case which we are talking about, the person whose goods are being seized, the cost to him, whatever he paid for them, is the cost for the purpose of determining the VAT to be assessed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He is going to be taxed at 30 per cent on what he paid for the goods, regardless of what they get at the sheriff's sale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here about delivery of goods in the course of business.  We are giving it an artificial meaning, but we are talking about it &ldquo;in the course of business&rdquo;. The kind of situation which Deputy FitzGerald is thinking about, where a person had bought a car and paid 30.26 per cent tax on it and then has his car seized by the sheriff and has to pay the tax again, cannot arise.  That cannot arise because we are talking about a delivery of goods by an accountable person in the course of business; so that where a private person has bought a car and paid the duty, he does not come under this section dealing with the sheriff at all.  Where it is a trader who is delivering in the course of business he will have paid the duty, perhaps, but he will also have recovered it against his ordinary liability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at section 2 (1).  It reads:</P>
      <P>With effect on and from the 1st day of March, 1972, a tax, to be called value-added tax, shall, subject to this Act and regulations, be charged, levied and paid&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on the delivery of goods and the rendering of services delivered or rendered by an accountable person in the course of business, and</P>
      <P>(b)  on goods imported into the State.</P>
    </Speaker>

I am pointing out that this section 11 (2) deals with the situation where goods were subject to wholesale tax at the high rate&mdash;in other words, including cars&mdash;and which are then delivered within the State on or after 1st March, 1972.  In other words, there in a sale of a secondhand car and where that happens, it is charged at the rate of 5.25 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When I raised the question of the sheriff's sale the Minister said it was very necessary and that, especially because of the question of the seizure of cars liable to this very high rate of 30.26 per cent, it was important that this should not be evaded, or words to that effect.  Now it transpires that the car being secondhand at the point where the sheriff is taking it, is taxed at 5.26 per cent.  Am I right in that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that is a separate case.  The Minister was not talking about that.  He was talking about registered traders generally and he spoke about the sheriff in relation to registered traders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not talking about the sheriff seizing battered old secondhand card.  Surely it was obvious that I was talking about the evasion of tax at the high rate which implies that I was talking about new cars at the high rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have implied that to the Minister but it did not imply it to the rest of us, because at that stage the Minister had not pointed out that there was this provision in regard to secondhand cars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If this sheriff's sale provision, which is to hit everyone in the country, because anybody who has anything seized has to pay value-added tax on the seizure against him, is necessary because of the possibility that a car dealer selling new cars might decide to get out of his obligations in some way by deliberately having a seizure against him and evading his responsibility for 30.26 per cent tax, and that he would then buy back the car subsequently and that nobody else would bid against him at the sale&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is losing sight of the fact that this applies only in the case of registered traders.  Therefore we are talking about people having cars seized who have had a refund of duty and who, in fact, have not paid any value-added tax.  We are <Col N="817" /> not talking about the ordinary person who has paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the cost of the goods seized, not on the current value. The Minister is justifying this on the grounds that there could be a case where a trader in new motor vehicles deliberately seeks to evade his responsibilities by getting his goods seized so that he can buy them back on a basis of not paying the tax and being in a better position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy is complicating the position unnecessarily. The fact is that by inserting this provision we are putting people whose goods are seized on exactly the same basis as somebody who is threatened by the sheriff and sells his goods and pays the sheriff out of proceeds of sale.  I do not think we ought to give an advantage to the person who will not do that and waits <Col N="818" /> for the sheriff to seize his goods.  That is what we would do if we were to delete this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us earlier that he can reclaim the tax when he pays it.  It makes no odds to him.  The Minister explained that the registered trader having paid this tax on the goods seized from him can reclaim it from the Revenue Commissioners and get the money back again.  Therefore he is no worse off. If he will not be affected either way, what is the point of this complicated provision?  If he would be put in a position where he would be better off by having his goods seized than by selling them there might be some case, although a rather remote one, but if he gets the tax back anyway there is no point in the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest again that the Minister might have another look at this.  Perhaps we are taking the wrong line but I agree with Deputy FitzGerald that it appears a bit complicated. If the Minister considers that it can be improved on the next Stage he might do so and let it go at that. Otherwise we could continue arguing about it all day and still not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that. We have now spent about six hours on this Bill and a very high proportion of the time was spent, not in debating the measure or what needs to be done to it, but in trying to understand it. This is really impossible.  It is wasting the time of the House.  We can all be accused of wasting it because we are asking questions to try to understand it, and we can be told we should have done our homework, but it is not that easy.  The Minister has found great difficulty himself.  He has had to have frequent conferences lasting for many minutes to try to understand it despite the fact that he must have a big brief in front of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not argue over whether it is something which either side cannot understand.  It was bad enough to be arguing about a section which was not before us without arguing about who is right like a crowd of kids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will be a long time going through this House for reasons which are avoidable.  We have a so-called explanatory memorandum. In a case like this it simply repeats the words:</P>
      <P>The ordinary commercial meaning would be confined to the voluntary transfer of possession of goods from one person to another, but for the purposes of the tax this meaning is expanded to include&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) the seizure of goods by a sheriff or other person acting under legal authority;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no explanation whatsoever. It merely states what is in the Bill.  I know from trying to draft explanatory memoranda for Private Members' Bills that I am not allowed to explain anything, and that it is against the rules to explain anything. One of the problems is that we have no explanation.  The Minister has had some guidance but we have had none. We are wasting hours trying to tease out what the Bill means so that we can think about whether it needs to be changed.  In the case of such a complex Bill could the Minister ask the Revenue Commissioners to provide us, informally, if you like, if it cannot be in the form of a printed explanatory memorandum, with a simple explanation in ordinary language of the reason for each provision so that we can get on with it.  Otherwise the Bill will not leave the House before 1st November.  I wonder would the Minister consider the possibility <Col N="820" /> of doing this.  I know it would be an unusual procedure but it is a very unusual Bill and we are all unusually muddled about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to hold up the House.  God knows it has been held up long enough.  What Deputy FitzGerald has said is quite correct. Surely a Bill which requires nearly 100 Ministerial amendments should not be brought into this House for Committee Stage.  Surely the obvious thing to do is to rewrite the Bill and bring it in as a new Bill.  Even at this stage I would suggest to the Minister that it would go through far more quickly if something like that were done.  The Minister is proposing amendments to his own work and the draftsman's work, amendments which they had to prepare themselves after the Bill had been published and had its Second Reading.  This gives the impression that somebody misunderstood the purpose of the Bill, or many sections of it&mdash;not only the Opposition but those who were drafting the Bill.  I would not blame the Minister or his officials for this.  It is a very complicated matter.  I would seriously suggest that two things could be done. We have only half an hour left and we are getting nowhere in a hurry. The Minister could agree to take back the Bill and have another look at it and re-introduce it.  He should get a committee of the House to put it through Committee Stage.  Otherwise we could be here until God knows when.  I am trying to be helpful.  I am not being critical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that when Deputy Tully talked about 100 ministerial amendments this conveys a certain impression, but he will agree that the vast bulk of them are consequential. The number of substantial ministerial amendments is quite small. For instance, the question of changing from 1st March to a specified day runs right through the Bill and accounts for a great many of the amendments. A few others are of the same kind. What I am saying is that the ministerial amendments do not complicate the issue unduly except in so far as <Col N="821" /> there is a big number of them.  The basic principle is straightforward enough.  I agree that the Bill is extremely complex and difficult to follow. As far as I am concerned, it is certainly the most difficult I have ever come across.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Tully talks about 100 amendments, that is giving a very different impression.  I regard the Bill as extremely difficult and complex and I will certainly consider what procedure might be open which would assist Deputies to follow the Bill more easily so that the debate could, perhaps, be speeded up somewhat. I do not wish to be critical, but I would remind Deputies and, in particular, Deputy FitzGerald that part of the problem&mdash;only part now, not all the problem&mdash;has been that we have had to refer forward to certain other sections, sections we have not reached, and, in regard to some of them, Deputy FitzGerald had tended to question the wording.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Part of the problem has been&mdash;I do not want to be critical about this&mdash;to talk about some of the basic sections in the Bill which involves going to later parts of the Bill and getting a picture of how certain things will be handled.  We have run into some difficulties because we are talking about things to which certain conditions in later sections apply while we have not, in fact, reached these sections. Indeed, I think some Deputies were not aware of these sections.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1) (e), lines 5 to 7, to delete all words after &ldquo;of <i>section</i> 34) of&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;of taxable goods delivered to him&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to make a bit clearer and simpler the provisions of subsection (1) (e).  I am, of course, prepared to be told there are good reasons for the wording here and I put down the amendment partly to extract what the reasons are.  I have, in fact, been told that there are some defects in the wording here, but I admit to not being entirely clear as of this moment as to what these defects are.  It was suggested to me that my wording would be more comprehensive as well as being clearer.</P>
      <P>The problem about this particular subsection is that it will be impossible to administer.  If a man who is running a shop takes a pot of paint and paints part of the shop, will he have to account for this?  Will every little transaction of that kind have to be accounted for?  This seems to be what is suggested here and it does not seem feasible to administer something along those lines.  There is room for confusion and the complexity of it and the trouble involved in dealing with quite small items goes beyond what is justified.  It seems to me the words &ldquo;of taxable goods delivered to him&rdquo; are more comprehensive and clearer than the words used in the subsection.  I should like to hear the Minister's reaction to that particular point before trying to develop my argument further. I find this also a rather difficult section to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of subsection (1) (e) is to ensure that tax may be charged on goods which are converted to use in a business.  This would be important where the business included exempted activities.  In that case it would be necessary to deal not only with the goods which had been delivered to the taxpayer, but also, with the goods he had constructed, manufactured, produced or imported. Deputy FitzGerald's amendment would confine the adjustment to taxable goods which had been delivered to the taxpayer <Col N="824" /> but would make no provision for the goods he had constructed, manufactured or produced himself.  It would be too narrow.</P>
      <P>On the question of the particular application or this&mdash;the tax becoming payable as a result of the application of the provision would be creditable, in full, against the tax on the traders' receipts where the business is not an exempt business.  For example, a manufacturer of washing machines, who also engaged in hiring them, would not be taxed on those machines which he withdrew from his normal stock for hiring purposes since the tax payable would rank for full credit against the tax payable on his hiring receipts.  I do not anticipate that there will be any real difficulty of a practical kind here but, if we do not make the kind of provision we have here, where a business is engaged to a substantial degree in both exempt and non-exempt activities, then in the absence of this kind of provision, there could not alone be confusion but considerable evasion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 8, before &ldquo;development&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;delivery or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that a person who received a tax credit for tax invoiced to him on the purchase of premises&mdash;for example, a shop or a warehouse&mdash;will be accountable for tax on the sale of the premises even if he carried out no development himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> An example of the operation of the amendment would be as follows: A is a builder.  He builds a shop and sells it to B, a trader, for £10,000.  On the assumption that the shop was built after the commencement of VAT, A will invoice B as follows: cost of shop, £10,000; VAT, £6,000 at 5.26 per cent&mdash;this is the 60 per cent to which we referred earlier&mdash;amounting to £315.  That is a total of £10,315.  B would be entitled to tax credit against his own VAT liability in respect of the £315 suffered on purchase of the shop.  If he subsequently sells the shop, whether or not he carries out any development himself, he will be taxable on the selling price.  The effect of the amendment is to ensure that in such circumstances the person who has received this tax credit will be accountable for the tax on the sale of the premises subsequently by him, even if he himself carried out no development.</P>

When he sells the premises the second time&mdash; suppose the price is £10,000 again; it would be more, as a result of inflation &mdash;he sells it for £10,315.

If, in fact, he opts to go on the basis of the cash received there is some doubt as to whether the ordinary rules applying to VAT would operate in that case.  This is designed to remove that doubt and make it clear that the ordinary rules as set out here will apply in the case of a builder who has opted for a cash receipts basis of accounting.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete subsection (3), lines 21 to 38.</P>
      <P>The problem here is that the effect of this section as drafted, and particularly with the inclusion of this subsection, appears to be to get around and invalidate the effect of the exemption of lettings&mdash;I hope exemption is the right word there&mdash;under the First Schedule.  The onerous character of the obligation imposed, particularly by this subsection relating to the disposal of interests in property would be such that where interests are disposed of by somebody&mdash;I think it was an accountable person with over £1,800 per year coming in from these activities; I hope I am right in that&mdash;is such that he will be forced, in fact, in order to minimise his tax liability to opt to pay tax on the lettings.  As I understand it, this in fact will reintroduce VAT on lettings on an extensive scale very much against the public interest and very much against the intentions of the Bill and its First Schedule.  That is the advice I have had in the matter and I have been told it is very important to deal with this matter and ensure this does not happen.  I am advised that this back-door method of forcing people to opt to pay VAT on rents would push up rents and that this should not be done.  I am open to correction if I have misunderstood the position but that is the advice I have and I should like to hear the Minister on this before I try to develop the argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the provisions here, if any person has an interest in land to which this section applies, and surrenders possession of the land&mdash; which he does by letting it or by allowing people into it on terms; it may involve a leasehold or a letting&mdash; and if the transaction is not caught by section 4 (2), then the person surrendering possession is deemed to have made appropriation of goods for a non-business use under section 3 (1) (f) and thereby to be liable for tax at such rate or level that he would be forced, in order to minimise his tax liability, to opt rather to pay tax on the rents.  This introduces a tax on rents through a back-door.  That has been put to me as the problem.  I would not claim fully to understand it but that is what has been suggested to me as being the effect of the subsection and that is why I put down the amendment. The Minister may be able to clarify whether I am well advised on this point or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is a basis for the suggestion that has been made to Deputy FitzGerald.  Subsection (3) here deals with the situation in which a person who has developed property, after the commencement of the tax, or has received a tax credit in respect of the development on the purchase, subsequently surrenders possession of it&mdash;for example, by a short term letting&mdash;in such circumstances he is not regarded as making a taxable delivery to another person.  In these circumstances he will be deemed to have made a self-delivery.  However, paragraph (b) of the subsection provides that a self-delivery is not regarded as taking place if the owner parts with possession in circumstances in which full credit could be claimed for any tax chargeable.  The reason for this subsection (3) is to ensure equal treatment or neutrality in the operation of the tax.  A builder who constructs property for letting would be charged to tax when he surrenders possession of the property (say by letting) and he will thus be put in the same position as a property owner who has the property constructed for him for the purpose of letting.  They will each be put in the same position.</P>

    <Col N="829" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This means that he has to pay tax on the full value of the property because he lets it to somebody although he has not relinquished ownership of it.  Anybody faced with having to pay tax on the full value of the property is not going to do that but will pass it on to the tenant by putting it on to the rents.  This will push up rents.  That is what is so undesirable. It is precisely what I am trying to avoid.  Obviously, the problem arises from the surrender of possession. The fact that that is interpreted to mean the letting of the property is precisely what creates the problem.  If a man sells property, then, of course, he should have to pay the tax but if he is merely letting it, as the First Schedule of the Bill exempts lettings, it is undesirable to reintroduce it here, through this back door, by forcing a man to opt to pay tax on the letting because the alternative is to pay tax on the entire value of the premises, which he cannot do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the 3 per cent tax that we talked about earlier.  It amounts to about 3.1.  It would be on 60 per cent at 5.26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously he will not opt to pay that if instead he can put it on to the rent and recover from the tenant.  This means that he will naturally opt for that alternative and you are pushing up rents, which is precisely what the First Schedule is designed to avoid.  It seems to me a most undesirable provision for that reason, if I understand it correctly.  It is only when the property is sold that this should arise, not when it is let. It is a mistake to try to reintroduce lettings here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

The purpose of the Bill is to exempt rent, not to push up the amount to be paid.  I cannot see the value of this proposal in the circumstances.  The talk of neutrality is all very well but neutrality which is hostile to people renting property and which pushes up rents is a kind of neutrality that we do not want.  I am wondering whether in fact the answer is not to zero rate rents rather than to raise them.  It may be that some difficulties are arising from the fact that rents are exempt and that you cannot recover the tax paid on the construction of the building.  That is an area of complexity that I do not want to pursue at this moment.  Would the Minister look at this again and see whether there is some validity in the point I am making and whether the provision can be so reconstructed as to avoid doing anything which will encourage people to opt to pay the tax on rents, thereby pushing up rents?</P>

I have to live with this fact.  The Opposition parties have not disagreed with the contention I make that, on the basis of the religious orders and a certain number of lay organisations, it is not possible to position the centres entirely according to the population that requires them and there will be movement of children outside an area into the extended accommodation run by religious orders.

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give any indication as to why there has been a drop of almost 3 per cent in the number of people who hold medical cards? Is he aware that for some months past, Deputies have been alleging that fewer medical cards are being issued since the introduction of the health boards and that the health boards are not administering this section of the GMS quite as efficiently as the local authorities did?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference is due to the fact that, I suppose, with the knowledge of the changeover in the system the county authorities were not revising the medical cards.  There has been a very considerable revision.  The county is becoming more prosperous and it is quite possible that there might have been a reduction even before the health boards started.  I cannot give the exact figure but there was a reduction in the numbers receiving medical cards in the four-year period before the coming into operation of the health boards. There was a reduction of between 3 per cent and 5 per cent.  This reduction has not only been occasioned by the formation of the health boards.  I should also like to tell the Deputy that dependants over 16 years of age have been eliminated from the register of persons covered by medical cards. Such persons have been informed that they may apply for medical cards in their own names.  I cannot give the <Col N="838" /> rate at which they will apply but it has some effect in relation to this reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any evidence relating to the figures for the current quarter?  Is he aware that revision of medical cards took place on 31st March, 1972, and that since this date many cards have not been renewed for people whom one would expect would qualify?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy any information on that subject. Under the Health Act, 1970, there would naturally be some increase in the number of medical cards occasioned by the fact that there were people in the lower income group who were going to their private doctor and paying.  Under the choice-of-doctor scheme now they can get free service. That would add to the number.  There would be a certain number of additional medical cards to those who benefit by the provisions in the Health Act, 1970, where the income of the husband and spouse is not to be counted in relation to family.  There would also be a reduction based on the fact that there had not been sufficient revisions of medical cards.  If the Deputy will look at the document on the county incomes prepared by the Economic and Research Institute he will find ample evidence that there would be likely to be some diminution in the number of medical cards because of the growing incomes of the community.</P>

      <P>The Minister agreed last week that these senior posts would include persons from outside the public service and, if necessary, outside the State-sponsored bodies.  There is an extremely difficult situation facing persons in private employment, unless they go in person to a Minister and tell him they would like a job in Brussels, telling him they are earning £8,000, £10,000 or £15,000 in private industry, but that they would like to assist the country by making themselves available to the panel for senior appointments.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose <Col N="845" /> to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>There are 201 pensioners in the CIE Superannuation Scheme, 1951.  I assume that the Deputy's second question relates also the CIE Superannuation Scheme, 1951, and the details requested were as follows at 31st December. 1971:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Capital value of Fund&mdash; £6,142,262;</P>
      <P>(b)  Annual income&mdash;£901,861;</P>
      <P>(c)  Annual Pensions&mdash;£67,817;</P>
      <P>(d)  Trustees&mdash;M.J. Hayes, P. Murphy, F. Lemass.</P>
      <P>At the latest actuarial valuation of the pension fund its liabilities exceeded its assets by £177,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the number of pensioners under the 1951 scheme are comparatively few in relation to the total number of pensioners, would the Minister make representations to CIE to the effect that they might improve the lot of these pensioners <i>vis-à-vis</i> their colleagues who retired under other pension schemes?  I have been given to believe that they are seriously prejudiced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At first sight I had much sympathy with the Deputy's view in putting down this question but the point is that, by reason of the fact that the 1951 scheme was designed for serving staff who were due to retire, only 201 pensioners have been affected so far whereas membership of the scheme at the moment is more than 2,500 serving staff and the actuaries say that provision must be made for these.  That is the reason for the high capital value of the fund in relation to the actual pensions paid out.  That is the problem but I will bring the matter to the notice of the board, although they inform me that actuarially it is right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Ceann Comhairle, I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the appeals referred to is not yet available.  The present position in the Dublin and Cork test cases which I mentioned in my reply to Deputy Barry on 16th May is as follows.  The Dublin appellant has now furnished an explanation of his non-attendance at the hearing fixed for the 8th May and re-listing of the hearing is under consideration. A hearing has been fixed for the 7th June at Cork in the Cork test case.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of Question No. 15 I wish to point out, in case there has been misunderstanding, that where the claimant's employment has been terminated, unemployment benefit is paid on the basis of a six-day week irrespective of the duration of the normal working week.  As I stated in reply to the Deputies on the 26th April the disallowance by deciding officers of Saturday, 15th April, in the particular circumstances arising out of the recent ESB dispute was based on the fact that the generality of the workers affected were conditioned to a five-day working week and were laid off only on a day-to-day basis without termination of their employment.  I also mentioned that disallowance of the Saturday might nevertheless not apply in certain situations&mdash;for example, short-time or casual employment, depending on the facts and circumstances in the particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue on the cases now under <Col N="847" /> appeal is whether disallowances imposed by deciding officers in the circumstances which obtained were correct.  Accordingly, it would not be proper for me to say anything further pending determination of the appeals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether the rate for the week was divided by five or by six?  The Minister will appreciate that if a decision is made generally to divide by five there would be very few complaints from anybody but the Department of Social Welfare cannot have it both ways. They cannot decide whether to divide by five or by six at any time it suits them to change their minds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount payable is divisible by six&mdash;six working days&mdash;but that has nothing to do with what may be held to be a day of unemployment or waiting days.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If somebody is unemployed for a week which, in the particular case in mind would amount to five days, surely he should be entitled to a full week's benefit and, therefore, the amount should be divided by five and not by six.

The Deputy will have heard in the budget statement that the scheme of prescribed relative allowance for certain pensioners is being extended to cover male relatives and it is proposed to make a corresponding extension in the case of the old age (care) allowance also.

I might add that the World Bank interest rates vary from time to time.  Therefore these are matters on which we cannot make categorical statements.</P>

      <P>As a result of the expansion of the National Parks and Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works the accommodation in No. 10 Hume Street is no longer adequate and it is proposed to transfer the branch to part of the new building at the back of No. 52 St. Stephen's Green.</P>
      <P>I do not share the Deputy's view as to the effects which the housing of the branch in a historic building or one of architectural merit would have but in any event the determining factor is the availability of suitable premises.</P>

I know what the rent is for the entire building, although it is not in my brief.  I would like to say that the accommodation now being given is 4,300 square feet as against 2,000 square feet which they already have.  It is more than double what they have now.</P>

A scheme of improvements was prepared some considerable time ago but some changes were needed as the building accommodation for single men is no longer required and an office for a female clerk had to be provided. The revised plans and the specifications are now almost ready and I expect it to go to tender in about two weeks.</P>

      <P>On 23rd February, 1972, I told the Deputy in answer to his question that the Blackwater is No. 22 on the priority list of major catchments on which the arterial drainage programme has proceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time also I referred the Deputy to the statement in connection with arterial drainage policy which I <Col N="859" /> made to the Dáil on 17th November, 1971, when introducing the Vote for Public Works and Buildings for 1971-72.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the talking about the drainage of the River Blackwater comes from the Deputy's side of the House rather than from over here.  I have made it quite clear any time I have been asked about it, even working under present policy, that it will be very many years before the Blackwater is reached.  It is No. 22 on the priority list.  The latest survey being undertaken is No. 18 and with the capital moneys being made available I do not know whether we will ever see the Blackwater being drained.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will insist on the establishment of community schools <Col N="864" /> in areas in which parents, existing teaching order and teachers are not in favour of the establishment of such schools even in the light of the numbers attending the existing schools being below 400, in view of the wide range of subjects being taught to honours leaving certificate level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas in which community schools are proposed are for the most part areas in which there are at present two small secondary schools and a small vocational school, some or all of which are in need of replacement.  None of them could possibly by itself provide the range of subject necessary to cater for the interests and ability of all the pupils.  They are all so small that there could be no question of their being able to teach a wide range of subjects to honours leaving certificate level and in fact they are not doing so.  It would be neither educationally nor financially sound to replace these small schools by separate new buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Measures taken since November, 1970&mdash;the date of issue of the Kennedy report&mdash;in the general interest and for the welfare of children in care may be broadly summarised as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  A new school has been opened in Finglas and a further new building to serve as a remand and assessment centre is to be available there in the autumn; the total estimated cost is £560,000.</P>
      <P>(b)  A contract has been placed for the erection of a new school at Oberstown, County Dublin.  It is expected to be ready early in 1973.  The estimated cost is £350,000.  As soon as it becomes available, St. Conleth's Reformatory School, Daingean, will be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  A contract has been placed for a group home building for one of the <Col N="867" /> residential homes (industrial schools) and plans are well advanced for the building of a further number of such group homes.</P>
    <P>(d)  Buildings have been reconstructed and adapted in the case of some residential homes for the purpose of the provision of self-contained apartments for small groups of children.</P>
    <P>(e)  Detached or semi-detached houses have been bought in some suburban areas to provide residential accommodation for small groups of children in a family setting.</P>
    <P>(f)  More favourable pupil-teacher ratios and more flexible staffing arrangements have been introduced for children who do not attend the ordinary primary and post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>(g)  A special one-year's course in child care on an annual basis has been introduced for younger members of the staffs of the residential homes (industrial schools) and special schools (reformatory schools); in-service courses have been introduced for senior members on the staffs of these schools and some members have also attended&mdash;or are attending&mdash;recognised courses abroad.</P>
    <P>(h)  With effect from 1st July, 1972, a grant equivalent to the full statutory grant may be paid from the Vote for Reformatory and Industrial Schools in respect of children of more than 17 years of age who are following a course of education suited to their aptitudes and interests. In this connection children who have the required ability are being encouraged not only to complete a full post-primary course of education but also subsequently to proceed to third-level education.</P>
    <P>(i)  Provision has been made in the Estimate for 1972-3 in the Vote for Reformatory and Industrial Schools for an increase of 20 per cent as from 1st July, 1972, in the current rate of the capitation grant payable to the schools.  The current rate is <Col N="868" /> £8.25 per week and this has operated since the 1st August, 1969.</P>
    <P>(j)  The estimated amount of expenditure from the Vote for reformatory and industrial schools for the period to 31st March, 1973, in respect of capital works&mdash;new buildings, reconstruction, adaptation, purchase of houses <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;in relation to the projects mentioned above is £1 million approximately.  In addition further heavy capital costs were incurred for the same purposes by the authorities of the schools concerned.</P>

      <P>Whichever Vote it will come under it will not be the Vote for Reformatories and Industrial Schools.  I will put a simple question to the Parliamentary Secretary: why is the reformatory school in Daingean closed down?

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware of a statement made by the Bishop of Killaloe, Most Rev. Michael Harty, at the opening of a school complex and reported in the daily press (details supplied) to the effect that he had some reservations about the amount of time spent by pupils travelling to and from school and that he pleaded for a careful assessment of the economic factors that were formulating educational policy; and if a careful <Col N="869" /> assessment of these economic factors is being taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement referred to.  The overriding consideration in formulating educational policy is the welfare of the pupil and, subject to this, economic factors are taken into consideration. School transport services are planned to standards which ensure that the journey to and from school is of such a character as not to tax the physique of the child and prevent him from profiting fully from the instruction and training given at the school.  The position in this respect is a very great improvement on the previous situation when children had to walk or cycle long distances to school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Parliamentary Secretary stress in his reply that there were serious economic considerations? Is it not true that it is the economic considerations that weigh most over all other considerations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>These directives, which were, of course, linked to the Communities' agricultural price proposals for 1972-73, were published in the issue of the Official Journal of the European Communities for 23rd April, 1972, a copy of which was received in my Department some days later.  I understand that arrangements are being made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to have copies of the Journal placed in the Library.</P>
      <P>The draft directives were discussed at meetings with the European Commission on 9th February, 1972, and with representatives of the existing member states on 28th and 29th March, 1972.  The Irish representatives comprised officers of my Department, the Departments of Finance and Lands, and the Irish Mission to the Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> The directives with which my Department are concerned are generally acceptable to us.  Multilateral working parties are, however, to be established to examine problems arising in the pigmeat sector and in the eggs and poultry sector, and there are to be technical contacts between the Commission and the acceding member states to examine the operation of the directives in those states taking into account the fact that the implementing procedures have still to be adopted by the Council.  In addition, the Council are to take some further decisions on agricultural structural matters later in the year.</P>
    <P>I should add that the directive on retirement pensions is a matter for the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

Is he satisfied also that the meeting with the applicant countries on this matter did not take place until 28th March, which was four days after the existing members had come to a final decision?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>With regard to the first part of the question, having had full consultation with the farming organisations I am satisfied that the consultative arrangements that I have got with these organisations at the present time are adequate.  There are frequent consultations with the members of the farming organisations.  I consider this to be both desirable and necessary in present circumstances.  I am also satisfied that the amount of consultation that took place between our officials and the officials of the Community in Brussels are continuous. They go on all the time.  It has to be remembered that when the Six themselves were considering their own arrangements for the coming year this was primarily a matter for themselves. Under the arrangements that exist at the moment for applicant countries, of which we are one, this arrangement was adhered to.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider it desirable that the copies of the actual decision taken should not be available in this country, even to his own Department, until a full month after the decisions have been taken, and then only in the French language? Is the Minister also satisfied that discussions took place between his Department and the farming organisations between 24th March, when the decisions were taken by the Council, and the 28th March when the applicant countries were called in?  Why did discussions not take place on this specific issue in relation to the detailed directives prior to a decision being taken by the Council of Ministers of the existing Six so that some influence could be had on those decisions and we would be not just taking whatever was handed out after the event?</P>

It seems to suggest that during all the continuous negotiations and contacts that are going on, have gone on and will continue to go on between our officials and officials in Brussels each and every item of these consultations should be discussed in particular and in detail with the farming organisations, as and when they occur.  This would further impede the arrival at decisions.  With regard to the availability of the Journal and the fact that it is printed in French, I do not think this is a very serious difficulty at all.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The declarations referred to are unilateral statements made in the course of the entry negotiations by the British and Community delegations respectively.  They are not incorporated in the Treaty of Accession but are only appendices which have no legal effect or binding on member states.</P>
      <P>In the case of the declarations on liquid milk, pigmeat and eggs, the final paragraph of the statement made on behalf of the Community delegation notes with satisfaction that the existing Community regulations concerning these products&mdash;which, of course, Ireland and the other new member states have accepted&mdash;will not have to be amended to take into account the anxieties expressed by the British delegation.</P>
      <P>In the case of the declarations on hill farming, the Community delegation's statement acknowledges that special conditions obtaining in certain areas of the enlarged Community may require action with a view to attempting to resolve the problems raised by these conditions and, in particular, to preserve reasonable incomes for farmers in such areas, but adds that such action must be in conformity with the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and the common agricultural policy.

Is he aware that there appears in the directive in relation to milk marketing to be a recognition of the possible continuance of the monopoly position of the British Milk Marketing Board which could have a detrimental effect on Irish milk product exports to Britain; and is he also aware that, in relation to the hill farming declaration, there is a special recognition accorded to United Kingdom problems in this field without any special recognition being accorded to Irish problems in this field which are equally great?</P>

      <P>I do not accept that contention at all.  The Deputy asked me what the likely reason was for the British authorities seeking the annexe to the final act.  This is a matter for speculation, but it is my opinion that their original intention was to have it incorporated in the Treaty of Accession itself and that this was not accepted, and when the Deputy studies the annexe added at the request of the British authorities to the final act and the commentary of the Community itself, I think he will be assured that in the case of each of the commodities mentioned in the question, any benefits that may accrue to British farming as a result of the representations made by the British Government will apply equally to other member states, including ourselves.</P>

      <P>I have seen the press report to which the Deputy refers.  While I have no direct evidence that the horses concerned were, in fact, exported from this country, it would appear that they form part of a shipment of 31 horses from Dublin to Holyhead on the 19th May. The 31 horses in that consignment were individually inspected by a veterinary inspector of my Department before being permitted to be embarked and were passed as healthy, in good condition and fit to travel.  Shipment was effected strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Horses (Carriage by Sea) Order, 1960, and the horses were examined on landing at Holyhead by a veterinary inspector of the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food before being allowed to continue their journey.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the statutory provisions governing the shipment of horses from this country are adequate to protect the animals from avoidable suffering up to the point of landing. Thereafter responsibility for the welfare of the horses rests, of course, with the authorities of the consignee country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the complex nature of the liver fluke problem, measures against it are aimed at control and reduction of the economic losses caused by it rather than eradication.</P>
      <P>Progress since 1967 is difficult to measure since the weather over the past three seasons has tended to reduce seasonal incidence.</P>
      <P>The main measures taken by my Department in pursuance of the advisory group's recommendations have been:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the provision of fluke diagnostic facilities at a number of district veterinary offices and regional laboratories;</P>
      <P>(2)  the setting up of procedures whereby, under the guidance of the group, the Department veterinary research laboratory, the Meteorological Office and the appropriate branch of the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food cooperate in producing an annual fluke-weather forecast which is widely publicised.  This is accompanied by advice as to the correct times for dosing and management of stock to reduce fluke losses;</P>
      <P>(3)  trials with molluscicides aimed at determining the optimum timing and application rates to destroy the mud snail which is an essential link in the life cycle of the fluke;</P>
      <P>(4)  trials to determine the efficacy of fluke drugs&mdash;new drugs being tested as they become available.</P>
      <P>(5)  trials to determine the effects of fluke infestation in beef cattle in the first two years of life.  The Agricultural Institute and the universities have been co-operating in these.</P>
      <P>The work of the advisory group is a continuing process of reviewing the current situation in regard to liver fluke and recommending short term control measures and basic programmes of investigation.

      <P>The price paid by my Department for a reactor, under <Col N="888" /> the Brucellosis Eradication Scheme as well as under the TB Eradication Scheme, is the price that might reasonably be obtained for the animal from a purchaser in the open market who has no special knowledge that the animal is diseased.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst the increase is welcome, it ignores the realistic cost of replacement.  I would submit that in this particular sector the cost of replacement is, in fact, the market value of the beast being removed.  While the step taken by the Minister is a move in the right direction towards compensating the farmer for his capital loss, the serious loss of income, particularly for a man in the dairy business, is not taken into account at all. If a farmer loses his cows there is an inevitable loss of income, very often for a considerable period, and this reduction in income can beggar a farmer. I suggest that the matter is now urgent.</P>

      <P>I said in my reply that from the information I had it will be some time before the factory goes into production.  My attention was recently drawn to a statement made by one of the leading spokesmen of Midleton Worsted&mdash;the statement was reported in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>&mdash; that there was a shortage of labour in Midleton, that he had tried to get workers there and had failed.  I thought this rather remarkable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cott</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement was quite incorrect and this was admitted by the managing director of the factory.  In fact, none of the employment agencies in Midleton knew anything about the shortage of labour in that particular factory.  Well over 100 people have now been interviewed and I understand this man has still not got the quota he requires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce in order to expedite the processing of worthwhile patent applications, if he will introduce legislation to enable patent applications which have not been verified to be exposed under appropriate protection if 18 months elapse from the day they were first submitted to the Patent Office; if he will have a thorough examination made of practices in patent offices abroad with a view to incorporating into the Irish patent systems any reforms which have substantially reduced the backlog of patent applications in other countries; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that what the Deputy is asking is to have the patent law amended so as (a) to give, at the end of 18 months from the priority date of an application for a patent, some kind of provisional protection to an invention in respect of which a complete specification has been filed and, (b), to provide for a system of deferred examination such as has been introduced in other countries in the hope of reducing the backlog of patent applications.</P>
      <P>Under our law it is already the practice of the Patent Office to publish complete specifications 18 months from the priority date of an application for a patent but no rights are attached to this publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to deferred examination, my information is that it has certain disadvantages and is not universally <Col N="894" /> accepted as a useful reform.  For instance a Committee on Patent Law who have recently reported in Britain have recommended against it.  It will, however, be fully considered by me in connection with a re-examination of our patent law that will be necessary when the final form of the European Patent Conventions is known.  At that stage I will also consider the possibility of attaching certain limited rights to publication 18 months after the priority date.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the patent laws and practices of other countries are kept under review by the Patent Office with a view to the introduction into our law and practice of any change which would improve the system.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the present position of the draft convention for a European Economic Community patent; what effect its adoption will have on the Irish patent system and on the business of Irish patent agents; what negotiations have taken place between this country and the Community in connection with the matter; whether efforts have been made to locate the European Patent Office in Ireland; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>A second preliminary draft of the Convention for the European Patent for the Common Market was discussed with non-Governmental international organisations by the working party of experts on Community patents at a meeting in Brussels from 2nd to 5th May, 1972, at which this country was represented.  It is expected that further meetings of the working party will be held and that a conference to finalise the Convention will be held late next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present text of the Convention contains an article providing that the Convention shall be without prejudice to the rights of the contracting states to maintain their national laws concerning patents concurrently with the laws on Community patents.  The Convention is still being negotiated and it is not possible at this stage to forecast what effect <Col N="895" /> its adoption will have on the Irish patents system or on the business of Irish patent agents.</P>
    <P>The first occasion at which this country was represented at any meeting in connection with this Convention was the Brussels meeting of May.</P>
    <P>As to the location of the European Patent Office I should perhaps explain to the Deputy that this office will be an office which will grant European patents and not merely Community patents, and that European countries other than EEC countries would take part in its organisation.  No efforts have been made to locate the European Patent Office in Ireland, because it is felt that the desirable conditions of library and research facilities, communications and staffing could not be satisfied in this country, apart from the fact that a very considerable financial investment by the Government would be necessary to make location in Ireland, as compared with location in other countries, attractive.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite correct.  He could, if he wished grant not prospecting licences but mining rights and fix the royalties at the present stage.

      <P>Before the recent riot, a total of 851 cells was available for the accommodation of male prisoners in the prisons at Mountjoy, Portlaoise, Limerick and Cork.  Allowing for the fact that some were designed as multiple cells, nearly 900 prisoners could be accommodated in them without any suggestion of over-crowding. As a result of the riot, the number of usable cells has been reduced <Col N="905" /> to 669, that is to say 76 per cent of the former figure.  This accommodation is being fully used and in fact there is urgent need for more.</P>
      <P>I should perhaps mention that, while the total number of cells available in the various prisons is the only specific figure that can be provided in relation to prison capacity, it is not a complete indication of the number of prisoners who can be satisfactorily accommodated at any particular time. This is also influenced by the need to segregate unconvicted from convicted prisoners, the need for ancillary services such as catering, sanitation and recreational facilities and, of course, the requirements of safe custody.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether a person (name supplied) in County Dublin with over 35 years service in the Army has had his pension to the amount of £913.93 withheld because he is overholding in married quarters; if so, what assistance the Army authorities have given to provide him with alternative housing; and what arrangements can be made so that this man will be paid the pension which is due to him following his prolonged service.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the provision of houses for ex-military personnel is a matter for the local authorities concerned who are generally co-operative in this regard.  Soldiers who are about to be released from the Permanent Defence Force are advised by the military authorities to apply to the local authorities concerned for rehousing.  Following the making of each such application, my Department requests the local authority to give favourable consideration to each individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the third part of the question, Defence Force Regulations provide for the recovery, as a public debt, of charges in respect of the use of quarters, furniture, water, gas and/ or electricity by former members of the Permanent Defence Force.  While unauthorised possession of quarters is <Col N="909" /> continued, it is not possible to finalise those charges.  The Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme provides for the recovery of such charges from pension and for the withholding of pension until the amount of deduction is ascertained.</P>

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not think it a little unusual, even if these regulations have been in force for some time, that a man who served for over 35 years in the Irish Army should have £913.93 withheld from him because he is overholding through no fault of his own, due to a housing crisis situation? There is a housing shortage all over Dublin.  It is not this man's fault. Surely the Parliamentary Secretary could make an arrangement by which this man could be forwarded some of the money?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This man left the Army on 29th December, 1965, and he has been overholding since that date.  The Army did, in fact, pay him a certain amount of money arising out of the predicament in which he found himself.  They have been more than fair to him.  The Army have been making every effort to have him rehoused.  There is a friendly relationship between the Army and the local authority and I think in this case it may work out to the betterment of his situation.</P>

      <P>This offer was made to the council in view of the proposed sale to them of the State's interest in portion of the State lands attached to the barracks and because a major portion of the lands being sold are separate from the remainder of the sale area and adjoin the roadway in question.</P>
      <P>The council replied on 14th April, 1972, stating that, before the county engineer would be prepared to recommend to the council that the road be taken over and maintained as a public road, my Department would be required to contribute the sum of £1,000 to the council for the carrying out of repairs to bring the road up to the standard required by them.</P>

      <P>Generally I have no reason to believe that the arrangements made for the casting of votes at the referendum were other than satisfactory or that presiding officers and poll clerks were not adequately instructed in their duties.  In the few cases where problems came to notice the matter was taken up with the local returning officer immediately.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in the Sisters of Charity school at Armagh Road the main large hall which has a wide entrance was not made available? Two small rooms were made available for that enormous polling area with the result that only one person at a time could enter or leave the room. The place became congested late in the evening.  The main hall was redecorated but would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that this should not have prevented it being used for polling purposes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there may have been hitches.  The Department have given instruction to presiding officers that where difficulties for old people and others exist the most suitable location should be chosen for polling booths.  It is not always easy to get the best locations.  I will have the case referred to by the Deputy investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it happened in other constituencies but certainly in Dublin South-Central a number of halls were always used for polling.  On this occasion people who lived in the Kimmage area had to go a long distance to poll at the Presentation School at Terenure.  Formerly there were halls available for them.  I presume this was done in the interests of economy because I understand that national schools are free whereas payment must be made for other halls.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make inquiries into these matters.</P>

I did not make a fuss about it at the time.  I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary would not approve of this?</P>

      <P>Recently I approved proposals by Dublin Corporation to reconstruct two blocks of flats at Hollyfield Buildings, at present comprising 30 one-roomed flats, into 24 fully serviced two- and three-bedroomed flats, at an estimated cost of about £48,000.  I understand that the corporation have experienced difficulties in implementing these proposals and are reviewing the position generally.

      <P>I understand from the National Building Agency that it was necessary for them to terminate two successive contracts for these two houses.  After repeated advertisements for tenders, they succeeded in arranging a further contract with another builder.  There was some further delay because this builder had other work on hands but the agency are pressing the contractor to start work on the houses as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>No such qualification is defined in the Housing Authorities (Loan Charges Contributions and Management) Regulations, 1967.  Section 98 of the Housing Act, 1966, however, enables a housing authority to refuse consent to the sale of a vested cottage if they are satisfied that it is not being purchased for a person who is in need of housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will accede to requests by some local authorities, including Tralee Urban District Council, to be allowed to discount overtime in assessing rents for their housing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic principle underlying the differential renting system is to relate each tenant's rent to his ability to pay and to the standard of the accommodation he occupies.</P>
      <P>The system enables families with low incomes to be given accommodation at rents they can afford but which are far below the cost of providing and maintaining their accommodation.  The differential renting system can only be operated with the aid of a very large State and rate subsidy which last year amounted to more than £11 million while incomes from rents totalled about £7 million.  The exclusion of overtime earnings would cut across the basic principle of relating rent to ability to pay and giving the highest subsidy to those most in need of it.  It would also create anomalies between persons on fixed incomes and those whose earnings have a large overtime element in them, which would clearly be inequitable.  If overtime were not taken into account when fixing rents, persons with higher incomes would gain substantially&mdash;in some cases by a rent reduction of up to 50 per cent &mdash;while other tenants on lower incomes would not only not benefit but would have to meet part of the cost of the concession through the payment of increased rates.  I accept, however, that overtime could involve a tenant in some extra expense and for that reason proposals from local authorities to disregard a portion of overtime, generally not exceeding one-fifth, in assessing rent under a differential rent scheme have been approved.</P>

      <P>At the 30th May, 1972, some tenants of six of the 115 local housing authorities were withholding rents.</P>
      <P>In the case of five of these authorities, some rents are being withheld mainly in support of a claim that rents under differential rent schemes should be assessed on basic income only to the exclusion of overtime and bonus payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of two of the six authorities, some tenants are withholding rents because of small increases in the rents of low-rented dwelling imposed <Col N="927" /> by the local authorities concerned to meet part of the rising costs of repairs and maintenance.</P>
    <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to Question No. 124 on 2nd December, 1971, the management and control of houses in their estates is, subject to the Housing Acts and Regulations, vested in the local authorities. It is with these authorities, therefore, that the tenants must reach agreement within the framework of the existing law on any issue relating to the rents of the houses since it is the local authorities who would have to raise the money through increased rates or adjustment of other rents for any concessions they grant.  I might add that following discussions between representatives of the local authorities and the tenants, rents disputes in six other areas were resolved in the last few months.  I understand that every reasonable effort is being made at local level to resolve the existing disputes.</P>
    <P>The other information requested by the Deputy, in so far as it is available in the Department, is set out in a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>

    <P>*Ther are two disputes in Dublin city.  The first dispute is confined to part of one housing estate and is against the assessment of overtime and bonus payments under differential rent schemes: the second dispute is in opposition to an increase of 4p per room per week effective from the 24th April, 1972, in the rent of certain low rented dwellings.  Information as to the amount due to the corporation in the latter dispute is not available in the Department.</P>

      <P>The bodies which come under the aegis of my Department receive support in the form of grant from my Department and apart from short-term bank loans (overdrafts) the question of borrowing does not arise.  The only exception is the Board for the Employment of the Blind, responsibility for which was transferred to my Department in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 83/72.  Particulars of the amount borrowed by the board were given by the Minister for Social Welfare to the Deputy in reply to a previous similar question on 20th May, 1969.  The amount of loan outstanding on the latest date up to which information is available, viz. 31st December, 1971, was £47,000.</P>

      <P>Bord na Móna, in accordance with the provisions of the Turf Development Act, 1953 submitted to me a draft scheme to amend the Bord na Móna regular works employees superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>The improved benefits proposed in the amending scheme had been agreed between Bord na Móna and the trade unions and I agreed to their implementation with effect from 4th June, 1970.  Subsequently, the trade unions sought a number of further improvements to the draft scheme and these are still under discussion between all the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>Following are the details of the draft amending superannuation scheme as submitted to me by Bord na Móna:</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>Draft Scheme</i>
      </P>
      <P>Bord na Móna in exercise of the powers conferred on it by section 6 of the Turf Development Act, 1953 (No. 19 of 1953) hereby make the following scheme:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  (1) This scheme may be cited as the Turf Development Act, 1953 (Regular Works Employees) Superannuation <Col N="938" /> (Amendment) (No. 2) Scheme, 1970;</P>
    <P>(2) The Turf Development Act, 1953 (Regular Works Employees) Superannuation Scheme, 1963, is hereby amended as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Definitions</i>
    </P>
    <P>2.  Existing definitions numbered (10), (14), (20) and (23) shall be deleted and substituted by the following:</P>
    <P>(10) &ldquo;Contribution year&rdquo; means the period covered by the board's accounting year and shall be effective from the 27th March, 1969.</P>
    <P>(14) &ldquo;Failure of Health&rdquo; means such a failure of health, mental, or physical as in the opinion of the Board acting on the advice of a medical practitioner nominated by the Board in that behalf permanently incapacitates a member from doing his ordinary work in the service of the Board, provided that where the Committee so requires, the failure of health shall be determined by a medical referee, agreed upon between the Board and the Committee in each case.</P>
    <P>(20) &ldquo;Pension&rdquo; means the annual pension computed as shown in paragraph (1) of Regulation 24 of these regulations.</P>
    <P>(23) &ldquo;Contribution wages&rdquo; means the yearly remuneration of a member by reference to which the contributions under the Scheme are computed in accordance with the Regulations.</P>
    <P>New definitions numbered (39) and (40) shall be inserted and shall read as follows:</P>
    <P>(39) (a) &ldquo;Retiring wage&rdquo; will be taken as the actual earnings received by a member in his last year of service, or the average of his earnings in the last three years, if better, subject to a maximum of the yearly equivalent of his basic wage rate (or general time rate, if appropriate) increased by 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>(b) The wage by reference to which any pension awarded to a member is calculated under this Scheme shall be the member's retiring <Col N="939" /> wage less twice the annual equivalent of the old age (contributory) pension payable in respect of a single man at the date of the member's retirement.</P>
    <P>(40) A member to whom Regulation 18 (4) applies shall be known as an insured member.  Reference in the regulations to a member shall include reference to an insured member save where otherwise indicated by the context.</P>
    <P>1.  <i>Superannuation Fund</i></P>
    <P>Regulation 6 shall be amended by adding the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or (c) such other investments as may for the time being be authorised by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Membership</i></P>
    <P>Regulation 18 shall be amended by adding the following paragraphs:</P>
    <P>(18) (1) (d) Notwithstanding the terms of paragraphs (1) (a), (b) and (c) it is provided that a person transferring to the service of the Board in accordance with Section 4 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963 may join the scheme on the date on which he takes up duty.</P>
    <P>(18) (4) In the case of a member who is compulsorily insured under the Social Welfare Acts for benefits including contributory Old Age Pension at the time of entry to the scheme or at any time thereafter continuation of membership of the scheme is conditional on his becoming a voluntary contributor under the Social Welfare Acts, if eligible, should he cease to be compulsorily insured under those Acts.</P>
    <P>(18) (5) Every entrant to the scheme will be required to authorise the Board to make such arrangements as the Board may require to ensure payment of the appropriate voluntary contribution under the Social Welfare Acts, including any contribution payable after retirement on age or ill-health with a pension under this scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> 3.  <i>Contributions</i></P>

The contributions of members shall be deducted at source by the Board from the remuneration of the members and the amount so deducted shall be paid forthwith into the Fund.</P>
    <P>Existing Regulations 22 (6), (7), (8) and (9) shall be renumbered 22 (5), (6), (7) and (8).</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;pensionable wages&rdquo; in Regulations 22 (1), (2), (5) and (6) shall be deleted and substituted by the term &ldquo;contribution wages&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Reckoning of Service</i></P>
    <P>Regulation 23 shall be amended by adding the following paragraphs:</P>
    <P>23 (1) (d) Fractions of a year will be disregarded for the purpose of computing benefits, but a member may remain in membership beyond the normal retiring age of 65 years for a period of not more than three calendar months if his services are retained by the Board, and if by so remaining an additional year's pensionable service may be completed.</P>
    <P>23 (3) (a) Service with the Board shall be deemed to include such amount of service as may be reckonable for the purposes of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 (No. 10 of 1956).</P>
    <P>(b) Where a Superannuation award under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, is made by a local authority to any person and in determining the amount of such award, any period of pensionable service with the Board has been reckoned, the Committee of the Superannuation Scheme shall arrange to make an appropriate refund to the local authority under Section 57 (1) of that Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> 5.  <i>Pension Benefits</i></P>

    <P>(2) A member who retires on account of failure of health and who has completed less than ten years service, shall receive in lieu of an annuity a gratuity equal to 1/12th (one twelfth) of his retiring wage for each year of pensionable service.</P>
    <P>(3) (a) The Committee may at its discretion pay a supplementary pension to an insured member who at the date of his retirement,</P>
    <P>(i) was compulsorily insured under the Social Welfare Acts for benefits including contributory Old Age Pension, or</P>
    <P>(ii) was a voluntary contributor under the Social Welfare Acts for benefits including Old Age Pension</P>
    <P>(b) The sum of the supplementary pension and the Social Welfare Benefit or pension (single rate) payable to such insured member shall when added together not exceed the amount of the old age contributory pension (single rate).</P>

Provided, however, that the whole or part of the value of the benefit payable under this regulation shall, where necessary, be <Col N="943" /> given by way of non-commutable and non-assignable pension or annuity for any dependent relative of the member so as to secure that the aggregate value of all benefits given otherwise than by way of such pension or annuity as aforesaid on the death of the member, under all retirement benefits schemes subsisting in connection with the Board shall not exceed whichever is the greatest of the following:</P>

    <P>A pension payable under paragraph (a) (ii) of this Regulation shall <Col N="945" /> be payable during the lifetime of the pensioner to the date of his death provided that in the event of the pensioner dying within five years of the date on which payment of the pension commences payment of his pension to his dependants shall continue to be made until the completion of the balance of the five years from the said date of commencement of pension.

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)Of 4 holdings offered to the Land Commission during 1970, 2 were not accepted. Of 2 offered during 1971, neither was accepted.  The determination of lands to be purchased is reserved exclusively to the Commissioners and decisions must necessarily be governed by the particular circumstances of individual cases.  Generally it can be said that where properties which are offered for sale to the Land Commission are not accepted the main reason is that they are not considered suitable for land settlement purposes.</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)During the year 1970 the Land Commission had inspections made and reports obtained in respect of 6 holdings comprising 185 acres; during 1971 they had inspections made and reports obtained in respect of 7 properties, aggre, ating 218 acres.  Possession of 10 properties, aggregating 319 acres, and 5 properties aggregating 131 acres, passed to the Land Commission in 1970 and 1971 respectivelgy.</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)Regarding the field staff in Co. Longford, the Deputy is referred to reply to Question No. 29 on 4th of this month, Vol. 260 (No. 11), Col. 1709.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 7th June, 1972.</P>
