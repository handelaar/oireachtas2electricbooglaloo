      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) </NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is concerned mainly with the extension of the existing social insurance and social assistance schemes to implement the proposals in the budget for improvements in those schemes and consequential matters. The Bill also contains a provision relating to social insurance for the Garda Síochána, and other provisions designed to further improve the social insurance system.  The explanatory <Col N="169" /> memorandum circulated with the Bill is aimed at clarifying the provisions of the Bill, which, because of its technical nature, and the fact that it includes many amendments of existing legislation, tends to be difficult to understand in places.  I trust that the memorandum will assist Deputies in their examination of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The budget increases in the field of social assistance will give an extra 50 pence a week to non-contributory old age and blind pensioners making the maximum personal rate £5.15 a week. To meet the special needs of the very aged a further 50 pence a week is being provided this year for pensioners aged 80 or over, which will bring their maximum personal rate to £5.65 a week.  The increased maximum rates of pension will enable the scale of means and rates of pension to be extended so as to give an additional rate at the bottom of the scale which will be payable to some persons whose means are outside the present limits for pension.  The amounts paid to non-contributory old age pensioners in respect of qualified children are being increased by 40 pence for each of the first two children and 25 pence for each additional child.</P>
    <P>Widows' non-contributory pensions and deserted wife's allowances will also be increased by 50 pence a week thus bringing the maximum personal rate to £5.15 a week.  The amount paid to widows and deserted wives for qualified children will be increased by 45 pence a week for each child.</P>
    <P>As in the case of old age pensions, the scale of means and rates of pension will be extended to give an additional rate at the bottom of the scale which will be payable to some widows and deserted wives whose means at present exclude them from receiving pensions. Orphans' non-contributory pensions will be increased by 50 pence a week to £3 at the maximum.  The improved payments for orphans and for dependent children of widows and deserted wives will continue the upward trend in the special provision being made in recent years for those having the care of children.  The maximum rate payable to a widow with a non-contributory pension or a deserted wife with two qualified children will go up from <Col N="170" /> £6.45 a week to £7.85 a week; from £8.25 a week to £10.55 a week where there are four children, and from £10.05 a week to £13.25 a week where there are six children.  I have also found it possible this year to make a further improvement in the scheme of allowances for deserted wives.  Experience of the scheme in operation has shown that the age limit of 50 which applies at present to those who have no dependent children has operated harshly, particularly in the case of persons in the 40 to 50 age group who have difficulty in finding employment. To meet this situation the minimum age limit for deserted wives without dependent children is being lowered to 40 years.</P>
    <P>The rates of unemployment assistance for persons in urban and rural areas are being increased by 40 pence a week for the recipient and by a further 30 pence a week where there is an adult dependant.  The maximum rate will then be £4.35 for a single person and £7.75 for a married couple resident in an urban area.  Outside urban areas the corresponding rates will be £4.05 and £7.35.  Where there are dependent children, the rates payable in respect of each of the first two qualified children are being increased by 40 pence a week and in respect of each other qualified child by 25 pence a week.  These increases in unemployment assistance will have the effect of automatically extending the means limit for qualification for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>All of the increases and improvements in relation to social assistance will operate from the beginning of August next.</P>
    <P>The increases in rates of social insurance benefits and pensions announced in the budget will come into operation at the beginning of October next.  These will provide an extra 70 pence a week on the maximum personal rates of old age (contributory) pension and an extra 60 pence a week on the maximum personal rates of widow's (contributory) pension, disability and unemployment benefit, invalidity pension and maternity allowance.  The maximum personal rate of retirement pensions is being specially increased by £1.25 a week to bring retirement <Col N="171" /> pensions up to the level of old age (contributory) pensions.  Persons aged 80 or over receiving retirement pension or old age or widow's (contributory) pension will get a further 50 pence a week on their personal rates.  There will also be additional payments for dependants.  An extra 30 pence a week will be paid for an adult dependant in the case of old age (contributory) pension, invalidity pension, disability or unemployment benefit.  In the case of retirement pensions, the increase for an adult dependant will be 70 pence a week to bring the level of payment up to that of old age (contributory) pension.  For qualified children there are increases of 45 pence a week in respect of each of the first two and 35 pence a week in respect of each other qualified child for recipients of old age (contributory), retirement and invalidity pensions and disability and unemployment benefits.  Recipients of widows' (contributory) pensions will get increases of 50 pence a week per child in the amounts paid to them in respect of qualified children.  Orphans' (contributory) allowances will be increased by 50 pence a week.</P>
    <P>Finally the rate of death grant payable in respect of an adult will be increased from £25.00 to £35.00 and there will be proportionate increases in respect of children.</P>
    <P>These increases will make very substantial improvements in the payments under the various schemes.  From October next under the old age (contributory) pension and retirement pension schemes, a single pensioner will get a maximum of £6.20 a week, or £6.70 a week if he is aged 80 or over, while a married couple will get £10.35, or £10.85 if the pensioner is aged 80 or over.  A widow without children will get £5.60 a week by way of widow's (contributory) pension at the maximum and £6.10 a week if she is aged 80 or over. The maximum personal rates of unemployment and disability benefit, and invalidity pension will then be £5.55 a week and, where there is an adult dependant, the rate will be £9.30 a week.  The increased payments for qualified children will greatly improve the position of beneficiaries who have <Col N="172" /> dependent children, particularly in the case of widows.  For instance, a widow in receipt of a contributory pension and who has two children will get £8.60 a week instead of £7.00; a widow with four children, £11.60 a week instead of £9.00 and a widow with six children, £14.60 a week instead of £11.00.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, these increases in rates of social insurance benefits and pensions will come into operation from the beginning of October next, but certain rates of unemployment benefit which are payable where unemployment continues after 156 days and which are the same as the maximum rates of unemployment assistance payable in urban areas are being increased from the beginning of August next when the assistance rates go up.</P>
    <P>These increases in rates of payment and other improvements in the social insurance system are estimated to cost some £13,595,000 in a full year.  The social insurance system is based on the principle that the cost is met out of the Social Insurance Fund to which employers, insured persons and the Exchequer contribute in approximately equal shares.  For a number of years the Exchequer was required to meet considerably more than one-third of the cost of the system and steps were taken in recent years to bring the Exchequer's share of the overall cost down to that level.  However, in the last year the Exchequer's contribution to the Social Insurance Fund has again risen well above the one-third mark and the cost of the improvements now proposed would increase that proportion.  Consequently, in order to meet the cost of these improvements and ensure that the Exchequer is not required to bear an excessive proportion of the cost of the social insurance system, it is necessary that the rates of social insurance contributions should be increased substantially from the beginning of October next.  The increase proposed in the ordinary rates of social insurance contributions is 40 pence a week. Lesser increases are being applied where some only of the benefits concerned are covered.  The increase of 40 pence in the ordinary rate of men's contribution will be shared by the <Col N="173" /> employer paying 22 pence and the employee 18 pence and the total social insurance contribution will then be £2.12 a week of which £1.09 will be borne by the employer and £1.03 by the employee.  The increase in the rate of voluntary contribution covering widows' (contributory) pensions only will be 7 pence making it 44 pence and the increase in the contribution which covers old age and widows' (contributory) pensions, retirement pension and death grant will be 17 pence making it £1.08.</P>
    <P>A table showing the present and proposed rates of contribution appears in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increases in contributions it is scarcely necessary for me to say that real improvements in social welfare invariably cost money and substantial improvements in the social insurance system must involve substantial increases in the contributions payable by employers and insured persons if the basis of the system as a contributory one providing benefits free of means tests is to be preserved.  While, therefore, it may seem that the proposed contributions for ordinary insured persons are heavy, it should be borne in mind that the contributions for purely social insurance from October next for the ordinary male worker will be £1.03 which represents 4.74 per cent of the average weekly pay of industrial workers in December last, £21.70, while the overall contribution payable by him for social insurance, redundancy and health services, £1.21, would be 5.57 per cent of that pay. These percentages are not excessive when compared with the position in other countries.  For example, in Britain, at the same pay level, an insured man would be paying £1.26 or 5.8 per cent of his earnings in contributions for purely national insurance and £1.47 or 6.77 per cent in the overall covering health and industrial injuries. In the member countries of the European Economic Community, the latest figures available show that for insurance in respect of pensions and sickness and unemployment benefit, the insured worker was paying 6.58 per cent of his earnings in France, 7.05 <Col N="174" /> per cent in Italy, 11 per cent in Luxembourg, 11.05 per cent in Belgium, 13.15 per cent in Germany and 17.95 per cent in the Netherlands.  It must be remembered that the employer also is required to contribute heavily towards the cost of these benefits on the basis of the worker's earnings&mdash; 18.32 per cent in France; 30.66 per cent in Italy; 9 per cent in Luxembourg; 14 per cent in Belgium; 13.15 per cent in Germany and 15 per cent in the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the increases and improvements in the general social insurance system provided for in the Bill, it is proposed also to improve the benefits payable under the occupational injuries scheme.  The increases proposed are 60 pence in the rates of the main weekly paid benefits and allowances with proportionate increases in other payments.  All benefits under this scheme are met out of the occupational injuries fund which is financed by contributions paid by employers only which it is not proposed to increase on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I will also be putting before the House the Redundancy Contributions (Variation of Rates) Order, 1972, which will provide for the weekly redundancy contributions for men to be increased by 3 pence to 8 pence and for women by 2 pence to 6 pence. These contributions are collected by way of the social insurance stamp for those classes of employees to be covered for redundancy purposes and are additional to the rates of social insurance contribution I have mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The schemes under which allowances or increases of pensions both contributory and non-contributory are payable in respect of certain prescribed female relatives who give full-time care and attention to incapacitated persons aged 70 and over are being extended from October next to cover such male relatives as will be prescribed and will also be payable with invalidity pensions and retirement pensions.  This is being done because cases have come to light in which it has been shown that the necessary care and attention is being provided on a full-time basis by male relatives and there would, <Col N="175" /> accordingly, be a certain inequity in confining the scheme to female relatives only.  In addition the rates of payment are being increased in all cases from £2.75 to £3.00, the increased rate being payable from August in the case of payments on the social assistance side and from October where the payment is on the social insurance side.</P>
    <P>Apart from dealing with the budget proposals and matters consequential on those proposals the Bill proposes to implement the recommendation contained in the Report of the Commission on Garda Pay and Conditions to the effect that gardaí should be brought within the scope of the social insurance system.  Employment as member of the Garda Síochána will, from a date to be appointed by order, become insurable and regulations will enable me to modify the Acts in relation to gardaí in the same way as is done for established civil servants who are insurable only for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes.  The garda will also be excluded from occupational injuries coverage as the employment involves risks above and beyond those normally encountered in employment which is covered for such purposes and, in any event, the force have their own scheme of compensation for injuries received in the course of duty.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in the Bill to deal with a number of matters which have given rise to problems in relation to the operation of the social insurance system.</P>
    <P>The first, which has caused distress from time to time, is the failure of some social welfare beneficiaries to make any provision for their families. This may be due to any of a number of reasons but where it happens, it is the family which suffers and hitherto the Department have been almost powerless to remedy the situation. In connection with the old age contributory pension scheme, however, power was taken in 1963 to enable that portion of the pension payable in respect of a dependant to be paid directly to the dependant or to some other person on her behalf where the circumstances of the case seemed to warrant such action.  This provision has <Col N="176" /> proved to be beneficial in operation and it is proposed in the Bill to provide similar powers in relation to other social insurance benefits and occupational injuries payments where dependants are paid for.  It will be possible to extend those powers to the social assistance schemes by regulation.</P>
    <P>The second matter relates to the recovery of arrears of social insurance contributions where an employer goes bankrupt.</P>
    <P>Health contributions and redundancy contributions are, by virtue of the Health Contributions Act, 1971, and the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, respectively, deemed to be social insurance contributions.  These Acts also give to redundancy and health contributions a period of 12 months priority in the disposal of the assets of a bankrupt or an arranging debtor. Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, however, a period of only four months priority is accorded to social insurance contributions in similar circumstances. The Bill proposes to remove this anomaly by amending the Social Welfare Act, 1952, so as to give social insurance contributions the 12-month period of priority which applies to redundancy and health contributions.</P>
    <P>A further matter concerns the contribution conditions for receipt of maternity allowance which is payable on a woman's insurance only.  At present, eligibility for the allowance depends on the woman's insurance record in the last contribution year before the commencement of the sixth week prior to the expected confinement. This has been found to cause difficulty where a claim is made just after the end of a woman's contribution year because until the relevant insurance card has been surrendered to the Department, the claim cannot be decided.  In the case of maternity grant, this difficulty does not arise as eligibility may as an alternative be determined on the insurance record in the previous contribution year and the Bill proposes that a similar alternative should operate in the case of maternity allowances.</P>
    <P>The final matter relates to the position which will arise in August next, when non-contributory pensions are <Col N="177" /> increased, where for the period up to the end of September next, when contributory pensions are increased, there will be cases where the non-contributory pension to which a pensioner might be entitled would be temporarily more favourable than the corresponding contributory pension which he holds.  It was never the intention that the option which was given to contributory pensioners by the 1966 Act to switch to non-contributory pensions where it would be to their advantage, should operate for very short periods and there is provision in this Bill, as in previous years Bills, to prevent such switching where the advantage would only be temporary.  The right of pensioners to switch where the advantage would be permanent will remain.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I will summarise the cost of the various proposals in the Bill.  On the social assistance side there is £3,884,000 for old age and blind pensions, £610,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions, £165,000 for deserted wife's allowances and £2,751,000 for unemployment assistance, the total cost being £7,410,000 in a full year, all of which will fall on the Exchequer. The gross cost of improvements on the social insurance side will be £13,595,000 in a full year, of which the increases in contribution rates will provide some £10,424,000.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in recommending this Bill to Dáil Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed </NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomed the increases announced in the budget and I should like to repeat what my party said on that occasion, namely, that any benefits that are given to social welfare recipients will be welcomed by us. However the benefits announced in the Minister's speech, which are increases to social welfare recipients across the board, are too little and have been given far too late.  Even since the introduction of the budget the cost of living has continued to outstrip any increases given to these unfortunate people.  Before dealing with the Minister's speech I should like to draw another matter to his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This concerns representations made by Deputies and public representatives <Col N="178" /> to the Department of Social Welfare. Public representatives come into contact with social welfare recipients every day and they know that many of them are destitute.  I would draw the attention of the Minister to the flimsy acknowledgment that is sent by the Department of Social Welfare in response to such representations.  There should be a better effort made with regard to the acknowledgment of these representations.  Deputies would like to get an acknowledgment which might be sent to the people concerned which would assure them that representations had been made on their behalf and that their case was being considered. They should not be given the impression that they are ignored by Deputies and public representatives.  The flimsy acknowledgment sent by the Department could not be sent to the people concerned.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the long delay that occurs in dealing with cases which have been submitted to the Department for decision.  I wonder if there is any way in which the Minister could speed up this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle </NameTxt>
      <P>That matter would be appropriate to the Estimate. It is not relevant on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed </NameTxt>
      <P>This is an urgent matter. The delay that occurs creates hardship for many people.  Although we welcome the increases that have been given, while such benefits depend on taxation it will be difficult to give to these people a sufficient income that will enable them to attain a decent standard of living.  For that reason it is necessary to examine some of those cases.  There is an increase in the non-contributory pensions for widows but if one takes the case of a widow with two dependent children the amount she will receive now is £7.85 per week.  Surely the Government must realise that it is not possible today for anyone to provide 21 meals each week for three people on that amount.  Were it not for voluntary organisations such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, many of those people would be destitute.  I might add that <Col N="179" /> this House should give recognition to the amount of work being done by voluntary organisations such as the one I mentioned.  These societies are necessary so long as people in receipt of social welfare benefits are not being given enough to enable them to provide for themselves the necessities of life.</P>
      <P>In respect of the whole sphere of social welfare payments it is necessary to have a comprehensive scheme based on insurance but until we have such a scheme we must try to overcome the problem as it is by granting substantial increases to social welfare recipients. We must be concerned, particularly, with ensuring that children are looked after.  If we cannot look after them we cannot hope to build the type of country that we would all like to see. Children who are dependent on charitable organisations may grow up to believe they are second-class citizens.  They will have a grudge against society.  There are a number of schemes with which I am concerned particularly.  For instance, there is the free footwear scheme which I consider to be degrading.  Rather than operate this scheme it would be much better to implement the cost of footwear by way of increase in the incomes of social welfare recipients. In that way children would not be subjected to ridicule by other children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our whole attitude towards social welfare seems to be how little rather than how much.  We must get away from this attitude.  Recently there has been much talk of the reunification of this country but if we are serious in this regard we must have a new approach to the question of social welfare benefits.  While the increases being given are welcome it must be remembered that they will not come into effect for another two or three months and that a large percentage of them will be negatived by the uncontrolled increases in the cost of living.  For that reason we must examine the whole sphere of social welfare.  There must be reorganisation so far as the administration of social welfare is concerned. There are many people who are not <Col N="180" /> aware of their entitlements.  It would be very helpful to have information centres where people could ascertain what exactly are their entitlements under social welfare.  There is necessity for a national minimum income in respect of social welfare recipients.  In this respect it would be necessary to determine what should be the level of such minimum income.  Our social welfare schemes are very much outdated. The day has long passed when a man and his wife could live on the amount they are receiving by way of non-contributory old age pensions.  Such people must rely on the help of charitable organisations but this is degrading for them.  Those people are giving a live service to the nation.</P>
    <P>While increases in social welfare payments must be linked with increases in taxation under our present system I do not think the people will object to the imposition of a type of selective tax so long as they know that the revenue is being used to improve the lot of those who depend on social welfare.  The people are generous.  My involvement with a charitable organisation has made me aware of this generosity.  I have found that the people respond magnificently to requests for help because they realise much more than the Minister or the Government realise, how bad is the plight of social welfare recipients.  It ill becomes the Government, who have been in power for so long and who boast of a social conscience, to expect people to live on paltry payments.</P>
    <P>Our whole approach to social welfare has been one of cheeseparing. This was brought to my attention very forcibly recently when a woman who was in receipt of an old age contributary pension and who was living alone found, because she let a room in her house, that her pension was reduced. Such rigid application of the law is not necessary or desirable.  We should be more generous in regard to investigations. The present system of investigation is much too rigid.</P>

      <P>It arises in so far as <Col N="181" /> some of those people are concerned but I shall not continue in this way if the Chair does not wish me to do so. In the 12 months up to February this year the cost of food increased by 11.2 per cent.  We must realise that the greatest proportion of the income of social welfare recipients is spent on food.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister has decided to extend the prescribed relatives' allowance to male relatives and others who are looking after the aged. There is another problem which I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister.  The increase is welcome but it is penny-wise and pound-foolish. The amount that is provided for a relative looking after an aged person is not sufficient inducement to get people to look after the aged.  I have had the experience of meeting people who could not afford to leave jobs in order to come home and look after aged relatives.  As a result, some old people will have to go to institutions or homes of some kind where the cost will be five times the amount that is being paid by way of prescribed relative allowances.</P>
      <P>There are also people in receipt of invalidity pensions.  Neighbours sometimes look after them but they do not qualify for allowances unless the invalid is a relative.  The Minister should examine this point.  There is a great lack of domiciliary services and services available to families at particular centres.  Such services to people in their own homes are desirable.  Such services would help many people.  The aged should not be taken to county homes or institutions, but should be looked after at home as far as possible.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increases in this Bill. We hope that the Minister in granting these increases realises that they are not sufficient to keep people in decency in their old age or to solve their difficulties if they are widows or orphans. A better effort must be made to provide a decent standard of living for such people.</P>

      <P>The Labour spokesman, Deputy O'Connell, has been called away on urgent business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is now a hardy annual.  It <Col N="182" /> is discussed once a year after the budget when the Minister tells us how kind and considerate Fianna Fáil are in regard to those who have to exist, or partly exist, on social welfare benefits. In former years I have said that if any system requires restructuring it is the social welfare code which operates in this country.  The allowances granted here average around 50p with a few exceptions, and are insufficient taking into account present day money values and the steadily declining value of money.  Such increases are indeed exceptionally meagre particularly when we look around us and see those who, through their qualifications or in some cases through a little luck or patronage, are enjoying big salaries and increases not of pence per week but of hundreds of pounds per year under a system where increases are usually granted on the percentage basis which favours the people with high incomes and is a disadvantage to those on the lower scales.</P>
    <P>A non-contributory old age pensioner with no means at all cannot qualify for more than £5.15 per week. If he owns the house in which he is living he is not eligible for this amount but must make do with £4.90.  If he does not own the house but if he has a few pounds set aside for, perhaps, burial purposes and if that amount exceeds £25 it will cost him £13 annually or 25p per week.  This is a very unfair system.  We cannot take the group known as the &ldquo;contributory pensioners&rdquo; and deal with them as if their position was somewhat similar.  In actual fact there is a great variation. The old man or woman who is living alone or with relatives who are not in very affluent circumstances and who may be partly disabled or suffering from some infirmity is more or less dependent on the £4.90 or £5.15 per week.  It is exceptionally hard for such a person to live on that meagre amount at the present time.  It does not give him much opportunity for enjoying &ldquo;a little drop&rdquo; after Mass on Sunday or an opportunity of having a comfortable smoke occasionally.  Such a man or woman is in a very different position from an old age pensioner who is living with relatives who are reasonably well off and whose pension might be said to be available to him for the <Col N="183" /> little items which I mentioned. A little spending money is most essential. The man who has to live on the money and the man who has help from relatives are entirely different.  The man who has help from relatives is not entirely dependent on the money he gets from the State.</P>
    <P>It is difficult in legislation such as this to overcome this difficulty.  Some years ago I tried to have this position rectified by the Cork Health Authority. I proposed trying to get approval for payment of disabled persons' allowances to old people who are incapacitated. Subsequently, to some extent and to a limited extent, the dependent relative allowance helped in that respect, but the amount of the dependent relative's allowance, £2.75, increased to £3, with the qualification restrictions is not sufficient.  I am sure the Minister knows it is next to impossible to get old people admitted to the many hospitals and homes due to overcrowded conditions.  I understand that the latest figure for the maintenance of an old person in a cottage or district hospital is about £35 or, possibly, closer to £40 weekly, an exceptionally large sum.  The trend is for this figure to increase rapidly and it is supposed to have increased by about 30 per cent in the past 18 months or two years.  It is much better to pay additional allowances, particularly to incapacitated people, in the form of the disabled persons' allowance, which it is quite lawful to pay them if the local health board so decides rather than have them queuing up to gain admission to hospital.</P>
    <P>From my experience and the information I have got in visiting hospitals and institutions, particularly those for old people, I find with few exceptions that most old people prefer to be in their own homes if at all possible.  They want to end their lives within their own community and institutional life is not for them.  I have great sympathy for such people particularly those who are forced into these institutions through financial circumstances.  If some body were established to inquire in depth into such cases and, where circumstances warrant it, supplement their home incomes with a view to <Col N="184" /> having them kept at home rather than transfer them to institutions, it would be much better.</P>
    <P>In saying that I have always asserted and will continue to assert the responsibility of young people to care for their parents and immediate relatives.  Except in exceptional circumstances I do not like the idea of children or adults trying to get the local authorities to care for their parents at the end of their days.  I shall never approve of that. Everybody has an obligation, in so far as it is possible, to try to provide for their parents in their old age and keep them in the home and avoid sending them to hospitals or institutions.</P>
    <P>I know there is difficulty for some in doing this.  In my reasonably varied experience financial circumstances are often responsible and I sympathise with such people.  The meagre £4 or £5 old age pension makes it impossible for a person to get necessary care and attention at home and even with the improvement in the dependent relative allowance and combining the two amounts, the £5 and the £3, to make £8 it is still a small income for two people particularly where the aged person needs constant or near-constant attention.</P>
    <P>I know that money must be found to implement such schemes but I am in favour of providing money for our old people and incapacitated people and those who need care and attention at home.  There is an obligation on us to be more liberal with public funds than we are at present in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Social Welfare and his Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that the allowance under the Social Welfare Acts for the class of persons I have mentioned is not nearly sufficient.  I need scarcely tell the House the difficulty in most cases such people have in getting supplementary income from the assistance authorities.  So far as the contributory pensioner is concerned the type of letter one gets never varies : &ldquo;Joseph Brennan is in receipt of a contributory pension and consequently he is not entitled to home assistance.&rdquo;  I do not like that sort of statement.  The contributory pension is £5.50 and it is assumed by health <Col N="185" /> boards that is a sufficient income without regard to a person's disabilities and there is no further investigation. Once you have the pension you are deemed to have enough to live on.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the principle of giving extra assistance to those over 80.  We are all getting on and when a person goes beyond the 80 mark he is undoubtedly declining and needs more care and nourishment.  Instead of having one &ldquo;half&rdquo; in a day he could do with at least two.  Giving an additional allowance in such cases is good and all I can say is that it is a pity the amount was not £1 for those over 80 years of age.</P>
    <P>We have got in the Minister's script details of social welfare contributions in other countries, particularly our nearest neighbour and our cousins now within the European Community, but the Minister did not give us any details about the qualifying age for old age pensions.  I see no reason why the age limit set down in 1908 should continue any longer.  It should be cut to at least 65 years.  A large section of the Irish people qualify for pensions at 65 years and those who do not are mainly self-employed.  Those people find it exceptionally difficult to make ends meet because social welfare does not cover them.</P>
    <P>In all the countries within the Community the qualifying age for old age pensions has been reduced.  In the northern part of this country the qualifying age is lower than it is here. When I raised this matter before I was told about the additional cost on the Exchequer if this was generally applied.  When we take into account that a large proportion of the people are now covered at 65 years I do not see any reason why the balance should not be covered as well.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to assume that more than 30 per cent of the money given out in old age pensions on Friday morning finds its way back into the Exchequer.  If a pensioner buys an ounce of tobacco and a half one he will find that the Exchequer gets back a fair proportion of the money he has paid out.  The Exchequer also gets a share of the money that person pays <Col N="186" /> when he buys bread and butter.  If we provide old age pensions for people at 65 years and upwards, it is likely that up to 40 per cent of the money will find its way back into the Exchequer. There is not a Deputy in the House who would think it unjust if that qualifying age for old age pensions was applied to all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Last year when there was a Norwegian delegation in Dublin we were told that Norway was the only country in Western Europe which maintained 70 years as the qualifying age for old age pensions.  The Norwegian delegation told us that they were ashamed of that and that this year they were reducing the age by three years to 67 years as the qualifying age.  We are on our own in regard to the qualifying age, a qualifying which the British Government thought was right in 1908.  In justice we must do something about the reduction of this qualifying age. If we look at our neighbours who have gone past 70 years of age we find that almost every one of them is incapacitated in some way and it is very difficult for them to enjoy any retirement. This is a further reason for reducing the qualifying age to 65 years.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to widows' pensions.  We have heard a great deal about widows' pensions in the past year because widows have organised themselves in different parts of the country and they have been making representations to public representatives, particularly Members of this House, with a view to getting an improvement in their pensions.  The matter is easy enough to deal with so far as contributory pensions are concerned. A widow is allowed her pension irrespective of means and she is allowed a certain amount for each child.  A step forward has been taken in this Bill by the allowance of 50p for each child which is given.  The question here, so far as widows are concerned, whether they are in the contributory group or the non-contributory group, is when their breadwinners die&mdash;we are very fond of using the word &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo; and I think I can use it here for want of a better word&mdash;their lives must be restructured.</P>
    <P>In the case of a salaried worker, <Col N="187" /> unless there is another pension in addition to the social welfare one, the income is bound to decline in real value.  The children must be provided for.  It is all right to say we are providing free education but let us not forget that there are numerous incidental expenses.  That widow is undoubtedly suffering great financial hardship because, particularly if the family are young, in the 14 to 17 age group, it is unlikely she will be able to take a job outside even if she wanted to.</P>
    <P>We come to the case of the non-contributory widow and here the position is more extreme.  She gets the same rate as an old age pensioner but she must have less than £25 a year and not own her house.  If she owns her house she will not get the £5.15.  What I see wrong with this is the number of widows anxious to get part-time employment to earn a few extra pounds. If a widow does so her pension will be reduced.  Where it is possible to do so and where her family commitments allow, we should be encouraging such a widow to supplement her income. Instead of that, we have the Department following that widow around watching to see if she will earn a pound this week or next week.  They do that in a big way.  Widows are chased by the Department's officers, I am sure on the instructions of the Department, to ascertain whether their incomes have increased.  If so, their pensions are reduced immediately.  I ask the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Geoghegan, to look into this matter.  We are moving into a more enlightened age and real incomes are low enough without trying to prevent widows from earning a little extra.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to be in conflict with the rules of the House, but it is very difficult to find the dividing line.  I will move along to another group of women, the wives of farmers and shopkeepers.  They find themselves in great difficulty when the breadwinner dies, sometimes early on <Col N="188" /> in their lives, and the means tests are applied so rigidly that if such a widow has no children she must have nil&mdash; how could one hold nothing?&mdash;to get £5.15 a week.  She must not have more than £26.05 per year to qualify for £4.09 and if she has £26.26 she moves down to £4.25.  If she happens to have £52 a year she moves to £4.40 and if she has the princely sum of £169.76 she moves to £2.40 a week.  Take a widow with two qualified children who has £169.76 yearly income.  She gets the princely sum of £5.10, after fierce investigation. The Minister and the House will appreciate that a woman with two young children will not be able to go out to work to supplement that income.  If she does and if she were to move beyond an annual income of £192 there would be a further reduction in her pension.</P>
      <P>These figures are unrealistic and I urge the Minister to review them and review the entire system which is outdated and in need of restructuring. There is general agreement that widows are in extreme hardship at present because of the levels of the allowances and the rigid application of the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will move now to the unemployed and the disabled.  I understand there are more than 70,000 listed as unemployed. As far as our unemployed are concerned, in this country with a population of 2.9 million and with so much work to be done in so many different fields, candidly I do not understand why such a large number should be listed.  Since I was elected to this House in 1951 I have been raising this matter here.  The money paid out is not channelled in the proper direction.  What we want for our men and women is productive work of one kind or another.  The majority of our people want to earn their livelihood in productive employment and not through the medium of social welfare benefits.  These people through the contributions they pay more than cover the unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance they may get.  This money would be spent to better purpose if it were set aside for the purpose of putting schemes of work into operation.  Departments <Col N="189" /> employ workers and I have advocated some co-ordinating body which would direct labour from one scheme to another.  That would be much better than declaring a man redundant and paying him unemployment benefit.  We are obliged to pay this benefit.  There should be a co-ordinating committee which would direct labour from one departmental scheme of work to another.  You have the Department of Posts and Telegraphs providing essential services throughout the country.  You have the Department of Local Government working in conjunction with local authorities in the building of houses. You have the Electricity Supply Board providing essential services. You have drainage and water schemes. How is it some system cannot be devised whereby workers could transfer from one scheme of work to another instead of becoming redundant?</P>

      <P>It is very hard to draw the line.  It would be much more beneficial if work were provided for our people.  I hope the Minister will do something to establish the kind of committee I have suggested.  I am getting a little tired of reminding him. Unemployment assistance recipients receive pittances.  Employment should be provided for these people.  There is plenty of unskilled work.  There are schemes all over the place and there should be no trouble in providing employment for these people.  Some system should be devised to transfer those willing and able to work on to the active employment list.  That would certainly be of benefit to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> A great deal has been said both for and against the payment of unemployment assistance to small farmers.  I believe that scheme to be soundly devised.  It would be difficult for anyone to formulate a scheme which would close all loopholes. The defects in the last scheme were that improvements in incomes resulted in reductions in allowances.  So far as self-employed people like farmers are concerned, the best way of making provision, if there is any way now, is on the land valuation basis.  I know it is 102 years since the land was valued but, by and large, this scheme is working well and is a great advantage to many farmers.  It is all right for individuals to point to a selected few in some areas who on the surface would not seem to qualify but, generally speaking, I have found that this scheme has been a great boon to our small farmers, particularly those with families.</P>
    <P>Such farmers in the 12 western counties possibly do not see creamery cheques at all, where creamery facilities are available, because their supplies, if in existence at all in the winter months from November to May, are exceptionally limited and the credit which is given to them in the winter is not cleared by the time the summer ends.  Therefore, the direct weekly payments to them are a great advantage. I know several people personally whose standard of living has improved.  Again, is there some other way we could do the job?  I leave that to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Such schemes are optional, but I have advised&mdash;and I am sure other Members of the House do likewise&mdash; people who qualify to avail of it.  It is a Government scheme.  Some who possibly need it more than others do not avail of it.  However, the Minister knows this type of scheme will come to an end once we enter Europe.  Open warfare was engaged in on that issue before the referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy </NameTxt>
      <P>All right, Sir.  The scheme in relation to disabled people could be broadened.  Whether they are incapacitated physically or mentally they are a special group to whom we have special obligations.  An omission from the Bill is that self-employed people are not covered.  If a farmer, a shopkeeper or some other self-employed person becomes ill there are no benefits for him.  If he dies, his wife will have to go through this rigid means test if she wants to get any pension. Embodied in this Bill should be a provision to cover self-employed people or people who are outside the insurance range at present and who are not covered by other schemes, as civil servants and local authority employees are.  The scheme I have in mind is a contributory one.  Self-employed people are not getting a fair crack of the whip at present.  Let them pay.  The Minister has told us about payments in European countries.  Such payments apply to self-employed persons as well as to wage earners.  The next Bill of this kind introduced here should have a section dealing with insurance for self-employed people.  The investigation of the means of self-employed people who are not covered by other pension schemes should cease.  It is a laudable aim in the community we are joining that people should pay contributions towards retirement allowances and disability allowances.  We should draw up the same system here and let all make their contribution.  I understand that in <Col N="193" /> Europe the aim is to give retired people an allowance somewhat similar to what they earned in active life.  Whether that is too high a target to set for this country as an initial move I am not in a position to say but I think it is a target that should be aimed at.  I am satisfied that if such a scheme were initiated by the Department it would meet with universal support.  Almost everyone within the precincts of this chamber is covered by this kind of insurance.  The greater body of the citizens of Dublin would possibly be covered.  The well-to-do people can look after themselves by insurance and so on.  However, when we move down the country we find many self-employed people such as farmers and shopkeepers&mdash;many shopkeepers are finding business difficult at the moment; competition is exceptionally keen&mdash;not covered by any kind of retirement allowance and fighting with the Department to secure a non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>I would make a strong appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to try to embody in the next Social Welfare Bill some measure to cover all our citizens. I am sure he will appreciate, as well as I do, that many self-employed people are contributing as much, if not more, to the development of this nation as others.  I am not standing up here and asking that a magic wand be waved. I know this will cost money and time and effort but I think it is essential and justifiable.</P>
      <P>The other items in the Bill centre around particular details and they are clearly set out.  When another social welfare measure is brought before this House in 12 months time, or long before that, I hope it will contain a provision to lower the qualifying age for pension for all our people to 65 years and that it will contain a social insurance scheme for self-employed people, better concessions for old people particularly those who are incapacitated and have to live on the allowance.  I know it is difficult to meet all the demands made by organisations such as the widows organisation but I hope the Bill will help in a reasonable way where help is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister&mdash;if he should continue <Col N="194" /> in office&mdash;would do this he would make a name for himself forever as Minister for Social Welfare.  He would secure a place in history as the man who, belatedly though it was, reduced the qualifying age for the pension from 70 to 65 years.  He would confer a benefit on the Irish people and the people who would have to pay for it would not cavil at it or deem it unfair to be asked to make their contribution to those laudable schemes in the social welfare field.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore </NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has again proved his dedication to advancement in the social welfare code, as he has done each year.  One speaker has asked whether he is not complacent.  The Minister has given evidence each year that he is far from complacent.  Each year we take a step forward towards at least an improved social welfare service if not a perfect one.  I know it is possible for any speaker to take any item and say: &ldquo;Not enough.&rdquo;  I do not think anybody would say it is enough but in this Bill £13½ million extra is being provided for social welfare. We may disagree on one or two points in regard to the allocation of money to the various sectors but we must remember that there are calls on the State for other services.  Our social services are comparable generally with those obtaining elsewhere.  It is inevitable that we should compare ourselves with the UK and the Six Counties but in one or two categories our social services are ahead of theirs.  I do not say this in any boasting way but to try to bring home to people who criticise our services that we are moving towards parity of service with Britain and the rest of Europe.</P>
      <P>The Department has been criticised because of its methods of investigation of claims.  I am sure the officers of the Department are just as concerned as the rest of us that the money at the disposal of the Department is distributed in the very best way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is whether the State is the right organisation to administer these services.  I want to avoid the question of administration but I would suggest that when the Minister is preparing the new social welfare code he should consider the reduction of State <Col N="195" /> involvement in social welfare administration and of providing revenue to bodies of a less official nature who, because of their expert local knowledge, might be in a position to ensure that the service would be applied in the best possible way to those most in need.</P>
    <P>Countries which have almost perfect social welfare services have got the highest suicide rates and the highest rate of mental illness.  That aspect should be borne in mind in examining the question of the distribution of wealth to those most in need.  I do not intend any reflection on the Department who must comply with the regulations.  In connection with the preparation of the new code the question should be examined.  Admittedly, with regard to unemployment benefit, which is a contributory scheme, the State is the best administrative body but in the case of other services such as those for the blind, the widow, the deserted wife, the administration of the services could be handed over to some other agency of a local and charitable nature.  It would also be worth considering involving the local health board in such administration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy made a remark with which I agree, that apart from State aid to social welfare recipients, families and children have a duty to contribute to the upkeep of aged parents and aged relatives.  The vast majority of people agree with this concept but there are cases in which it should be brought home to persons that they have this duty.  Our objective should be to avoid having to send aged persons into institutions where the cost will be heavy and the persons will not be so happy as they would be at home.  The Minister should consider increasing the payments to persons caring for aged parents or relatives in their own homes.</P>
    <P>There are many women who have made tremendous sacrifices in order to care for an aged parent.  When the parent dies the person who has cared for him or her may find that she is past marriageable age and too old to train for employment.  The State should give increased recognition to these persons and should be generous towards them so that they could keep the aged <Col N="196" /> parent in frugal comfort and be in a position to acquire some means.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy also mentioned the fact that Norway and Ireland are the only countries in which 70 is the qualifying age for old age pension and he said that Norway was reducing the qualifying age.  In a recent international conference on social welfare a paper was read indicating the qualifying age for old age pensions in various countries and it was indicated that Ireland and Norway were the only countries that had not pensions before 70 years of age.  I pointed out that there were retirement pensions at 65 years of age in operation in this country.  This was news to the <i>rapporteur.</i> The Norwegians did not give any indication of their intention to alter the qualifying age although their delegates indicated that they would like to.  I am sure that Norway is striving, as we are, to reduce it to 65 years of age.  We know that it will come.  I do not know what the Minister's plans are but I do know that he will have the qualifying age reduced to 65 at the earliest possible time.  We look forward to this.</P>
    <P>There are reasons why the qualifying age should be reduced as soon as possible to 65.  At least, it should be optional for an insured person to continue working beyond the age of 70 and to draw the old age pension.  This idea may be frowned on by some sectors of Labour.  It is a question that must be considered.  It is important that a worker should be assured of some comfort in his retirement.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare services should be examined in the context of the EEC. The Minister listed a number of European countries and gave the social insurance contributions in each case.  In nearly every case the contribution is higher than it is here.  This is not something to be happy about but it does indicate that in countries which pay higher benefits the beneficiaries contribute a great deal more than is the case here.  We must be realistic.  We must ensure that the wealth of the nation is distributed equitably.  That is the basis of our philosophy.  The Minister is conforming to this philosophy in introducing the Bill under which another £30½ million is disbursed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> The Minister might also consider the question of voluntary contributors to social welfare and an extension of the benefits available.  He might consider the possibility of a publicity drive in order to attract voluntary contributors. Persons who have passed the age limit for inclusion in social welfare could become voluntary contributors and thus maintain themselves in benefit and ensure that in the event of their death their widows would receive a pension.  In urban areas, in particular, there is a bone of contention among voluntary contributors.  They consider they should get something from the scheme into which they have paid substantial amounts.  Despite the fact that the salary limit has been raised, more people will be entitled to benefit.  There will be more money available for the general social welfare fund and this will ensure that people will know that they can obtain some benefit from the State.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is preparing a new code for social welfare benefit he should ensure that the scheme is enlarged. For instance people who need home help should be able to avail of this facility.  From the point of view of economics it would be worthwhile if we could ensure that as few as possible are forced to enter institutions. From the humanitarian point of view it would be worthwhile also; old people prefer to stay at home, regardless of the care and attention they might get in an institution.  It will cost the State at least £20 per week to maintain a person in an institution; therefore, it would be worthwhile considering a payment of, for instance, £10 per week to a person to look after an aged relative in his home.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of the person who might wish to retire at the age of 65 years.  He should be allowed to do this if he wishes.  We should increase allowances given in respect of children. This is important at a time when the family is under attack; it is the duty of the State to protect the family.  By adopting my suggestion it might help to have a better social welfare code and, consequently, a happier people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill but I do not think the Minister has gone <Col N="198" /> far enough.  All of us know that there has been a price explosion in the last 12 months and this has affected severely those dependent on social welfare benefits, whether they be old age pensioners, blind pensioners, people in receipt of sickness or disability benefits or home assistance, or those receiving a deserted wife's allowance.  The standard of living of these people has dropped substantially in the last 12 months.  Up to now it has been possible for them to eat meat three times a week but, having regard to the price of meat at the moment, it has not been possible for them to have meat more than once per week.  The Minister should have regard to the fact that if they are to survive and remain in good health they must eat meat more frequently.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of social welfare benefit must watch every penny they spend.  During the winter they will have to buy coal to keep their house, or room, adequately heated.  That problem may not be as acute during the summer but during the winter if they have not adequate heating they will suffer severe hardship.  It these people are not adequately fed there will be unnecessary deaths.  It is not good enough that old age pensioners should have to depend on the St. Vincent de Paul Society or any other charitable organisation to help them survive.  It is a sad reflection on this State that we have people forced to live in such conditions. We are not doing enough to ensure that they can have a reasonable standard of comfort in their old age. Fine Gael are convinced that top priority should be given to old people and all those dependent on social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>There is much hidden poverty in this country.  There are many people who have had sufficient means up to the present but now they are too proud to say they are in want.  Many are retired pensioners, people who by their sweat and toil have built this nation. I cannot understand why successive Governments have allowed this problem to become so great that now it will require a major effort to ensure that these people are given a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that in some county <Col N="199" /> councils home assistance is given to old age pensioners.  The odd thing about home assistance now is that some county councils handed it over to the regional health boards while others continued to operate it themselves.  It is about time that the Minister made up his mind as to whether home assistance is to be administered by the Department of Health or by the Department of Social Welfare.  Some months ago Deputy Spring and I were told in reply to a question here that the Minister would make a statement shortly on the matter.  We were given a long-winded reply at the end of which the Minister said the whole matter was being given urgent attention and that he would be in a position shortly to tell us which Department would be responsible for home assistance.  I hope the Minister will tell us what are his proposals in respect of home assistance. This form of assistance is very valuable to such persons as old age pensioners and widows whose income may not be sufficient to cover the ordinary necessities of life so that an extra £1 or £2 in the week may make a lot of difference to them.  Substantial increases in the grants towards home assistance should be given to the county councils and the regional boards concerned. There is the personal touch in the administration of home assistance and this is important.</P>
    <P>Old age pension committees have outlived their usefulness.  When these committees sit to adjudicate on particular cases it is a useless exercise if the pension officer is not prepared to attend.  At this point I might level a little criticism at those social welfare officers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley </NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair will allow me to develop the point I wish to make he will realise that what I have to say is relevant.  There is a lack of common sense and, at times, a lack of Christian charity on the part of some social welfare officers.  To illustrate <Col N="200" /> what I mean, I will take the case of a farmer who decides to hand over his land to his son.  This farmer completes an application form for the old age pension.  He then goes to a local solicitor and tells him of his wish to hand his land over to his son but that at the same time he wishes to retain certain rights, for instance, the use of a room in the house for his wife and himself for the remainder of their lives and also the use of the kitchen.  When the pension officer goes to the household to make his investigation he ascertains how much money the man has saved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley </NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and if there are in-calf heifers outside, he will probably ask whether they are being handed over also.  However, that is not the point I am making.  My point is that it usually takes three or four months before the transfer of the land has taken place officially.  Such delay is not the fault of the farmer or of the solicitor but is the fault of the Land Registry who are slow in having transfers dated and stamped.  This brings me back again to the administration aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley </NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but I am making the point that once land has been transferred by a farmer and the transfer is in the hands of a solicitor, the farmer should qualify for an old age pension without any delay.  It is not fair to deprive him of that pension for as long as three months when he has done all in his power to get the pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley </NameTxt>
      <P>Many of these people are not aware of the delays involved. People in Kerry, for instance, may not be as smart as those in Connemara.  So far as assessments for widows' pensions are concerned, the rules are much too rigid.  Anyone knows that after the death of a man, the small business he <Col N="201" /> may have been running, will never be the same again.  In such cases there should be a certain amount of leniency and flexibility in dealing with the application for a widow's pension.</P>
      <P>Another matter I wish to raise is that of persons who have a certain number of stamps and who qualify automatically for sickness benefit.  I cannot understand why these people should have to wait for ten to 14 weeks before getting any benefit.  Once a person signs for sickness benefit and is found to be entitled to it, he should not have to wait for this length of time before receiving payment.  How is such a person to exist in the meantime?  Here again a little common sense should be applied.  Perhaps the Minister will consider the adoption of a more streamlined method in processing applications for sickness benefit.</P>

      <P>Since we have not had the opportunity of discussing social welfare for a long time I am sure the Chair will be a little lenient in the knowledge that we are making these points for the good of the people as a whole.  These are the points which I wish to make.  These are the grievances which each Member of this House has met in his constituency.  I know that the Minister is sympathetic to all applications. Perhaps he could cut through the waffle and reduce the delays that make the situation agonising for the people waiting for the benefits.  I hope that the Minister will take note of what I have said and refer to these points when replying.  I am particularly concerned with the case of the old age pensioner who signs over his land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell </NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies I have no hesitation in welcoming any proposals for increasing the meagre allowances of the less well-off section of our community.  In spite of the fact that the increases are negligible in relation to the spiralling cost of living, it is some solace to these people to know that they are getting an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister why <Col N="202" /> we have this anomalous situation again where there is a lot of criticism from insured workers because they do not get benefits payable to them until October although the non-contributory benefits commence in August.  Would it be possible for the Minister to arrange for a uniform date of commencement so that all workers might get benefits in August?  This happens each year and is a source of irritation to insured workers.  There may be some way of correcting this.  Many representations have been made to me about this point.</P>
    <P>The Minister has justified the increases in the social welfare contributions. The Minister says that the State are paying an increased contribution to the social insurance fund and that the State's contribution has to be maintained at one-third while the employers and employees pay two-thirds. The Minister has compared the position here with that in Britain.  I do not think that there is any relation between the benefits paid in Britain and Northern Ireland and those paid here. The Minister's argument is not relevant and does not justify his statement. The Minister has openly admitted that it would cost £100 million to put our social services on a par with those in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>People would gladly pay an extra 1 per cent to the social welfare scheme if they were entitled to the benefits accruing to social welfare contributors in Britain and Northern Ireland.  The Minister's argument falls flat on that basis alone.  The Minister put up a ridiculous argument when he said that if we allow for the health service contributions paid by an insured worker the payments for redundancy and health services would be £5.57 whereas in Britain the figure is £6.67.  That is a ridiculous argument having regard to the fact that there is a comprehensive health service in Britain covering every person.  It is an audacious remark and cannot be justified by any means.  The Minister should look seriously at this point and be realistic about it.  He should not try to bluff us about this kind of statement.  There is no relation between what is payable in Britain and what is payable here.  The 800,000 <Col N="203" /> workers would gladly agree to pay an extra 1 per cent if it would give them the benefits that the British workers have.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether he will consider doing this.</P>
    <P>Too little publicity is given to the fact that all these social insurance benefits will cost £13 million and, of this £13 million, the workers and employers will pay £10 million.  This is not made clear.  The Minister vaguely alluded to this point in the final sentences of his speech when he said:</P>
    <P>The gross cost of improvements on the social insurance side will be £13,595,000 in a full year, of which the increases in contribution rates will provide some £10,424,000.</P>
    <P>In actual fact what is not being made clear is that the contribution rates are paying the increase almost entirely. The Minister is taking credit for something to which he is paying a very small contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan </NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not referring to the assistance side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the social insurance side.  The gross cost of the improvements on the social insurance side have been referred to. The insured workers pay almost the entire amount.  They pay £10.5 million out of a total of £13.5 million.  Because of the vague promises which have been made by the Minister over and over again, I would have thought that the scope of the insurance contribution scheme would have been extended to cover those earning over £1,600.  Where a worker earns over £1,600 he must be a manual worker in order to benefit. I know a case of a telephone technician in a private enterprise.  This man installs and repairs private telephones. He is not considered a manual worker and is not entitled to benefits. That is a grievance with many workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means test is a sore point with many workers.  I have examined the means test for unemployment assistance in the urban areas.  How can the Minister justify an unemployment payment of 12p per week to an unemployed man because that man is living <Col N="204" /> at home?  It seems illogical to talk of a means test to a man who is bereft of any means at all.  If he has the choice of either staying at home or living on the State, and if he chooses to stay at home the Minister imposes a means test and will not give him unemployment assistance.  The means test should be applied to a person's own income.  In cases like this the person has no income. It is important for the Minister to remember that the unemployed person is an adult and as such his family or parents have no obligation to support him.  It would be different if there were this obligation.  The parents have no obligation in law to support such a man.  From the charity of their hearts they supply shelter over his head.  The Minister is denying this man normal unemployment assistance.  I would ask the Minister to see how we can overcome the difficulties of the means test as applied to unemployment assistance, and why a man should be told that he is getting 12p per week in unemployment assistance.  If the Minister can justify that I shall accept it but I do not think he can.</P>
    <P>I think this point is relevant.  Where care is provided for an old age pensioner by a male or female relative&mdash;I am glad the Minister has corrected the anomaly here and will also apply the provision to males; it was pointed out to the Minister over and over again that many a man has provided this service for his father or mother and was deprived of benefits&mdash;I ask the Minister to go one step further and arrange that in the case of all persons who are providing this attention&mdash;this is very important&mdash;the Department should stamp their cards.  This should be part of the arrangement.  If this was done many more people might provide this care and the saving to the State would be enormous in that these people would not be put in homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate this point: the people who give up their employment to provide this service later find themselves deprived of any benefit and have no contributions to their credit.  As a result they depend on non-contributory schemes.  This is a most unjust way of treating people who are performing a very useful task in <Col N="205" /> our society.  The Department should credit the insurance cards of anybody providing this care with contributions during the time the care is being provided. If the Minister did this he would be doing something very useful. I am glad to be able to say that the Minister listens to recommendations. In his speech he showed he had listened and he rectified anomalies where he saw them.  We must admit the Minister does this and I appreciate it very much.</P>
    <P>The Minister is putting before the House the Redundancy Contributions (Variation of Rates) Order, 1972, which provides for the weekly redundancy contribution for men to be increased by 3p to 8p and for women by 2p to 6p.  This is an increase of over 60 per cent for men and it is actually 100 per cent for women. Already there is £1.5 million in the Redundancy Fund, so I wonder why the Minister has decided to increase the payments.  He has not justified the increase or given reasons for it in his speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell </NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will give an adequate explanation for this remarkable increase.  The means test makes it very difficult for widows and deserted wives to succeed in a claim. For a deserted wife or a widow with two children to manage on the amount provided, even with the increase, is almost impossible.  The allowance is inadequate to meet the present cost of living.  One can live on a level where one forgets how these people try to manage on what they are paid.  We might remember that there will be a further wage increase but these people will have to wait another year for an increase.  They are falling behind all the time and the increases are not sufficient to enable them to cope with the spiralling cost of living.  I have seen cases where such people are worrying about pennies.  We are inclined to forget this.  I know there is a limit to what can be paid but as the Minister knows there will be a free-for-all and these people will be left behind.  There is a certain greed in our society and everybody wants to get as much as he can, forgetting the less well-off sections who are left to live at, or below, poverty level.</P>

    <P>I should have thought the Minister would introduce some sort of income supplement by way of national assistance instead of home assistance to bring these people above poverty level. <Col N="207" /> Over 250,000 people are living at or below poverty level at present.  This is a very high figure.  The Minister is not bringing them up with the present benefits.  Also, the new benefits do not come into effect until August, at the earliest, while in the meantime costs have gone up and by the time they get their benefits these have been eroded by the spiralling cost of living and they must wait another full year for an increase.  This makes it very difficult for them to live and we should have some national scheme to cope immediately with cases of poverty such as these.  The Minister who is dealing with these people should be more aware of the problems than anybody. The benefits are granted too late and these people live more on hope of an increase than on anything else not realising that the increase is being eroded and that when they get it it is not adequate to cope with the increased costs.</P>
    <P>Despite all the promises the Minister made about dealing humanely with applications for deserted wives' allowances I do not think he has succeeded. The means test, the proofs they must provide, the humiliation of these people and the negative attitude of the Department are still a great difficulty. I am sure the Minister genuinely and sincerely believed he could operate this scheme humanely but red tape takes over and as a result many of these people cannot succeed in their claim for a deserted wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister brought up the question of the payment of social welfare benefits to a person with dependants.  Sometimes the dependants do not get this benefit.  I am very pleased to see that the Minister has tried to correct this anomaly.  In many cases there are people drawing social welfare benefits in respect of dependants but they are not supporting them.  The Department have not been able to assist very much here because of the restrictions put on them.  I ask the Minister to consult with his opposite number in Britain because we have cases of people drawing social welfare benefits in Britain for their dependants in Ireland but when people here make applications to the <Col N="208" /> Ministry of National Insurance in England they do not get any satisfaction. They say that they know these people are drawing those benefits but they cannot do anything about it. There are thousands of cases like this.  If the person applies to the Department of Social Welfare in Dublin and the matter is taken up with the particular Department in Britain on the person's behalf a grave injustice might be avoided.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the case of people who have been insured here and who go to Britain.  They only get benefits at the Irish rate.  If a person has been in England for years and comes over here he gets only the Irish rate.  That is not reciprocity.  If they only get benefit at the Irish rate in Britain why can they not get benefit at the English rate here?  I have had experience of this in one case and the Department succeeded at least in getting Irish benefit for the person in England.  Why could they not have paid this person at the English rate? Reciprocity means that it should operate both ways but it is not operating to the benefit of people in Britain who are paying the English contribution rate but are getting benefit at the Irish rate.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the question of employers who do not stamp their employees' cards.  I am glad to see that some extra action has been taken in regard to this.  At long last there is some redress for the employee.  If a case has occurred prior to the rectification of the injustice can it be retrospective?  What can the Minister do about this very important point? Could we have some assurance that there will be continuity of contribution for those people who in the last few years found that their employers had not stamped their cards and there was no redress at that time other than to sue the employer, which was an impossible task?  The impact of this could be felt in the next few years, especially in regard to retirement pensions and old age pensions.  There are not many of those people but some of them suffered very badly because there is now a gap in their contributions. It would be much appreciated if the Minister could rectify this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill and to congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare on having introduced it.  In the main it gives effect to the improved scheme of social assistance and social insurance which was announced in the budget statement of the 19th April. It also brings the Garda Síochána within the scope of social insurance. This is bringing more people under the umbrella of social insurance.</P>
      <P>In spite of what has been said by Opposition speakers I believe our social services compare very favourably with other countries.  Our ambition is to move up social welfare benefits in relation to the improvements in the general standard of living as resources permit in an expanding economy.  It is the job of the Government to ensure that the economy is capable of paying continually increased benefits.  The redistribution of wealth in an expanding economy must essentially result in a better scale of social welfare benefits.  This is something which the Fianna Fáil Government have always done, particularly during the last decade.  Many improvements have been made and every year more and more people are drawn under the umbrella of social welfare.</P>
      <P>Our social welfare schemes are often compared with those of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but when making those comparisons people forget that in Northern Ireland insurance applies to almost everybody.  If we are able to extend our insurance scheme to embrace all sections of the community we could make much greater payments.  The unemployed in the North pay their insurance contributions to national insurance as do self-employed and the employed.  If this system operated here it would enable the Government to increase benefits very considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to deal only with the sections of the Bill which affect the rural area in which I live.  Section 3 of the Bill provides for an increase of 40p in the personal rate of unemployment assistance in both urban and rural areas and 30p a week in the rate for adult dependants.  Where there are dependent children the rate for each <Col N="210" /> of the first two children will be increased by 40p and for the third and each subsequent child by 25p a week. These increases will be effective from the 2nd August, 1972, and payable from the 10th August, 1972.  They will automatically raise the means limit for qualification for unemployment assistance and will thus extend this scheme to include such persons whose means prevented them from qualifying for assistance.  This is very important because it will include people who are at present deprived of this assistance and who feel they are entitled to it. I am glad to see this improvement has taken place.  We remember that last year, when the unemployment assistance was taken from unmarried people in the west, there was a great outcry from the Opposition.  I was one of the people very concerned then because it affected my constituency and I was a member of a deputation to the Taoiseach and the Minister to try to have it rectified.  I am therefore glad to see these improvements and to learn that the assistance will be payable all the year round.  We know that the money saved by that curtailment was very usefully spent and the work done with it eliminated some of the hardships suffered in the west due to bad roads.</P>
    <P>I dot not know whether it is relevant to the Bill, but from time to time we get complaints from wives of men in receipt of unemployment assistance. They tell us it is not being spent in the way it should be.  I hope that the Department of Social Welfare will arrange to have this money paid to the dependants of those people who would be prepared to use it properly.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see in section 6 that &ldquo;prescribed relatives&rdquo; are to include male relatives.  Until now it was restricted to female relatives only and the change is welcome.  Many men have to stay at home to look after their parents and are therefore deprived of opportunities to take up employment. The payment of these allowances will help to keep old people out of institutions, something every Government should encourage because, no matter how well they are looked after in institutions, to those people there is no <Col N="211" /> place like their own homes.  It should therefore be our ambition to contribute more towards their maintenance at home.</P>
    <P>I should like to see some changes in the unemployment benefit scheme. Particularly I should like to see the income limit of 50p per day increased. People who have more than 50p per day are debarred from benefits because officially they are regarded as being employed.  The figure is very unrealistic and it is hard on people with sufficient stamps to be told after long and exhaustive inquiries that their means exceed 50p per day and that they are therefore not entitled to anything.  I find it hard to accept that the appeals officer in those cases should have the final say because in many cases I have had contact with in the past three years I could not understand how the appeals officer arrived at his decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Any Bill introduced to improve the lot of the social welfare classes must be welcomed.  In saying that we are glad to see something being done for those classes, we must look realistically at what is being done.  If one had been out of touch with things for several years, one would think the present rates or the proposed rates of benefits were generous, based on a contributory old age pension for a single person of £5.15 per week; but when one looks at them against the background of the present value of money and the present cost of living, one certainly should not be complacent.  One has only to consider the amount of respect there is for 50p to realise what is being done for the social welfare classes.  A few years ago a 10s note was regarded as a fair piece of money to have in one's pocket but at the present time 50p is regarded <Col N="212" /> in a very different light, as being of very little value.</P>
      <P>It is in this light that we should look at what is being done for the social welfare classes.  I am not saying this in any offensive way, but I believe that the gap is widening instead of closing.  What we are doing each year for the social welfare classes is not catching up with the increase in the cost of living or the diminishing value of money.  Somebody put down a parliamentary question yesterday asking the Minister how many old age pensioners are in receipt of home assistance and the answer was to the effect that statistics were not available. However, it was conceded that a considerable number of those people are in receipt of home assistance.  We know home assistance is the last refuge of the destitute: it is paid by health authorities only to people who are in extreme poverty.  It means therefore that old age pensioners who are receiving home assistance are in a pretty bad way.</P>
      <P>If we are to give better benefits we will have to have further taxation. It is a type of taxation to which no one with a social conscience would object.  The gap is widening all the time and these people on an existence level see money being spent lavishly in other directions and that brings home to them just how badly off they are.  The Members of this House will have to shoulder their responsibility in this regard and vote more money for more equitable social payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I know they are excluded for occupational injuries.  I made a plea on previous occasions for an amendment in the law to enable contributory old age pensions and non-contributory widows' pensions to be paid while the recipients were living abroad with their children.  This is socially desirable and, with an amendment in the law, it could be administered in conjunction with the appropriate Department of State in the country in which the recipient is living without a great deal of trouble.  There are many parents living here, lonely and isolated and, if they could bring their pensions with them, they could live with children abroad.  Some of these are being maintained in institutions.</P>
      <P>It is possible to draw the pension for a period of three months, but that does not fill the bill.  The Minister knows the case I am making.  It would be economically wise to do this because it would save maintaining at least some of these people in institutions. The Minister may say that if the children are not prepared to take the parents without these pensions, then they are not very charitable.  That is not the point.  These old people do not want to leave the pensions behind them.  A public representative very quickly learns the attachment these old people have to their pensions; they would suffer anything rather than lose them.  I appeal to the Minister to use the ingenuity at his disposal to make what I propose possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is amending the law in relation to the payment of additional pensions to old age pensioners who have to rely on relatives to look after them.  This was confined to female relatives.  It is now being extended to male relatives.  The Minister will come across cases in which sons are living on bits of land.  I deliberately say &ldquo;living on bits of land&rdquo; because one could not call them farms. <Col N="214" /> Will these male relatives be excluded on the basis that they are gainfully occupied looking after one or two cows?  I will put a typical case: I know a boy who came home from England to look after his mother. There is a little farm but in actual fact the boy is wasting his time.  He is not full-time employed, or anything like it.  When the Minister is drafting the regulations will he be generous?  Will he avoid regulations which will make it virtually impossible for a male relative to qualify for this additional allowance unless he is standing up, with one hand as long as the other, doing nothing? If he is in that position he will probably be getting unemployment benefit and he will be ruled out but, if he is living on a small farm and looking after his parents, will the Minister ensure that he will not be ruled out?  There are cases in which sons and daughters work nearby and attend to their parents in the morning and again at midday and spend the evening with them.  Will the Minister be generous in this respect?  This is a very worthwhile scheme and, if it were properly worked, it could save the Exchequer a good deal.  If a person is charitable enough to look after an old person this additional allowance should be paid.  I will give the Minister briefly the contents of a letter I have here:</P>
    <P>She is an old age pensioner and a widow.  She is 78 years of age. Her husband is dead 2½ years.  She lived at such a place and she arrived at me when her husband died.  If she is not here she would be in the county home for she has no one to take care of her.  She is very hard to put up with and, if it is not possible to give her an allowance, she will have to go to hospital.  I have a son living with me but I do not think there is any responsibility on him to keep her.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>She probably gave them the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I do not think so.  The Minister can investigate that.  If she is being properly looked after in a neighbour's house, why not give the allowance?  Would that not be an economic proposition? <Col N="215" /> It is not an answer to say she might not be properly looked after.  There is an abundance of social workers or people who act as social workers or investigation officers of one type or another, and they could keep a check on this sort of thing.  I believe that, in keeping with the policy at the moment to encourage elderly people to remain at home or not to go into hospital, this scheme, if it were properly, generously and sympathetically worked, would go a long way to relieving old people's homes and institutions from having to care for many persons of that type.  Therefore, when the Minister is drafting regulations under this scheme in regard to the male relatives he should not draft regulations that it will be impossible to bring oneself within, because that only leads to frustration and a lot of correspondence for the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare operates a scheme known as the medical and surgical appliances benefit scheme.  I had a case recently in which an insured person, who had lost one eye when he was fairly young, found it necessary to get an artificial eye or at least to have an artificial eye replaced.  He asked me if I could help him out because he was refused.  I took it up with the health board and the health board told me that he was reasonably well off and they could not help him, but they referred me to the Department of Social Welfare who wrote me as follows:</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for Social Welfare to refer to your representations on behalf of (named person) in connection with the provision of an artificial eye.  The Medical and Surgical Appliances Benefit Scheme that is administered by this Department provides for a subvention towards the cost of hearing aids and contact lenses only. There is not, accordingly, any way under the scheme by which assistance could be afforded to the person mentioned in the matter of an artificial eye.  He may, however, be eligible for assistance under the Health Act, and information in this connection may be obtained from the North Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> Apparently the Minister could provide this man with a hearing aid or contact lenses but he is not permitted under existing legislation to provide him with an artificial eye.  I think that is ludicrous.  It is obviously a loophole in the scheme and I would suggest that the Minister have the scheme amended to provide for reasonable medical or surgical appliances, and I would say that this is one of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he lost his eye at work we would pay him a pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): But this man did not.  He lost his eye years and years ago.  In that case he would come under the occupational injuries section of the Minister's Department, but this man would not come in under that.  This is just a loophole in the scheme which deals with medical and surgical appliances.</P>
      <P>There is another hard luck case which I came across and which I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  In this country sometimes people are doubly punished.  I refer to people who come before the courts and are sentenced to terms of imprisonment, people who had good industrial records up to the time of their breaking the law.  Then they do 12 months or so imprisonment; they come out and find that should they become ill they are completely cut off from benefit for 12 months.</P>
      <P>A case which brought this to my attention concerned a man with an excellent industrial record over several years.  He is a married man with a family who unfortunately was involved in a fatal road traffic accident.  He received a sentence of 18 months and spent practically all of the year 1970 in prison.  He came out, and in the year 1971 he had 49 contributions.  He then got ulcers, and I venture to say that it was his term of imprisonment that caused the ulcers.  Apparently in his case 1970 was the qualifying year, and because he spent that 12 months in Mountjoy he was not entitled to sickness benefit although he is unable to work.  Not alone is he being punished but his wife and family are also being punished.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Deputy Tully, in the Labour benches, made a plea about this some years ago.  With respect, Sir, I would say I am in order because this is a matter that requires amending legislation.  I can give the Minister this man's social welfare number.  It is 1334757.  I have been in correspondence with the Minister's Department about it and I was told that he would come into benefit on 5th June of this year if he was still ill.  He was seriously ill and unable to work, but the point I am making is that this is punishing a man twice. There are different types of criminals, but once a man is sentenced by the court to punishment and serves imprisonment and repays his debt to society, to use the appropriate jargon, he should not then find that society is still getting its own back on him but not alone on him but on his wife and family by withholding from him benefits to which he is entitled under the social welfare code.  He should at least qualify for credits.</P>

At any rate, I believe I have made the case fairly clearly to the Minister.  It is something about which I felt very strongly when it was brought to my attention and I ask the Minister to do what he can to remedy the position.  If he can do it without legislation so much the better.</P>
      <P>A section of the Minister's Department deals with dental benefit.  In my constituency during the recent withdrawal from the scheme by certain dentists insured people had to go to other dentists.  They could not be blamed for that.  Now they are not being indemnified against the bills which they incurred or not being paid dental benefit.  That is unreasonable. I may be getting out of order in pursuing that, it may be administration, but the Minister knows what I am getting at.  There were a few months when in my constituency there were no dentists operating this scheme and insured people went to dentists who had been operating the scheme.  Now the Minister will not pay the bills. That is not fair.  He should pay them.</P>
      <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association want the Minister to amend the law to provide free radio and television licences and free electricity for people confined to wheelchairs on the same terms as those benefits are given to old age pensioners.  That is a reasonable request.  I recommend it to the Minister. I hope he will do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody said the Minister's Department are not good at replying to <Col N="219" /> letters.  I should like to dissociate myself from that remark.  I find the Minister's Department in that respect, and within the limits of their authority, very courteous and helpful when representations are made to them.  There are delays occasionally in the payment of benefits and these delays should, even if it entails the employment of further staff, be cut out because delays in making payments to people in this class are serious.  As I said before, in the case of old people, it is like promising a child a toy and then withholding it.  I should like the Minister where possible to cut out these delays.</P>
    <P>I should like to join in the plea that has been made for the payment of old age pensions at 65.  I also think there is a lot to be said for a scheme of social insurance or social services based on contributions and payable to all who join.  That would eliminate the necessity for the means test.  That type of scheme should be encouraged, should be investigated and I hope it will not be too long before such a scheme is introduced.</P>

It has been the policy of this Government down through the years to avail of every opportunity to improve social services. The Minister's speech this morning shows, beyond all contradiction, that he is fully aware of the many defects there are in our services and that every effort is being made to remedy them.  Improvements in social services can only be made by a Minister with the money that is available to him.  Another important factor is that you must ensure the least possible hardship on those who must finance the services.  I, like many others, would be only too delighted to stand up and make a case for various increases but we must keep in mind the impact on the people who are paying for the services.

    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> There was a very big injustice done for many years to the unfortunate woman over 50 who was deprived of any subsistence. I am glad the Minister has seen the defect in this part of the service and has now remedied it.  We will have to have quite an amount of examination of this service in the future because there is an injustice not alone by the State but by the person who is mainly responsible for maintaining a wife and family.</P>
    <P>I am glad too the Minister has increased the retirement pension.  However, I should like the Minister to take into account that when a person retires at the age of 65 he is still capable of making a contribution to the State by way of part-time employment.  It is important for him to have work available to him even though it is only part-time. This should not affect his pension rights.  This is very important because many people are not adjusted to meet old age and this must be done gradually. I should like the Minister to give further consideration to this aspect of retirement pensions.  It is very important for people to keep themselves occupied and they should not be deprived of a pension if they take up part-time employment.</P>
    <P>The matter of the failure to stamp insurance cards comes up very often. I do not think we are hard enough on the people who fail to fulfil this obligation. It is the employee who suffers.  He is working on the understanding that his employer is stamping his cards.  It may cost the State more money to ensure that there are more inspectors calling on employers to see that they are stamping their cards and that they are up-to-date.  Much hardship has been caused in recent times and I am glad the Minister has an eye on the situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's move in bringing the Garda Síochána under the social services.  This is long overdue. It will be welcomed by gardaí and by members of their families because it gives them security for the future.</P>
    <P>The allowance given to a relative who is looking after an old person is also worthwhile.  Whatever money is available should be provided in this direction.  There is a saving on hospitalisation. <Col N="221" /> All old people wish to end their days in their own homes.  We could do quite a good deal in this field. The only injustice I can see at present is that a person who is prepared to give up employment to stay at home and look after an old relative is, when that relative dies, deprived of all social services even though he may have contributed for 20 or 30 years.  I mentioned this on the last occasion we were discussing the social services.  I know the Minister is looking into it.  There is an injustice here and it is a disincentive to a person to give up employment to look after an old relative.  I would ask the Minister's officials to give this matter urgent attention.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the death grants.  On the death of a relative people really need money.  I have no doubt that the Minister is keeping this in mind and that at the first opportunity he will increase the grants in this sphere. This Bill will be welcomed by everybody. It is a step forward in improving our services.  I am convinced that the Minister is fully alive to the many defects in the services and that he intends to remedy them.  I welcome the Bill and I have no doubt that it will be welcomed by all who will benefit from the various increases provided for.</P>

      <P>Serving members of the Garda Síochána will now come under the social services.  This is laudable but there are a number of gardaí who helped to found the State and the institutions of the State and who gave great service to the country and to whom we owe a great deal.  They are men who led active lives and who retired in the past ten years.  They paid their social welfare contributions and they should also be brought in under this Bill.  Will retired gardaí who have paid their contributions be deprived of the same rights as ordinary citizens?  I should like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>

    <P>I would like to see that married <Col N="222" /> women are not deprived in this sense. I have seen it in our town where many of them were deprived of social welfare benefits recently on the grounds that they were not available for work. I know that they were available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the Chair but if this group cannot keep up with the Joneses in this respect they will be deprived of their rights.  Yesterday I referred to an increase in the population. It is nice to see that.  The previous speaker asked where would we get the money to pay for all this.  I suppose he will advocate the use of the pill now so that we will not have to pay this money, putting the Minister in the position of Old Mother Hubbard going to the cupboard and finding it bare.  Money is being spent otherwise which could have been spent in this direction.  Children's allowances and old age pensions will have to be increased when we go into Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women who looked after bed-ridden parents made great sacrifices.  They sacrificed their chance of marriage and when their parents died that chance <Col N="223" /> was gone.  I do not know how the Minister could give some form of recognition to this group.  They did a great deal of good.  They kept their parents out of hospital.  They did not do that for the sake of getting money. Some of them did not know about the allowance which was available for minding old people and they made this sacrifice out of Christian charity and for love of their parents.  Many women who are not so young now made great sacrifices to look after their parents. They helped the State by keeping their parents out of an institution where their maintenance would have cost a great deal more.  There are certain conditions governing the payment of the allowance.  There are many people who made great sacrifices in looking after aged parents who do not qualify. The Minister will not always be in charge of the Department&mdash;it is our intention to shift him shortly&mdash;but the officials of the Department could advise Ministers that there is another group entitled to recognition for what they have done.</P>
    <P>It is not the Minister, it is our entry into the EEC, that has caused the increases indicated by the Minister to be made.  Let Fianna Fáil not claim at an election that they gave these increases voluntarily.  The screw was put on them by virtue of our entry into Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the increases, meagre and insufficient as they are, given in the Bill to social welfare recipients, I do not think the Minister has gone as far as he should have gone.  I do not want to deal individually with the increases.  The Minister said that the increases in the field of social assistance will give an extra 50 pence a week to non-contributory old age and blind pensioners, making the maximum personal rate £5.15 a week.  These increases are grossly inadequate.  It has been the policy of the Government over the last few years not to bring budgetary increases in social welfare into effect immediately they are announced.  One would assume that such increases would be tied to increases in the cost of living.  Between February, 1971, and <Col N="224" /> February, 1972, the price of bread increased by 17 per cent, the price of butter increased by 10 per cent, sugar by 17 per cent and tea by 5 per cent. The price of clothes increased by 9 per cent.  Fuel and light increased in the last few years by 10 per cent.  All these increases affect social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>I may be criticised for suggesting that an old age pensioner or other social welfare recipient is entitled to his pint of stout or a drop of spirits. These items also have increased by 8 per cent.  They may be regarded as a luxury but to some elderly persons they are not a luxury; they are necessary.</P>
      <P>Widows and orphans are to receive the niggardly increase of 60p.  Old age pensioners are to receive an extra 120p. The Government have not been over generous to these categories of persons.</P>
      <P>I want to make a suggestion to the Minister&mdash;Deputy Fitzpatrick also mentioned the matter&mdash;for his sympathetic consideration.  The suggestion is that the provision of free electricity and free radio and television licences, already in operation in the case of old age and blind pensioners, should be extended to deserving persons, regardless of age, who are suffering from prolonged and substantial disability and whose income is derived wholly or mainly from social welfare benefit and assistance schemes and that the regulations governing such a scheme should include the necessary safeguards against abuse by non-deserving persons.</P>
      <P>The Minister is well aware of the many persons suffering from prolonged illness but who do not come within the old age pension category.  For instance, there are those who have to spend their lives in wheelchairs.  Regardless of age, these persons should be entitled to this concession.  I strongly recommend this proposal to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am greatly worried and concerned about the position of persons who have been in receipt of disability benefit, which benefit has for some reason or another been suspended.  I may mention as an example a case in my constituency of a married man with five children who had been in receipt of a disability benefit and in whose case the <Col N="225" /> disability benefit was withheld as from 1st May last.  The amount of the benefit he received was £12.15 a week.  Up to last Saturday this man was still waiting to be called before a medical referee. I cannot understand why this person who, in my view, will be disabled for years to come, if not for life, should be left in that position.  He was in receipt of £12.75 per week from 1st May but up to last Saturday he has not received anything from the Department. He is still awaiting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this matter several times.  However, I shall bow to the ruling of the Chair.  I am not satisfied with the increases that have been given to social welfare recipients because the increases in the cost of living have been in excess of these increases.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to a suggestion which I have made already, that television and radio licences and free electricity be given to persons who are suffering from severe and prolonged disability.  This should be given to all such people irrespective of age. All Deputies would welcome such a decision and I would ask the Minister to give the matter sympathetic consideration and to amend the legislation accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I should like to make on this Bill.  I recall that some time ago the <Col N="226" /> Minister, or some prominent members of his party, indicated that the thinking in his party's policy had been formulated to have social welfare payments on a wage-related basis.  As the House is aware, the benefits payable under our social welfare code are flat payments, the only difference being that there is a distinction made between those who have a spouse only and those who have a spouse and children. The difference in payments has no relation to the earning capacity of the recipient.</P>
      <P>In their policy document issued quite a number of years ago, Fine Gael suggested that social welfare payments should not be provided on a flat basis but in relation to the wages of the person in need.  The reason was a simple social reason.  If a person in receipt of £20 per week falls ill he will receive the same benefit as a person who received £15 per week before he became ill.  Assuming both people have the same marital status they will receive the same benefit.  It is obvious that there is much greater hardship for the person who is in receipt of the larger salary to adjust to the social welfare benefit.  While it would not be possible within the limits of the national budget or the capacity of the contribution system to equate benefit with wages, nevertheless the disparity between wages and benefit should be removed.  I am disappointed the Minister has not taken this opportunity, on the eve of our entry into Europe where many benefits are superior to those obtaining here, to introduce the principle of wage-related benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even within the system of the graded flat benefits considerable injustices result.  One can mention the case of a tradesman who falls ill.  A single man receives approximately £5 per week but a married man, depending on the number of children, can receive approximately £12 per week. There is a considerable difference between the benefit received by a single man and that received by a married man with no children.  This is getting back to this incongruity which runs right through the public sector, namely, that wages and salaries are greater for married people than they are for the <Col N="227" /> single man or woman.  We have not equal pay for equal work; in the social welfare code for sickness we do not give equal benefit.  I concede that a married man should be compensated for his extra responsibilities but why should a single man be prejudiced because he does not have that responsibility? He may have other, equally heavy, responsibilities.  The trauma of his illness, coupled with the adverse change from a salary to benefit, can be equally difficult on a single man who might have domestic dependants.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the prescribed relative allowance was an effort to compensate in some way for the disadvantages of the flat rate but I suggest that in practice we have seen in the working of the prescribed relative allowance that it has been unduly narrow and restrictive.  There are many cases which are excluded although I do not think that it was intended that they should be excluded.</P>
    <P>In this connection I have in mind the case of a pensioner with two children, a daughter and son.  If the mother should fall ill, it might happen that the daughter would be compelled to return home to care for her as the son would not be competent to carry out the nursing involved and, in any case, he would be out of work if he should have to return home.  Because the pensioner is not living alone she is deprived of the extra allowance for the daughter who may have given up a satisfactory job to take care of her.</P>
    <P>A similar situation exists for a married couple who maintain the mother of one of the parties.  If the prescribed relative is the daughter of the pensioner and if her husband lives in the house the allowance is not payable. If it is held that the wife is maintained by her husband she is not entitled to the allowance.  The conditions attached to this allowance should be considered again.</P>
    <P>These are matters relating to the general philosophy behind our social welfare payments.  I complain, and my party have consistently complained, that these payments should not be on a flat basis.  We advocate that they <Col N="228" /> should be related to the wage of the person concerned.  The justice of this is obvious and the social desirability of it is equally obvious.  The Minister indicated some time ago that he accepted the principle but I regret that he has not had the energy to extend that acceptance into this legislation.</P>
    <P>The increases proposed in the Bill are welcome but I suppose it is only natural that those of us who have experience of the social welfare code in practice are not satisfied completely with the level of the benefits.  There are anomalies right through the code.  The anomaly that grieves me most and which I consider needs to be removed urgently is that relating to domestic workers.  Domestic workers are prejudiced if they become unemployed because they cannot obtain unemployment benefit unless they have been contributing for many years to the insurance scheme.  There is also a second condition that they must have reached a certain age in order to qualify for benefit.  So far as I know this is the only class of worker discriminated against in this regard.  In continuing this discrimination the Department are, perhaps unwittingly, reflecting an out-of-date and Victorian attitude towards this category of workers.  The fact that these workers are referred to as servants very often in local authority and central government correspondence and legislation seems to suggest that the Victorian thinking has not departed altogether.  It would be a blow for justice and fair play if this discrimination were removed and these workers treated as all other workers with regard to benefits.</P>
    <P>I suppose the thinking behind the discrimination is that there is such a demand for domestic workers they should never be unemployed.  That thinking is out of date and it is no longer valid because, happily, the wages of domestic workers are now so high that the number of persons capable of employing them is diminishing.  Consequently, the employment opportunities are diminishing also and should a worker become unemployed in an average country town the opportunities for being re-employed are not available automatically.  Therefore, considerable hardship results to the unemployed <Col N="229" /> worker who is unable to receive unemployment benefit.  The result is that such a worker is forced either to go to England or to migrate to another part of the country.  This is the only category of worker who is put in this position.  There is no justification for that.  It is another serious omission in this Bill that in this year of 1972 and on the eve of going into Europe, this type of Victorian discrimination is not removed once and for all.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to raise concerns occupational injuries benefit. To elucidate, I would like to refer to what was the position of an injured workman prior to the introduction of the occupational injuries benefit under the social welfare code.  Prior to the change an injured workman got relief through the Circuit Court under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  There was provision for him to bring his application to the court and the court, having heard the medical evidence and the facts to establish that the accident occurred in the course of the man's employment, and having heard the medical evidence to establish incapacity, made a finding, generally in the first instance, of full incapacity. The full compensation then became payable although that compensation was a meagre figure.  If an employer thought that circumstances had changed it was open to him at any time to go before the court again and have the case reviewed as to the continuing incapacity of the worker.  At that stage the court, having reviewed the case, could continue its order of full incapacity or, if the medical evidence so indicated, it could make a finding of partial incapacity.  In other words, it would say that the workman was partially incapacitated only and was capable of some work.  The matter would then be adjourned to see if the workman could obtain any work suited to his partial incapacity or, if he could prove to the court there and then that no such light work, as it was called, was available, the court was empowered to make an order finding partial incapacity but treating it as total incapacity so as to enable the workman to continue to receive full compensation. That was a power which the court had to use very frequently and it <Col N="230" /> enabled the court to adopt a humanitarian attitude towards many cases of chronic injuries which were not fully incapacitating but which were sufficient to prevent a man from doing more than light work.  Anybody who has any connection with ordinary life must know that light work is non-obtainable. It is a contradiction in terms because by and large in rural Ireland there is no such thing as light work.  Who will employ a man who is capable only of light work?  It would not be feasible to do so.</P>
    <P>This power of the Circuit Court to make a finding of partial incapacity but because of the absence of light work, to treat it as total incapacity, has not been carried over into the social welfare code.  Under our Occupational Injuries Act it is possible to have a situation where a workman is found to be partially disabled in which case a percentage scale of disablement benefit applies.  Consequently, a person who was found to be partially incapacitated might receive benefit of, say, £1.50 per week, and be told to find work which would provide him with whatever more money he should want. Of course, the reality of the situation is that there is no work available for such a man.  There should be power for some officer of the Department to treat such a situation in a way that would enable that person to receive the full benefit.</P>
    <P>I find a differing practice in relation to the workman who is suffering from a chronic injury.  Under the old Workman's Compensation Acts a man who was in receipt of benefit for a long time and who might appear to have recovered physically from his injuries would find if he were to go before the courts, that the courts invariably applied the attitude whereby they took into account the long number of years that he had been away from work. They took into account the psychological effect on the man from having been away from work for so long.  Invariably, the courts in their humanitarian attitude found partial incapacity. They found that the original trauma had resulted in a psychiatric inability to work and that in itself is a definite medical complaint.</P>
    <P>I find now that the differing approach <Col N="231" /> by the Department of Social Welfare in relation to this type of injury is resulting in injustice because the Department are inclined to apply the law according to the letter.  One cannot blame them for doing this because they have an obligation to the Legislature to ensure that the laws passed are applied strictly. They have not got the discretion or the traditions of the courts in interpreting Acts in a manner that may, perhaps, appear to infringe the letter of the law but which comply with the spirit of it.</P>
    <P>I am aware of cases falling within the occupational injury code of persons suffering from the effects of a very old accident and who, on strictly physical terms, cannot be said still to show the signs of injury and to the medical referee or outside consultant whom the Department sometimes bring in there is no trace of injuries and the apparently obvious deduction is made that the person is fit to go back to work.  I stress that in such cases the psychiatric element should be looked into at the instance of the Department and it should not be left as a matter of appeal for the workman or his advisers.  In order to administer this branch of the code as fairly and as humanely as possible the Department should take the initiative in putting beyond doubt the capacity of a man to go back to work. The psychosomatic condition of that type of worker should be investigated at the instance of the Department and if there is any justification for a finding of partial incapacity it should be treated as total and in this way treat humanely a man who may have been ten or 15 years off work.  That man is not capable of going back to work and it is contrary to what should be the spirit of the social welfare code to force him back to work.  In such a situation speed is of the essence.  The procedure, as I understand it, is that in the periodic review if the medical referee&mdash;and I mean no reflection on the professional competence of medical referees when I say some of their findings are puzzling to their colleagues in busy general practices&mdash;finds, as he very often does, that incapacity has ceased, from that finding the benefit is cut off and is not restored until the <Col N="232" /> whole tedious procedure of appeal has been gone through.  I suppose there is no alternative when the Department's own medical officer says this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, but I think it also bears on the question of policy and I am dealing with the policy approach of the Department in relation to difficult cases of partial or total incapacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>But with respect, it is a matter of policy.  The Minister dealt with a number of matters that had given rise to problems in relation to the operation of the social insurance system.  This is why I say the occupational injuries code has defects which are more than just the defects in the scale of weekly payments.  The Bill merely seeks to improve the scale of payments to some extent.  I think it is a pity it does not go farther because it is very important for the morale of persons injured at work or who are at work and may suffer injury to know that they will be sympathetically and compassionately looked after by the Department of Social Welfare.  This one change is the main change I recommend, the power to treat partial incapacity as total, thus enabling the worker to receive full benefit and not put him in the ridiculous position of asking an employer for light work and having people laughing at him.</P>
      <P>It might assist this part of the code if there was a different procedure.  It was a pity the matter was entirely taken out of the hands of the courts because while going to court had disadvantages in that the person had to employ lawyers and face the ceremonial of a court, yet the ambience in court was always in favour of the worker.  There was no question of the court being a wing of the establishment and its perspective was absolutely independent. That was very valuable for the worker and if something akin to this were restored it would go a long way towards improving the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> I welcome the increase in old age non-contributory pensions and the increased means level ceiling.  While regretting that the means test has to be applied, one can see the need for it. We can only hope that it is applied as liberally as possible and that the person who is thrifty does not find himself prejudiced when he comes to qualifying age and that it is also applied liberally to persons who decide to part with their property.  I am aware that there has been a considerable improvement in the Department's attitude towards accepting transfers by persons on the eve of the 70th birthday as genuine dispositions of property and not just transfers made for the purpose of qualifying for an old age pension.  There should be a question of discretion as to whether such transfers are accepted or not.  All transfers of property by persons in their 69th or 70th year are socially desirable and should be encouraged.  If a person knew that by transferring his property it would help him to acquire an old age pension it would encourage him.</P>
    <P>Some transfers are still disregarded if the Department feel they were entered into for the purpose of qualifying for a pension.  I think I am correct in saying it has become the practice of the Department to accept transfers from parent to child without question but transfers from uncle to nephew or from older brother to younger brother are sometimes disregarded.  This is socially wrong.  The Department's attitude at all times should be to encourage such transfers and encourage older persons to give up property and give way to younger people who may be only comparatively younger.  If, as a consequence, somebody qualifies for an old age pension what of it?  He has given a lifetime of work to the State and the few shillings available on foot of a non-contributory pension in the comparatively few cases involved are trivial.  I urge the Minister to arrange that all transfers be henceforth accepted and not condemned on the grounds that they were entered into purely for qualification purposes.</P>
    <P>I have no more to say other than to mention again my disappointment that <Col N="234" /> the principle of wage-related benefits was not introduced in this Bill.  The Minister is in favour of the principle and once his mind is running in that direction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Generally, the increases are welcomed and we can only hope they will continue to grow and that the wage related scheme, when implemented, will ease the lot of many recipients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always in a position to be able to pay a tribute to the Deputies who contribute to debates such as this but more so this year than at any time.  I always regard the debate on such a Bill as an occasion when I get a lot of information which I can use as a feeler to know in which direction we should move most rapidly and where we are failing to make the necessary impact.  These can only be found when there is a realistic constructive approach to the debate.</P>
      <P>This year, fewer Deputies than ever before referred to our social welfare code as being antiquated.  Only one did so and not with any great conviction.  I should like to say at the beginning that if the examination of the code, which has been going on for a number of years on every aspect, reveals one thing more than another it is that our code does not compare unfavourably in its scope with that of any other country, and when we hear talk about a need for a restructuring of the code we realise it is nonsense. We have only to fill in a few gaps, make a few changes such as advancing the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time, we cover old age, widows and orphans, the blind, the disabled, births, marriages and deaths, and other matters, together with the dependants of all these <Col N="235" /> classes, and that is as much as any country in the world is doing at the present time.  Other countries may have different twitches here and there with regard to particular fields, they may have a few things which we have not got, but many of the things which we urgently need, such as pay related benefits, are being worked on at the moment.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that the form of our code need not necessarily be discarded and the legislation we have passed need not be repealed. All we need to do is to move forward to the field of social insurance and this is the area in which I should like to move as rapidly as circumstances permit us.</P>
    <P>I should like to see social insurance extended and become more comprehensive to give greater cover to a great many more people.  Any Minister would desire this because it will relieve us of many of the things about which complaints come in, above all the disgusting system which we have to put up with while we have a means test.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to a general discussion on the social welfare system, I should like to get people to understand that social welfare investigating officers are appointed to assist people in getting the benefits to which they are legitimately entitled.  On the other hand, I should like these officers to realise that they are not there to keep benefits from the people but to ascertain what they are entitled to and, of course, their qualifications.  These two things do not always seem to harmonise and the result is that an officer approaching a household is regarded as being someone who is trying to keep something from the household.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In their own way the officers help to cause that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the attitude of the officers of the Department is that they should appear as persons whose duty it is to interpret the legal implications so that persons may get the benefits for which they qualify. There is one thing people must remember and that is that there are abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> It is the people who abuse the system who cause the burdens for those who should not suffer the disadvantages of the necessary investigations.  We have many abuses.  We have abuses in the matter of disablement benefits for sick people.  We have persons frequently being brought to court because they have worked and drawn benefits simultaneously. They are the people who use up the money which should be available for people who really need it and in that way they are the cause of harassing others.</P>
    <P>When the day arrives when we will move into the wider field of social insurance, and when the means test largely disappears, then it will be necessary only to ascertain the qualifications which one would have under the insurance scheme.  This will be necessary, too, and it brings me to a point about several complaints we get about delays.</P>
    <P>Persons who are insured are entitled to certain benefits and in certain circumstances we must ascertain their qualifications.  They are required to have so many contributions within the contribution year and if we are not able to ascertain these simple qualifications we cannot pay the benefits immediately and consequently delays occur.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley was mistaken, it was a slip on his part, when he spoke about sick benefit applicants being made to sign at the exchange every week.  Such applicants do not have to sign at the exchange.  They may have to send in certificates repeatedly without getting their money but this is always due, when traced down, to some justifiable reason.  We cannot pay benefits unless we are satisfied the persons are qualified. People make a living out of writing to newspapers about these delays, and, of course, they always will because this will always be an emotive subject and the Department will always have to face a certain amount of odium. However, we will continue to try to ensure that there is expeditious handling of all cases and we ask the public to co-operate fully with us in this respect.</P>

      <P>The increase in the food group of the consumer price index between mid-May, 1971, and mid-May, 1972, was 10.8 per cent.  Meat, milk and butter accounted for less than half of this increase.  Part of the price rise arose from action taken by the Government to improve farming incomes and to that extent was in line with expectations.  Market forces, however, accounted for the greater part of the change.  In view of the volatile nature of these forces and the wide range of food items affected, detailed forecasting in this area is not attempted, account being taken in only a general way of food prices in assessing future trends in the consumer price index.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications of this exclusion have been examined already and I am satisfied that it does not result generally in hospital beds being used unnecessarily. Moreover, members of the main scheme for at least two years have the option of joining the supplementary out-patient scheme which gives, at moderate extra charges, considerable assistance towards the cost of illness or medical investigation outside hospitals. Therefore, I do not propose to ask the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to extend the cover provided in <Col N="240" /> the main scheme in the manner suggested.</P>

      <P>The number of acute hospital admissions per 1,000 of the population in the case of VHI members fell in the last four years.  The number is very much lower than the number of acute hospital admissions from the total population.  These charges are very reasonable.  They vary from £1.5 per annum in the case of a single person to £6 in the case of a married couple with four or more children.  They cover 80 per cent of the expenses in excess of £20 in the case of a single person and 75 per cent of the expenses in the case of a married couple with children under 18.

      <P>Maternity allowance is a weekly payment for a period beginning with the sixth week before the end of the expected week of confinement and ending six weeks after the week in which the confinement occurs. The expected date of confinement is certified by the claimant's doctor and is the date which enables the date from which the allowance is payable to be established.  It should be emphasised that the allowance is a weekly allowance and not a grant.  Its purpose is to provide the expectant mother, who is working and who gives up her job, with a source of income for a period before and after her confinement.  The period before confinement can only be determined by reference to the expected date certified by the claimant's doctor.  The expected date and the actual date of confinement do not always coincide and for this reason the period over which the allowance is paid before confinement may vary. Accordingly the total period over which the allowance is paid may be less or more than 12 weeks depending <Col N="243" /> on whether the actual date of confinement is before or after the expected date certified.</P>
      <P>The particular purpose of the allowance must be borne in mind in considering the period over which it is paid and any one aspect of the matter cannot be taken in isolation.

      <P>Having regard to the very substantial increase in the public capital programme, including building and construction, in the current financial year, I am unable to accept the implication in the question of a serious deterioration in the employment situation in the building industry in the coming months.  I am, however, having the various points raised by the Construction Industry Federation <Col N="245" /> examined as a matter of urgency with a view to considering what further action, if any, is required.</P>
      <P>I might add also that the 1972-73 current budget will release into the economy an additional £35 million in spending power which, it is estimated, will increase the national growth rate by 1¾ percentage points over the year ahead.

      <P>and <b>Mr. Keating</b> asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of a recent court statement relating to the legal status of women, he will introduce legislation to repeal all archaic laws which appear to place a woman in the same legal category as a chattel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I have no authoritative text of the remarks in question, still less of the precise context in which they were made, what I have to say is in no way to be taken as a comment on those remarks.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the law of this State, that is to say, the family law governing the status of a married woman <i>vis-á-vis</i> her husband and children, places her, or appears to place her, in the legal position of a chattel. There was, in the fairly distant past, some justification for such an allegation in relation to the law which obtained both in Britain and in this country and the usual complaint is that we have failed to keep pace with the British in changing it.  This complaint is not based on fact.</P>
      <P>The last remaining legal restrictions that applied to the property rights of married women were removed in this State by the Married Women's Status Act, 1967.  Likewise, that Act enabled a wife or husband to take civil proceedings against the other for a civil wrong, thus affording full legal protection for the personal rights.  As regards rights in relation to children, the legal position&mdash;contrary, I may say, to what is being publicly alleged so persistently &mdash;is that the father is not the sole guardian of his children.  Father and mother have equal rights, being joint guardians.  This legal position dervies first of all from the Constitution and has been spelt out in detail in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the constant policy of this Government and their predecessors to work towards improving the status of women despite, at times, remarkably vehement rearguard actions by those who feel that we must not be the first to initiate any change in the legal field. For instance it is only a few years <Col N="257" /> since the Government were the targets of a sustained and scurrilous campaign because they insisted that, on the death of a husband, a wife should have, in relation to his property, legal rights deriving from her status as a wife and not, as the critics of the Government wanted, a law under which a wife as such would have no rights at all, and could benefit only if she could go into court and prove she needed the money.</P>
    <P>If there are any remaining areas of inequality in the legal field, they can only be minimal ones and I have no doubt that they will be pointed out by the Commission on the Status of Women which was appointed by the Government in 1970.</P>

      <P>I accept the good intentions of the Department of Justice in regard to the status of women and I accept the validity of the Minister's claim that a good deal of progress has been made.  I was interested to see that the Minister had no authoritative version of what the judge said because I have, in fact, a transcript of what the judge said.  It may not be an authoritative one; that may be the outlet the Minister is using; but I think it is a transcript of the words the judge used. The content of that is at variance with the content of the Minister's reply because the judge in this case who, I think, was acting out of a desire to point a defect in our law and with the objective of having our law amended, indicated that the relevant law&mdash;I understand I cannot quote, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;had been abolished in England for over 125 years.  The abolition was in 1857.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question, a Cheann Comhairle.  I will draw to a close as quickly as I am able.  The justice in this case made it clear in <Col N="258" /> charging the jury that they were to regard, as in English law, the wife as a chattel, as something that the husband owned and that they could compensate him just as they would compensate him for a thoroughbred mare or a cow.  Those words, which are very shocking and very offensive to women, were used in addressing a jury by an Irish judge who, we must assume, knows the law and we must assume that the charge to the jury in this case was correct.  In view of that, it seems to me that the Minister's reply is, shall we say, disappointing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset of my reply, I do not want to comment on what was said in the particular case and this is especially so in view of the fact that the period for an appeal in that case has not expired and for all I know there may well be an appeal. I do not want to prejudice the rights of either party.  What is not in dispute is that the tort of criminal conversation is still part of our law but the Deputy may be misled into believing that a similar right has not very recently existed elsewhere.  I draw his attention in particular to the provisions of section 41 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1965, in England, which sets out in statutory form the precise same right of action under statute as exists in our common law tort of criminal conversation.  In fact, subsection (2) of that section refers specifically to the old tort of criminal conversation and says that the court is to decide the matter in the same way. That was in a 1965 Act in Britain.  In an Act of 1970, that particular section was repealed as from 1st January, 1971. Therefore, it is only in the past 18 months that the substance of the tort <Col N="259" /> about which we are talking at the moment has been repealed elsewhere. It is by no means clear that the existence of this tort is in any way detrimental to the status of women. Equally, it would appear&mdash;without wanting to make any comment on any recent case&mdash;that the jury in a particular case recently certainly, by their award, did not regard the tort or the right given as anachronistic.</P>

      <P>This is a matter for Dublin Corporation and the Garda. Following the installation of traffic light signals at the junction of Church Street and Inns Quay, these authorities imposed a prohibition on parking at all times for a distance of 120 feet back from the light signals on the river side of Inns Quay.  This was done <Col N="268" /> to ensure the effective use of the signals by securing that the inside traffic lane is kept free from turning traffic, thereby preventing congestion on the approach to the signals.

      <P>I am satisfied that the local authorities have made good progress to date in providing an efficient fire service, with modern buildings and standardised equipment, and that the process of improvement is continuing.  Certain aspects of the fire service are being reviewed in the context of local government reorganisation generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the basic and further training schemes arranged by the Department, there are now 86 qualified instructors throughout the country and these will be of great help in improving further the efficiency of local brigades.  These courses are <Col N="271" /> being maintained and, in addition, more specialised courses for qualified instructors have been introduced.  The question of the need for further courses is under constant review.</P>

      <P>The matter is a very important one and always has been considered as such by my Department. The work that is being carried out by the Fire Officers' Association and the local authorities is urgent and necessary but I would not agree entirely with the Deputy's suggestion that the matter is any more urgent now than what it was, say, six months ago or at any other time in the past. The matter will receive top priority in the Department and I hope to be able to announce some fairly substantial improvements in the whole situation following the review.  The review will be a comprehensive one but it is not completed yet.</P>

      <P>I advised the Deputy in reply to a question on 8th March last that arrangements had been made to replace an aerial cable between Galway and a point some four miles from Tuam and to renew an underground section of cable from that point to Tuam and that it was likely that this work would take about six months to complete.  It is now expected that the work will be completed and additional circuits brought into service between Galway and Tuam by the end of July. Some additional circuits have recently been provided between Galway and Dublin and more will be brought into service over the next few weeks.

      <P>Work has been in progress since March last on installing equipment to increase the circuit capacity of the cable between Kanturk and Mallow.

I have discussed this matter with telephone operators and with the supervisor at Mallow and they tell me that the only solution is the provision of another switchboard at Mallow; otherwise the position will worsen day by day.  A couple of weeks ago the Minister told me that an automatic dialling service would not be introduced into that area for three or four years.  That was a vague answer.  I suggest that the Minister should make further inquiries and try to solve the problem by providing an improved service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a recent newspaper article which contains a statement to the effect mentioned by the Deputy.  It appears that the statement compares an estimate made in 1970 by RTE for the first year of partial operation of Radio na Gaeltachta with the most recent estimate made by RTE for the operation during the current year of a more developed service than provided for in the 1970 estimate.  I understand that apart from the effect of the greater degree of development of the service in its first year the increase is attributable to the general rise in costs since 1970 and some underestimation of staffing and other costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there was a 100 per cent increase.  It was a 91 per cent increase.  I am told the increase is attributable, first, to the fact that for part of the current year Radio na Gaeltachta will be operating from three studios in Connemara and from one in each of the counties Donegal and Kerry and will be broadcasting from three medium waves and three very high frequency transmitters instead of one medium wave transmitter. Another reason is the higher staff costs and artistes' fees than were estimated originally.  This was largely because of a greater development of service.  Yet another reason is the general increase in price levels since 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I do not intend to take up the time of the House for very long in opposing these regulations but I do not think I would be discharging my duties to the people who elected me if I did not speak on them.  The regulations proposed involve the establishment of Comhairle na nOspidéal, being a body referred to in section 41 of the Act.  My serious objection to the composition of that body is that they are heavily loaded in favour of the medical profession and I ask the Minister to consider the advisability of handing control of the hospitals in this country to a board composed entirely, practically, of the medical profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister will appoint all 23 members of the board and it is stated in the regulations that not fewer than 12 of them will be registered medical practitioners engaged in a consultant capacity in the provision of hospital services.  I do not wish to be unduly critical of the medical profession or of any professional body but it appears to me that each of these consultants will have a vested interest in the running of a hospital. The danger is that they will be guided entirely, perhaps, or to a large extent <Col N="283" /> at any rate, by the interests of the medical staffs of the hospitals.</P>
    <P>I think that on such a board it would be necessary to have medical people in an advisory capacity, in a position to tender advice on the running of hospitals, on the appointment of medical staff and that sort of thing, but I think it is entirely wrong and a dangerous departure to constitute those boards in such a way that the medical staff will have control.  That is what we are proposing to do.</P>
    <P>I know that people are of the opinion that the health boards which have been set up are entirely bureaucratic, that again in that case they are being handed over to the medical profession and associated professions.  That is a retrograde step.  I think the majority on those boards should be elected representatives, people who would have to answer to those who elected them. The result then would be that in most cases, certainly in medical matters, the board would always be guided by the professional members of the board. Then, in matters of principle not concerned with the staffing of hospitals or the treatment of patients, the views of the elected representatives would prevail.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for any professional man to see things only through his own professional eyes.  It is very easy for any member of a profession to believe that the rights and privileges of his profession relating to certain matters should prevail, and it is very easy for any of us to be irritable and short tempered with people who put forward views with which we do not agree.</P>
    <P>No matter how long I speak I could not improve on the points I have been trying to make.  It is simply that I think it is fundamentally wrong that in something so important to the people who are ill in hospital and to their relatives as the running of our hospitals control should be handed over to a body who have a vested interest.  I say that because, without being unduly critical or offensive, the staffs of these hospitals are, in effect, the officers or servants of the public. They are there to serve the public on, <Col N="284" /> I immediately concede, reasonable conditions.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer that the medical staffs of our hospitals should work in conditions as nearly ideal as possible.  For instance, I do not believe it is possible for a surgeon to operate with any degree of comfort in a one-surgeon hospital.  The days of such hospitals have gone.  There will have to be larger staffs and conditions will have to be improved to such an extent that doctors, whether general practitioners, specialists or consultants, will have reasonable hours off, a reasonable number of days off, weekends off, but I do not concede that it is prudent to hand over the complete administration or control of hospitals to people who have a vested interest in one point of view.  I say that is not prudent.  I am not seeking to cast any reflection on the medical profession. They are human beings.  They are subject to the shortcomings of human nature.  But that is exactly what I fear.  The regional health boards have not been, as I said, very long in operation, but the general feeling is that they will be run in a bureaucratic fashion right from the top down.  Even in this House we now have the Minister refusing to answer questions and saying that such and such is a matter for the health board.  That is a development I do not like.  It has come since the establishment of the health boards.  After the boards were first set up it was possible to get an answer from the Minister on health matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I was, Sir, pointing out that I do not approve of the regional health boards' method of operating and I feared there was a trend towards bureaucracy creeping into the administration of the health services.  I made a point that the Minister is not prepared to answer questions relating to administrative matters.  The Minister resented that and told me I need not flog that horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> After the health boards were set up the Minister freely answered questions relating to my region.  I can think of one question which was very effective, a question relating to the placement of a mentally retarded child.  That child was placed within a matter of weeks. However, when I put down further questions, the Minister took the attitude that the matter was a matter for the regional health board.  Was that, I wonder, the Minister's own idea or is this the attitude of the health board? Is it their attitude that they cannot be bothered supplying information to the Department for transmission to Deputies in Leinster House?  If that is the way in which this attitude towards questions arises, then I deprecate it very much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Then I would ask the Minister to review his attitude and to preserve democracy here.  Any questions I put down were put down only because the child could not be placed for seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am making a comparison between the attitude which prevailed under health boards and the attitude I fear will prevail under the board we are setting up now.  If you have a board loaded in favour of the administrators of the hospital, and if you have a Minister for Health who will not answer questions here relating to the administration of that hospital, but will rather refer one back to the hospital board, a board which is loaded in favour of the administrators, then where does democracy go?  What becomes of the rights of the citizens? How is a citizen to make a complaint? How is he to get his rights?  This is something about which I am fearful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital board, so-called, consists of 23 people and at least 12 of these must be consultants.  I understand all of them will be appointed by the Minister.  The chairman and vice-chairman will be appointed by the Minister.  On the discussion on the <Col N="286" /> Health Act here we nearly had a standup fight in order to get the concession that a majority of the regional health boards must be elected representatives. I remember a very long debate and the Minister yielded; he conceded that a majority, 17 out of 32, would have to be elected representatives.  When you come to the regional hospital boards you have the same thing again.</P>
    <P>There shall be thirty-two members of the Dublin Regional Hospital Board, made up of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) four persons appointed by the Eastern Health Board, four persons appointed by the Midland Health Board, four persons appointed by the North-Eastern Health Board and four persons appointed by the South-Eastern Health Board&mdash;</P>
    <P>then you have 16 persons appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us now, while we are considering these health regulations, what type of person he intends to appoint, what type of appointees will make up the 16 persons he will appoint.  Will they be elected representatives?  Will they be members of the medical profession? This is important.  It is very important in relation to the little interlude we had before I rose to speak because a ruling was made that people who had spoken before would not be allowed to speak again since they had an opportunity to put their points when the Health Estimate and these regulations were being debated as a package.</P>
    <P>It was very significant that the Minister was prepared to allow these regulations to go to a decision of the House or a vote of the House without answering any of the points that must have been made by Deputy Clinton, Deputy Begley and other Deputies who spoke on the package.  That is why I say there is a tendency to steamroll things through the House and to show a sort of resentment at the questioning in the House of decisions by regional health boards.</P>
    <P>My fundamental objection to these regulations is, first, that there are too many boards and, secondly, that the boards will be loaded in favour of the <Col N="287" /> medical profession.  We already have regional health boards.  We are setting up regional hospital boards and a national hospital board.  These boards will be tripping each other up.  It will be very hard for a person to know where he should go for his rights and who is in control of what.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that he is asking us for a blank cheque.  He is asking us to hand over the administration of our hospitals to a board to be set up here and he should not expect to get that authority without a full discussion and a full debate in the House.  Before the voting on this matter this evening he should answer the questions that have been put.  He should tell us how he can justify writing into these regulations that out of 23 members of Comhairle na nOspidéal 12 shall be registered medical practitioners engaged in a consultant capacity in the provision of hospital services.  I want him to deal in particular with that.  That is my fundamental objection to these regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one general and one specific topic to which I should like to refer in the discussion on these draft regulations and statutory instruments.  The general topic is the topic of democracy in the selection of personnel, democracy of control of the hospital services.  We all pay lipservice to the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; but we are inclined to think it means the opportunity of electing a Government or local authorities every so often.</P>
      <P>In historical terms democracy is a new growth, a fragile growth and a partial growth.  If it is to be more than a word which is uttered by every party as something everyone agrees about at election times, systematic efforts must be made to introduce democracy into all aspects of our lives: into education which I will not pursue; into industry which I will not pursue; and into the control of our health services.  It is a fundamental question of answerability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health services become more and more expensive with every passing <Col N="288" /> year, and properly so, because knowledge is exploding and because people's desire to avail of the best current knowledge is also increasing rapidly.  Society has decided that it is prepared to spend much more money than heretofore on the provision of health services, medical services and hospitals.  In the end, however, we raise this money, it comes from the public.  It comes from the public just as much if it is dropped in 10p pieces into cans on street corners as if it comes from a local authority or from a national Government.</P>
    <P>In the matter of membership of the single national council&mdash;and I am now referring to the draft regulations &mdash;we find in the section on membership, section 5, that all persons appointed to the council shall be selected for appointment by the Minister.  This is to operate for a period of 3½ years from now, or a period of three full calendar years from the beginning of 1973.</P>
    <P>I am not a doctor but as a veterinary surgeon I am a member of a profession which has some minor similarities.  As I think everyone in this House does, I profoundly admire the individual action of very many dedicated doctors, but I cannot say that I admire the collective action of the medical profession as a whole in the same unreserved way that I admire so many individual doctors.</P>
    <P>Very often the doctors themselves show a contempt for democracy.  They are a clique.  They are, in the old-fashioned term, a mystery.  They despise the ability of the public to apprehend their mystery and they desire to keep the public at arm's length, in ignorance and out of the way as much as they possibly can.  This attitude is bad medicine.  It belongs more in the last century than in this. Not only is the knowledge of the public rising rapidly, but the responsibility of the medical profession to explain to the public what they are about, and the way in which they are discharging their public duty, is increasing all the time.</P>
    <P>Yet the tendency among leading doctors, among what one might call the politicians of the medical profession <Col N="289" /> rather than the day to day journeymen, the GPs, who are admired and respected by everybody, is to hand down the succession from man to man, to favour the chap they like, to go on gathering the chosen few into this select band, this special élite, the people known as consultants and specialists.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that beginning in 1976 we may have some other method of selection, one would hope a democratic method of apointment but, by the time 3½ years have elapsed, individual cliques will have dug themselves in, and then we will have the possibility of a self-perpetuating oligarchy contemptuous of democracy and not willing to be answerable to the people who in the long run are putting up the money, that is, the public at large.  That is my general objection.</P>
    <P>This is my general objection, but when one comes to consider the actual sections of the draft regulations, there is a more specific and particular objection relating to appointment.  We have an historical distinction in this country between local authority and voluntary hospitals and I want to make a distinction in my attitude to the voluntary hospitals as I made a distinction in my attitude to the medical profession as a whole as distinct from the attitude to particular doctors. There is admiration of the services to the nation from very many voluntary hospitals.  This will be shared&mdash;there will be no possible disagreement on that.  Yet to the extent that many of them have roots in the past, many have a strong tradition, many have a specially entrenched position, they are unwilling in the changing circumstances where the vast majority of their money comes not from voluntary collection but from the public purse to change their control into a democratic form of control where they are answerable to the public.</P>
    <P>I would refer to sub-article (4) of page 6 of this statutory instrument which sets out that regional hospitals shall exercise the function of appointment, which is referred to in section (k) of sub-article (8), and then sets out that this function of appointment by the regional boards shall be exercised <Col N="290" /> only with the consent of the body or bodies responsible for the administration of the hospital or hospitals concerned.  That is fine in relation to hospitals where there is a measure of democratic control, local authority hospitals, but in my view, it is not fine in relation to voluntary hospitals.  What is built into what I have quoted is a veto on the power of selection of the already not sufficiently democratic regional boards. Already on the National Council, Comhairle na nOspidéal itself, I am disappointed to see that of the 23 persons, 12 shall not just be registered medical practitioners&mdash;that is perhaps arguable&mdash;but they shall be registered medical practitioners engaged in a consultant capacity and this is already building the strength of what I call a self-perpetuating oligarchy, a self-perpetuating élite.  They already have too much power given to them in the composition of the boards, but when that has been done first, they then hand away a veto to an even more elitist and self-perpetuating oligarchy running very many of our voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>The net outcome of this is that the maverick doctor, the doctor, perhaps, admirable medically but with strong social attitudes, the man who is outraged&mdash;this is hypothetical obviously &mdash;possibly by what he sees in certain areas, the man who has very strong opinions on contraception as certain doctors have&mdash;there is a veto against that man being handed away against a man who from his professional viewpoint has expressed outrage at housing standards, who has possibly expressed outrage at nutritional standards, dental care, the treatment of unmarried mothers&mdash;a whole lot of these areas in which the most humane, the noblest of the medical profession do express concern and a sense of their own responsibility, of their own outrage.</P>

      <P>The debate will be perpetuated if we are now to debate what will come before the House as a second set of regulations, namely, the selection procedure, if the Houses choose to give it to Comhairle na nOspidéal.  It does not arise in this <Col N="291" /> debate and I made it absolutely clear that Comhairle na nOspidéal will itself have to be formed and start to study how in relation to consultation with other bodies and with me, it would select so that the question of not selecting somebody who is a socialist doctor simply does not arise. They have only the power of withholding or granting sanction for the post of a consultant and I, from my financial control, will have the ultimate decision in every case, withholding or granting sanction for the making of an appointment in the consultant field in this country.  They have no selection procedure, so that although I am very interested to hear what the Deputy says, it does not arise on these regulations.  It will come before the House later and we can then discuss whether the system of selection is likely to preclude socialists or people interested in housing.</P>

      <P>If I am in error, it is a genuine error on my part and I apologise if I am wrong.  The Minister introduced the word &ldquo;socialist&rdquo;.  I was expressing a category of doctors who have a sense of profound concern and outrage at what they see in our society.  They generally are socialists but it is not an invariable one to one correspondence.  While I take the Minister's point, I cannot agree that it represents the situation, unless I misunderstand the documents we are now considering.  I take it that his point is that he has the ultimate right of appointment, but what I am worried about is not the power of appointment by the bodies responsible for the administration of the hospital or hospitals. Let me be more precise about it What I am worried about is not the power of initiation of appointment but the power of veto on appointment by the boards of voluntary hospitals, and that unless I misunderstand it entirely, does come up under these regulations. Because it is divided into sections and <Col N="292" /> subsections (a), (b) and (c), I may be unclear because I am not absolutely happy in my own mind how I should name each of these subdivisions in order to be understood.</P>

All that can be argued and I hope the Deputy will take my word for it that no selection procedure is at the moment envisaged.  He can argue all these points when I come before the House as I hope by about next February or March to complete the powers of Comhairle na nOspidéal to deal with the question of selection procedure.</P>

      <P>I am quite happy to do this, but quite genuinely we are at cross-purposes because I was not <Col N="293" /> entering my doubts about the mechanism of selection of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  I was entering my doubts about the veto which is here being given to the boards of the voluntary hospitals.  Perhaps we could resolve this if I asked the Minister a very brief and direct question.  If it is answered satisfactorily, I shall sit down immediately. Am I wrong in thinking that article 8 (4) on page 6 of the statutory instrument confers a veto on the boards of voluntary hospitals if they wish to exercise such veto.  Am I wrong in that understanding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct that we had a difference of a point of view between some consultants and the voluntary hospitals, so what we had to put in this regulation was that if and when there is a selection procedure devised it is unlikely that a consultant will be appointed by the regional hospital board to work under the regional hospital board unless he worked for more than one hospital. Most of the hospitals seemed to feel that if the doctor was going to work solely for one hospital he should not receive the type of contract that would be given to him by a regional hospital board.  None of that is of real significance because the regional hospital boards have no power to select in this regulation.  The whole of that matter has been postponed and we could even get an agreement between the voluntary hospital authority, the regional hospital boards and myself that it would be possible to appoint a consultant without the consent of the voluntary hospitals.  All that can be discussed again when we have the selection procedures before the House.</P>

I entirely accept that the method of selection has not yet been worked out but it does seem to me that a veto is being handed to groups that are what I have called self-perpetuating oligarchies, that the operation of real democracy in this matter is being inhibited. The Minister's explanation, far from <Col N="294" /> removing my objections, has strengthened them.  I want to read that on to the record and reiterate my dissatisfaction.</P>

The regional hospital boards have a budgetary assistance function in relation to the budgets of the voluntary hospitals as they come before the health board and to me. They have a research function on the future of the hospitals and they have a function to encourage better management in the hospitals.  They do not run the hospitals, either the voluntary hospitals or the health board hospitals. Neither does Comhairle na nOspidéal run the voluntary hospitals.

      <P>to consider any proposal of a health board or other body referred to in paragraph (a) for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  a change in the user of a hospital maintained by it,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): On a point of order, these regulations propose to establish regional hospital boards and clause 8 of the document which Deputy Enright is dealing with proceeds to set out the functions of <Col N="298" /> these hospital boards and some of them are particularly alarming when you consider that they will be handed over to the people who are employed in the hospitals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the Deputy.  The Deputy is right.  They will have these powers but they will be recommending powers.  First, very definitely, the county advisory committee would have to be consulted in regard to any change of function and, secondly, they can make no ultimate decision because any decision they could make about the closing of a hospital or changing the function of a hospital would involve a financial decision on my part, so that I am ultimately responsible and they will not have overall control.  They are bound to come back to me and I would have to take full responsibility, with the consent of the Oireachtas, for the decisions they make in that regard. That applies to virtually every change in the health service.  It requires my consent because, first of all, I have a national health policy which I will continue to operate and my successor, whoever he may be, will continue to operate and I also have financial control. So, the Deputy can be sure that the regional hospital boards will not be able to make decisions making radical changes in the characteristics or the functions of hospitals without its coming before me and, therefore, before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one very serious point which is completely relevant to clause 8.  We hope that the regional hospitals will be built.  As to the functions of the hospital boards, the Minister says there will be no change, that they are completely under his authority.  That is fair enough.  I agree on that.  In regard to the building of hospitals or factories, when questions are asked about the building not being proceeded with we are told that it is due to sufficient capital not being available and so on.  That is very dangerous.  There will be 23 members of Comhairle na nOspidéal, 12 of whom will be medical practitioners engaged in a consultancy <Col N="299" /> capacity.  The Minister has the power of appointment of the others also.  In other words, he has complete power of appointment.</P>
      <P>In the Cork Regional Hospital Board there will be 16 persons, four persons appointed by the Mid-Western Health Board and four persons appointed by the Southern Health Board and eight persons appointed by the Minister.  It appears that the Minister will have complete and unfettered control of the regional hospital boards and of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  This is a very serious matter for everybody in the country. The Minister will have control over the question of whether regional hospitals will or will not be built.</P>
      <P>There are many county hospitals which are&mdash;I hesitate to say being scaled down&mdash;at the very most maintaining the <i>status quo.</i> I am giving the Minister the benefit of the doubt in saying that.  County hospitals in the health board area in which I am situated will be maintained barely at existing levels.  The people in the area agree to this in the hope that a regional hospital will be built in Tullamore.  The Minister will have sole discretion as to whether or not the regional hospital will be built.  It is a very dangerous situation that we have to depend completely on the Government having the money available to build these hospitals.  Deputies can be put off indefinitely on the plea that the capital is not available.</P>

      <P>The Minister states that he has financial control at the present time.  A question may arise as to whether a hospital is necessary in an area and it may be the case that money may be needed for something else.  It is dangerous to allow this to happen.  The Minister mentioned that no changes would be made with regard to the scaling down of hospitals until consultation had been held with the county councils' advisory committees. I have been a member of Offaly County Council for five years and it is my opinion that the submissions of county councils have not received the recognition to which they are entitled.</P>

When the regional hospital boards at Dublin, Cork and Galway are set up, the Minister will have complete control over them.  In Comhairle na nOspidéal there will be 23 members of whom 12 will be medical practitioners engaged in a consultant capacity in the provision of hospital services.  Deputy Keating made the point, with which I agree, that the consultants will not be in close touch with the ordinary people to the same <Col N="301" /> extent as would general practitioners. Medical practitioners should have as decisive a voice in this matter as consultants.</P>
    <P>The Minister also has power to appoint the remainder of the board and this is not a good thing.  This House should not hand over all of its authority.  In addition, the county councils contribute by means of the rates.  It is not good that complete authority should be taken from the local representatives.  The health schemes are becoming too remote from the people and this is not desirable.  If this should happen we would have a dangerous situation&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; advisedly.</P>
    <P>There are 30 members on the Midland Health Board, 16 of whom are public representatives.  Members of the Midland Health Board form part of the Dublin Regional Hospital Board.  On the latter board there are 32 members consisting of four from the Eastern Health Board, four from the Midland Health Board, four persons appointed by the North-Eastern Health Board and four from the South-Eastern Health Board.  The Midland Health Board comprises four counties and there will be one representative from each county.  When one considers that out of the 32 members 16 will be appointed by the Minister one realises what is involved.  On the Dublin Regional Board only 16 persons will be answerable to the people; the other 16 are appointees of the Minister and do not have to answer to anyone but to him.  It is my opinion that representatives on the board should have to answer to the people.</P>
    <P>In his explanatory memorandum, the Minister has stated that the chairman and vice-chairman of Comhairle na nOspidéal will be selected by him from among the members.  In this instance the Minister is taking too much responsibility and I do not think it is wise.  In view of the fact that the regional hospital boards will be answerable only to the Minister, it is alarming to read that the discontinuance of any hospital will be a matter for the regional hospital boards.  I could not vote for this regulation if this is allowed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> In the midland health area we have agreed that a regional hospital will be set up at Tullamore and I am prepared to stand by that decision.  However, there will only be one representative from each of the four counties on the Midland Health Board.  Many of the people in the health boards have grave misgivings about this regulation.  The public representative is being cut out completely in Comhairle na nOspidéal. He will not have any voice in that council.  The 23 members will not be responsible to anyone but to the Minister. The regional hospital boards are so rigged that they will be answerable only to the Minister.  This is a very dangerous practice.  The matter almost slipped through the House this evening without there being any opportunity for a frank discussion of it.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Local Elections Bill went through the House.  We have now allowed the postponement of the local elections.  If important issues are allowed to go through the House without being opposed, the 144 members who comprise this House are letting democracy slip from their grasp.  In conscience I could not vote for the regulations before the House because as the boards are set up they are too far removed from the people who will be using the hospitals and these are the people who have a right to a say in the running of their hospitals.  They should have the right to elect people to the administration of their hospitals and if the boards are not running the hospitals properly, they should be answerable to the people who use the hospitals.  From these regulations we can see that there will be no consultant in the country who will be answerable to the people.  Neither will the other people appointed to the boards be answerable to the people and neither will the 16 persons appointed by the Minister have to answer to the people.</P>
    <P>I would agree with these regulations if Comhairle na nOspidéal were a democratic body on which public representatives would have a 50/50 say. They should have a casting vote but I would go along with a 50/50 representation. There is not sufficient public representation on the Dublin regional <Col N="303" /> hospital boards.  I am sure there will be grave misgivings throughout the country when the people realise what are to be the functions of the regional hospital boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally I do not speak on health matters but when anything of this particular nature comes before the House I am inclined to contribute.  This is a piece of specialised bureaucracy of the type that the Minister in particular is very fond of. These regulations are based entirely on the premise that the Department of Health are all important in this matter and that nobody else has any say. The introductory section of the regulations is contrary entirely to what is normal practice in statutory instruments. This reads that:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health. . . . hereby makes the following Regulations as respects which, pursuant to the said section 41, a draft has been approved by a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It goes on to describe the regulations. When the Health Act of 1970 was going through the House, I presumed to rise on Committee Stage to ask a question of the Minister but the Minister became very angry with me.  Months afterwards I had to help the Minister out in relation to that Bill.  On the second occasion, many months later, the Minister's attitude towards me was very different when I asked him a question.  In the meantime he had been put through the mill by the House.  According to the regulations, Comhairle na nOspidéal shall consist of 23 persons all of whom are to be appointed by the Minister and the majority of whom are to be consultants. There is a special provision that biochemists, top grade, and senior registrars shall be prescribed officers.  In other words, they also may come in but nobody else may.  This is a real example of the top echelons of staff only being entitled to be appointed by the Minister to Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations go on to deal section by section with the Dublin, Cork and Galway regional hospital boards <Col N="304" /> and, eventually, in section 8 to define the functions of each board as distinct from the special functions which are embodied in the earlier sections of the regulations.  Let us take the Dublin Regional Hospital Board.  We are told that there shall be 32 members of this board made up of:</P>
    <P>(a)  four persons appointed by the Eastern Health Board, four persons appointed by the Midland Health Board, four persons appointed by the North-Eastern Health Board and four persons appointed by the South-Eastern Health Board and</P>
    <P>(b)  sixteen persons appointed by the Minister after consultation with, or on the nomination of, such bodies representative of persons concerned with the provision of hospital services and such other bodies (including bodies engaged in medical education) as he considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister can appoint anybody he wishes as one half of the members of the board.  The Department of Health become a dictator and can do what they wish in relation to a matter of this nature which concerns the people for whom the services are being provided under the Health Act of 1970.</P>
    <P>We come now to the functions of the regional hospital boards which, fundamentally, are to operate the regulations under which the hospitals are conducted and to lay down the rules under which appointments are made. There is one particular function that I shall refer to at some length.  I refer to 8 (1) (f) which says: &ldquo;to advise hospital authorities in its area.&rdquo;  What does that mean?  What is the significance of that in regulations which are supposed to deal with administrative matters?  Regulations are administrative law and according to article 8 (1) (f) the functions of a regional hospital shall be to advise hospital authorities in its area.  What significance has this?</P>

      <P>This means that regional hospital boards, because they would have consultants from voluntary hospitals which the health boards do not run, would be able to advise the health boards how better the voluntary hospitals in an area could co-ordinate with the health boards in an area to provide better service at possibly less cost and utilise all available beds.  It is advice in relation to the combination of voluntary hospital beds and health board hospital beds in the area.  That is fairly harmless.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because, in fact, the Government in no circumstances will accept an amendment to any Bill or give any standing whatever to the Opposition parties.  It is no wonder that after 15 years in office they would become arrogant.  This is the reverse of that, because advice is something you give people if you cannot coerce them.  The remainder of the article is to the effect that the regional hospital boards shall do this and that&mdash;&ldquo;advise the Minister . . . to make appropriate representations . . . to govern . . . to examine . . . to allocate . . . to control the expenditure of capital funds allocated by it under paragraph (i).&rdquo;  The Minister himself under these regulations has control of major capital expenditure.  He will not give these hospital bodies constituted by himself responsibility for major projects; he wants to keep that under his own thumb even though these boards are composed of senior people.  He is <Col N="306" /> giving them no real control over expenditure.</P>
      <P>No wonder the cost of hospital services has gone sky-high and that the cost of a hospital bed in a voluntary hospital in this city today is £75 a week for a private patient.  If anybody is unfortunate enough not to be in the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme he may suddenly wake up to find himself a bankrupt or the equivalent of a bankrupt if he has to stay in hospital for a number of weeks.</P>
      <P>Article 8 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>to organise advisory services on management for hospitals.</P>
      <P>This is the old game of the Government getting in consultants wasting the people's money.  The Government have never stopped this game of throwing money around&mdash;McKinsey and Co. and all the others.  The result is that the value of money is down in this country and we have no option when Britain allows the £ to sink but to allow the Irish £ to sink with it.</P>
      <P>Article 8 (2) says:</P>
      <P>In considering a proposal referred to in subarticle (1) (c) (i) or (iii) of this article, a regional hospital shall request and have regard to the views of the relevant local committee established under section 7 of the Act and the views of any other hospital authority . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a good deal about the business of providing that so-an-so shall consult with somebody else.  This is of no significance whatever.  When it is provided that one Department shall consult another Department they write to the other Department and the other Department say: &ldquo;We do not think you should do this.&rdquo;  The first Department then write back and say: &ldquo;You can say what you like about it.  We shall do it in any case.&rdquo; That is the end of the game if the second Department have any common sense, particularly if it is the Department to which I was attached.  If it is provided that such-an-such a Department shall consult the Department of Finance and if they stand on their hind legs they can tell the Department of Finance to jump in the Liffey.  And this is done.  If the Department of <Col N="307" /> Finance have any sense they say: &ldquo;Very well.  You have consulted us. You have done what you are bound to do under the regulations.&rdquo;  And that is the end of it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Shall have regard to the views . . . &rdquo; All they need say if any rumpus arises is: &ldquo;Yes, we had regard to their views and we decided to do such-and-such.&rdquo; This whole business is gobbledegook of the first order and has no significance in regard to genuine administration.</P>
    <P>Regulation 11 says:</P>
    <P>Any reference to a health board in sections . . . shall be construed as including a reference to a regional hospital board.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of omnibus clause that Ministers and their advisers love: &ldquo;such-and-such a thing shall be held to mean something else.&rdquo;  As I said before: &ldquo;Two shall be held to be equal to five,&rdquo; any way you like to talk about it.  John O'Donovan shall be same as the chairman.  This kind of thing is done.  I am not drawing a long bow.  This kind of thing has gone completely out of hand in this country. There is literally no restriction any longer on what the Executive may do. They continually put clauses into Acts enabling them to do what they like and if anybody says that is not good enough they refer, as the Minister did a while ago, to the Act and say: &ldquo;It was in the Act&rdquo;.  And the House has authorised the Act.  So if the House chooses to give away the democratic rights of the people this is an occasion when the Houses of the Oireachtas are within their rights to do wrong, and once they have done wrong nobody can catch up on them, nobody can do anything about it.</P>
    <P>These regulations are brought in on the second last day of the month and are to come into operation at the end of the month.  In other words, the House is put under pressure to push these regulations through at a moment's notice.  The printers' mark on the last page is 5/72, the month of May, yet here we are at the end of June discussing whether the Minister is to have power to make these regulations. This is the kind of action by <Col N="308" /> the Executive that makes people worry about democracy, and the next general election will be about democracy and nothing else.  It will be about whether you can have democracy when you have this so-called administrative law, which is not administrative law at all but the absolute control, the dictatorship, of the Executive.</P>

      <P>I have 29 years experience in this House and this is the first time that the unusual circumstances have arisen in which a Minister has moved a motion at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and a Deputy who has spoken on the Health Estimate is not allowed to speak on the regulations because he is said to have spoken already on a motion that was not before the House until 4 o'clock this afternoon.  I do not know how that ruling came to be made but it is not in accordance with the democratic principles of this House.</P>
      <P>I take grave exception to whoever made that ruling.  I was present in the House at 4 o'clock this afternoon when for the first time the motion was moved, after Questions. A Deputy then presented himself to speak and was told he could not address himself to the motion because he had spoken on it previously. I do not like to challenge the Chair's ruling but I find it hard to understand how any Deputy could be ruled out of order as having already spoken on a motion which was not moved until 4 p.m. today.  It is something on which the Ceann Comhairle should express an opinion because it concerns the rights and the liberties of every Member of the House.  One thing that is rich and precious to us all is the right to address Parliament in compliance with the rules and order of procedure. Deputy Clinton has been treated most unreasonably.</P>

      <P>The position as put to me is that anybody who spoke before cannot speak again.  The only <Col N="310" /> discussion at the moment is on the health regulations.  With regard to any comments to be made on Deputy Clinton, I wish to point out that there was a ruling by the Ceann Comhairle, it was discussed here and finalised, and I should be obliged if the Deputy would continue to discuss the regulations only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comply with the Chair's wishes but I heartily compliment myself on not having spoken on the Health Estimate because if I had I presume I would not be allowed to address the House on the regulations.  I presume that when Deputy Clinton spoke on the Estimate he was under the impression that when the motion came before the House he would be permitted to speak on it.  I would feel extremely disturbed had I spoken on the Estimate and was thereby deprived of the right to address the House on the regulations.</P>
      <P>The regulations are of a type one would expect to be presented by Fidel Castro.  They are not democratic or in line with the principles of the Health Act on which the Minister has been so vocal in the House and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to compare now the powers exercised by health boards in the past and the powers to be exercised by the health boards set up by the Minister in the last 18 months.  I recommend strongly that these proposed regulations be rejected by the House.  Under them, not alone will the teeth be extracted, so to speak, from regional health boards but the very limbs will be amputated.  What is in the Minister's mind?  There is more behind these regulations than would appear on the surface.  They are, in my opinion, evilly conceived.  There is a close resemblance here between Health and Education.  Health and Education are two of the most vital Departments in any democracy.  An attempt is being made to remove education from the religious orders and from private sectors and now we see an attempt being made by the Department of Health to take control of the hospitals out of the hands of the religious orders and out of the hands of the voluntary hospitals. We owe a deep debt of gratitute to these institutions.  These are institutions <Col N="311" /> which have earned public confidence. Outstanding work has been done by St. Vincent's Hospital out in Elm Park, by the Mater Hospital, by the Richmond Hospital and by all the other hospitals here in this city and throughout the country.  Very few institutions enjoy the respect and confidence that these hospitals have earned.  It was in these hospitals that many people were restored to a new life as a result of the care and attention bestowed on them as patients in these hospitals.</P>
    <P>When the Health Bill was under discussion here we were not told that the thin edge of the wedge would be inserted through the medium of regulations to deprive those responsible for the running of these hospitals of the right to run them.  As in education, we find here the icy grip of bureaucracy on health.  These regulations are being introduced for no good purpose and for no good reason.  The only purpose is to channel health into the hands of the civil servants and the Minister. These regulations confer extraordinary powers and, whilst the House has every guarantee of integrity with the present Minister in office, there is no guarantee for the future.  But it would be quite wrong for Parliament to confer such far-reaching powers on any Minister for Health.  It is all very well for the Minister to tell the House that he is quite satisfied and, if the House gives him the authority, he will administer these regulations with integrity and with impartiality.  What guarantee is there for the future?  In five, ten or 15 years time there may be a Minister for Health who will use these regulations for party political advantage.  He may fall the victim of some clique which may want greater control over our hospitals.  It is wrong to give the kind of powers sought in these regulations to any Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I want to give this House the reasons why I have such strong opposition to these regulations.  The Minister is well aware that many of us in this House have been associated with the old health boards for many years past. Many of us have also been associated with local authorities.  Our primary concern was the welfare of the aged, <Col N="312" /> the ill and the disabled.  As public representatives we devoted our energies and time to the building up of a good hospital structure.</P>
    <P>If these regulations are passed tonight they will completely undo the valuable work done by members of the health boards, members of the old boards of health, members of local authorities and hospital committees. They will undo the valuable and useful work performed in the voluntary hospitals such as St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, the Mater, the Richmond and other outstanding hospitals that have gained not only national recognition but international recognition for their care and attention and devotion to duty.</P>
    <P>These regulations have been put into print and circulated.  Will the Minister tell us what were the views of the Government in general when he was seeking approval to have these regulations printed and circulated?  At 4.5 p.m. today it was his intention and the intention of the Government to sneak these regulations through the House without notice, without discussion, without debate, in order to pull the wool over the eyes of Members of the House who are keenly concerned about the future of the entire hospital structure.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not be unfair.  We discussed the general functions of these boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal during the passage of the Health Act.  If the Deputy looks at section 41 of the Health Act he will find that the main concept is there so this was discussed at very considerable length during the passage of the Health Act.  I just want to mention that to the Deputy.  There is nothing new in the general concept of these three boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal.  The Deputy, of course, is entitled to say what he thinks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Minister that I read the Health Act line by line and section by section.  It is true that there was a vague reference to Comhairle na nOspidéal and that there were other vague references, but it is only now that we have got the orders and the regulations.  This House <Col N="313" /> should not be too hasty in passing regulations of this kind without knowing what they are doing.</P>
      <P>As I have said, there is a terrific similarity between these regulations and the trust deed associated with the community schools.  The same principle is involved.  We can deal with the community schools on another occasion. As I have pointed out, this is an attempt by the State to monopolise and completely take over education and health.  Through these regulations the health services will go out of the hands of the health boards and out of the hands of the elected representatives.</P>
      <P>It is stated: &ldquo;The Regulations shall come into operation on 1st day of July, 1972.&rdquo;  They will come into operation at the end of this week.  The Minister has not satisfied the House as to why they are necessary.  They are an expression by the Minister and the Government of no confidence in the regional health boards set up under the Health Act 18 months ago.  I should like to hear from the Minister in clear and simple terms what will be the functions of the regional health boards if we take away from them control of the hospitals, administration of the hospitals, administration of hospitals staffs and the planning, development, design and extension of hospitals.  Everything connected with hospitals will fall into the hands of Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of a health board. We discussed this matter and passed a resolution unanimously asking the Minister to defer putting these regulations into operation.  I should like to hear from the Minister how many health boards have petitioned him to defer putting them into operation. Having considered the notice given by the Department about the making of these regulations, all the health boards submitted resolutions to the Minister pointing out that before regulations of this character were made the health boards should be given an opportunity to prove themselves in relation to hospital planning and hospitals in general. Only 18 months ago the Minister addressed the health boards and pledged co-operation and support.  He expressed sympathy and asked for co-operation between the health boards and himself.  The first major issue to <Col N="314" /> arise was the taking away from the health boards of the management of the hospitals, the planning of future hospitals and the staffing of the hospitals under these regulations.</P>
    <P>All the health boards asked the Minister to do was to postpone the introduction of the regulations so that they would have an opportunity of studying, reviewing and planning, and of examining the financial aspects of future hospitals and health policy.  Is it not correct to say that practically no regional health board is in agreement with these regulations?  Is it not correct to say that practically all the health boards asked the Minister to postpone them?</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what is the urgency?  Why can he not comply with the unanimous request of so many health boards?  Why must 1st July, 1972, be the date?  Has he entered into any commitments for hospital borrowing from any international source by reason of which he must give that source a guarantee that Comhairle na nOspidéal have been set up or are about to be set up?  There must be reasons for it because no sane Minister who wants to co-operate with newly-established health boards would act in this fashion against the wishes of the health boards who asked that these regulations be deferred.  Therefore, when I read that these regulations shall come into operation on 1st July, 1972, I believe that there must be an extraordinary urgency associated with them.  I ask the Minister if the urgency is a financial one?  Must he give to some hidden, concealed hand a guarantee that the Last Post has been sounded over voluntary hospitals?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No Last Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that no Last Post has been sounded.  I put it to him that if these regulations are passed, if the House agrees to them, that in itself is the Last Post, the flag at half-mast and, in my opinion, the requiem for voluntary hospitals.  Nobody knows that better than the Minister but I think he knows what is the urgency associated with these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading the draft regulations further, <Col N="315" /> we see that during the period ending 31st December, 1975, all persons appointed to Comhairle na nOspidéal shall be selected for appointment by the Minister.  We are now in 1972 and these regulations cover the period to 31st December, 1975.  &ldquo;Shall be selected by the Minister&rdquo;&mdash;I ask is that a democratic process?  Does this not give the Minister full say and full control over the very creation and birth of Comhairle na nOspidéal?  Of course it does, and he is going to put on Comhairle na nOspidéal people who will do exactly what he wants in relation to expenditure, to planning of hospitalisation, to the setting-up of hospital extensions.  In the making of these appointments, there are to be 12 consultants, 12 people who are already associated, or will be in an official capacity associated, with the working and management of hospitals.  I do not dispute for one moment their integrity. The medical profession have an extremely high standard, but I ask the House is it right or proper that the Minister should give this power over to 12 consultants, together with 11 other people appointed by him alone&mdash;not by the health boards, not by the local authorities, not by a Committee of this House and not by the Government collectively but by the Minister himself.  I put it to the Minister that he will know the minds of these people.  He will have already sounded them and he will know the material of which they are made, and unless they are prepared to implement his policy in relation to expenditure on future hospitalisation, these people will not be appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal do not control hospital expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that this will be an occasion on which appointments by the Minister in relation to this matter will be similar to all other State appointments made by Ministers of this Government when, on practically all occasions, they appointed people who carried out their wishes.  Whether it was right or wrong, black or white, no matter what the wishes of the Minister's were, whoever they so appointed blindly carried <Col N="316" /> out their wishes.  I strongly object to the extraordinary powers the Minister is taking unto himself, not, may I say, that I am overwhelmed with suspicion of the present Minister but that I fear some reckless individual who may yet occupy the position the Minister holds may seriously abuse the power this House is now giving.  Now is the time for this House to show its disapproval by deciding that they will not trust even the present Minister with this power and authority in relation to these appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proceeding further, we find that the regulations set out that there will be three hospital boards, Cork, Galway and Dublin.  I am interested in the Dublin Hospital Board because it is the board which will be responsible for the area of the Midland Regional Health Board.  The Midland Health Board will have their representatives on the Dublin board and we will then be in the extraordinary position&mdash;I put this to the Acting Chairman as a representative for Longford-Westmeath&mdash;that the hospitals in that constituency, in Longford and Mullingar, will be in the same board area as the major hospitals of Dublin and if there is to be hospital reorganisation, extension, development and planning, the majority of the members of this board will not be from Laois-Offaly or Longford-Westmeath but from the greater Dublin area. Despite the fact that the FitzGerald Report recommended that a regional hospital be considered favourably for Tullamore in County Offaly, I venture to say, while not setting up to be a prophet, that when these regulations are passed and when the Dublin Regional Hospital Board have full control, whatever development takes place will not be in Tullamore, in Mullingar or Longford.  That is why we view this with the greatest concern and alarm.  I distinctly heard the Minister for Health tell the Midland Health Board, and other health boards assembled for the purpose of hearing his address, that the location of a regional hospital would be a matter for the boards themselves. Now we find that the boards will have no say in this.  When the Minister was addressing the health boards he consoled and gave confidence to members that in planning future regional hospitals <Col N="317" /> the health boards which he was bringing into being on that date would have this responsibility.  Now we find they have not this responsibility at all. Who did the Minister think he was fooling?  Is it not true that all the health boards have been fooled, that they thought they had power and authority and that they were responsible for health administration and hospitalisation? Now they find that that is not so, that the Minister is appointing what can be described as a ghost team who have no responsibility whatever to the public, who will not have the confidence of the public, who will be brought into being by the Minister and the Minister alone.  The electorate, the ratepaying community, will have to foot the bill but they will have no say in this matter.  Therefore, the health board which covers the area of the Acting Chairman will now have no say in the location of a midland regional hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they will.  The regional hospital board cannot decide the issue.  I explained that during the passage of the Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in these regulations.  If there is a regulation which gives authority to the health boards to decide on the location and the establishment of a hospital in any of the health board areas I would like to see it in writing but I cannot find it in these regulations.  Perhaps the Minister has a different copy of the regulations. Perhaps the Minister is dealing with the conditions that have been laid down by international financiers for the lending of money or the granting of money for hospitalisation.  I do not know.  That is what we are trying to get information on.  That is the purpose of the debate.  That is the reason why Deputy Clinton was not allowed to speak this afternoon.  Some of us must have the right and the courage to stand up and ask these questions and to insist that the Minister should not treat the House with silence or contempt but should give us all the information which the ratepaying community are entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Regional Hospital Board will be made up of four persons from <Col N="318" /> the Eastern Health Board&mdash;that is four persons from the present Dublin Health Boards&mdash;four from the Midland Health Board&mdash;of concern to the Acting Chairman and of major concern to myself as a member of that board&mdash; four persons appointed by the North-Eastern Health Board and four persons appointed by the South-Eastern Health Board.  If they had the say there would be some element of democracy in operation but these will be &ldquo;16 persons appointed by the Minister after consultation with, or on the nomination of, such bodies representative of persons concerned with the provision of hospital services and such other bodies (including bodies engaged in medical education) as he considers appropriate&rdquo;. This gives the Minister power to appoint 16 persons and these 16 persons will be carefully scrutinised by the Minister.  Their views will be well known in advance.  There will be discussions and recommendations.  We are told there may be nominations submitted to the Minister.  The Minister will not appoint anyone who will cause any degree of embarrassment to himself, to his party, or to the Health Act. He will appoint 16 people who will bend the knee to the crack of the whip of the Minister for Health.  I have no confidence in a set-up of this character.</P>
    <P>The regulation covers the establishment of the Dublin Regional Health Board.  Further on we see that the Cork and Galway boards are similarly appointed.  Let us come to the question of the function of a regional hospital board.  They shall be:</P>
    <P>to consider and keep under review the general organisation and development of in-patient and out-patient services in the hospitals administered by health boards or by bodies in its functional area which are engaged in the provision of services under the Act, with a view to promoting the organisation and development of these services in an efficient and satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that the present health boards are not carrying out their duties in an efficient and satisfactory manner? Is this not, in plain language, a slap in the teeth for the health boards appointed only 18 months ago?  Is it <Col N="319" /> not correct to say that the functions of the regional hospital board will be the very functions of the health boards at present?  Can the Minister deny that at this moment the duty of the CEOs and of our regional health boards is to keep under review the general organisation and development of the in-patient and out-patient services in hospitals administered by the health boards?  That is what they are doing at the moment. This regulation is to take from the health boards functions which they thought they would have for an indefinite period and give them to a new board being established by the satellites of the Minister for Health, appointed by him and by him alone.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the Tánaiste that when these regional hospital boards are set up, members of the existing health boards will lose interest.  Their functions will have been minimalised. Forthwith, on the passage of these regulations the hospital boards will be redundant.  Is it not correct to say that at the moment the hospital boards administer the hospitals?  The hospital board of which I am a member administers the county hospitals in Portlaoise, Tullamore, Mullingar and Longford.  The development of in-patient and out-patient hospital service will be the responsibility of the regional hospital board when these regulations are passed.  It means that the Minister for Health, without giving any reason or excuse, without giving the boards a fair chance, without giving them even an opportunity of failure &mdash;they have not been in existence for a sufficiently long period to have failed&mdash;without giving them the test of time, is taking from them the right to administer the hospital service.</P>
    <P>Who does the Tánaiste think he is fooling in relation to this matter?  I hope every hospital board will hold a special meeting or two to deal with these regulations.  I put it to the House that the CEO and his recently appointed highly expensive staff will all be declared redundant so far as the health board is concerned and will become the servants of the new hospital board to be appointed by the Minister and by him alone.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not appoint all the <Col N="320" /> members of the health boards.  County councils appointed some members. The Minister made certain appointments. He administered a very bitter pill in a sweet, attractive, chocolate coating.  The real snag is appearing. The real test is coming.  The health board which the Minister established in a semi-democratic manner are now being rendered powerless by the dictatorial establishment of a board that will have no responsibility whatever to the people or from the people, that will have no obligation whatever towards the ratepayers who will foot the bill.  All that the ratepayers will be asked to do is to pay up and shut up. The votes of ratepayers will not enter into the appointment of members of these boards.  It is the strength of influence with medical organisations, the strength of political pull with whatever Minister may be in office that will be responsible for the administration of hospitals and of these hospital boards. This comes about because of the distasteful, disgraceful and undemocratic manner in which these boards will be appointed by one man to administer millions of pounds of the taxpayers' money.  The taxpayers and the ratepayers will have no say as to how the money is spent.</P>
    <P>The money will be spent on the recommendations and advice of the hospital boards, none of whom will be elected by the ratepaying community. We are buying a pig in a bag.  The ratepaying community will blindfold themselves, put out their wrists to be handcuffed and their ankles to be chained. The Minister will appoint his colleagues and his friends to spend millions of pounds of the taxpayers' money while the elected representatives on the health boards will have no say whatever.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with any other explanation the Minister for Health may give.  I am concerned with what is here in black and white.  There is nothing in these regulations to indicate that in the development of in-patient and out-patient services in the hospitals administered by health boards the health boards will continue to have responsibility.  On the contrary, the regulations indicate that there will be a transfer of these powers and responsibility <Col N="321" /> from the semi-democratically elected health boards to the dictatorially appointed hospital boards on which the elected representatives, the general public or the ratepaying community will have no say whatever.</P>
    <P>Draft regulation 8 (1) (b) says that the functions of a regional hospital board shall be:</P>
    <P>to make such recommendations as it thinks fit arising from the consideration and review under paragraph (a) to the Minister, to a health board or to any other body concerned.</P>
    <P>Here we find a most extraordinary situation.  The hospital board appointed by the Minister will make recommendations to the health board on which there are elected representatives. This is a reversal of the normal procedure. The elected representatives on the health boards are familiar with local requirements.  They know what is required by way of in-patient and out-patient service, maternity service, dispensary service.  Should not the health board make the recommendations to the hospital board instead of the hospital board make a recommendation to the health board?  The draft regulation is ill-conceived and designed for a purpose.  This is not a consultative set-up; this is dictatorship.  This is part of the Government policy.  Eventually this House will have no influence. It is slowly becoming a mere talking shop and it will become a mere county council.  To pass a regulation of this kind is not in the interests of our health services or the general organisation of our hospital services.  I disagree with the Minister's appointees making recommendations to members of the health boards who were elected by the people.  The health boards must levy the charge, they must get the money from the counties they administer.  If they have to pay the bill they must have some say as to how, when and where the money is spent but that will not happen if this regulation is passed.</P>
    <P>This regulation says that people who have no authority from the public, a group of consultants already employed by the health boards, will be made masters.  They will tell their masters how much will be required, how much must be levied, how and where it is <Col N="322" /> to be spent.  If this is called democracy, let us describe it as Fianna Fáil democracy. It is not democracy by the people or for the people.  This is the worst type of planning for the future, it is bad management and it will not produce good results.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have fancy ideas about the future of these boards but I fail to see them.  I do not understand why he has taken this step.  The character of the regulations worries me. It is stated that the functions of the regional hospital boards shall be to consider any proposal for &ldquo;a change in the user of a hospital maintained by it&rdquo;.  I put it to every Deputy that this is a most serious regulation.</P>
    <P>I want to warn health boards that this regulation will give power to the newly instituted hospital boards to downgrade or close hospitals in order to suit the hospitals with which the consultants, who are members of the board, will be most prominently associated. This is bordering on what might be described as a corrupt practice.  It will have serious consequences for the country.  I can foresee that many of our county hospitals will be downgraded or closed down as a result of this regulation.  Do the surgeons, the sisters, the nursing staff, the porters and all others associated with hospitals, realise that hospitals can be closed down by direction of a body that has no responsibility to the people?  They will be able to downgrade, to close the doors of any hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am dull, but I am reading the regulations as would a lay man.  Article 8 (1) (c) (i) states that the functions of a regional hospital board shall be to consider any proposal for &ldquo;a change in the user of a hospital maintained by it&rdquo;.  It is stated clearly in the regulations and <Col N="323" /> there cannot be any doubt about the matter.  Article 8 (1) (c) (iii) states that the functions of the regional hospital board shall be to consider any proposal of a health board for the discontinuance of a hospital.  To me &ldquo;discontinuance&rdquo; means an end, a full stop.  As a member of a health board, I read this as meaning that if the regional hospital board decide to close a hospital in my area there is nothing I can do about it if this regulation is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may say this is nonsense but there is nothing in the regulations which tells me it is nonsense.  I am only reading what is set out in black and white.  If this ministerially appointed hospital board decide that Portlaoise County Hospital, that Tullamore, Mullingar and Longford Hospitals must be discontinued, what can I, as a member of the Midland Health Board, do about the matter?  I cannot tell the CEO of the Midland Health Board that the Minister has said that all this is nonsense. The regulations set out plainly what can be done.  I will not vote for regulations which put the hospitals in my constituency, whether at Tullamore, Birr, Abbeyleix, Edenderry, Mount-mellick or Portlaoise, in danger of being closed as a result of the power and authority which the regional boards will have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious aspect of this is that these faceless people, mainly consultants and existing employees of hospital boards, will advise the Minister on hospital policy in so far as it affects the functional area of the board. Not only that, but they are to make appropriate representations to Comhairle na nOspidéal on matters referred to in section 41 of the Act.  This is a very serious situation for every hospital in the country.  As a result of the passage of this regulation numerous hospitals will be closed.  Instead of services improving they will become further removed from the people.  I hope that there will be sufficient members here to reject these outrageous proposals which the Minister thought <Col N="324" /> would go through the House unnoticed and with speed and efficiency.  He thought that all these defects would be concealed.  It is only right that there should be a frank debate on the proposed regulations.</P>
    <P>These powers are very wide.  We see that the functions of the regional hospital boards shall be to govern the numbers and types of officers and the employment in such hospitals and, except in so far as the Minister has the function, the remuneration of such officers.  Have the trade unions been consulted on this matter?  Have the nurses organisations been consulted? Have all grades of employees in hospitals been consulted in relation to this new departure?  Already health boards and CEOs have the right to deal with questions of remuneration.  We find now that in accordance with these proposed regulations the health boards will govern the numbers and the types of officers.  The Minister is now taking away from the health boards and health authorities the right to decide rates of pay.  It will be the function of the hospital boards to determine the numbers of nurses, doctors, ward attendants and, perhaps, ambulance drivers and helpers to be employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That means simply what I said during the passage of the Health Act: that the regional hospital boards will do the work being done now by the Hospitals Commission which are a body whose board are appointed by the Minister.  The Hospitals Commission's work will be done by the hospital boards on which the health boards will be represented so that they will have more authority than they had before to deal with the salary matters which are now being dealt with by the Hospitals Commission in Dublin for the voluntary hospitals.  I hope the Deputy will not exaggerate the meaning of this.  I have given him a clear picture.  Granted, it is not clear in the section but the Deputy need not worry about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister wished to have that on record but the regulations before us do not contain that.  This matter is very serious.  I say this because we have <Col N="325" /> ample evidence to indicate that there are numerous medical card holders who cannot obtain the services to which they are entitled because of the manner in which the Department are dealing with the medical profession.  I have here a letter that I received from an outstanding specialist.  In this letter he referred to a patient he had seen at a clinic and said that he pointed out to her family doctor that there was a long waiting list of adult female tonsillitis cases.  He said that during the previous two weeks he had spent eight hours operating on two ear cases and as the patients concerned were medical card holders he would receive remuneration of approximately 5s per case or 1s 2d per hour.  He continued that having spent four hours on such a case in that week he was unable to spend all his time operating on patients who were medical card holders.  He suggested that I might use my influence to have the patient concerned taken to some other hospital.  Is this the way medical card holders are being treated by the Department?  I have great sympathy for this surgeon.  I cannot think of any circumstances in which any professional man would be expected to work for such rates of remuneration.</P>
      <P>Lest the Minister did not clearly understand I repeat the last paragraph of the surgeon's letter:</P>
      <P>As these are medical card holders I shall receive remuneration of approximately 5 shillings per case or 1s 2d per hour operating on them. Having spent four hours on a case such as this this week I am unable to spend all my time operating on patients with medical cards.  Perhaps you could use your influence to get her into some other hospital.</P>
      <P>Is that not a very serious situation for any professional man and is it not more serious still for the medical card patient who is being pushed from Billy to Jack because the surgeon can only afford to operate on two such cases in a week because the local authority will only pay 1s 2d an hour for operating? Is there not better pay for road scavengers?</P>

      <P>What I have here is Statutory Instruments, Draft of Health (Hospital Bodies) Regulations, 1972, and I presume my copy is no different from the others.  As different people take different meanings from the Bible I presume the Cathaoirleach and the Minister will take their own meaning from what they read.  I must be guided by my intelligence.  Being blessed with reasonably good eyesight, assisted by high standard spectacles, that conveys to me that &ldquo;the remuneration of such officers&rdquo; means their pay or monetary reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was quoting the case of this surgeon who must work for 1s 2d an hour and can only do two medical card cases in the week.  I want to ask the Minister if he thinks that rate of pay encourages the medical profession who have given such outstanding service and are sincerely devoted to their calling. The medical profession, particularly our surgeons of the highest standing who are under their lamps for the greater part of day and night in many <Col N="327" /> cases, are owed a great debt of gratitude by the public.  I shall not go beyond saying that present rates of pay are insufficient.  This is the function of health boards at the moment but, according to my reading of this, it will now be passed over to the hospital boards.</P>
    <P>More serious still it will become the function of these boards to control the expenditure of capital funds allocated by them under paragraph (i). This completely takes the skin off the health board and leaves a very poor and feeble skeleton.  That is why I resent these regulations and look on them as a severe intrusion on the rights of the public and a serious blow to democracy.  These regulations should be expounded at every church gate. Have the people adopted the attitude that they will accept anything from Fianna Fáil?  These regulations go too far.</P>
    <P>Article 10 says:</P>
    <P>(1)  A body established by these regulations may appoint such and so many officers and employ such and so many servants as the body may, from time to time, think proper and in appointing any officer or employing any servant the body shall comply with any directions given by the Minister relating to the procedure to be followed.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every officer of the body holding office in a permanent capacity shall cease to hold his office on attaining the age of 65 years.</P>
    <P>(3)  The body shall determine the remuneration and conditions of service of each officer and each servant.</P>
    <P>Are these not most extraordinary powers presented to Parliament as mere regulations which the Minister proposed to the House at 4 o'clock and expected to have passed at five minutes past four?  Did the Minister think none of us knew what was going on or did he think he was pulling &ldquo;a fast one&rdquo; and that Parliament would not have the opportunity of discussing these regulations?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> Article 10 also says:</P>
    <P>(5)  The Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit, declare that any of the powers conferred on a body by this article shall be exercisable only with the consent of the Minister, and whenever any such declaration is in force, the said powers may, in relation to any officer or employment to which the declaration applies, be exercised only with such consent.</P>
    <P>This gives additional power and authority to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This matter is far too serious for the Minister to stand up here and tell us that the regulations mean one thing while he says another and to refer us back to what he said on the introduction of the Health Act some years ago.  The fact of the matter is that he is depriving health boards of all responsibility and permitting a select few, mainly of the medical profession, consultants whom he will appoint, to spend millions of pounds and to put into effect their own views and opinions in relation to the entire hospitalisation of the country.  I want to object very strongly to these regulations. I oppose them strenuously.  I think they are bad and should be rejected by this House because we are handing over rights which public representatives should be slow to hand over to people who have a vested interest, a financial interest, in hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>I want to place on record my deep appreciation of the fine contribution the voluntary hospitals have made and to salute the outstanding work of the Sisters of Mercy and the Sisters of Charity in St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, the Mater Hospital and all those responsible for the Richmond and the other voluntary hospitals which have not alone been a credit to this city but have rendered outstanding service to the entire country.  I am sorry that these regulations are not in the interests of these hospitals.  I feel they should be rejected and I trust that every effort will be made by health boards to voice their loud and strong opposition to the manner in which the Minister has treated them, that is, with contempt, disrespect and distrust, <Col N="329" /> and above all, by showing his lack of confidence in those who have given their time freely and voluntarily day after day in the service of the general public, the welfare of the aged, the invalided and the sick, with a serious devotion and love for the maintenance of a very high standard of hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>These standards are now at risk. Inexperienced people far removed from rural conditions are now to be equipped with extraordinary powers and authority to deal with every aspect of this serious matter.  I hope that this House will see fit to reject these evilly-disposed and ill-conceived regulations which are not being brought in in the interests of health, of a better service for the public or the promotion of a better hospital service for the people but for a reason which is in the back of the Minister's mind, a reason which has not been disclosed but a reason on which the public can use their own common sense, intelligence and imagination.</P>

      <P>The Minister has had one assurance from Deputy Flanagan, that is, that he is in good health, if one can judge by the strength and length of his contribution this evening.  One can say that he has spoken a good deal of sense about the operation in particular of the regional hospital boards and the duplication of which many of us are quite fearful.  Deputy Clinton in previous contributions has expressed very considerable reservations about the likelihood of an overwhelming bureaucratic apparatus being set up by the Minister, I think, somewhat unwittingly but, nevertheless, he is now proceeding to do it, under the 1970 Act, and I am quite fearful, and I share the reservations of Deputy Clinton that the duplication of work between the various eastern health boards, the Southern Board and so on, the health boards in the country and the regional hospital boards and the area boards now being set up will lead to an appalling administrative confusion and an unnecessary administrative expense, and indeed, inevitably will lead to conflicting policy decisions developing between staffs employed by the respective authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> I submit that the arguments put forward by the Minister, originally on his Estimate and during this discussion, have not been strong enough, in the sense of bearing in mind the original FitzGerald Report and the new consultancy advice available to his Department, to hold water as he suggests in relation to the regional hospital boards and the intermeshing of functions with those of the health boards themselves.  I think the Minister should seriously have another long look at the administrative structure he is now setting up and I say this as one who strongly supported here the regionalisation of the health services.  I think we needed regionalisation of our health services and I supported the setting up of the health boards as such, but I am afraid we are now building another edifice on that, an edifice which could result in a future Minister having to unscramble an appalling confusion of function and identity of purpose. That is my criticism on that aspect and I propose to pass on to deal very briefly with the second criticism.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated earlier on that the FitzGerald Report recommended quite clearly that all consultants should hold their contracts from the regional hospital boards, and as the Minister is aware, a specific provision in this regard was contained in section 41 of the 1970 Act.</P>
    <P>I am aware from statements I have received from the Irish Medical Union and from other interests directly involved that the Minister has now come up with a proposition which is wholly unsatisfactory to everybody concerned but which seems to meet the wishes of the voluntary hospitals.  At the moment about half the hospital beds in the country are in the voluntary hospitals.  I am afraid the Minister, in relation to the appointment of consultants, having taken about five steps forward, has now taken about ten steps backwards.  In article 8 (4) of these regulations it is stated:</P>
    <P>A regional hospital board shall exercise its functions . . . only with the consent of the body or bodies responsible for the administration of the hospital or hospitals concerned . . .</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> I must charge the Minister that under pressure exerted on him by the vested interests and in the power struggle that went on he has ignominiously caved in and given way to pressures which are not of themselves fully democratic. We are now going back to the old class distinction in hospital appointments whereby some consultants will hold their contracts from the regional hospital boards in good faith and in full understanding; others in the voluntary hospitals will hold them subject to a veto by the boards of these voluntary hospitals.  That, in 1972, is not good enough.  It is no consolation for the Minister to say, as he has said, in a very ambiguous context, that it seems likely that the authority employing the consultant will remain as at present, that is, it will be the health board or the voluntary hospital body concerned.  What was the purpose of having common contracts of employment?  Was it not to break down the appalling public disgrace of the cream of consultancy appointments and the cream of the power of the land ruling the roost exclusively for almost all time to come with total consultancy appointment power within their hands, a relatively small group in the medical profession holding that exclusive power in their hands within the operations of the voluntary hospitals while those who were not in the swim, those who were not well got with certain people on certain boards of voluntary hospitals, took their chance in the ordinary local authority hospital for consultancy appointment?  I think the Minister is in many ways an excellent Minister for Health, probably the finest Minister for Health this country has had, but in relation to the appointment of consultants and these regulations the cave-in by the Minister is a rather ignominious cave-in.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the medical organisations concerned generally wished to retain the concept of the regional hospital boards holding the contract.  They had one reservation, that is, that people should not be chopped around from one regional hospital to another without their <Col N="332" /> consent.  The Minister is equally aware that the Dublin voluntary hospitals more or less, to use an unparliamentary phrase, told the Minister to get lost, that as far as they were concerned the contracts of consultants would be between them and the consultants and while the appointment system could come through the regional bodies they were retaining that power exclusively to themselves.  I do not think that is good enough.  I do not think it is possible because what we now have proposed in these regulations is a very simple thing.  We are now, in effect, putting into statutory form, putting into a statutory instrument, the handing over of an exclusive power of veto to such organisations, which is undesirable. This is a right worked hitherto in a voluntary manner.  It worked <i>sub rosa,</i> with the acquiescence of the Department of Health, but when we embody it in a statutory instrument I think the Irish Medical Union are right in saying, as they have said to me, that it is the most inglorious cave-in they have ever seen by a Minister. It perpetuates in statutory form the handing over to voluntary hospitals of their veto of appointment of consultants. This is discriminatory and within the medical profession it will perpetuate the class divisions which are rampant within that profession. Talk about trade unionists, you could cut the class divisions within the medical profession with a knife.  We are now building up again the old inbreeding system, the old power struggle system, of the boys who are well in and the boys who are not. Certain consultancy groups who virtually control appointments in certain voluntary hospitals will once again crack the whip if they do not like the colour of the hair of a particular consultant.</P>
    <P>These are my two reservations.  I have waited about three hours to speak. It is no way out for the Minister to state that all the consultants would be operating under a common form of contract under the regional hospital boards and he wanted them to be assignable to hospitals within the region.  The Minister is right in putting that up for consideration.  He pointed out originally that the advantage lay <Col N="333" /> in having great flexibility in the organisation of consultancy services.  It also meant that a consultant could be appointed to a local authority hospital or to a voluntary hospital.  What happened? Overnight the Dublin voluntary hospitals told the Minister what to do with his proposals and they have now successfully retained all power.  I do not think that should go without protest in this House.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to have a very sharp look at the general concept of regional hospital boards.  I am afraid the functions outlined here are so omnibus, so open to conflicting interpretation by the various CEOs, that all I can see happening in my health board area is holy administrative warfare between the Dublin Regional Hospital Board and the Eastern Health Board.  I think there will be maythem. There were many members of my party who completely opposed the setting up of the Eastern Health Board and I opposed them.  I think the idea is quite excellent, very necessary, but I would have taken the bull by the horns and put the hospital administrative system under fairly substantial control of the Eastern Health Board in the Eastern Health Board area rather than hiving it off in a manner which will make it impossible to administer. Four almost anonymous individuals, unknown to one another, from the Eastern Health Board, four individuals appointed by the Midland Health Board, most of whom would never have seen one another, four persons appointed by the North-Eastern Health Board, four persons appointed by the South-Eastern Health Board, are to come together with 16 persons appointed by the Minister, many of whom may not know one another, to form the Dublin Regional Hospital Board.  It will take them ten years to discover what political party the members support.  Usually, that is discovered within a matter of hours.</P>
    <P>I submit that the administrative apparatus proposed by the Minister is extremely cumbersome, unnecessary and unlikely to be helpful to the health services.  The Minister should rationalise it.  Of course, on the consultancy side, he should withdraw the regulations and if he wants the support of the <Col N="334" /> House he will get it, in telling certain vested interests that, in running the health services, we have an overriding national responsibility.  We have a responsibility to the medical profession. We have a responsibility to prevent them from perpetuating the class divisions that they have already built up, which most of them detest and want amended.  We have a responsibility also to, for example, the Irish Medical Union who have opposed this regulation, who have asked me and a number of other Deputies to oppose it.  If the Minister does not take it back for re-examination, we will vote against these regulations this evening and, if we are given the opportunity, after the next general election, we will willingly amend the regulations and make them more rational and more democratic.</P>

      <P>I do not think I should deal with a great deal of what Deputy Flanagan said.  He quite obviously misunderstood the import of the regulations.  First of all, I must put in perspective the underlying reasons for establishing these regional hospital boards.  I indicated the reasons absolutely clearly in the course of the debate on the Health Act, both on the Second Stage and on Committee Stage.  I spelled out to the Dáil and in the Seanad the general functions of the regional hospital board, the general functions of Comhairle na nOspidéal and how I saw their relationship with the health boards and with myself as Minister.  So, when I spoke on the occasion of introducing the Estimate and, later, the regulations, I did imagine that most Members of the House would either re-read what had been said before on the occasion of the debate or would remember the general import of what lay behind the proposals which are now before the House finally in the form of a specific statutory instrument.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting down to that, if the Deputy will give me a chance.  As the House knows, between 65 and 70 per cent of our total health expenditure relates to hospital services <Col N="335" /> and you have this position obtaining: we need a real effort to plan the hospital services on the basis of these following facts&mdash;that the percentage of acute care beds provided by voluntary hospitals as distinct from health board hospitals is 83 per cent in the Eastern Health Board area; 33 per cent in the North-Eastern Health Board area; 30 per cent in the Southern Health Board area; 18 per cent in the Midland Health Board area; 15 per cent in the Mid-Western Health Board area; 13 per cent in the Western Health Board area; 10 per cent in the South-Eastern Health Board area and 8 per cent in the North-Western Health Board area and, in contradistinction to that, the percentage of patients who go to Dublin for hospital treatment, including maternity services, is 24 per cent in the case of the North-Eastern Health Board; 4 per cent in the case of the Southern Health Board; 25 per cent in the case of the Midland Health Board; 10 per cent in the case of the Mid-Western Health Board&mdash;one in every ten&mdash; 10 per cent in the case of the Western Health Board; 25 per cent in the case of the South-Eastern Health Board and 22 per cent in the case of the NorthWestern Health Board.</P>
      <P>So, there is a complicated situation of a very considerable number of voluntary hospitals in some areas, fewer in other areas, and a very considerable movement of patients from the country to Dublin in order to be cared for in relation to various specialities and, in some cases, maternity services. I suppose I should also mention that 29 per cent of the patient beds in the voluntary hospitals of Dublin are occupied by persons from outside the area, 18 per cent of the patient beds going to the Western Health Board coming from outside the area of the Western Health Board.  I will give one other figure, what are defined as local specialities in relation to treatment represent about 82 per cent.  Then there are specialities in treatment covering a regional area which amount to 9 per cent and then there are the great national specialities where one can have treatment in only one or two hospitals.  These amount to 9 per cent of the cases treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> That gives the background to the general position.  What is the best way of planning the future hospital services, bringing together and co-ordinating the voluntary hospitals and the health board hospitals and making the best use of the beds, allowing for the regional characters, the regional problems involved and allowing for the special position of Dublin to which go so many patients and where 83 per cent of the beds are provided for acute care by voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>We need, quite obviously, as much specialised knowledge as we can get, as much guidance as we can receive from the interests concerned.  It was the recommendation of the FitzGerald Report, not in the same form&mdash;it is the recommendation in the Devlin Report on the Civil Service&mdash;that, whereas it is absolutely true that the officers of my Department can do very excellent planning, in relation to this kind of planning, why not have regional hospital boards which represent in part the health boards on which there are representatives appointed by me who are skilled in these matters?  They will tease out these questions, examine these problems, make use of the powers that will be given to them in this statutory instrument, knowing that I will have the ultimate responsibility, that I as Minister for Health, or whoever replaces me, have first of all to announce a national health policy and to get consent of the Oireachtas for that. Then I have to provide every health board and every voluntary hospital with the necessary finances to carry on both current and capital and extended development.  Thirdly, the Minister for Health of the day, whoever he may be, has to ensure that standards are kept uniform.</P>
    <P>So, the idea that the regional hospital boards could be huge Parkinsonian empires that are able to make decisions irrespective of what this House might like, or of what the Minister might like, from my point of view, is entirely wrong.  They will not be able to do any such thing.  They are bodies with special functions, trying to see how far we can get the voluntary hospitals and the health board hospitals to work together and to provide the greatest <Col N="337" /> possible variety of services in an efficient way.</P>
    <P>I think most Members realise that there is growing specialisation in medicine.  Within the next 15 years we will reach a stage where all operations in relation to vascular surgery for children under ten years of age will be carried out by one specialist.  We will reach the stage where no longer will any genito-urinary surgery be practised by general surgeons but will be practised entirely by specialists.  Inevitably this means more teamwork in hospitals and more specialisation.  The only way we can deal with this is for the regional hospital boards to have the kind of staff and facilities whereby they can examine the detailed survey of the patient workload of every hospital which is gradually accumulating as a result of the work of the Medico-Social Research Board.  This will be able to tell the regional hospital boards the nature of the maladies of every patient in every hospital, how long it took to observe the patient, and how long he was in hospital.  We are beginning to understand the meaning of specialisation in relation to future developments and we will be able to plan the integration and co-ordination of voluntary and health board hospitals on a better basis.</P>
    <P>I have said all this before; there is nothing new in what I am saying this evening.  The Department of Health, with the consent of the Oireachtas, control the financial expenditure of the whole hospital system in this country, except for those who pay privately as patients in the hospitals and in relation to the private funds of the voluntary hospitals.  We have to give consent to all major construction and reconstruction of hospitals.  That remains in the power of the Minister for Health with the consent of the Minister for Finance and, finally, with the consent of this House.</P>
    <P>We need to have the means of ensuring that when the budget of a health board is examined there should be some relationship between the increase of expenditure that can be afforded each year over and above the increase of costs and the increase of user, as between the voluntary hospitals and the health board hospitals in the area.  There should be a regional board <Col N="338" /> that could consider this on the basis of what is required in the health board area and the relationship of hospitals in a particular health board area having regard to the fact that many patients may go outside the area and come to Dublin.  They should consider what can be done about the planning of facilities when there are two different types of hospital operating in an area and it is necessary to plan as well as possible for the future development of the hospital system.</P>
    <P>We must face the inescapable results of specialisation.  It will come whether we like it or not.  Everybody, even those in Dublin, will agree that if we can keep patients out of Dublin by being able to afford intelligently-organised specialist services in the regions that would be a good thing. Obviously certain types of patients will always have to go to Dublin or Cork, for example, for neurological services, but there are a number of other specialist services that are provided only in Dublin which perhaps could be provided in the regional areas outside Dublin.  This might be possible provided we know about the patient workload from the Medico-Social Research Board and provided research is undertaken by the regional hospital boards where they can get the health boards and the voluntary hospitals in the area to consider the proposition, for instance, if we can afford more genito-urinary surgery in Cork, Galway or Waterford, or wherever it might be proposed.  I made this clear to Members of the House when we were discussing the Health Act.</P>
    <P>The regional hospital boards will be concerned with examining the proposals in the FitzGerald Report.  There is no need for the regional hospital boards or for the Minister to follow rigidly the proposals made in that report. I accept the general ambit of the report because I know there will be more specialisation.  I know that in about ten years it will be difficult to get a single-surgeon hospital to perform any operation but what is described as the cold, absolutely simple surgery.  Therefore, I know that the general concepts in the FitzGerald Report are valid.</P>
    <P>The regional hospital boards will not <Col N="339" /> override the wishes of the health boards with regard to the change of functions in the hospitals or to the closing of any hospital.  The regulations say that the regional hospital boards shall consider the proposals made by health boards in relation to changes in the function of a hospital or the discontinuance of a hospital.  I made it clear that this would be the result of combined discussion between hospital boards and the health boards, that the county advisory committees will have to be consulted.</P>
    <P>Finally, I, or the Minister for Health who succeeds me, will have the responsibility. It is literally impossible for either Comhairle na nOspidéal to make any sensational proposals in relation to the withholding or granting of consent for the appointment of consultants in an area, or for the regional hospital boards to make any proposals for changing the function of a hospital or for closing a hospital without financial changes being necessary &mdash;either transferring money from one health board to another or having to provide money for beds in a large regional hospital that will take the patients who are now looked after in a single-surgeon hospital.  The Minister for Health will have absolute personal and financial responsibility.  He will have to come to the House for money and to get his Estimate through in respect of any major changes that are going to take place in relation to the proposals made in the FitzGerald Report.  I am not shuffling off the responsibilities of the Minister for Health by appointing enormously expensive regional hospital boards which would take away responsibility from me and crush the efficiency and sense of well-being of the health boards as was suggested by Deputy Oliver Flanagan.</P>
    <P>I accept entirely everything that has been said by Deputies in regard to their fears as to how the regional hospital boards will perform.  I am getting proposals for the procedures of the regional hospital boards, for the method of their communication with the health boards, for their staffing, for the connection between the regional <Col N="340" /> hospital boards, the health boards and my Department, for the co-ordination that must exist between the regional boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal when Comhairle na nOspidéal make a decision recommending the appointment of some new specialists in some areas.  I must have recommendations as to how best I can ensure that this will not be what Deputies fear&mdash;a bureaucratic structure which will simply mean a great number of new institutions making a series of decisions with the Minister for Health having to examine a series of different decisions made by different bodies, all taking time and all involving unnecessary and expensive staff time.  That must be avoided.  I have had consultations in a preliminary way with the firm of McKinsey who, I say without fear of contradiction, made very good proposals for the upper staff structure of the health boards, for the support staff. Indeed, these proposals have been accepted without demur and without much criticism by the majority of the health boards.  Therefore, they have established a reasonably good reputation for setting up the administrative structure of the health boards.</P>
    <P>The same people have talked with representatives of many of the voluntary hospitals.  They have talked with people concerned with health boards and they are to propose to me a structure which will ensure that this operation will be carried out properly, that the communications will be all right, that there will be no multiple decision-making of the wrong kind and that, above all, these boards will not simply be duplicating the work of my Department.  My Department's functions will have to change to some degree because of the decentralisation process that will take place in relation to the operation of these boards.</P>
    <P>I wish to say one thing in that connection which will be of particular interest to those concerned with the Eastern Health Board.  I recognise what Deputies Clinton and Desmond said about what would appear to be an inadequacy in the structure of the Dublin Regional Hospital Board because of the fact that, whereas some 22 or 25 per cent of the patient load comes to Dublin from other health <Col N="341" /> board areas for specialisation, in Dublin where 83 per cent of the beds are provided by voluntary hospitals, there is a special situation and obviously there must be a long-term examination of the whole work of the voluntary hospitals system in Dublin, the health board system, the establishment of two new regional hospitals and the continuing moving ahead of the Blanchardstown and St. James's hospitals. Therefore, I assure Deputy Clinton that I have asked the firm of consultants to suggest to me some form of committee work procedure in relation to the regional hospital board of the Dublin area that will ensure that the Dublin problem can be examined in a meaningful way and that there can be a right kind of relationship between the Dublin Regional Hospital Board and the Eastern Health Board so that planning can be conducted properly. I will go further and say that if this does not work I will have to come back to the Dáil and admit to Deputy Clinton that he was right, that the Dublin Regional Hospital Board was an unwieldy structure.</P>
    <P>I would have to come back and amend the structure and if I have the privilege of continuing to be Minister for Health, I would be prepared to do so.  I believe that I can devise a committee procedural system which will enable what Deputy Clinton fears to be avoided, the fear that there is a very special situation where there is a large number of people attending hospital in the Dublin Regional Hospital Board area.  There are also the outlying areas all of which have to be looked after and, equally, there is the considerable number of patients coming from all parts of the country to the Dublin Regional Hospital Board area for specialisation.</P>
    <P>A great deal will depend on the method of administration of these bodies and how they work with the health boards.  Most responsible Deputies paid tribute to the way the health boards were beginning to operate although, as yet, many of them have not got their full staffs and some have not even got their programme managers. A number of responsible Deputies, too, were of the opinion <Col N="342" /> that this new structure was better than the old county council structure because of the growth of specialisation and the fact that so many people moved outside the county council areas to go to hospital in Dublin.  If we have as much success in relation to the operation of these boards as we have had in relation to the health boards, we will be making progress. I would say to Deputy Desmond that we intend going ahead with the new regulations for the selection of consultants in voluntary hospitals.  I am aware that the most responsible consultants in this country and a great many members of the boards of voluntary hospitals accept that this is the best course to follow but I will not be deterred by any pressures exercised on me to prevent this happening. I have said that already in this House.  I intend to go ahead and it will be possible for me, if I can get the right kind of co-operation, to go back on the arrangements made in this statutory instrument and arrange for the possibility of consultants working through regional hospital boards and they will work to them even though they may be working for one hospital. I will discuss that again with the bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that the major value in a consultant getting a contract from a major hospital board is in the case where he works in a specialist function for a number of hospitals.  I do not think it is very valuable if he works for one hospital except that you get standard terms of appointment, some standardisation of salary and that at times also a consultant will agree to being obliged to work for the Dublin Regional Hospital Board or whichever regional hospital board he is appointed for and that he must be obliged to move from one place to another if he is appointed by the regional hospital board as a whole.  The medical profession did not like that part so I have had some difficulty. Nevertheless, if I can get a selection procedure agreed for the consultants employed in the voluntary hospitals, we shall be making progress. This is not to criticise the boards of the voluntary hospitals who have given splendid service but knowing <Col N="343" /> how successful we have been with the Local Appointments Commission, if we apply the same kind of principles to the appointment of consultants in voluntary hospitals we will be making more progress in securing the best talent possible.</P>
    <P>I could answer many detailed questions but the answer to most of the questions is given by me when I say that I admit these boards will not carry out the purposes for which they were created unless the management-communication-co-ordination structure between them and the health board, between them and Comhairle na nOspidéal and between all three and myself are intelligent.  Of course, I will be answerable to the House for everything that is being done by these boards and there can be no secrecy about the method they operate.  I could not spend an hour attempting to answer a series of questions that were put to me but I think I have said enough now to assure the House that I have no conspiracy in mind to take away the authority of the health boards, as was suggested by Deputy Flanagan.  I can assure the House that the people whom I will appoint will be people of the most eminent character.  They will represent certain specialities.  They will represent geographical areas.  They will be people who are beyond reproach and no one will say that any appointee of mine, either to Comhairle na nOspidéal or to the regional hospital boards, was appointed with the idea that I had some project in mind of forcing an action which was purely for political party purposes. They would have to say that they would be people of the very highest skill and reputation and it would be impossible for any Member of the House to say that my appointees were appointed because I had some low motive in mind of a party political character.  The idea is ridiculous.  No matter who is Minister for Health, when it comes to matters such as the conduct and administration of hospitals with all the boards operating and with their tradition over a long period, the idea that any Minister for Health would appoint people who would act for corrupt reasons to that <Col N="344" /> Minister's personal advantage is inconceivable.</P>

The Minister is Minister now but, in fact, there will be changes over the years and it might be better to have this written into the regulations to prevent changes which might occur.  It is not necessary to elaborate as to why changes may occur but changes could occur which would change the whole concept of the FitzGerald Report in regard to the setting out of hospitals. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider making this addition to article 8.</P>

      <P>I regret that I cannot amend the regulations at the moment but the Deputy may be assured that the whole question of the implementation of the FitzGerald Report in relation <Col N="345" /> to the midlands, north and south, will require very great care.  There are a great number of conflicting interests and the Deputy will find himself involved in these.  The idea that in some way the regional hospital board could ride rough-shod over a health board <Col N="346" /> and make decisions, or put me in the position of making decisions, without proper consideration of these matters is quite untenable.  This would be quite impossible and I can assure the Deputy of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was outlining the inevitability of delays in many cases and the efforts we were making to eliminate them as far as possible and I was seeking to point out that we need the co-operation of the applicant as much as that of the officials on the administrative side to achieve this.  The local old age pensions sub-committee is a sub-committee which I have always held should be there.  I had particular regard for their position in so far as they may act as a buffer between the officials and the applicants and I was always slow to advocate their abolition but if I feel, as I do in some cases, that they do not meet sufficiently frequently and by that means delay some applicants' claims for pensions, then I will take a serious look at the question of retaining them unless they pull up their socks and do a better job of work for us.  Like any other Deputy, I get personal complaints from my constituency.  I make inquiries and find that the claim has not yet gone before the old age pensions sub-committee or if it has they have not yet met to clear it.  If they act as a delaying agency, then they are not performing their function as I would like them to. I would be very slow to abolish them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always felt they did act as a buffer between the officials and claimants but there is a vast difference between the manner in which they perform their duty as from one sub-committee to another.  I was a member of a sub-committee for many years.  We met on the last Saturday of every month religiously and disposed of all the claims before us in a manner which was in accordance with our best interpretation of the regulations.  Some committees do not meet sufficiently frequently and they hold a few claims waiting until they have a number, seemingly not appreciating that delays may be occurring for which we eventually have to take the blame.  This is a matter to which I must give some <Col N="348" /> serious consideration in the time immediately ahead as part of any effort we make to cut out any avoidable delays.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies made favourable reference to the prescribed relatives scheme which has now been extended to males.  Some Deputies made the comment which is frequently made with regard to old people detained in homes. I have had informal discussions with the Minister for Health time and again regarding this matter.  It is natural that one should ask, if it is costing £17 or £20 to keep an old person in a home, would there not be some relatives who might be prepared to take the old person out and look after him for, perhaps, half that figure or something less.  This is a matter for the Department of Health rather than Social Welfare but it concerns all of us and is of considerable interest and worth pursuing.  I would point out though to Deputies who seem to think that this would be a simple thing to do that it is not quite so simple because if a scheme of this type operated between Health and Social Welfare one can visualise everybody eventually seeking to claim for this type of benefit by simply going into a home for a week and then being claimed out by relatives.  These are obstacles which it may be possible to overcome.  Any deep examination of our welfare system must have regard to this as something for consideration in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I am trying to cover the points raised without mentioning Deputies specifically. Most Deputies advocated the lowering of the qualifying age for old age pensions.  We have done that in relation to contributory pensions.  The retirement pension is now payable in full at the age of 65 for persons qualified to receive it.  It is inevitable that we will be faced with reducing the age on the non-contributory side too. Sometimes it is pointed out that there has been no reduction in the qualifying age for old age pensions since they were first introduced.  It is forgotten that the average expectation of life has been considerably extended since 1908.  When we bring the pension age to 65 I would say it will be equivalent <Col N="349" /> to paying it at 55 when pensions first came into being.  I have not got the exact figure but there has been a marked advance in life expectancy due to the better medical facilities available now.  Nevertheless, it is true that Norway was the last country in Western Europe paying pensions at 70 and they recently reduced the age to 67 or 68.  We have now reduced it so far as contributory pensions are concerned and we will inevitably be faced with bringing down the age in the near future to a lower qualifying age than that which it is at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley referred to applicants being held up when a transfer of land is involved.  I thought we were reasonably generous in this.  We usually accept proof from the solicitor putting through the grant of administration that it is being done and we do not as a rule have to wait for deeds to be produced. There is not any real delay in this respect on our part.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked why these payments were not made immediately, why August and October?  As the House knows, the dates used to be October and January.  We have brought the dates forward considerably and it is not possible to do any better if we are to make provision for the work that has to be done in the way of preparing new schemes, preparing and printing new books, having new insurance stamps prepared and all the necessary preparatory work which must be carried out before payments can be made.  This is an administrative problem for my Department.  It is a gigantic one.  Every year all the books have to be re-printed.  There has to be a complete set of instructions, a complete new set of regulations.  The entire work has to be repeated every year for the thousands and thousands of cases involved. It is a very big job when one is dealing with several hundred thousand cases.  It would not be possible to have it in operation next day with any degree of efficiency.  Deputy O'Connell again made reference to our approach to the scheme of deserted wives allowances and appealed for a more humane approach which, he said, I promised all along.  We have been as liberal and as humane&mdash;to use his own word&mdash;as one could possibly be in this <Col N="350" /> respect.  We are dealing here with a rather sensitive and difficult area where one must not be prepared to take qualification for granted; proof must be produced.  The officials of the Department have been dealing with this matter admirably and the complaints reaching me are practically nil.</P>
    <P>The question was asked also by Deputy O'Connell, whether, now that we are taking power to have the dependant's allowance paid separately in cases where the breadwinner may not be fulfilling his responsibility to the dependants, this could be brought into the reciprocal agreement with the United Kingdom in cases where the breadwinner is drawing his allowance in England and not contributing to the family at home.  I would only point out that on our accession to the EEC these matters of reciprocity and common payments in the various countries can easily be worked out as part of the whole welfare scheme.  Deputies are aware that contributions paid in various countries can be aggregated for the purpose of qualifying for benefits and the benefits are payable in whatever member State an applicant may be living at a particular time. With regard to reciprocity in the matter of the payments to which Deputy O'Connell referred, the procedure will be simplified by our entry to the EEC.</P>
    <P>On the question of persons taking care of their old folk losing their title to unemployment benefit or other insurance benefit, this matter has been raised by a number of Deputies, sometimes privately with me and, in other cases, in the debate in the House.  We are looking into this matter.  Deputy O'Connell advocated that contributions could be paid in respect of the years spent in taking care of the old folk.  I would remind him that it would be sufficient to give them credit for contributions in order to maintain the validity of the contributions they have already made or to maintain the continuity of their right to payment, so that if there is a long lapse represented by the time in which they were engaged in taking care of the old folk, when the old folk have passed on and the persons concerned are again available for employment and apply for benefits, the <Col N="351" /> continuity of their benefits will not be broken by reason of their not having continued as contributors over a long period.</P>
    <P>In cases where persons have not had their contributions brought up to date, in the case of companies going into liquidation, this is a matter we have dealt with already.  Some Deputies did not seem to remember that that was already done.  We took power last year to make provision for cases where persons would otherwise have lost their title to benefit as a result of the firm or company where they worked not bringing the contributions up to date. We would exercise that power only when we are certain that there is no possibility of recovering the contributions from the employer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made an appeal on behalf of old people going abroad and losing their non-contributory pensions. This is a problem which confronts me frequently in my constituency. I know all about it.  Many of our emigrants who marry and settle down abroad bring their parents out for a holiday.  This does not involve any problem in so far as the pensioners are entitled to be absent for 13 weeks and still draw the pension in respect of that period.  There is discretion as far as the Minister is concerned where, for good reason, the pensioner is unable to return within the 13 weeks.  If it is due to sickness or some other good reason, it is possible to extend the period.  It is a matter requiring the greatest possible vigilance because it is not unknown to the officers of the Department or, indeed, to Deputies, that many people are inclined to shuttle back and forth and only come to draw their pensions. In these cases residence is not established and it is not permissible under the regulations.  The 13 weeks give ample scope if the matter is approached in the proper manner.</P>
    <P>Appeals have been made for the extension to disabled persons of the benefits available to certain old age pensioners by way of free electricity, television licences and travel.  When I suggest bringing in a new scheme on a limited scale it is invariably pointed out to me, and rightly so, that once a scheme is introduced there is an immediate <Col N="352" /> demand for its extension to other sections.  When we introduced free travel for a particular section there were demands from all other sections for its extension to them.  One cannot yield to every demand that is made. I can assure those who made the case for certain disabled persons, particularly wheelchair cases, that it is one of the many things we have under consideration from time to time.  As I have already said, there are priorities and one has to take cases in the order in which they are regarded as of the greatest importance.</P>
    <P>I may be overlooking some of the questions raised by Deputies.  If so, I am not doing it intentionally.  The same points were raised by many Deputies. I would only like to say in a general way that the suggested improvements that have been recommended and the anomalies that have been pointed out are frequently brought to our attention.  As Deputies must be aware, advantage is taken of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill every year to tidy up matters that have been shown over the previous year or longer to need attention.  Very often, some of these things can be done without legislation.  In any event, we do take the opportunity when the Bill comes before the House to write into it provisions that have been shown to be necessary.</P>
    <P>The reduction of the qualifying age for old age pensions to 65 years of age would, at the best estimate we have, cost about £13 million.  It is a huge sum&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>A sizeable sum will flow back to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy is doing a cost/benefit analysis in his own mind and he is pointing out that the State would not lose.  I agree that any money we pay in benefit goes into circulation immediately.  It is never stagnant capital and is always available to stimulate purchasing power.  In so far as it goes towards the purchase of taxable goods it goes back to the Exchequer. However, that is not the only basis on which one must examine the need or otherwise to give certain benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> The important point with regard to the social welfare code is that a social conscience alone is not sufficient.  It is not what is involved in deciding on a certain payment to any individual. Any Minister for Social Welfare must be confronted with the limitations which present themselves to him when he is considering the payment of benefits to the less well-off section in our community.  He must have regard to the amount he can take from the public purse at a given time.  He is not dealing with his own money, neither is he taking money out of a bottomless pool.  He must take money from the people in order to give to those who are not able to provide for themselves.  The redistribution of the national wealth and the extent to which the Minister will go at a given time must be limited by the regard he must have to leave in the pool a sufficient amount to sustain the effort towards national economic expansion which is the mainspring in providing the resources necessary to maintain the benefits.</P>
    <P>Any Minister must work within these limitations.  It is not a matter only of conscience.  As has been pointed out, the public conscience has been so shocked into a sense of its public duty in recent years that everyone is demanding better payments for the welfare classes.  I should like to take up a point made by Deputy Murphy with which I agree.  Although the public conscience has been aroused to a sense of its responsibility, I wonder if the individual's sense of responsibility has not been lulled a little so far as relatives and friends are concerned.  Of all the things the State can do for people, particularly for the aged, the loving care of their own families and relatives is of greater importance than anything any Government can do.  I hope we have not reached a stage when that sense of responsibility, that conscience which made it necessary for people years ago to look after their parents when there was no benefit provided, has not been completely lulled into a sense of irresponsibility. Irrespective of what we do here, I hope that important and indispensable part of the care of the aged by their relatives will always be <Col N="354" /> part of the public conscience which will accept its responsibility and do its share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that this constitutes a big burden in many cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>For economic reasons it is not always possible to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a sacrifice people should undertake cheerfully. There are cases where different circumstances prevail.  We try to make a distinction between some of the less well-off of our old people and others. For that reason we have been discriminating in bringing in benefits which are available to some and not available to others.  In this connection I am thinking of the home care scheme, the allowance for prescribed relatives, the provision of electricity, the concessions regarding free travel and free licences for television and radio. These benefits were calculated to reach that section of the older people who have few friends to take care of them and who are in a worse position than those people who have relatives to care for them.</P>
      <P>For that reason I am anxious to have the new scheme of home assistance finalised&mdash;it is now at a fairly advanced stage.  When it is completed we will be able to have home assistance paid on a national basis in a uniform manner and it will enable us to give supplementary benefits in cases where the flat rate benefits available are not sufficient. That is recognising that there is a vast difference between people who enjoy the benefits of social welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that a considerable number of people are below the poverty level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brenan Mr. J. Brenan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brenan</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable number of people can hardly survive on the amounts we pay them, while others can enjoy a reasonably normal life because of their circumstances.  This will give us an opportunity to deal with this problem in a humane and expeditious way.  A close examination of our social welfare code does not reveal that there is anything seriously <Col N="355" /> wrong with the structure of social welfare. Our benefits cover a wide and comprehensive range of cases.  One of the most important improvements for the future is the extension of social insurance to cover a wider range, to get more people under the contributory umbrella rather than the non-contributory so that means tests eventually will disappear as part of the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>So long as our resources compel us to have means tests they must be carried out.  They are distasteful and they will give rise to a good deal of unnecessary accusations regarding the manner in which the administrative section of the Department must carry out this work.  None of us appreciates that.  How often have we heard it said that the man who leads a prudent life and makes the necessary provision for himself and his family and, perhaps, accumulates a little extra capital, is victimised because he finds on reaching the age of 70 that he does not qualify for the old age pension whereas his neighbour who may have made no effort during his lifetime to provide for himself finds that he is entitled to an old age pension.  This accusation is often made in regard to the means test but that is not the basis on which the means test is applied.  We must deal with circumstances as we find them at a given time.  I hope that with the extension of the social insurance scheme we can look forward to the time when more contributory cases will be the order of the day and that means tests will be few.  In replying to a question here the other day I gave figures regarding the numbers of widows in receipt of contributory and non-contributory pensions.  Some Deputies doubted these figures but I can assure them that they were correct.  Each year the number of widows receiving contributory pensions becomes greater because more people are now in insurable employment and fewer people are claiming non-contributory widows pensions.  This is not as evident at the old age pension stage as it is in respect of widows' pensions but it is becoming more evident in respect of old age pensions, too.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I had dealt briefly with the medical card eligibility qualifications but before returning to that I would like to comment on the debate in the House this evening on the health regulations.  These discussions were protracted and rightly so.  So far as every aspect of our legislation is concerned there is creeping in a system of bureaucratic control. Whatever may be said about other members of the Government the Minister for Health favours this bureaucratic system very much and the selection of nominees on boards who do not have to be endorsed by the public.  Possibly we are looking eastwards in putting such ideas into our legislation. Our fellow Europeans in Eastern Europe adopt the same system.  They do not believe in democracy or in holding elections or electing members of governments or boards&mdash;I am sure they have somewhat similar boards to ours &mdash;on a democratic system.  We find a great deal of fault with them but recent legislation here dealing with many aspects of local government, health, housing and roads seems to copy to a large extent the structure obtaining in Czechoslovakia, Russia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and other East European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that a good idea?  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would say it is not. The Minister heard a great deal in the discussion on health regulations today about the system by which he nominates to different boards such as health boards, hospital boards and other boards dealing with health services on a selection basis.  There is a great difference between a democratically elected member of a board and one selected by the Minister or nominated by some nominating body.  The Minister and Deputies have to account to the public for their stewardship and if the public feel that our activities do not measure up to their requirements they are likely to withdraw their support. Members of the House get that opportunity every three or four years <Col N="359" /> on average.  The same applies to local authorities elected on the same system. If local authority members in the electorate's opinion betray their trust they are removed from office and rightly so.  But many nominees appointed on a selection basis are selected and appointed on qualifications that have nothing to do with the work they undertake.  I would not assert that the Minister for Health would be responsible for the same kind of activity as some of his Government colleagues in selecting nominees for public bodies or boards.  The usual practice of Fianna Fáil, as the records show down through the years, was to appoint people for their political qualification mainly.</P>

      <P>In fairness to my predecessors if the Deputy looks at the names of the people appointed to some 20 advisory committees and boards connected with health and hospital services, he will find the people appointed were appointed on merit.  Questions have been answered in the Dáil about the great number of consultative committees and if the Deputy looks through the vast list, he will find that the people appointed by my predecessors were people of real merit.  There was no question of appointing people solely to get a political job done.  He will find that.  I challenge the Deputy to read through the list of the Mass Radiography Board, the Health Insurance Board and all of them and he will find very eminent people there.  I do not want to interrupt <Col N="360" /> the Deputy but it is not fair to charge my predecessors in this way.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the protracted debate on the health regulations indicated the feeling of Deputies in regard to the abolition or partial abolition of our democratic system of selecting public boards.  We are moving from that system.  The Minister may say that the main reason for doing so is that you can get a better qualified person on the board who could not gain the confidence of the electorate.  If that argument were sound it could apply to the Minister or the Government also and it could be said that you could get a better body of men to fill the Government seats who could not and would not get the confidence of the public.  So that argument fails.</P>
      <P>For the record, it is now generally accepted that although the health boards have been in operation since April, 1970, little or no worthwhile improvements have taken place under the new system.  I know of none.  There are more dissatisfied people now in regard to health services&mdash;one meets them in one's constituency and I am sure this applies in all constituencies&mdash;than when the Health Estimate was £5.7 million as it was in 1948.  That may seem peculiar but it is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has heard a number of contributions on the procedures and regulations governing eligibility for medical card services.  This is possibly one of the greatest questions for the <Col N="361" /> Minister, the health boards, public representatives and those engaged in health administration generally.  The main reason, of course, is that money values are steadily declining and health costs are increasing rapidly, and families who are stricken with illness and whose incomes are moderate find it very difficult to measure up to the costs involved in getting proper care and medicines for the members of their family who are afflicted with illness of one kind or another.  The guideline set down of £16.50 for a married couple, with £1 per week in respect of each child&mdash;it was 75p and I understand it has been increased by 25p&mdash; gross figures, of course&mdash;would exclude a man with a wife and four children whose gross income was more than £20.50 weekly and that is an exceptionally moderate sum, having regard to present-day money values.  How is such a person to buy medicines at an average cost in many instances of £2 or £3 per item, equating an item to a prescription?  The average prescription, I would say, would cost in or about an average of £2.</P>
    <P>I am joining with the other members who expressed dissatisfaction with the figure set down and the rigid manner in which the administration deals with applications at present.  It seems to me that so far as wage earners are concerned, if you are above the income limit, irrespective of how small the figure in excess of that limit may be, you get a letter telling you that you are excluded from benefit.  I did refer to families who in the old days were getting some special consideration, some of the members of which had poor health and had occasion to have medical attention regularly. Surely in such cases that kind of attention should be provided at public expense? I am stressing that again tonight. It has been stressed already, but I think that with the amount of money which we are paying to doctors now and the new terms made available to them, this kind of service could be provided at little additional cost. The men are there already paid for and I assume that we buy medicines&mdash; when I say we, I mean the public&mdash; at a cost some 40 per cent below what <Col N="362" /> it would cost the private individual to buy them.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle may think my margin of profit rather too high and maybe it is, but in any case it is probably better to say that a body like a health authority purchasing substantial amounts of medicines will get terms much more favourable than those given to the private individual, and I hope something will be done to rectify the present unsatisfactory position and that some directives will be issued to the chief executive officers of health boards on the matter.  If that is not done, there is no purpose in having discussions in this House.  It serves no purpose to take up time here, time which is costly on public funds, to discuss such matters or for elected representatives to bring them to the notice of the Minister if some action is not taken, and definitely this medical card field is a field which cries out for action at present.</P>
    <P>Leaving the question of cards&mdash;my sequence may not be too good&mdash;I move to another section, that is, the section who do not qualify for medical cards and who have to avail of the services of the voluntary health insurance scheme in order to provide against illness arising in their families. I am not satisfied that some families are getting a fair deal.  Possibly it would be better to say that I am not satisfied with the voluntary health insurance system as it applies at present. It is difficult to get over what I have in mind but it relates to families above the £1,600 income limit or the valuation limit in the case of farmers, one or more of whose members is stricken with illness which needs continuous or regular attention.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board will exclude that member when an application is made.  He may be mentally handicapped and his parents are keeping him at home.  He may be a person moving on to manhood and may be suffering from several other ailments, and with the exception of a few ailments such as diabetes and two or three others, there is no cover for him at all.  I know some in my constituency who find themselves in this position and they are not very well-off financially.  I have one person in mind <Col N="363" /> whose income would be around the £2,000 mark.  One member of his family needs regular attention.  He must provide medical services for that member.  The board excluded him. They could not cater for someone who obviously would be a liability. They excluded him when representations were made because his parents' income was deemed to be well over the set standard.  It would be about £300 or £400 over the limit.  In such cases some means must be devised whereby, say, the voluntary health insurance would carry the liability even if that meant an overall increase in their charges.  This and all such families would be joining such a scheme anyway and paying their contributions, but they are in this unfortunate position that one member is suffering from this ailment of a continuous nature and they have been told that institutional treatment would not be any great advantage so far as the possibility of a cure is concerned. Many families are anxious to keep such a handicapped relative at home and this is desirable.  I am putting this forward here.  I am not offering any suggestion as to how it could be overcome. I know the health board's view that if they take such a person and accept responsibility for him, he is bound to be a liability on their funds over many years.  I am making a sincere plea for such people.  The Minister and his Department should devise some method of helping those who are outside the limit but who, by virtue of the illness of members of their family, find it difficult to provide the care and attention required.</P>
    <P>Numerous memoranda and books have been issued telling us of the many advances in our health services.  There is one from Mr. Brendan Hennessy painting a rather bright picture of how smoothly our health services are moving. I do not think that is so.  There have been statements issued from the Department telling us about all the services that are provided and all the schemes that operate for the benefit of our community.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare in his speech this evening on the Social Welfare Bill re-echoed the views of <Col N="364" /> Members of this House on the desirability of keeping old people in their own homes as far as it is humanly possible to do so.  He said it was a matter more for the Department of Health but one would think that the two Departments would put their heads together and try to devise some helpful scheme for our old people.  I have made suggestions from time to time which I think would go a long way towards relieving the congestion in our district hospitals and our county homes.  I do not like using the term &ldquo;county home&rdquo;. We have, with our relatively small population, more hospital beds per head of population than any country in the world.  In Cork County we have almost 10,000 hospital beds and that is an exceptionally big figure in proportion to the population of the county. How is it then that it is almost impossible to get hospital accommodation, especially for old people, at present? It strikes me that even if we were to increase hospital accommodation sharply the same position would obtain. I tried, when on the former health authority in Cork, to go a part of the way towards relieving that position.  I tried to get approval, unsuccessfully of course, for the payment of disablement allowances to incapacitated persons of more than 70 years of age. My reason for so doing is that such supplementary allowances would help families to care for these old persons at home.  I know that many people would like to keep their aged parents at home and they should be obliged to do so, but having regard to the small incomes of some households that is exceptionally difficult.  Then there are cases of relatives outside the first degree, uncles, aunts, cousins.  It must be distressing for some of these people when they are advancing in years to realise that it is possible that they will end their days in some institution, if a bed can be obtained there.  The most distressing feature of all and one which amazes me is that in order to get admission to what used to be described as a county home, representations must be made.  That is a peculiar situation. In the past, people tried to avoid having to go into such places.  In west Cork we renovated and reconstructed the county home and brought it up to <Col N="365" /> the standard, possibly beyond the standard, of the average district hospital.</P>
    <P>There must be something wrong in regard to hospitalisation.  Are our people more prone to illness than people in other countries?  How is it that, apart from district hospitals and homes for elderly persons, the acute care hospitals&mdash;and there are a number in County Cork, Dublin and Galway&mdash;have long waiting lists for admission?  I do not understand the reason for that.  The only conclusion I can come to is that the Irish are not a healthy race, that they need more hospital care and are more prone to hospitalisation than other races.</P>
    <P>There may be another reason.  I do not know whether the Department try to probe these questions in order to find answers to them.  In the past, people were not inclined to go to hospital except where hospitalisation was urgently needed.  The system seems to have changed, in my view unnecessarily, especially in the case of aged persons.  If they were to receive an additional allowance, where circumstances warranted it, to remain at home and be cared for there, there would not be so great a need for institutionalisation.  I refer to an additional allowance over and above the prescribed relative allowance of £2.75 applicable in certain cases and which is helpful.  As I mentioned earlier today on the Social Welfare Bill, even for two persons, the allowance would amount to only about £8 a week.</P>
    <P>I ventured to assert that the <i>per capita</i> charge in district hospitals should be more than £30 a week.  The Minister for Social Welfare gave the figure at something less than £20.  I think that figure is incorrect.  In my view, having regard to the increase in costs that has taken place in the last few years, it costs more than £30 to maintain an aged person in a district hospital.  Five or six years ago, in Cork, the cost was, on average, about £18 and I have no doubt that the cost has increased by 70 or 80 per cent since then.  I appeal, therefore, to the Minister to give more consideration than is given at present to the provision of financial help, where circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> In the departmental circular of 20th April, 1972, on home help services, which is a rather lengthy document with several subheads, there is very little reference to financial aid to individual families.  If financial aid were given to the families or to the aged persons, most of whom are social rather than medical cases, that would suffice.  Many of these old persons do not need medical attention in hospitals. An extra payment in these cases, where circumstances warrant it, would be the best way to provide for them and would have the effect of keeping them in their own homes.</P>
    <P>It was emphasised on the Social Welfare Bill today, and it had the approval of the Minister for Social Welfare, that it is desirable to keep as many old persons as possible in their own homes, first, because old people like to remain in their own homes and like to live out their lives in familiar surroundings.  We do not like institutional life and avail of it only when there is no alternative.  As I said when the Minister was absent from the House, he should consult with the Minister for Social Welfare and try to get his priorities right in regard to the alleviation of the overcrowding in district hospitals and homes.  The best way to do that is to give financial help to families and individual old persons.  The authorities are very niggardly towards applicants for this kind of help.  I know a number of cases.  I might mention at this stage the non-implementation of section 69. This would relieve the position to a considerable extent, particularly for those under the age of 70.  The Minister indicated that so far as these disabled people are concerned, the additional cost would be more than £1 million.  I realise that this money must come from the people but he should provide that £1.25 million and pay the allowances on a means system similar to that operating with regard to old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned about mentally handicapped people.  We have the greatest of sympathy for them but the burden rests on the State to provide for them.  We are spending a great deal of money on the modernisation of institutions for these people but this is <Col N="367" /> a necessary expenditure in order to help them.  Our ratio of mentally ill people per head of the population is higher than in neighbouring countries. The building of smaller units would be an effective way of providing accommodation for these people.  The old-type hospitals, such as the old Cork Mental Hospital which was a huge building housing some 2,000 people, is not the best type of accommodation.  The type of unit built in Cork, known as St. Anne's, is the ideal accommodation for these people.  It is not fair to apply the term &ldquo;mentally handicapped&rdquo; to many of the patients.  Some of them may be in the institution for a short period only but they may have to spend some time in a hospital to receive corrective treatment.</P>
    <P>Therapy work in our institutions is something we should encourage.  It is desirable to build up the confidence of people during their stay in mental homes; to teach them skills or to advance the skills they have is praiseworthy. Every effort should be made by social welfare working groups to provide suitable employment for those people when they have finished their treatment.  This will give them a sense of independence and will help them in their rehabilitation efforts.</P>
    <P>The problem with regard to mentally handicapped children is sizeable.  In this case, also, we have a higher ratio per head of population who are suffering in this regard than other countries. I know that the Cork group of the Polio Association, in conjunction with the Department and the health board, have made quite an impact in Cork. Although other institutions have done the same in other parts of the country, despite this there is demand for accommodation which is not available.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of extreme urgency. The provision of suitable accommodation with training for mentally handicapped children should be given top priority.  In Cork we get many representations from parents but despite the efforts of all concerned the accommodation is not available.  Let us hope that this problem will diminish in the years to come.  If the additional accommodation is provided it can be used for <Col N="368" /> other purposes if it is not required for the mentally handicapped children. Therefore, it is not a case of pouring money down the drain.</P>
    <P>I shall not take up the time of the House by going into details on the administration of health boards.  I have made my views clear regarding the constitution of these and other boards so far as other aspects of local government administration is concerned.  I believe in the democratic system but I know that there are moves afoot to abolish that system.  For instance, there are plans for removing as many powers as possible from public representatives at local level.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are not the only culprits in this respect because there are some people in both the Fine Gael and Labour Parties who advocate this step also.  This ailment, as I shall call it, arises because many people in our society who are deemed to be professional do not like the idea of giving their time on such bodies as county councils.  They consider it a waste of time to attend meetings of these bodies and to have to deal with correspondence from the people they represent.  While some of them may like to be members of these bodies they would prefer to be selected for membership of them without having to be elected.  Knowing that they will not have to answer to anybody they would consider themselves free to say what they wished.  I shall not go any deeper into that question for the moment.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I would like to raise for the purpose of geting a comment on it.  I refer to people in this country who, without qualifications of any kind, set themselves up as healers of one kind or another.  I know that there are such people as bone setters who are successful and who are capable and efficient but there are many others whose activities are questionable.  These people advertise in the newspapers to the effect that they are capable of healing certain ailments.  They usually request that a certain amount of money be forwarded to them in the first instance for which they will, in turn, forward medication of some kind.  Unfortunate people suffering from the ailment for <Col N="369" /> which a remedy is advertised will very often take a chance and buy the medication offered.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that such public advertisements should be subject to scrutiny for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is any merit in the commodities advertised.  No one knows how much one of these people might earn from his activity.  In recent times there has been one particular group of people moving around the country and attracting huge crowds.  Many people spend a lot of money when they attend the clinics at which these people operate.  Sufferers are told, after these alleged healers lay their hands on them, that they may be cured.  I am doubtful as to the authenticity of these operations.  I am wondering whether the Department should investigate the activities of these people.  Many people in Cork have availed of these services in the belief that they will be cured. I do not share their faith in that respect and I do not like to see money being extracted from them in such circumstances. In some instances people travel many miles to visit these alleged healers.  In fact, three or four people whom I have known personally in west Cork have moved from there to the province of Ulster in the hope of being cured.  The cost involved for these people was formidable.  They are entitled to do as they wish but the State has some obligation to see that they are not being fooled.  Perhaps an inquiry by an independent party would be the answer.  This would ascertain whether these people have the powers they claim and whether cures are effected.</P>
    <P>To sum up briefly, the matters I have raised here today and on the last occasion: I drew the Minister's attention to the desirability of changing the regulations governing eligibility for medical cards, changing the regulations so far as they apply at present to married women who are never deemed to be engaged in gainful employment and are consequently precluded from qualifying for disabled person's allowances. I mention these matters to the Minister and I suggest that he should not wait until the debate concludes to do away with this system.  I read to the House a letter from the Cork <Col N="370" /> Health Board relating to a particular case to illustrate what is happening. I suggest that the Minister should not let that happen again because it is a most outrageous feature of our health services.</P>
    <P>The next item I have in mind is the desirability of providing additional accommodation for mentally handicapped children and the other very important item, the desirability of recasting the rules and the conditions of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to cater for members of families&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would require legislation, but I will not argue with the Chair.  I want to focus attention on this group of people who find the situation difficult now because their means are deemed to be too high or in excess of the qualifying amount for services under the health services system, even though their parents must pay their share.  I have not referred to the big demands for our health services of which they must pay their share and I illustrated one case of a man with £2,000 per year who was told that he was too well off to qualify under the health services system and, by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, that he was not fit enough <Col N="371" /> medically to qualify for that scheme. I leave it to the Minister and his advisers to devise some system which will overcome this difficulty.</P>
      <P>I conclude by giving one last piece of advice to the Minister.  It is that as far as he possibly can he should keep away from the road he is travelling at present, and travelling at a reasonably fast rate, particularly taking into account his attitude to representations by Cork County Council regarding the South Cork Health Advisory Service.  This is the road towards bureaucratic control and the Minister should get away from it.  He was elected to this House on a democratic basis and he should acknowledge the rights of elected representatives and of the electorate.  This kind of system which is creeping in here, as I mentioned earlier, the eastern European system, is a bad one and he should keep off that track.  Otherwise, to my mind, something serious will happen. The people who pay the piper should see their elected representatives with more say than they have at present in calling the tune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has occupied a number of hours now and has ranged widely in scope.  I suspect that this desire to broaden the scope of the debate is generated by the Minister's attitude in providing all information necessary for Deputies and others on every aspect of the health services.  I have for some time been interested in health and I must say that his introductory speech was very informative, as was the comprehensive folder which he provided in relation to auxiliary matters such as &ldquo;Home Safety,&rdquo;&ldquo;What Sort of a Drinker Are You?&rdquo; and a &ldquo;clean shopping list.&rdquo; I suggest that all those pieces of information, if I may refer to them as such, are calculated to make people aware of the general rules appertaining to higher health standards all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, I think I should add a word in appreciation of the volume of work achieved by the Minister's staff in the Custom House.  I must say that in relation to the size of this staff the output during the past <Col N="372" /> number of years of information in general on every aspect of health has been enormous.</P>
    <P>Having some knowledge of the health system we should not let this occasion pass without recognising the services rendered by the Minister and his staff.  We are now beginning to realise that health presents a changing scene and that what was deemed satisfactory ten years ago would not be acceptable now.  We must recognise in general the changing pattern of health services and we must see in it some of the advances that have been made.  I have heard it argued that the scope of the health system has not expanded in recent years.  I could mount a good argument to support the opposite case. It was said here that the scope of the general medical service did not expand. I say it did and that it has been upgraded. Persons who were hitherto only partly covered by the old system have now got full cover.  I shall return to that point later.</P>
    <P>In the past 15 months the hospital system has changed.  I gather there is some criticism of this.  People in general are afraid of change but I think the Minister has in his speech and his explanation today on the Statutory Instrument setting up the system to administer the new hospital system, said sufficient to show that there is nothing in it which either a county councillor, a voluntary health worker or a Deputy might fear.  Consultation and teamwork are advocated at every term.  I do not want to indulge in overpraise or overkill but when we come to debate change here we are inclined to overkill.  I was on the select health committee which went on for roughly three years and held 60 meetings and as far back as the time of that committee most of the measures embodied in the Minister's proposals to change the hospital system were then advocated by the regional specialists and other medical men who were in very close touch with health and medicine in general.  Therefore, it should not be said now that there is any attempt to infringe on democratic principles.</P>
    <P>The health board system rests on the personnel nominated by various county councils and the regional health board <Col N="373" /> are responsible for the general health scheme in their own area.  On the other side it was argued as far back as then that a regional health system could not work properly unless it was coordinated with a higher system of regional hospital boards governed by a hospital board.  There were very good reasons for that proposition.  Even at that early stage the reasons advanced were that the proposed boards should preferably be in the university areas. There were good reasons for that also because that is where those boards would have the facility of drawing on the medical faculties in the various universities, where laboratory services could be provided and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the point made by some Deputies that there was an overt attempt here to take away from the functions of members of local authorities.  There is no such attempt.  There is a genuine plan to change the hospital system and this calls for a different sort of administration. This was well explained by the Minister when he was introducing his Estimate.  It is not a good enough argument, on the part of those who criticise this move to improve our hospital system, to merely say, and leave it at that, that we are interfering with the rights of elected members of local authorities.  This is not so and the people who make this charge know this very well because most of those who make it, strangely enough, are the nominated members of health boards. In our capacity as members of local authorities we get correspondence.  We <Col N="374" /> got various letters which emerged from quarters which would be suspect to say the least of it, which would have a vested interest in seeing to it that the change in the hospital scheme would not proceed too quickly, urging that this proposed change be slowed down. The members of my local authority had enough sense to mark those letters read, unanimously.  It was the right thing to do.  Most people are afraid of change but we need not be afraid of it if we know how to handle it.  This change is being well handled.  If we want to keep up with the changing methods in the field of surgery, in the field of consultation and in the auxiliary services I suggest we should accept the system as proposed and try to work it.  I mentioned that subject because a number of speakers seem to be preoccupied with the idea that we were adopting Eastern European methods.  This is not so.</P>
      <P>I shall move now to the measures taken to put preventive medicine on a better basis.  The Minister referred to a report which he had before him regarding the patient/hospital relationship, the length of stay of patients, the mortality rate <i>et cetera.</i> It is a very laudable aim to extend and broaden the scope of the scheme of preventive medicine.  Nowhere does this show up better than in the mental health section. The figures the Minister gave in relation to the fall off in the number of long-stay patients in mental hospitals are impressive.</P>
