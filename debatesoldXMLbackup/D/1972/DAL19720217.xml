      <P>Deputy Begley made a remark which I consider it important to contradict.  He said that the Estimate for Fisheries was down this year.  Of course, that is not true and I can only conclude from that remark that Deputy Begley has not read my introductory speech.  If he had read that speech he would have realised that there is an increase of £250,000 on last year's requirements.  This increase is an indication of the Government's confidence in the industry and we want to ensure that the confidence of those engaged in the industry will be sustained.</P>
      <P>Deputy Begley referred, too, to the question of a conservation policy and he queried me as to what is this policy. Every fishery administration must, of necessity, have a conservation policy, the primary purpose of which is to ensure the rational exploitation of fishery stocks.  These stocks are not inexhaustible. They must be managed in a proper manner if the species is to survive.  Nothing can be more detrimental to fish stocks than overfishing which, while it may reap a bonanza in the short run, would certainly lead to a collapse in the long run.  At present we can see the effects of overfishing for herrings in the North Sea. It was with a view to conservation of stocks that we succeeded in the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission in having purse seine netting for herrings forbidden; this is a most efficient method but forbidden in the Dunmore East herring fisheries.  Similarly, we have been instrumental in having salmon fishing in the high seas outside our national fishing limits banned totally in a sanctuary area round the UK and this country.  No doubt Deputies are aware of the various bylaws on close seasons, weekly fishing times and so on, all of which measures are taken in the interest of conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention also that discussions have taken place between representatives of the fishermen, BIM and my Department as to what further conservation measures might be adopted. The results of these discussions are <Col N="2001" /> under consideration.  It will be seen therefore, that we are not neglecting this vital task of conservation.  On the contrary, we are very much alive to the problem, we are dealing with it in a positive way and shall continue to do so.</P>

      <P>The question of pollution was raised by Deputies Blaney and Moore and also by one or two other Deputies.  Pollution is a matter that is engaging public attention now.  It is engaging our attention also.  I think sometimes that there is a tendency to exaggerate the effects of pollution.  The impression seems to be created that we are doing nothing to deal with the problem.  Of course, we are very much aware of the problem and are taking steps to deal with it.  There is a working arrangement between the IDA, the IIRS and my Department whereby applications to the IDA for grants towards the erection of new industries or the adaptation of existing ones are vetted at the outset from the point of view of pollution.  Indeed, the IDA, in their grants structures make allowance for plant additions necessary to deal with possible pollution.  All these applications are examined jointly by the IIRS and my Department and the necessary measures by way of licensing conditions, so as to avoid pollution or reduce it to tolerable levels, are agreed on.  In addition, in the agricultural side of the Department, the officials in conjunction with the advisory services of the committees of agriculture have been advising the farming community on measures to avoid or minimise pollution from agricultural sources, including silage effluents.  To help in this, the grants available under the scheme of building grants administered by the Department include provisions for anti-pollution measures such as provision of storage tanks.  I might say also that the officers of my Department form part of a working group set up by the Minister for Local Government to examine all aspects of water and air pollution and to make recommendations as to future action.  I hope that <Col N="2002" /> will help to relieve the anxiety expressed by Deputies regarding pollution. I can assure the House that the fisheries section are keeping a close watch on developments, with particular reference to industrial developments and the building of silage pits by the farming community which could be detrimental to fish life.</P>
      <P>I shall not refer to inland fisheries in great detail because at the moment the Inland Fisheries Commission are sitting and we hope they will have some worthwhile suggestions to make.  From personal contact with the commission I know they are doing important work and I look forward to their report. There was the usual mention in this House regarding nationalisation of our inland fisheries.  This is a matter that has been mentioned frequently for many years.  The Inland Fisheries Commission will give this matter their attention. One of the main points in their terms of reference is the tenure of inland fisheries and it is inevitable that the commission will consider this important matter.  I await with interest their recommendations and I can assure the House that such recommendations will have a bearing on whatever decision the Government may take in the matter.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the restructuring of the boards of conservators. These bodies are in the main elected bodies and, therefore, they should be responsive to those interests for whom they speak.  It may be that not all boards are free from defects of judgment, but in my experience they do a creditable job in looking after the fisheries within their districts.  No doubt the entire conservancy system will be examined by the Inland Fisheries Commission and I shall be glad to consider any recommendations they may make on the matter.  Therefore, I do not think it is necessary for me to comment on inland fisheries in great detail.  We have a widely representative commission consisting of 22 members connected with all branches of inland fisheries and I look forward with confidence to the worthwhile suggestions I know they will make.  It would not be proper for me to comment on this matter in great detail until the commission report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2003" /> There are many other matters with regard to the fishing industry I should like to mention but I do not want to detain the House unduly.  If I have not covered all the points that have been raised by Deputies during the debate I would ask them to forgive me. If they consider they have not got adequate information they can come to me in my office, or write to me, or if they prefer they can put down Parliamentary Questions.  I shall be only too pleased to give all the information possible at any time.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that in replying to such an important debate it is not easy to recall all the points made and deal with them all.</P>
    <P>Question put, and a division being demanded, it was postponed in accordance with the Order of the Dáil of 4th November, 1969, until 10.15 p.m. on Tuesday, 22nd February, 1972.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Gó ndeonófar suim fhorlíontach nach mó ná £10 chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun íoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mártha, 1972, le haghaidh tuarastail agus costais Oifig an Aire Oideachais (lena n-áirítear Forais Eolaíochta agus Ealaíon), le haghaidh seirbhísí ilghnéitheacha áirithe oideachais agus cultúir, agus chun ildeontais-i-gcabhair a íoc.</P>
      <P>Suim £83,368,000 an soláthar atá déanta sna seacht Vótaí a bhfuil mé freagrach iontu.  Is méadú é seo de £9,814,000 i soláthar na bliana airgeadais seo chuaigh thart, eadar na Meastacháin bhunaidh agus na meastacháin bhreise.  Tá soláthar £3,850,000 i Vóta a 3 (Oibreacha agus Foirgintí Poiblí) le haghaidh tógáil.  méadú agus feabhsú scoileanna náisiúnta.  Is ionann an dá shuim le chéile agus breis is 17½ faoin gcéad den chaiteachas ar na seirbhísí soláthair.</P>
      <P>Bheirim anois don Teach mion-eolas áirithe maidir leis na Vótaí éagsúla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clúdaíonn an Vóta seo: (a) costais <Col N="2004" /> riaracháin na Roinne Oideachais; (b) na seirbhísí i dtaca leis na hinstitiúdí Eolaíochta agus Ealaíne; (c) seirbhísí ilghnéitheacha oideachasúla.</P>
    <P>Sé £7,124,000 an méid atá á hiarraidh faoin Vóta seo, méadú glan de £1,225,000 ar an tsuim a vótáileadh anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Seo a leanas na príomhrudaí is cúis leis an mhéadú seo: (1) £450,000 de mhéadú ar sheirbhísí iompair; (2) £25,000 i leith corp oideachais; (3) £55,000 sa bhreis atá á chur ar fáil i mbliana i leith áiseanna teagaisc clos-amhairc; (4) £172,000 de mhéadú ar na deontais ard-oideachais; (5) £320,000 de mhéadú ar chostais riaracháin na Roinne.</P>
    <P>Sé £3,500,000 an méid iomlán atá riachtanach anois leis na seirbhísí iompair do scoileanna a fheidhmiú.</P>
    <P>Tá líon na ndaltaí bunscoile a fhaigheann iompar méadaithe ó 42,700 go 52,000 agus líon na ndaltaí iarbhunscoile méadaithe ó 72,000 go 74,500.  Tá fairsingiú déanta againn fosta ar na seirbhísí iompair do dhaltaí eislinneacha; agus cé nach ndealraíonn an líon atá i gceist a bheith mór i gcomórtas le daonra na scoileanna i gcoitinne, tuigfear gur mó i bhfad costas iompair gach dalta.</P>
    <P>Sé an fás leanúnach atá faoi na huimhreacha atá ag freastal ar iarbhunscoileanna is mó is cúis leis na costais mhéadaithe.  Thig linn a rá le fírinne anois nach gceiltear faill oideachais ar pháiste ar bith a thuilleadh as siocair a áit chónaithe bheith i bhfad ó scoil.</P>
    <P>Tá na seirbhísí bunscoile ag borradh leo i rith an ama, go háithrid sna háiteacha a ndruitear scoileanna beaga agus a n-iompraítear na daltaí saor in aiscidh chun lárscoileanna. Íoctar £352,000 le CIE anois mar dheontas d'fhonn na táillí iompair a íocann páistí scoile nach bhfuil cearta saor-thaistil acu a choimeád slán ó na hardaithe a rinneadh ins na táillí i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Tá £55,000 sa bhreis á chur ar fáil d'áiseanna teagaisc clos-amhairc agus do chúrsaí do mhúinteoirí.  Beartaítear cuid den airgead seo a chaitheamh ar ullmhú ábhar clos-amhairc a bhéas <Col N="2005" /> fóirstineach le húsáid sna cinéalacha éagsúla de ghléasanna sofaisticiúla a bhíonn sna scoileanna anois.  Tá stiallscannáin áirithe á ndéanamh faoi láthair ar eolas iomshaoil, stair agus tíreolaíocht agus roinnt téipeanna á ngléasadh le haghaidh ranganna ceoil. Is do na bunscoileanna iad seo uile, mar chuid de na háiseanna d'oidí atá i gcionn an churaclaim nua.  Tá sé i gceist níos faide anonn fónamh mar an gcéanna do churaclam na n-iarbhun-scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Tá aonad deá-chóirithe áiseanna clos-amhairc sa Roinn agus fearadh na fáilte ann roimh oidí a thig ag lorg treorach ón oifigeach i gceannas.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom anois tagairt do na deontais ard-oideachais.  Sa bhliain acadúil 1970-71, bhí 3,562 micléinn ann a raibh na deontais seo acu agus ba é £871,617 a luach iomlán, móide fó-dheontais de thart ar £46,000 a tugadh mar chúiteamh i leith méadú táillí.  Sular tugadh an scéim seo deontas isteach ní raibh ach tuairim is 800 macléinn ar iolscoileanna agus ar fhorais eile ardoideachais a raibh scoláireachtaí acu ó chomhairleacha contae agus contae-bhuirg.</P>
    <P>Is mar a leanas atá costais riaracháin na Roinne: £1,670,700 i leith tuarastail agus liúntais; £178,000 i leith chostais taistil; agus £205,000 i leith seirbhísí postála.  Níl sa mhéid ar fad ach tuairim is 2½ faoin gcéad den iomlán atá á dháil ar chúrsaí oideachais, rud a bhéarfas le fios don Teach á dhícheallaí agus atá srian á choinneáil ar na costais seo.</P>
    <P>Orthu siúd atá ar fhoireann na Roinne tá 17 siceolaithe oideachais, agus dualgas orthu maidir le treorú dhaltaí iarbhunscoile, eagrú oiliúint inseirbhíse oidí, agus forbairt tástála siceolaíochta.  Is cuid bhunusach rialta dá gcuid oibre a bheith i gcomhairle agus i gcomhar le micléinn, le tuismitheoirí agus le hoidí agus daoine proifisiúnta eile.</P>
    <P>Tá 247 oifigigh ar fad ar fhoireann phroifisiúnta na Roinne.</P>
    <P>Thóg an Roinn uirthi féin i 1968 iris oideachasúil, darb ainm <i>Oideas</i> a fhoilsiú.  Foilsítear dhá uair sa bhliain í agus bíonn altanna ar chúrsaí léinn <Col N="2006" /> inti ar mhaith le hoidí agus lucht oideachais eile a choinneáil ar an eolas.  Daoine atá ag saothrú i ngort an oideachais, ón taobh amuigh agus ón taobh istigh den Roinn, a scríobhann na haltanna seo.  Is ábhar sástachta le gach duine lena mbaineann teacht na hirise seo ar an tsaol.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar glan sa Vóta seo don bhliain 1971-72 de £30,938,000, méadú de £2,750,000 ar sholáthar na bliana anuraidh.  Sula dtéim isteach go mion i gcúrsaí an chaiteachais seo ba mhaith liom trácht ar an bhunoideachas i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Ar 30 Meitheamh, 1970, bhí 517,778 daltaí ar rollaí, i gcomórtas le 509,725 ar an lá céanna i 1969.  Is ionann sin agus méadú 8,000.  Tá tuairim is 15,200 oidí cáilithe sa tseirbhís anois.  Ó tosaíodh ar pholasaí cónasctha na scoileanna beaga, tháining laghdú de 909 ar líon iomlán an scoileanna.  Ar na scoileanna a druideadh, bhí 471 scoileanna aon-aide agus 389 scoileanna bheirt-oide.  Druideadh 124 scoileanna i rith na bliana 1970: sé 3,929 líon na scoileanna atá anois ag fónamh.</P>
    <P>Is minic go dtarlaíonn an iomarca fóirne sna lár-scoileanna atheagraithe de thairbhe chónascadh scoileanna. Thagair mé anuraidh don bhónas brostaithe de £200 arb aidhm dó na hoidí iomarcacha seo a mhealladh chun postanna eile.  Tograim i mbliaina an bónas seo a ardú go £400, le súil go gcuirfear dlús le cothromú dháil na n-oidí ar fud an chórais.</P>
    <P>Tugadh an curaclam nua do na bun-scoileanna isteach go foirmeálta i mí Iúil na bliana seo.  Tá an dá imleabhar de láimhleabhar an oide sna scoileanna faoi seo agus tá fealsúnacht agus modhanna an chláir úir ag leathnú leo de réir a chéile go sásúil.  Ní bréag a rá nár cuireadh oiread fáilte i gcoitinne roimh bheart fiúntach ar bith eile de chuid na Roinne le blianta anuas&mdash; agus ba iomaí sin beart fiúntach a rinneadh&mdash;agus a fearadh roimh an churaclam seo.  Tá na Teachtaí agus an pobal uile eolach go leor anois ar an mhachnamh is préamh don churaclam, agus ní rún domh soisceál i lár Aifrinn a dhéanamh de anseo.  Sé an rud is mian liom luí air go bhfuil trí riachtanas ann leis an churaclam a <Col N="2007" /> thabhairt in éifeacht go rathúil, mar atá:</P>
    <P>(1) leor-sholáthar fearaistí don oide;</P>
    <P>(2) ranganna de mhéid réasúnta agus</P>
    <P>(3) tuigse a bheith ag na hoidí do mhodhanna agus do fhealsúnacht an chláir.</P>
    <P>I dtaca le fearaistí don oide de, is ábhar pléisiúir domh a chur in iúl don Teach go bhfuil £250,000 curtha ar fáil agam sa bhliain airgeadais reatha i leith fearaistí, i leith bhunú aonaid mhúinteoirí agus i leith tionscnaimh áitiúla faoin chlár nua a spreagadh.  Tá dhá chineál fearaistí scoile ann.  An chéad cheann, an bog-ábhar coitianta a bhíonn in úsáid go laethúil.  Leis an ábhar seo a cheannacht, gheobhaidh gach scoil gach bliain suim áithrid de réir a méide.  Sé sin, gheobhaidh scoil bheirt-oide corradh le £20 sa bhliain agus scoil deichniúr oidí corradh le £100.  Lena chois seo, tá scéim eile á tionscnamh agam faoinar féidir treallamh sofaisticiúil &mdash; téip-thaifeadáin, gléasanna dúbláide agus a leithéid &mdash;a chur ar fáil do scoileanna a bhainfeas lán-fheidhm astu, ar bhonn deontas 75 faoin gcéad den chostas.</P>
    <P>An lárionad seo do mhúinteoirí, is smaoineamh nua i gcúrsaí oideachais é.  Go hachomair, sé is feidhm dó:</P>
    <P>(a) ionad cruinnithe a chur ar fáil a dtiocfaidh múinteoirí le chéile ann chun fadhbanna a gcuid oibre a phlé;</P>
    <P>(b) a bheith ina lárionad gléasraí agus treallaimh a ndéanfaidh múinteoirí ábhar a ullmhú ann le haghaidh na scoileanna;</P>
    <P>(c) áit tionóil a sholáthar le haghaidh chúrsaí staidéir i gclár na scoile;</P>
    <P>(d) a bheith ina ionad teaspáintis do shaothar oidí agus daltaí, téacsleabhair, etc.</P>
    <P>Is iomaí gasra staidéir atá ann ar fud na tíre mar a dtig múinteoirí i gcionn a chéile ag beachtú a gciall dá ngairm, ag plé ghnéithe dá gcuid oibre agus ag malartú smaoineamh.  Faoi láthair cuirtear as go mór dóibh cionnas gan buan-áit fhóirstineach tionóil, gléasraí <Col N="2008" /> nó ábhair thagartha a bheith ar fáil acu.  Agus rogha-áiteanna a chur ar fáil ar fud na tíre do na daoine dúthrachtacha seo, sé mo mhian go gcuirfinn ar a gcumas dóibh a dtuigse a neartú, a ndeacrachtaí a réiteach agus a gciall dá n-acmhainn féin a ghéarú le gur fearr a gcuirfí in éifeacht é.  Is faoi na múinteoirí féin a d'fhágfaí stiúrú na lárionad seo le tacaíocht na Roinne agus chuirfí fáilte iontu roimh gach aicme oidí, eadar bhunoidí agus iarbhunoidí, mar is cóir do ghairm chomhtháite aon-chuspóra.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar éigin airgeadais á dhéanamh agam fosta le cur ar chumas na Roinne cuidiú le tionscnaimh mheasúla a fhorbairt a rachadh ar sochar do scoileanna i gceanntracha agus i réigiúin ar leith.  Sé an teolas imshaoil is fearr a fhóireann don chineál so saothair, ar mhéad a bhfuil d'fhairsinge ann faoin churaclam nua i gcúrsaí taighde staire, geograife agus tuaitheolaíochta.</P>
    <P>Nuair a deirim go gcaithfear méid réasúnta a bheith sa rang, más leis an oide agus na páistí araon iomlán tairbhe a bhaint as an chlár nua, aithním gurb é 1:32 an coibhneas oide-dalta atá ann sa tír uile le chéile. Mar sin de, dá mbeadh ár gcuid múinteoirí agus páistí eagraithe mar ba mhaith linn, bheadh an scéal gan locht againn.  Dá leitheadaí a gcuirfear an polasaí cónasctha i gcrích sea is túisce a ndéanfar cothromú mar is ceart ar an scéal seo.  Ach cé go ndéanann an polasaí cónasctha leas oideachais na bpáistí ar an toirt, is san aimsir is faide anonn a thiocfas buntáiste dá bharr ó thaoibh dáil mhúinteoirí de.</P>
    <P>Ní mór cuimhneamh freisin go bhfuil an daonra ag dul i méid anois, rud is maith le hinnse.  Cé go raibh líon na bpáistí bunscoile fán leathmhilliún le dornán bliantach anuas, tá sé anois fá 518,000 agus méadú á thuar dó go 540,000 i 1975 agus go 560,000 i 1980.  Is den ghéar-riachtanas é, mar sin, leor-soláthar d'oidí a oiliúint ina aghaidh seo, rud atá mé á dhéanamh ar theann mo dhíchill.  I mbliana, soláthraíodh 720 oidí nuaoilte&mdash;an uimhir ba mhó ariamh&mdash;do na scoileanna, agus tugadh 800 macléinn isteach ar oiliúint.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2009" /> Tá 1,400 macléinn ar fad faoi oliúint anois, a bhuíochas sin don fhás atá ag teacht faoi líon na macléinn eachtracha, agus don chomhoibriú fial fairsing a bhíonn i gcónaí ar fáil agam ó údaráis na gcoláistí oiliúna. Molaim go hard iad dá bharr.  Tá cúrsa speisialta aonbhliana curtha ar bun go sásúil i mbliana i gColáiste Phádraig do chéimithe iolscoile: ar an bhliain seo chugainn is rún domh líon aithrid de mhicléinn lán-fhásta a earcú do na coláistí don ghnáthchúrsa dhá bhliain.  Agus torthaí an dá pholasaí &mdash;polasaí cónasctha agus polasaí earcaíochta&mdash;a chur le chéile, tá mé in uchtaigh go gcinnteofar leor-soláthar agus leor-dháil mhúinteoirí ar fud na seirbhíse bunscolaíochta sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, tá fadhb an chúrsa trí bliana fós le réiteach againn.  Tá machnamh á dhéanamh ar seo in éineacht le tuairisc an Údaráis Ard-oideachais agus a bhfuarthas de thrácht air ó na páirtithe lena mbaineann. Má chuirtear le fad an chúrsa oiliúna do bhunoidí, caithfear riar do mhéadú na gcoláistí oiliúna agus, rud is mó tábhacht ná sin, don cháilíocht a bhronnfar ar na micléinn ar chríochnú a gcúrsa dóibh.  Is ábhar é seo a bhfuil fairsingeach machnaimh ann agus a bhfágfaidh sé de lorg ar ghairm na múinteoireachta go huile.</P>
    <P>Sula n-imím ó na coláistí oiliúna ba mhian liom trácht ar an scéim deontas do mhicléinn a d'éirig liom a thabhairt isteach i mbliana.  Cuireann an scéim seo micléinn na gcoláistí oiliúna ar an aon chéim lena gcomrádaithe iolscoile a fuair deontas faoin scéim deontais le haghaidh ard-oideachais.</P>
    <P>Is é £100, cailíní, agus £108, buachaillí, an táille bliantúil sna coláistí oiliúna le fada an lá.  Beartaím an táille a mhéadú go £125 i leith gach duine a thiocfas isteach sna coláistí ó 1972 amach.  Agus costais reatha san áireamh, measaim go n-aontóidh na Teachtaí uile go bhfuil an tsuim £125 sa bhliain i leith iostas, cónaí agus oiliúint an-réasúnta.</P>
    <P>Bíonn oidí nua-oilte eolach ar an churaclam nua de bhrí go ndéantar cúram den chlár úr sna coláistí oiliúna. <Col N="2010" /> Is fíor a rá go raibh na coláistí orthu siúd a leag dúshraith an churaclaim le turgnamh agus le tionscnamh.  Is iomaí oide sa tseirbhís áfach a gcaithfear féacháil lena dhearcadh a chur in oiriúint don athrú.  Chuige seo, tá beartas cuimsitheach d'oiliúint inseirbhíse á bhunú ag an Roinn.  Fán bhliain seo chugainn beidh cúrsa foirmeálta déanta ag beagnach 4,000 príomhoidí i bhfealsúnacht agus i modhanna an churaclaim. Níl anseo ach tús.</P>
    <P>Tá coiste ar oiliúint inseirbhíse bunaithe agam, ar a bhfuil ionadaithe ón Roinn, ó na coláistí oiliúna, na hiolscoileanna agus ó Chumann na Múinteoirí.  Tá pleananna fadtréimhseacha á leagan amach ag an choiste seo le cur ar chumas múinteoirí eadar 25 agus 60 bliana d'aois cúrsa athnuachana a fhreastal gach cúigiú&mdash; seachtú bliain.  Beartas taibhsiúil é seo; ach measaim gur riachtanas do-sheachanta é, agus a mbíonn de shíor-athrú ar theoiricí agus ar mhodhanna oideachais sna laethe seo.</P>
    <P>Ní fhéadfadh cigirí na Roinne agus foireann na gcoláistí oiliúna leo féin riar don riachtanas seo.  Caithfear a chinntiú i dtosach báire go mbeidh leor-soláthar de léachtóirí éifeachtacha ann i ngach gné den churaclam.  Mar thús, tá súil agam go mbeidh ar mo chumas 350 bunoidí roghnaithe a chur ar chúrsa speisialta i 1972.  Mar adeirim, níl anseo ach tús: bíonn castacht agus éagsúlacht ag baint leis na riachtanais oiliúna inseirbhíse a bhéas deacair a réiteach; beidh gach acmhainn agus seift dá bhfuil againn de dhíth lena sásamh.</P>
    <P>An scéim leabharlanna bunscoile a oibríonn an Roinn i gcomhar leis na húdaráis áitiúla, beidh sé i bhfeidhm ar fud na tíre ón bhliain seo amach ó thárla gur dócha na contaethe Cill Dara, Ceatharlach, Sligeach, An Clár agus Loch Garman anois istigh ann.  Tá an scéim ag dul ar sochar dona scoileanna go mór sna contaethe a bhfuil sé i bhfeidhm iontu.  Ba mhaith liom focal buíochais a rá leis na húdaráis áitiúla dá bharr as ucht na cabhrach airgeadais atá á chur ar fáil acu.  Ba mhaith liom focal ar leith a rá le leabharlannaithe na n-údarás áitiúil: marach a gcomhoibriú fonnmhar ní bheadh an scéim ann ar chor ar bith.  Anois, ó tharla <Col N="2011" /> na sé contaethe fichead uilig sa scéim, ba chóir go ndéanfaí é a dhaingniú agus a fhorbairt.  Tá fíor-ghá le leorábhar léitheoireachta sna scoileanna, go háithrid i gcomhthéacs an churaclaim nua.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom trácht anois ar chuid de na méaduithe is mó atá i Vóta 28 ar fhigiúirí na bliana anuraidh. Tá méadú de £1,898,000 ar Fho-Mhírcheann C1, Tuarastail Oidí, an chuid is mó de bharr íocaíocht an dara cuid, 10 faoin gcéad, den 12ú ardú agus na n-uimhreacha breise múinteoirí atá sa tseirbhís.  An méadú i bhFomhírcheann D, Aoisliúntais, de £455,000, baineann sé le arduithe dá réir i bpinsin agus arduithe sna cnapshuimeanna agus sna híocaíochtaí <i>ex gratia</i> do bhaintreachaí. Tá £144,000 sa bhreis i bhFomhírcheann A1, Coláistí Oiliúna, ag freagairt don fhás atá ag teacht faoi líon na macléinn faoi oiliúint agus don ghá atá ann le tuilleadh cóiríochta agus áiseanna.  An £194,000 sa bhreis atá i bhFomhírcheann C4, Deontais i leith Fearaistí Scoile, baineann sé leis an scéim nua le haghaidh bogábhair a sholáthar do na scoileanna, aonaid mhúinteoirí a bhunú, agus mar sin de, dar thagair mé roimhe seo.  Tá soláthar de £40,000 i bhFomhírcheann C9 fá choinne an dá imleabhar den churaclam nua bunscoile do chur i gcló.</P>
    <P>Bíodh is nach as an Vóta so a sholáraítear an t-airgead le haghaidh tógáil agus feabhsú scoileanna náisiúnta, ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don ghné thábhachtach so den soláthar atá á dhéanamh i gcóir an bhunoideachais.  Tá a lán á dhéanamh chun cóiríocht den chuid is fearr a chur ar fáil le haghaidh na bpáistí bun-scoile.  Tá an-ghlaoch orainn le haghaidh scoileanna nua ins na ceantracha ar tógadh tithe iontu le déanaí agus le haghaidh scoileanna nua do na páistí eislinneacha.  I dteannta le freastal ar na héilimh sin tá gach iarracht á dheánamh againn laistigh dar n-achmainn chun na sean-fhoirgintí a thabhairt suas do chaighdeán a theastódh anois.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain airgeadais 1970-71 tógadh 46 scoileanna nua agus críochníodh 51 mór-scéimeanna leathnaithe <Col N="2012" /> agus/nó feabhsaithe.  Ar an 31ú Márta bhí 79 scoileanna á dtógaint agus 75 scéimeanna feabhsaithe nó leasuithe idir lámhaibh.  Caitheadh £3,358,000 ar scéimeanna tógála bun-scoileanna sa bhliain airgeadais seo caite.</P>
    <P>Taobh amuigh den chaiteachas so caitheadh £38,200 ar obair phéinteála.</P>
    <P>Suas go dtí an bhliain airgeadais reatha deineadh an soláthar le haghaidh tógáil bhunscoileanna ar Vóta na nOibreacha Poiblí.  Ón mbliain seo chugainn amach beidh an soláthar le haghaidh tógáil gach saghas scoileanna ar Vótaí mo Roinne.</P>
    <P>Beartaím Vótaí 29 agus 30 a ghlacadh le chéile, ós aon aonad amháin liom sa chóras oideachais an iarbhunscolaíocht.  Leagaim béim ar an phointe seo, óir is riachtanach liom i gcúrsaí iarbhunoideachais cuimhneamh ar ár bpáistí uile, a n-inmheachtaí agus a gcumais.  Agus ní lú ná sin is riachtanach liom, más linn machnamh ar chor ar bith ar sheans cothrom ó thaobh oideachais a thabhairt do gach páiste an uile chómhgar ar chur ar fáil i ngach ceantar a fhónfas an oiread agus is féidir do pháistí uile go léir an cheantair sin.  Is ar an ábhar seo a bhíomar ag leagan meáchain chomh tréan sin ar an oideachas chuimsitheach, bíodh sé le fáil sna scoil-aonaid mhóra nó, nuair nach féidir sin go fóill, sa dlúthchomhoibriú eadar scoileanna.  Is beag an mhaith treoir-sheirbhís oideachasúil a chur ar fáil agus buanna gach dalta ar leith a aimsiú mura mbíonn ar chumas na scoile a fhreastalann sé na buanna sin a fhorbairt d'easpa áiseanna agus leithead sa churaclam.</P>
    <P>Ós ag caint ar chomhoibriú eadar iarbhunscoileanna mé, ní miste a rá go bhfuil cuid mhaith ama agus dúthrachta caite ag an Roinn ag iarraidh an comhar seo a chur chun cinn. Taobh amuigh de chúpla áit shonrach, ní raibh mórán le maíomh as ár saothar againn.  Ar a shon sin, is tuar dóchais na cruinnithe a bhí againn ar na mallaibh.  Cuirim fáilte roimhe seo, de bhrí nach ró-líonmhar na ceantracha a mbeidh sé indéanta scoileanna pobail a chur ar fáil iontu sna cúpla bliain atá romhainn amach.</P>
    <P>Na tograí a rinneadh maidir le <Col N="2013" /> scoileanna pobail a bhunú in áiteacha áithride, is iomaí sin caibideal a tharraing siad anuas sa Teach seo agus taobh amuigh de, ar mhéad agus bhí spéis ag daoine iontu.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé le linn ceist a fhreagairt ar na mallaibh, cuireadh mo chuid tograí as a riocht a dóigh a tharraing míchliú nach beag ar an tír seo thar lear.  Sé ba mhó ba chúis leis seo an mhian a bhí ar chomhaltaí áithride den Teach seo cluiche polaitíochta a imirt.  Thosaigh siad, á rá go raibh mé i gclaonpháirt le hÚdaráis na hEaglaise Caitlicí le greim a fháil ar na gairmscoileanna. Nuair a d'aithris Stiúrthóirí Crábhaidh na Meánscoileanna a gcás, cuireadh i mo leith go raibh mé i gclaonpháirt leis na heaspaig le greim a fháil ar scoileanna na n-ord rialta. I ndeireadh báire, dar leis na Teachtaí ceanann céanna seo, ba chomhcheilg den chliarlathas Chaitliceach an t-iomlán le scoileanna aon aicme creidimh a dhéanamh de na gairmscoileanna.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam cad is bealach nó barúil do na Teachtaí seo faoi láthair ó tharla a gcuid fáidheadóireachta chomh mór sin ar seachrán i leith na ráiteas a foilsíodh le déanaí thar cionn an chliarlathais Chaitlicí.  An drochfháidheadóireacht chéanna seo, thug sé ar Fhine Gael ráiteas a eisiúint, ar maíodh gradam polasaí dó, i dtaca le iarbhunoideachas i gcoitinne agus le scoileanna pobail go háithrid.</P>
    <P>Níl sa ráiteas seo ach moll mór focal atá ag teacht treasna ar a chéile.  Agus fonn orthu eadar ghirria agus ghadhar a shásamh, ní thugann an ráiteas uathu aghaidh ar na fadhbanna ar chor ar bith.  Cinnte, ní mheasann lucht a chumtha go gcuirfidh siad cluain ar aonduine.</P>
    <P>Sé fírinne an scéil gur thairg mise tograí arbh aidhm dóibh cothroime faill oideachais a sholáthar, go háithrid sna réagúin is tirce daonra.  Leis seo a dhéanamh, ba riachtanach aon scoil iarbhunoideachais a sholáthar sna réagúin seo a bheadh mór go leor le riar d'inmheacht agus do chumas gach dalta.  Is domhsa a b'éigean tús a chur leis an réiteach seo agus ba chóir go mba léir faoi seo nár chlaonbheart urchóideach é le greim a fháil ar na <Col N="2014" /> scoileanna.  Sé a bhí ann go huile agus go hiomlán go dtabharfaí le chéile iad siúd a bhí páirteach cheana san iarbhunoideachas sna réagúin atá i gceist agus go gcuirfí a n-acmhainn uile le chéile, ionas go bhféadfadh gach dalta &mdash;agus leagaim béim ar an fhocal &ldquo;gach&rdquo;&mdash;na buntáistí is mó is féidir a fháil ón iarbhunoideachas a chuirfí ar fáil dá réir dóibh.</P>
    <P>Anois nó a choíche, ba mhaith liom an bhréag sin a bhascadh gur mian leis an chliarlathas Chaitliceach seilbh a ghlacadh ar na gairmscoileanna. Bheadh siad lán tsásta na scoileanna seo a fheiceáil ag treabhadh a n-iomaire féin.  Is é mise a bheadh mí-shásta dá dtarlaíodh seo sna réagúin áithride seo, de bhrí go dtiocfadh de go mbeadh trian na ndaltaí ar scoileanna nach bhféadfadh, ar laghad an tinrimh, freastal ar an réimse leathan d'ábhair is gá le fónamh dóibh.  Na hoird rialta a d'aontaigh a bheith páirteach sna scoileanna pobail, is iad siúd an dream a dhéin an fhíor-íobairt.  Faoi láthair, tá lán-réimeas acu maidir le bainisteoireacht na scoileanna atá faoina gceannas.  Agus a bheith páirteach i riaradh na scoileanna pobail, rannfar údarás na bainisteoireachta go cothrom orthu féin, ar na tuismitheoirí agus ar an choiste gairmoideachais.  Is slat tomhais a n-aontú seo ar a ndúthracht agus a ndíbhirce in oideachas ár n-óige.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir mo chuid tograí a léiriú go mion agus go beacht go dtí go mbeidh crot críochnúil ar na gníomhais iontaobhais. Ní hionann Tamhlacht agus Baile Bhlainséir agus na réagúin eile mar a bhfuil sa chuid is mó de, trí scoileanna beaga ann cheana, agus tógáil i gceist i gcás cuid acu nó ina gcás go léir.  I gcás na réagún eile seo, is mar seo a fheictear domh an réiteach deireannach.  Beidh trí iontaobhaithe ann a bheas ina bpearsa dlíthiúil chun críche an gníomhas iontaobhais a tharraingt suas.  Is mise a cheapfas iad ar a n-ainmniú siúd a bhfuil scoileanna sa réagún acu faoi láthair.  Beidh bord bainisteoireachta ann ar a mbeidh, de ghnáthach, sé dhuine, beirt le hainmniú ag na hoird rialta dar tagradh, beirt le hainmniú ag an choiste gairmoideachais agus beirt a thoghfar ó thús ag tuismitheoirí na bpáistí siúd atá cheana ar <Col N="2015" /> iarbhunscoil sa réagún.  Bean amháin, ar a laghad, a bheith ina hionadaí do na tuismitheoirí.  Roghnófar na múinteoirí ag bord roghnathóireachta ar a mbeidh beirt ionadaí dena hoird rialta, an príomh-oifigeach feidhmiúcháin den choiste gairmoideachais, ionadaí ón Roinn agus cathaoirleach aontaithe.  De thairbhe creidimh de, beidh cead isteach sna scoileanna ag scoláirí ó gach aicme creidimh.</P>
    <P>Is deacair domh a shamhailt go bhféadfadh duine ar bith ar spéis leis leas oideachais ár n-óige, go bhféadfadh sé cur in éadáin na dtograí seo mar atá rianaithe agam.</P>
    <P>Is le goirid a tháinig coincheap na sraith-aonad sóisearach agus sinsireach go hÉirinn; ach más linn leor-chúrsaí réasúnta a chur ar fáil ag leibhéal na sraithe sinsirí caithfear glacadh leis gur sna haonaid mhóra amháin is féidir sin a dhéanamh, de bharr na n-iliomad ábhar atá ann anois ag an leibhéal sin agus de bharr beaichte agus doimhne na gcúrsaí féin.  Fágann sé seo, agus níl seachnadh le déanamh air, nach mbeidh cóir léinn i gcuid de na scoileanna ach fhad leis an mheán teistiméireacht. Ní go héascaí a ghlacfar leis seo sna scoileanna úd a raibh cúrsa teoranta ard teistiméireachta iontu de ghnáthach.</P>
    <P>Mar sin féin, is fadhb é seo a gcaithfear aghaidh a thabhairt air.  Ní lú is tábhachtaí ná é go gcaithfear deireadh a chur le fás chúrsaí easnamhacha ardteistiméireachta in ionaid nár chleacht a leithéid ariamh.  Mar ar leag mé béim air cheana, ní haon mhaith a bheith ag caint ar inmheachtaí dhaltaí nó treoir-sheirbhísí a sholáthar dóibh mura mbíonn rogha leathan ábhar éagsúil ar fáil acu.</P>
    <P>Tagraim anois do roinnt rudaí sna Vótaí ar leith ar dóigh liom go mb'fhiú trácht orthu.</P>
    <P>Sé £22,179,000 agus £12,195,000 fá seach atá á lorg don dá Vóta 29 agus 30.  Sin £34,374,000 ar fad, suim is ionann agus méadú de £3,572,00 ar sholáthar na bliana anuraidh.  Is le haighaidh íocaíocht an 12ú ardú i dtuarastail mhúinteoirí is mó atá an t-airgead breise de dhíth.  Tá suim bhreise de <Col N="2016" /> £310,000 ag teastáil le haghaidh na bhfordeontas do na meánscoileanna i leith táillí.  An borradh faoi líon na ndaltaí ar rollaí is cúis leis seo.</P>
    <P>Sé £490,000 is costas reatha do na sé coláistí réigiúnda teicniúla atá anois i mbun oibre.</P>
    <P>D'fhás uimhir na múinteoirí meánscoileanna ó 6,800 i 1969-70 go 7,500 i 1970-71.  I 1970-71 bhí 3,741 múinteoirí sna gairmscoileanna.</P>
    <P>Tá luaite agam cheana go bhfuil £490,000 á chaitheamh ar na coláistí réigiúnda teicniúla i mbliana.  Tá bunú na gcoláistí seo, dar liom, ar cheann de na forbairtí is tábhachtaí dá dtáinig i gcúrsaí oideachais le deireannaí.  Tá ganntanas orainn le fada i gcúrsaí teicneoireachta agus ard-teicneoireachta sna réimsí cosúil le bainistíocht i gcúrsaí gnótha i gcoitinne, innealthóireacht, eolaíocht agus bia-teicneolaíocht: tá na coláistí seo ag líonadh na bearnan san dúinn.</P>
    <P>Agus ballraíocht sa Chómhargadh ag tarraingt orainn go tiugh beidh dualgas níos mó ná ariamh ar na coláistí an pearsanra oilte a sholáthar dúinn a bheas riachtanach lenár dtabhairt slán sa tsaol fíor-chomórtasach sin a bhéas sa mhullach orainn.</P>
    <P>Sé £10,199,000 an méid iomlán atá á lorg faoin cheann-teidil Iolscoileanna agus Coláistí agus Institiúid Ard Léinn Átha Cliath&mdash;méadú de £1,984,000 ar an soláthar a tugadh sa bhliain 1970-71, eadar an Príomh-Mheastachán agus an Meastachán Breise le chéile.</P>
    <P>Is le haghaidh deontas do na hinstitiúidí iolscolaíochta, eadar dheontais reatha agus deontais chaipitil, atá an chuid is mó ar fad den Vóta seo.  Tá na deontais seo mínithe go mion faoi fho-mhírchinn A go F2; agus tá geall le £9 milliún i gceist iontu, suim is mó de 20 faoin gcéad ar sholáthar na bliana anuraidh.  Lena chois sin, tá fomhírcheann úr cruthaithe&mdash;fó-mhírcheann M&mdash;a bhfuil £330,000 ann fá choinne treallamh caipitil d'institiúidí den tríú leibhéal.  Is leis na hiolscoileanna a dhéanfar tromlach mór na n-íocaíochtaí as an Fhó-Mhírcheann seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoi <Col N="2017" /> na scéimeanna tógála iolscoile a mbaineann na deontais chaipitil sa Vóta seo leo.  I gColáiste na hIolscoille, Baile Átha Cliath, tá an foirgneamh nua ealaíne tógtha; tá an foirgneamh nua riaracháin á thógáil faoi láthair le hionchas a bheith críochnaithe in earrach na bliana seo; pleanáileadh an leabharlann nua sa dóigh go dtógfaí de réir a chéile í ina haonaid infheadhma: beidh an chéad aonad infheadhma de réir i mí na Márta seo chugainn.  I gColáiste na hIolscoile, Corcaigh, tá an bloc nua eolaíochta críochnaithe.  Tá lucht pleanála ceaptha agus plean chóir a bheith réidh acu faoina rianófar riachtanais tógála an choláiste amach anseo maraon leis an mhodh is fóirstíní lena sásamh taobh istigh de scéim forbartha.  I gColáiste na hIolscoile, Gaillimh, tá obair thógála ar siúl ar na foirgintí leabharlainne, eolaíochta agus bialainne, a bhfuiltear ag dréim lena gcríochnú fá fhómhar na bliana 1972.  I gColáiste na Trionóide, fosta, tá foirgneamh úr le haghaidh seirbhísí bialainne á tógáil.  Tugadh £30,000 de dheontas tógála do Choláiste Phádraig Manuat i leith na cóiríochta breise is gá de thairbhe tuataí a ghlacadh mar mhicléinn céime agus dioplóma sa choláiste.</P>
    <P>I dtaca leis na deontais reatha do na hiolscoileanna, measaim go gcaithfidh mé an rud a dúirt mé anuraidh le linn Meastacháin na Roinne a thabhairt isteach a rá arís, sé sin: cé go bhfuil cuid mhaith de chostais mhéadaithe na hiolscolaíochta á réiteach le deontais mhéadaithe ón Stát, nach bhfuil sé míréasúnta a iarraidh ar na mic léinn cuid den mhéadú a sheasamh ós iad is túisce a fhaigheann tairbhe ón iolscolaíocht. Tá le cur san áireamh fosta cor airgeadais na tíre agus go háithrid na hil-éilimh throma ar an Státchiste i leith chostas forbairte an oideachais, atá ag síor-dhul i bhfairsinge agus i ndaoirse.  Is maith is eol domh nach dtarraingeoidh a bhfuil ráite agam gnaoi na ndaoine orm go háithrid sna laethe seo agus an smaoineamh á chothú go bhfuil oideachas saor in aiscidh go dtí an leibhéal is áirde ina cheart do-shéanta ag gach duine óg. Sé fírinne an scéil ar ndóigh go gcaithfear díol as ár seirbhísí oideachais uile agus nach sochar d'aonduine a rá gur <Col N="2018" /> dualgas fir eile an t-ualach a iompar.</P>
    <P>Mar atá luaite agam cheana sa Teach, tá corradh le £400 sa bhliain d'airgead lucht íoctha cánach á chaitheamh mar chabhair i leith oideachas gach micléinn iolscoile.  Dá mhéad ár mbáiúlacht don iarratas nach gceadófaí ardú sna táillí iolscoile, is den riachtanas é amhairc san aghaidh ar staid eacnamúil na tíre.  Tá teora leis an méid airgid atá ar fáil don oideachas nó do sheirbhís ar bith eile atá ag brath go hiomlán nó i bpáirt ar airgead rialtais. Agus cúrsaí mar atá siad, tá gach gné agus gníomhaíocht den tsaol ag gabháil chun daoirse agus tuarastail i gcoitinne ag dul i méid.  Níl cosúlacht ar bith ann dá réir sin go bhféadfaí na táillí iolscoile amháin a thógáil as measc na codach eile agus breis cánacha a ghearradh lena gcoinneáil chomh híseal agus a bhí siad.</P>
    <P>Tá fógraithe agam tamall ó shoin, mar sin féin, go bfuil mé sásta airgead a sholáthar i leith lucht seilbhe deontas ard oideachais d'fhonn an méadú a tháinig i bhfeidhm ar chuid de na táillí iolscoile i mbliana a chúiteamh leo i luach na ndeontas.  Dúirt mé fosta ar an ócáid sin, ar mhaithe le gan thar £10 sa bhreis a chur ar mhic léinn sna dáimheanna is airde táillí de bharr mhéadú táillí na bliana anuraidh, go mbéinn sásta deontais bhreise airgid a thabhairt do na Coláistí Iolscoile i modh cúitimh dóibh in aon chaill a tharla as siocair gan méid iomlán an mhéadaithe a ghearradh ar mhic léinn na ndáimheanna sin.  Dá thoradh seo, is dóiche go mbeidh sé riachtanach Meastachán Breise a thabhairt i láthair an Tí roimh dheireadh na bliana airgeadais seo.  Ní féidir liom níos mó ná seo a dhéanamh maidir leis na méaduithe sna táillí.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's <Col N="2021" /> speech contains a good deal of interesting material and there are matters on which we can congratulate him and welcome new developments of a constructive kind.  The speech, however, suffers from the defects his speeches always seem to suffer from of lacking a coherent philosophy and theme.  This may not be entirely the Minister's fault in that he is responsible for a number of Votes and his speech is structured to deal with these Votes and as, strictly speaking, this House is debating the voting of money under these headings it is proper that his speech in part, at least, should take this form.  I wonder would it not be possible, nevertheless, for the Minister, in making the opening speech in a debate of this kind, having dealt with the specific matters that he is called upon and properly called upon to deal with with regard to the voting of money, to stand back from that and use this occasion to tell us something of the overall philosophy, the overall approach to education that lies behind the detail contained in the speech.  This is not the first time I have made this point and I shall have to keep on making it until something is done about it.  This could happen by one of two possible events&mdash;the Minister accepting what I say and restructuring his speech accordingly or the Government changing to enable somebody on this side to approach the problem in that way.  It is a pity, whether it is because the Minister feels constricted by the form of the Vote or for whatever other reason, that this debate is not set off on the right note by telling us something about how the Government see the whole education problem and what is the philosophy of their approach to it and how does this philosophy inform the different administrative decisions taken during the course of the year.  I shall try to live up in some measure to the strictures I am levelling at the Minister's speech by trying to approach the problem in this way but it is not a thing that can be satisfactorily done from the Opposition side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our difficulty is that we have to piece together the Government's thinking from various utterances at different times, each of which tends to deal <Col N="2022" /> rather partially with some aspect of the problem and nowhere can we find an overall view.  We have to undertake a fair amount of detective work to try to establish what is the Government's thinking and sometimes to work back from their actions to what impliably must be the philosophy behind action of that particular kind.  That does put us at a disadvantage and it inevitably, no matter how we try to put the debate on to a different level, makes it difficult for me to do this successfully. Of course, what the whole educational sector is calling for is a White Paper on education followed by legislation to put our whole educational system on a proper footing.  I shall return to this theme later.  I shall not dwell on it now beyond saying that the absence of an adequate legislative structure at present is creating very grave problems, indeed, because, throughout the whole educational sector those concerned, be they school managers, teachers or parents, do not know what their rights are and have very few rights because the system is run largely on the basis that the Department provides the money and the Department calls the tune.</P>
    <P>It is right in some respects that this should be so but the right of the Department to call the tune arbitrarily and at times, as it would appear to those engaged in the educational sector, capriciously is one which should be exercised within the framework of some legislative system within which those concerned have certain basic rights which cannot be overturned by arbitrary action.  This arbitrariness of the system, the capriciousness of the system, and the fact that nobody knows when some bolt from the blue will descend upon them and require them to change everything overnight, or sometimes retrospectively, is something inherently undesirable.  While one can understand from the viewpoint of the Departmental civil servant the attractions of the system which gives him complete freedom to change his mind whenever he likes and impose his decisions on those concerned, they lacking any legal protection from this, from the point of view of the country, of the political system, of the Government <Col N="2023" /> and of the Government Minister, it is not really a satisfactory way to do business.  In a dictatorship things work like that.  The dictator does what he feels like doing and there is nothing to stop him.  This is the system of government. Sometimes it gets things done more quickly.  However, this capriciousness and the fact that it leaves people insecure and uncertain of their rights leads eventually to revolt of the masses and there is something like a revolt of the educational masses in progress at the moment against the way in which the educational system in practice is run by the Department of Education under the authority of the Minister but one sometimes feels not always under his control.</P>
    <P>I should like now to approach this whole issue from the same viewpoint as I did two years ago by concentrating on two main themes of educational policy and considering how what has happened in the past two years relates to these particular issues.  The Minister may recall that at that time I suggested that we should consider educational policy under such headings as participation of those involved in the system, the effective use of resources with which the Department is properly concerned, the whole issue of equality of opportunity, the way in which the educational system may be used to achieve a more just society, the question of educational standards which can get overlooked under all the other pressures and the question of variety and choice in education, an issue which is a contentious one and about which there are divergent views.</P>
    <P>Starting then for no very good reason, with the question of participation of people in the running of the system, there has been very little progress in this during the past two years. The extent to which people feel more and more alienated from the system by its capriciousness and by the fact that they are not capable of exercising any rights within the system has increased the pressure for participation and the people's sense of frustration because they are not being given any role.  The only concrete progress in this period has been the concession to parents in <Col N="2024" /> relation to boards of community schools.  This has been a grudging concession which has been dragged gradually from the system.</P>
    <P>Originally, the proposal was a simple one.  It was to have four representatives from all the religious orders involved and two from the vocational school authorities.  This was the proposal regardless of whether there were in fact two religious orders in the area or whether in fact any religious orders were involved.  In one case the existing secondary school is not, in fact, a religious school.  That proposal to have the four-and-two system was modified on the basis that the religious orders would appoint two people as parents' representatives everywhere, and not just in Tallaght and Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>Under pressure the Minister has recently announced that in areas other than Blanchardstown and Tallaght the parents will be allowed to elect these two representatives.  It has taken nine months pressure to get that concession. We are still in the position in regard to Tallaght and Blanchardstown that the parents are to have no representation, or something which might be referred to as inverse representation. There are parents of the children of an existing school and by virtue of some queer logic in the Minister's mind the school authorities who do not operate schools in the area will appoint parents' representatives, but neither the school authorities nor the parents concerned of the existing school will have any representation. The logic of that defeats me.  I have scanned the utterances of the Minister and of the Parliamentary Secretary for any attempt to justify this curious approach, and beyond the negative statement that democracy is impossible in Tallaght and Blanchardstown no explanation is given.  No explanation was given as to why, if democracy is impossible in these areas, it is necessary to ensure parent representation for the parents who do not have children at school in the area but not for the parents who do have children there.  I would be glad to hear the Minister on this point.</P>
    <P>The record of the church authorities in this matter has been somewhat better <Col N="2025" /> several years ago than that of the Minister.  The church authorities of the Roman Catholic Church brought out an excellent document on the question of parent-school associations.  The document set out the need for such bodies and the need for parents' involvement, in terms which were extremely progressive.  The document gave encouragement to everybody concerned about parents' rights.  It is true that somebody lower down the line sabotaged the document and what was issued later to those concerned was a document quoting the Hierarchy's statement and saying that what was meant by the Hierarchy was that they did not want parent-school associations, but only wanted the parents to drop along and have a chat with the teachers ocasionally.  I am paraphrasing what was in the document but I do not think I am oversimplifying unfairly what was in it.  How or why that happened is one of the mysteries of the internal arrangements of the Catholic Church in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the Hierarchy in their original statement, before it was modified, set out clearly the reasons why there should be involvement of parents in parent-teacher associations, which would be a step in the right direction.  This initiative is an encouraging one.  The tradition of church and State in Ireland is not a very honourable one in this respect.  They both pretend to propound at appropriate occasions the view that the parent is the primary and natural educator of the child, and then they proceed to legislate in such a way that the parent seems to have no rights whatever in connection with the education of their children.  There has been a change of heart, the Hierarchy have given an excellent lead and the Minister&mdash;although it has taken a lot of pressure to bring the concession to fruition&mdash;is prepared in the community schools to allow parents, if the schools are not in this Dublin area in which democracy is so difficult, to choose representatives to the community school boards.  This is a step forward.</P>
    <P>What is striking about the community school arrangement, from the <Col N="2026" /> point of view of participation, is the absolute exclusion of the teachers from any representation on the management board.  I have not yet heard from the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary any reason for this, other than the reason that on the existing school authorities they are not represented. Even that is not by any means a fair statement of the position because in many schools run by religious orders, the orders manage the schools and are also the teachers and there is, by virtue of the religious order being the body running the school, teacher representation and, in fact, they run the school in that sense.  I am not saying that the manager, or the headmaster, or the reverend mother, or the rector of a particular institution is always responsive to the views of the teachers, but there is teacher involvement in that sense.  In these community schools the teachers are being excluded from any role in the running of the school.  Teachers are being given positions on what is called the advisory board.  This needs clarification.</P>
    <P>I was present in Tallaght when the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking. He explained that the teachers would, through the advisory body, be concerned with and be the people undertaking the day-to-day running of the school.  That seems to be a useful development.  If that is the case why are the boards called advisory boards? The one thing an advisory board does not do is run anything.  It merely advises others on running something. If it is, in fact, a committee of the management board concerned with the running of the school, let us give it another name.  There has been confusion of thought in this matter.  If the advisory board is simply a way of enabling teachers to pass advice to a body on which they have no representation that would be very unsatisfactory. If, in fact, an advisory board is going to run the school, subject to overall policy determined by the management board, that is a little better. If so, advisory board is the wrong name.  Could we have some enlightenment on the terms of reference of the advisory board, their functions and powers?  If the advisory board is undertaking the day-to-day running of the <Col N="2027" /> school, it seems that the board and the teachers represented on it should have representation on the management board.</P>
    <P>It is a basic principle of the management of anything that it will only be successful under modern conditions if people have a voice in management. The concepts of partnership in industry, industrial democracy and participation are all concepts which should now have universal acceptance, because it is recognised that when there is a group of people working together and when they are educated to the point of feeling that they have a contribution to make&mdash;and that in our country today means the entire population, after several centuries of education&mdash; they are not going to work satisfactorily if they do not have some participation in the decisions which affect the organisation of their lives.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that teachers, who are educated people, concerned with the education of the children in their schools, must have a voice in management.  It seems that the teachers and the parents together should, in some combination, have this responsibility.  To exclude teachers altogether from management is to show an attitude of mind which goes so far back into the last century that it does not seem to be appropriate to any Minister of a modern Irish State.  I hope that this will be rethought. I hope that teachers will have direct representation on the management boards just as in any higher level institution, where the teachers elect their representatives to management boards.  I see no reason why this should be confined to third-level institutions.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it must be said that the long period during which teachers have not had any responsibility, have been deprived of responsibility and when it was made quite clear to them that they were not expected to take any responsibility and when they were denied the opportunity of promotion in so many schools&mdash;this long period has had its effect on the attitude of mind of teachers.</P>
    <P>There is a dispute apparently pending now between the secondary teachers and the school managers of secondary <Col N="2028" /> schools and although I have no direct knowledge of it beyond what I have read in the papers, if what I have read &mdash;and having read both sides of it I think I have a reasonable approximation of what the issues are&mdash;is correct, then the issues involved in the dispute are, first the question of the guarantee that the teachers concerned will in fact be appointed to vice-principalship. They are not seeking any assurance in regard to the principalship, though I hope that in many cases that will also be open to them and, the second issue, which as I understand it, is rather disturbing&mdash;I hope I am doing no injustice and that I have got the right end of the stick&mdash;is that, while they insist on a guarantee of being appointed as vice-principals, they demand that there shall be no requirement that vice-principals should do any work outside the school hours or in holidays.</P>
    <P>I have to say that that seems, on the face of it, an unreasonable condition. That teachers should seek responsibility, seek the opportunity to play their part in the running of the system is right, but that they should simultaneously say that if they get that they will do nothing except teach and will do none of the administrative work involved, which obviously can only be done outside the teaching hours, seems to me to be unacceptable.  Of course, there would be problems.  The teacher who is going to have a role as a principal or vice-principal of a school will not be able to play a full teaching role and do all his administrative work outside those hours.  Nobody suggests that, but nobody who knows anything about any school will imagine that a school can be run on the basis that whoever is in charge of it or second-in-command of it, arrives at the hour it opens, locks the door when it closes and is not available to meet parents, to meet the management committee or discuss matters with the Department at any time outside those hours.  If that is the claim and if I have understood it correctly&mdash;I hope I am doing no injustice to anybody&mdash;that claim, if pressed, to my mind undermines the claim to vice-principalship.  I can understand why this has happened.  The long period during which secondary <Col N="2029" /> teachers in particular have been excluded from any role in the system in so many of these schools, lay secondary teachers in particular, has undoubtedly created an attitude of mind just as in any group of people excluded from responsibility and the concept of responsibility becomes difficult for them fully to accept.</P>
    <P>I hope this dispute will be settled and that any opposition to giving the lay teachers their opportunity of promotion will be eroded and that if there are groups still resisting this when most of the groups concerned accept the principle, I think those groups will have to change their minds.  I hope that will be done and I hope to see secondary teachers given the opportunities which they deserve and which they have been denied for so long because of the peculiar structure of our system and that they will take responsibility and will be as willing to devote every hour of day and night that is necessary to the job of administering the school just as the religious principals of the schools give up their time for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Education is a vocation; so is the running of a school.  Anybody who has not a vocation for the running of a school and for working long and difficult hours and having long and difficult negotiations with the Department of Education and long and difficult talks with parents, should not try to take on the job.  They cannot have their cake and eat it on this issue.  If the disagreement between the teachers and the managers of the schools is as stated I hope that a compromise will be found by which teachers will be given their full promotional opportunities and will take their full responsibility. I shall be glad to hear from the Minister later what his views are on this and whether the problem is as stated and what action he thinks can usefully be taken to try to avoid a dispute on this issue and ensure that agreement is reached.</P>
    <P>In referring to teachers there is one matter in the Minister's speech which I wish particularly to welcome.  There is a number of useful innovations in his speech which we are very glad to see but this is a proposal for teachers' centres in different parts of the country. <Col N="2030" /> I hope this will be spelled out in detail.  It seems to be a very constructive idea.  As stated here, it would appear that the teachers themselves will have the opportunity of running these centres&mdash;&ldquo;envisaging centres&rdquo; as the Minister said, &ldquo;being run by the teachers themselves with Departmental support and embracing all teachers, both primary and post-primary as befits an integrated profession in pursuit of a common purpose.&rdquo;  This is an imaginative and well worthwhile proposal.  I am glad the Department have taken this initiative and I hope it will be possible quickly to establish these centres in every part of the country and that by giving the opportunity for teachers to come together, primary, secondary and vocational, in an environment where they will be discussing their common vocation, this will have significant effects not merely educationally in the schools in question but on the whole spirit of this profession.</P>
    <P>I also hope that out of this may emerge, since it has not emerged from any other source, an institute of education which educational interests themselves will sponsor, providing a forum for the discussion of educational problems at national level with the possibility of promoting and encouraging research.  We have had nothing like that so far.  For years past I have been trying to encourage such a development and, while I find everybody interested in it, I find nobody willing or able, perhaps, to take the first step. One of the sad aspects of the division of the teaching profession is that not only are there suspicions on certain issues but in each part of the profession there is a feeling that &ldquo;If we start something the others may not take to it.&rdquo;  There is a consciousness of this division and it is difficult to get any thing started.  I hope we shall see a national institute of education established by the various teaching institutes. It should not need the Department to start with; it is wrong that the Department should have to do all these things but I am very glad they have taken this particular initiative about teachers' centres and I look forward to hearing more about them.  I hope they will get off the ground <Col N="2031" /> quickly.  Perhaps the Minister could give us a little more detail as to how many there would be and how quickly they could be got going.  Obviously, if they are very few and teachers have to travel a long way to them their effectiveness will be reduced.  On the other hand, if there is a very large number problems of cost and organisation might slow down the process of getting them started.  There is probably an optimum between the two and I should be interested to get some idea from the Minister as to the scale of this proposal.</P>
    <P>Speaking of participation, we have mentioned teachers and parents but there is also the question of students. I think there is a mental blockage in the minds of people.  We have become so accustomed to thinking of students as children to be told what to do and not to speak unless spoken to.  The Victorian attitude to children, although it has changed in the personal relations of parents and indeed very often of teachers to students, has not changed nationally.  At virtually every level, even at a very young age, it is possible for some at least, and as years go on, for a very high proportion of pupils to make some contribution to the development of education.  They are the consumers; it is they who see it from the point of view of being taught; it is they who see the defects in the system. Their ability to identify these defects is less the younger the age and it grows with age.  Certainly, in the teenage groups whose maturity has increased so much in recent years&mdash;we can all look back to our own days as teenagers and be astonished at the much greater maturity there is today and the much earlier maturity and their sense of responsibility and involvement which I do not think any of us shared in our time. Perhaps there are Members of this House who have a few years advantage on me and who belong to a different generation who may have shared this but I certainly do not recollect in my time anything like the sense of responsibility, involvement and commitment which so many young people have today.  Indeed, I think it <Col N="2032" /> would have been very difficult 30 years ago to have got much good out of students if one sought their co-operation, advice and interest in improving the educational system.  Possibly they would have regarded one with some hilarity for making such a suggestion. But there has been a very great change and the concern with and interest in and consciousness of the problems of education on the part of students is a new development, a new development of which we are not taking advantage.</P>
    <P>We are not willing to adjust our minds to the fact that the only people who really can know fully what is wrong with the educational system are the actual consumers.  Their ability to identify the problems will, of course, because of their immaturity, always be limited and so will their ability to find the answers to the problems but, increasingly, they are becoming capable of identifying the problems; and I find that it is only in talking to school students that I can understand the things that are wrong with the system. One does not get this from the adults, from the parents and the teachers, to the same degree.  The consciousness on their part of the difficulties of the system and its extreme bureaucratic character inhibits the adults and there are certain aspects that one can get only from the students themselves and we should, I think, make some organised attempt to mobilise this source of wisdom on the subject of education and bring the anxieties of these young people to bear on the problems.</P>
    <P>My party have fairly recently started in my constituency a school students' branch with the particular hope of securing an input into the policy system from the actual students in the schools in the constituency.  The students have a very good current experience of education as it is today and already we have got some reports back on some aspects of the problems in education. I hope that in the months ahead other school student branches will be formed.  A separate group has grown out of this composed of young people who do not want to be involved in political commitments and party political activity but who want to think about these problems&mdash;they have separated <Col N="2033" /> off&mdash;but we hope from these two sources to get an input of ideas which will help us in the formulation of policy.</P>
    <P>I found the first reaction to our party's educational policy interesting and I say this recognising that it may be misunderstood or, perhaps, misconstrued by people who take my words out of context.  The first reaction was that the students found a great deal of educational policy irrelevant.  That is not because it is irrelevant.  It is because of all the problems with which we are trying to cope, problems which it is vitally important to solve, but, from the point of view of the students, matters of curriculum are more important and, very properly, I think, we excluded these from our policy because these are technical, educational, academic matters on which a political party should not lay down the law. There is, therefore, a gap here.</P>
    <P>There are some aspects concerned with practical administrative problems and development in which the students' representative council should have an opportunity to play a part; they should be directly involved in the running of the school.  These are naturally interests which relate to the question of management to some degree.  There are some aspects like that where interest turns on the whole structure of the educational system in which the students are not really interested.  They are interested rather with the curriculum examination side and this suggests to me that, while our initiative is a useful one, and I hope to get useful inputs into this particular area, I hope that the main input that one can get from the school students will be much more academic.  If we can get to the stage&mdash;not with this Government, I am afraid, but when the Government changes&mdash;at which the curriculum and administrative system is taken out of political hands and organised, as it is in Northern Ireland, on a professional basis, then it will be possible to mobilise the input from the school students on the academic side.  That will not be done effectively through a political school students' branch but through some other kind of organisation, perhaps an organisation of school students <Col N="2034" /> into a nationwide association of some kind.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that the band of interest in these problems is necessarily narrow and it does not become significant really until about the age 14. Sometimes there is only a two year band in interest because of the rapid turnover of the people concerned in the kind of organisation of school students.  There tends to be, as we found in Dublin when these were formed three or four years ago, not a very high survival rate.  However, the group which started are still very interested.  Next year they may not be interested.  It is very difficult to keep it going.  There are problems of organisation and it will not be easy to so organise the thing as to get the input for the policy system from this vital source.  But this must be done and I should like to hear the Minister's comments on this.  I have not got the impression that he is entirely with me in this.  I may be wrong but, in his reaction so far, I have not detected any instant sympathy with the idea of trying to find from the consumers in the educational system what are its difficulties and weaknesses and how they can be remedied.  There is an assumption by too many people that those who run a system know the system best and have nothing to learn. One does not have to do anything more than stop any group of workers in the street and ask them for their views on the running of industry and one immediately gets very acute criticism indeed of management and management's defects.  Of course the workers have their own defects naturally and if one consults with management, management will tell one what is wrong with them.  People seeing a system from inside and from underneath see defects which people on the top think they know about but, of which, in actual fact, they are completely ignorant.  What is true of industry is equally true in education.  We will have to discipline ourselves into taking full advantage of this.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister now whether he has any information on the development of student representative councils.  This is by no <Col N="2035" /> means the most important aspect of student participation but three or four years ago there was quite a development, certainly in the Dublin area, along these lines.  My daughter, who was slightly involved at that time, had a record of 22 schools and I am sure her records were incomplete.  I would be interested to know has this situation changed.  Has the Minister any policy on the development of some representative body within the schools? There is difficulty in their working successfully because they tend to work one year and not to work the next year, but there are schools in which they are highly developed, schools which actually believe they could not run the schools without the co-operation of the students.  The students take on a great many responsibilities which would otherwise devolve on the teachers.  There is one school in which this has worked very successfully and it would be well worth the Minister's while getting a report and, following on that, giving every encouragement to this development.</P>
    <P>At university level student representation is, of course, more readily accepted.  That is not to say we have it in a satisfactory form, but it is accepted.  The Minister has recognised that by appointing a student to the governing body.  This is a step forward but it is, of course, unsatisfactory in terms of the size of the representation. In my own college another student is elected by the students themselves and co-opted then by the governing body using the power of co-option.  The size of the representation is quite inadequate and the way in which the representation is achieved is not entirely satisfactory.  The Minister has quite properly appointed the current president of the students' representative council to get over the problem of direct representation and to avoid any personal involvement in choosing a student who might be undesirable from his point of view.  It is, I suppose, better than nothing, but there should be a proper system.  We will have to reorganise the charters of the universities and make provision for direct student representation and for students choosing their own representatives on <Col N="2036" /> these bodies.  I will come back to the question of charters and university reform later on.  I merely refer to them in passing here.</P>
    <P>There is a basic problem, however, about student representation or student organisation.  There is a choice to be made by students between having a trade union, if you like, for students nationally, a union of students which would concern itself with their interests, and having a body which would reflect not only their interests but the political attitudes of the more active students.  The Union of Students in Ireland is a body I have the greatest respect for, and I have said this before in this House.  I found them enormously helpful, very well informed and briefed, and the information and briefs and proposals which I have had from them have been better organised, better presented, better researched than those I have had from many other educational bodies, if not most other educational bodies.  Having said that, I think there is a problem posed.</P>
    <P>When the Union of Students in Ireland decides, if it does decide, to become a politically-orientated body&mdash; it is not that I disagree with their politics; they are perfectly entitled to their politics&mdash;there is a danger that this will diminish in some way their ability to perform their trade union role.  There are really two separate roles to be performed.  One is the role of representing students' interests generally and the other is the role of actively representing the views of the more radical students politically and trying to achieve their political objectives. I do not know the answer to this. Combining the two creates some problems, and the Minister has had his own personal experience of this recently.  Separating the two may create problems too.</P>
    <P>I certainly think it is quite unsatisfactory&mdash;and I think this needs to be said in this House, and I think it is felt by many students and by many members of the Union of Students in Ireland&mdash;if this body is going to represent all the students of Ireland, going to be a negotiating body with the Department as it claims to be and <Col N="2037" /> has been very effective in being and as such invites a Minister of the Government of this country to a function, that it should then, or large elements of it, use this political occasion to barrack the Minister and treat him with discourtesy.  You cannot have it both ways.  If you are going to run a political organisation, you either do not invite a political opponent along or, if you do, you treat him with courtesy.  If you are going to be a representative body, negotiating with the Department and representing the interests of all students and are going then to invite the Minister to your function, you do not have him treated in the way in which he was treated on that occasion.  I feel strongly about that.</P>
    <P>I attended the previous day and the Minister will be interested to hear that he is not the only recipient of some of the remarks.  I did not mind that at all but it is quite different when you invite a Minister along.  I sat in on the discussions during the day and various remarks were passed&mdash;the &ldquo;Fascist pig&rdquo; type of thing but that did not bother me&mdash;but it is quite a different matter if you are going to ask a Minister of the Government along to a function and he is insulted in the way in which the Minister was insulted on this occasion.  I know&mdash;and I say this to the Minister because I hope he understands this&mdash;that it was not the wish of most of the students concerned, that there was very grave dissatisfaction with the way he was treated and that many students, though many of them may disagree with his views politically, felt that it was quite wrong that he should have been treated in that way.  I think the object of action on the part of a minority, a confused minority, confused as to what the function of their organisation is, needs to be sorted out. I hope my own relationship with the USI is good enough, as I believe it is, for me to be able to make those remarks in friendship to them and indeed with respect to the job they are doing, they will need to consider precisely where they stand on these issues.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of participation of people not just in the <Col N="2038" /> school at local level but at national level, and here there is no problem from the teacher point of view.  The teachers have organisations and they are represented at national level and are in a position in which they can communicate their views to the Minister. Of course, the divisiveness of the system, the fact that it is so divided, creates problems, but teachers are represented. The people who are not represented are the parents, and here I am disappointed with the Minister's attitude because we have in this country both a parent-school movement, specifically orientated towards education and participation of parents in the affairs of individual schools where the children attend and a National Council of Parent Organisations concerned with wider interests than purely the parent-school relationships in a particular school, and the Minister seems to be tending to keep these organisations at arm's length.  I think this is wrong.</P>
    <P>Of course at this stage, they are not nationally representative, in the sense that every parent in the country is involved or has a local association he can vote for.  Nothing of this kind can start fully-fledged, representing everybody, but these are genuine open bodies whose ability to perform a useful function would be enhanced if the Minister gave them the minimal recognition they deserve.  I hope he will encourage rather than discourage them in future, because it is vitally important that the voice of parents should be fully heard, not just at local level but at national level, and as long as the Minister keeps them at arm's length, on the ground that they are unrepresentative, which can be said of anybody starting off in the early years of existence, he is not going really to come to grips with educational problems which at the school level are a matter for parents.</P>
    <P>The fact that parents in Ireland have not had any voice in policy&mdash;have not been heard, never mind listened to&mdash; is a serious defect in our system and I hope the Minister will open his mind more sympathetically to these bodies and give them the kind of encouragement which would enable them to <Col N="2039" /> become more representative.  You are not easily going to get representative bodies if the public are told by the Minister, &ldquo;I will have nothing to do with them as they are unrepresentative&rdquo;. Who is going to join such a body?  The enthusiasts will, but people generally will feel that this is not going to get anywhere.  If the Minister said, on the other hand, &ldquo;I am quite prepared to talk to you about problems. While you appreciate, of course, that I recognise the fact that there are many parents who are not represented in your organisation, I recognise that you are the voice of the active vocal parents at this stage and I hope you will be able to extend your range of representation. In the meantime, I will be happy to talk and discuss matters with you.  The more representative you become, the more I will listen to your voice&rdquo;.  That is the kind of positive and constructive encouragement that should be given to bodies of this kind rather than telling them that they should remain at arm's length.  The problem here is very much one on the parents' side rather than on the teachers' side and indeed even the students, through the Union of Students in Ireland&mdash;at least the third level students&mdash;are represented although we still have a problem with the second level students and with the parents, primary and post-primary.</P>
    <P>I have not much hope, however, of the Minister changing his overall attitude to the whole devolution of authority in education.  The Minister knows &mdash;I shall not dwell on it at length; there is no point in repeating it&mdash;the policy of my party on this.  We believe that the curriculum examination system should be a matter for a schools committee, similar in kind, though not necessarily identical in form, to that which operated successfully in Northern Ireland for about eight years, from 1961 to 1969, and then was given statutory form in the Bill introduced in Stormont in December, 1969.</P>
    <P>I know&mdash;at least I think I do&mdash;why the Minister and his Department and the Government are reluctant to concede this: because of a desire to hang on to control over the provision making Irish an essential requirement <Col N="2040" /> for school examination purposes.  This seems to be the reason why the Minister is unwilling to allow any devolution of authority here.  This is a political policy, which is not a national policy.  Of course, there is a national policy to preserve and revive the Irish language, but there is not a national policy to do it by these particular means.  They are in dispute and we are in disagreement on it, and it must not be referred to as a national policy.  It is absolutely wrong to pursue the particular political policy of one party as regards the means of achieving the revival, means that we feel are counterproductive. To refuse to allow the devolution of authority for the whole educational sphere to those who should be handling it and to insist on hanging on to control of the written examination system and have it organised and determined by the Minister and his supervisors is wrong.  We will challenge this.  We will fight it and we will change it in Government.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the effective use of resources.  Here perhaps I am nearer to the Minister. Although I disagree with the way in which his Department have administered schemes to achieve the effective use of resources I have the greatest sympathy with the aim they are trying to pursue.  I understand the difficulties involved.  While serious blunders have been made in some cases I do not suggest that the problems are easy to resolve.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation proposals that we have had are at three levels.  There have been the proposals to eliminate the very small primary schools, the proposals for the merger of post-primary schools and the university merger proposals.  These proposals are designed to secure more effective use of scarce resources and if there is one scarce resource in this country, the resource is teachers and, in particular, teachers with special skills, particularly those teaching the honours senior cycle level where there is a serious problem and about which the Minister is rightly concerned.  The trouble is that an effort is being made almost overnight to undo the damage that has resulted from years of neglect.  The <Col N="2041" /> attempt to undo in a few short years the problems created by historical circumstances, because of the neglect of the whole educational sphere by both the British and the Irish administrations has led the Government and the Department into a situation of inflexibility. We have sympathy with the Government in this regard and I am sure the Labour Party share this sympathy also.  There is difficulty when the problems are tackled suddenly, without warning and without explanation and in an inflexible way.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that unnecessary resistance is created in these cases.  It is not always easy to know the right course of action.  If this party had been in power we, too, would have made mistakes but I think we would have been much more sensitive to the people's responses.  There is the problem, on the one hand, of making the progress that is urgently needed for the sake of the children while, on the other hand, trying to ensure that the people go along with the efforts being made.  The problem of reconciling the two is immensely complex.  It would not be possible for any Government to have the perfect solution.  Any Government would be bound to fail in some instances but the failure rate of this Government is a little higher than it need be.  Some unnecessary mistakes have been made and some unnecessary inflexibility has been shown.</P>
    <P>The Minister should say more about one particular failure of the rationalisation system.  This is a failure that may well not be his fault but which he has not explained adequately.  I would put it to the Minister that, in his own political interest, he should explain it.  A large part of the rationale of the closure of the small schools was not only that it was considered that by having larger rural schools a higher level of education would be achieved but that by this move teachers would be released in very large numbers who could then be used to reduce the size of the classes in schools in urban areas.  Therefore, the scheme for the closure of the small schools was designed to tackle simultaneously two problems by one political decision.</P>
    <P>This two-pronged scheme which was <Col N="2042" /> so attractive from the point of view of achieving something has made it worthwhile tackling a very tricky political problem, a political problem that could bring nothing but unpopularity to the Government tackling it and to the Opposition who supported the Government in tackling it.  We went into this with our eyes open and in the knowledge that it would not do any of us any good in rural Ireland to support such a scheme.  We have achieved a measure of rationalisation in rural Ireland.  Perhaps mistakes have been made in some cases regarding the choice of schools closed but these are matters for argument.  What is very disappointing is that we have not achieved any significant alleviation of the position in the urban schools.  In response to questions in this House the Minister has given us some figures and the latest of those shows that 77 per cent of the pupils in primary schools in Dublin are in classes of more than 40.  My recollection is that comparing these figures with earlier ones, if anything, the trend has been towards an increase in the number of classes with 40 and more children.  I admit that there has been a reduction in the number of classes of more than 50 and 60 children but this has been done by creating more classes of more than 40 pupils.</P>
    <P>There has been no real progress in reducing the normal class to a reasonable level.  There is a clue to the reason for this in the Minister's speech but from his own point of view, that clue should be developed.  Why is it that the teachers who have been released from the rural schools are not in the urban schools?  I suspect that the reason is immobility of labour, the unwillingness of people to move.  That is a very natural unwillingness.  This was the reason indicated by the Minister in his speech when he talked about the £200 grant for this purpose being raised to £400.  This is a sensible approach to the problem but he should tell us in a little more detail what has happened. How many teachers have been rendered supernumerary in rural schools by the primary school rationalisation programme? How many have moved to centres where they have contributed to a reduction in the number of students <Col N="2043" /> in the classes in primary schools?  How many have to move yet?  How rapidly will the problem resolve itself by a process of retirement and the concentration of all new teachers in the urban centres?  Is the Minister diverting the bulk of the new teachers into the urban centres because in so far as there are teachers throughout rural Ireland who are supernumerary in the schools they are in, and in so far as vacancies are occuring in other schools nearby as a result of the death or retirement of teachers, it seems to me to be possible, to a large degree, to resolve the current rural requirements for new teachers from this pool of supernumerary teachers.  This pool should be spread fairly evenly throughout the country because the rationalisation programme has been fairly uniform.  The majority of the newly trained teachers should be put into the urban schools but it does not appear as if this is happening.  I would like some quantified assessment of what has gone on in this respect during the past five years.  I would like some indication of the scale of movement and of the number of teachers who are now supernumerary and how long it will take to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>We are badly off in this House for any kind of concrete information.  We are told simply that there are problems but we are not told the extent of these problems.  We are not given any basis of measuring the problems or of assessing how best they might be solved.  The statistical basis for education in Ireland is desperately weak and, disappointingly, all the work done by the Investment in Education Report does not seem to have been continued.  Certainly, there is no continuing statistical series published to keep up to date the figures in investment in education. Indeed, we are often forced to seek these figures by means of question and answer in the House.  Therefore, people who need data on education, instead of looking at a statistical handbook, must ferret through the debates of the House.  That may be a side issue but I mention it now in connection with this particular problem of school rationalisation. It is up to the Minister to provide us with the information we require so that we can help him to resolve this <Col N="2044" /> problem.  Sometimes the Minister must consider the criticisms he receives to be unfair.  Sometimes they are unfair but to some extent the Minister and his Department bring this on themselves by their undue secrecy and by their neglect to publish the kind of data that would enable us to see what progress they are making and to see for ourselves whether there may be good reasons for their not making progress. We do not want to be unfair in our criticisms but it is difficult when we have not got the data upon which to make fair criticism.</P>
    <P>At the post-primary level, about which there is considerable controversy, the problem is particularly difficult.  I hope nothing has been said on this side of the House that has ever suggested that it is an easy problem or that we have an easy solution.  I notice that the Minister in his speech made a few political references to the Fine Gael policy statement on this matter, suggesting that Fine Gael were inconsistent.  Fine Gael recognise in a manner, and the Minister should have been more generous on this point, the reality and difficulty of the problem involved.  We recognise it cannot be resolved overnight and that it will require much more imagination and flexibility than has been shown hitherto but I am afraid that &ldquo;imagination&rdquo; and &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; are words that the Minister equates with &ldquo;inconsistent&rdquo;.  This is not a political attitude of mind but is a bureaucratic attitude of mind.  If the Minister has a fault perhaps it is his undue sensitivity to bureaucratic considerations; he is too inclined to take the view of his Department rather than put his own stamp on decisions.  The Minister is a politician, as we all are.  It is the job of politicians to reconcile people and to resolve problems; it is not to set up rigid bureaucratic systems to satisfy the administrative criteria.  It is the politician's job to prevent the excessively rigid approach of the administrator&mdash;which may be right in its own context&mdash;but it is up to politicians to prevent it damaging human relationships.  It is their job to do everything possible to solve such problems.  The Minister has not been sufficiently political in that sense in <Col N="2045" /> his approach to some of these problems.</P>
    <P>We understand the reasons the post-primary rationalisation scheme has been undertaken.  We understand the need to tackle the problem of parity of esteem between vocational and secondary schools.  Because of the great prestige of the religious orders, in this country the problem of the parity of esteem between the two streams of education is rendered much more acute than in other countries, although the problem exists in other countries also.  Many Irish parents wish their children to be educated in the environment provided by religious schools.  There may be some parents who are influenced by some considerations of snobbery but, by and large, parents have good reasons and it aggravates the problem of parity of esteem.  It has created the situation where we have a kind of class system in education between the secondary and vocational schools.</P>
    <P>The Department are right to be concerned about this.  Their insight into this problem and their attempts to solve it should command general support.  It is wrong to criticise them because they have tried to solve it, but it is right to criticise them because the methods they have used to solve the problem have proved counterproductive in some instances.  However, the fact that they have attempted to do something about it after a long period when the Minister and his Department did nothing in the matter is something for which they should be commended.  Fine Gael do not fault them for this; on the contrary, we congratulae them for trying to do something, but the attempt to solve the problem has met with difficulties for reasons which could, and should, have been foreseen by the Minister in charge.  It is his responsibility if he launches a scheme which does not take sufficient account of the human and institutional problems involved and which must be resolved.</P>
    <P>Parity of esteem is part of the reason for the rationalisation programme.  The other part of the problem is the need to provide an adequate range of subjects in schools.  This is more important <Col N="2046" /> than has been realised but, at the same time, it is important that we know what we are talking about on this matter.  It is no good generalising about this; we must be clear about the range of subjects that is necessary and why it is necessary.</P>
    <P>A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Father Nolan, CSSp&mdash;with which I disagree almost totally&mdash;provides a useful basis for discussion on this subject. It was only on reading the article several times that I have seen the kind of fallacies that confuse people on this matter.  The article highlights some of the problems involved and enables us to sort out the good and bad reasons. The writer is right in some of his criticisms but I do not think that basically his logical approach is sound and on the key issues he does not tackle the right target.</P>
    <P>He makes a number of points which are true but his conclusions do not seem to me to follow.  He states that if a pupil is bad at one language he will probably be bad at others.  There is a lot of truth in that and I can accept it for a moment.  He said that the development of the individual mind requires some concentrated study rather than a wide range of subject matter dealt with superficially.  I share that view because I think it is necessary for people to study some subjects in some depth, although I am opposed to specialisation.</P>
    <P>Father Nolan states that if the primary school has not done its job some training in basic skills may be needed in the early stages of post-primary education.  This is true, although it should not happen.  Pupils coming to the post-primary school should have had the necessary training in basic skills and the post-primary school should not have to do this.  Of course it does not always have to do it; it is only in the very early years that we may have to supplement any weakness in the primary school and I think it is the exception rather than the norm.  Nevertheless, the situation can arise and Father Nolan has a case here.</P>
    <P>He also said that too many subjects may leave no time for other cultural activities, for civics, religious instruction <Col N="2047" /> and so on.  It is true that there can be too many subjects to be studied leaving no time for other extracurricular activities.  Children can be put under too much strain and the development of their minds can be inhibited by too wide a range of subjects to be studied.  All this is true but his conclusion does not follow.  Father Nolan states that many students choose unwisely; again, that is a valid point but his conclusions do not follow.</P>
    <P>Finally, Father Nolan has stated that a language additional to Irish and English is not necessary or even desirable for all students.  That is quite true because there are some students for whom it is not possible, never mind necessary or desirable; some students cannot learn two languages never mind three or more.  All of this misses the point.</P>
    <P>The fact that something is not necessary or desirable for all students &mdash;in this instance a language additional to Irish and English&mdash;is not a reason for preventing everyone from benefiting. Even if some students are unlikely to benefit from a modern, continental language, others will benefit. The students who will benefit should not be precluded because others will not benefit; it is totally wrong to say that they should not get the opportunity to learn the language.  We are talking in this case about the range of subjects open to students.  We are not talking about requiring every student to study the subject; the Minister is not attempting to impose this requirement with regard to a modern continental language.</P>
    <P>My view of this matter is that, having regard to our membership of the EEC, there will be a much wider range of occupations for which a modern continental language or languages will be necessary or desirable in the future. Any person in the administrative, clerical, or business world is liable to find himself in need of a modern continental language.  It may happen that he will not be required to use this language but anyone engaged in these jobs would be wise to know a continental language.  There are multifarious <Col N="2048" /> aspects of the EEC where direct involvement with a business or group may require the use of a continental language.  The person who undertakes a manual job in an Irish factory will not be at a disadvantage in not knowing French but people in the administrative, Civil Service or business spheres may, at some stage, find themselves at a disadvantage if they do not know a continental language.  This is a new dimension added to our system and account must be taken of it.</P>
    <P>The suggestion by Father Nolan that the fact that somebody is bad at one language means he will be bad at others is also irrelevant to the desirability of having a choice available to those who have the ability.  The mere fact that students who are bad at French will not be good at German is not a reason for not having French and German available for the students who are good at French and, therefore, capable of doing German. There is a logical fallacy here which seems to run right through the article.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the post-primary school is not concerned solely with the development of the individual without regard to content.  The implication of the article is that education is concerned with personal development.  I entirely agree that the main defect in our system, which the Minister is, I think, through the new primary curriculum going a great way to remedy, has been inadequate attention to this question of the development of the individual personality. This is perfectly true, but in a post-primary system right up into senior cycle, which is preparatory to third level education for many people, you cannot dismiss the subject matter completely.  There comes a stage in education when knowledge of a subject becomes an important element.  It is not an important factor at primary level; it is not a predominant factor, perhaps, at junior cycle but at senior cycle it is very important.  It cannot be dismissed as if, in the leaving certificate course, one is concerned solely with the personal development of the individual and he might as well be studying Hebrew or Aramaic as any <Col N="2049" /> other subject.  At senior cycle level the particular subject is very important because it is going to be for many people the last chance to acquire a particular skill which they may need later, for example, mathematics, or a foreign language, and for others it will be a necessary preparation for a more specialised course at third level.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the fact that primary education may need to be supplemented by post-primary because of deficiencies at the primary level, is not relevant either.  It could only be relevant for the first or second year of post-primary education where a student comes forward who has had an inadequate formation in the primary school and you might try to improve his ability to read.  These are exceptional cases which might best be dealt with by exceptional treatment.  However, as a reason for not having a range of subjects, for example, at senior cycle, it seems to me to be totally irrelevant.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, choice of subject does not necessarily imply, as again is implied in the article, taking too many subjects. There is a confusion of thought between having a choice of subjects and being required to do a large number of subjects.  They are two totally different things and one does not necessarily follow from the other. Certainly, if we do not have a range of subjects available we cannot do a range, but having a range does not force anybody, of itself, to take more than a certain number of subjects.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, the fact that many choose unwisely is not a reason for depriving everyone of choice.  This would certainly be an unfortunate principle to apply.  Of course, some students choose unwisely and that is a good reason for postponing choice as late as possible.  All my inclinations are to postpone choice in the educational system.  I do not like the idea of careers being decided at 11-plus or at 12.  One of the merits of our system is that, compared with some other systems, it does postpone choice later. I know this brings its own problem in train, but whatever educational system you choose has its own problems.</P>
    <P>The fact that you postpone choice <Col N="2050" /> is a good thing.  It does not mean that at some stage a choice has not to be made, and to say that because someone may choose wrongly there should be no choice whatever, that a person should be confined to a rigid, narrow curriculum, with no choice in case he might make a mistake is nonsense.  It is better that someone should make a mistake but that most should be able to choose what suits them rather than that nobody should be allowed to choose.  Again, there is a fallacy in basic logic here.</P>
    <P>From all this I conclude that a range of subjects is necessary in a post-primary school, most especially at senior cycle level where many are preparing for further study and many are now having their last opportunity at acquiring a command of subjects.  The unpalatable fact we have to face in this House is that at senior cycle numbers are small and that, at advanced level&mdash;and this is a point I want to come back to later&mdash;they are smaller still.  By &ldquo;advanced level&rdquo; I mean those who have completed senior cycle but may not be ready yet either in maturity of mind or years to go on to third-level education.</P>
    <P>This problem can be very acute.  I came across it in a very acute form the other day.  I was in Waterford speaking at a parent-teacher meeting at which a number of senior girls were present.  After the meeting I had an opportunity to talk to some of the senior girls.  One of them said to me that she and a colleague wanted to take honours mathematics but the school was not in a position to provide it.  This is understandable, because there are not that many people in the country in the post-primary system teaching honours maths and having the necessary qualifications to do so. The two girls had discovered that in a neighbouring school about 300 yards away, there were six boys in an honours maths class and they proposed that they should be allowed to join the class at sixth-year level.  This did not materialise and I will not even say what reason those two girls gave, because they may be wrong about the reason and I do not want to pin responsibility on anybody, but they have <Col N="2051" /> had their career possibilities stunted by some bureaucratic decision by somebody somewhere who should have been concerned with nothing but the education of children.  I was angry at hearing this.  This is happening because there are people in the educational system who are not primarily concerned with the children; there are some other things they put first, although I cannot imagine what could be put before this.</P>
    <P>Waterford is a large city and there are, of course, other schools in it, but if in two large schools in the city of Waterford with 30,000 people there are only eight pupils to do honours mathematics, how can one envisage throughout the country, in every town and village secondary schools providing a senior cycle up to honours maths level?  We are miles away from this.  In fact, we are so far away from it that I am not sure that even the Minister's proposals, radical and acceptable to many people though they may be, are adequate to deal with the problem.  When you come to a problem like honours mathematics where the number of teachers are so few, it is improbable that even the measure of rationalisation the Minister proposes will meet the issue.  In a case like this where the skill is so rare and so badly needed, even if we have to make special provision at senior cycle level, with children going as weekly boarders to a school some distance away where there is an honours maths teacher, we should be prepared to do so.  No bureaucratic considerations should stand in the way here.  I should like to hear from the Minister that his concern in this matter goes not only to the point of taking unpopular decisions in some cases in regard to rationalisation of the schools system but to willingness, where that proves inadequate, to take special steps to ensure that nobody is deprived of the opportunity of developing a skill which not only they have a right to develop as individuals but which this country badly needs.</P>
    <P>That Waterford case indicates how acute is the difficulty we have here and shows clearly how much we must <Col N="2052" /> have lost in the past.  How many young pupils have there been throughout the country who were never able to develop particular talents they had because the school they were in was not able to offer honours maths or a foreign language?  The Minister's concern to resolve this problem is something which we accept.  We may think he has not always handled it well, that in putting the case across his Department has not always shown the necessary ability and that we have more problems on our hands than we need have if the matter were handled more tactfully.  We are in sympathy with the basic thinking behind it and I hope the fact that we do understand the problem, and are trying to help, will assist in some way in resolving it.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether we are not forced to consider, in a country with such a low density of population, where you have this problem at the senior cycle honours level, something a bit more drastic than what the Minister is thinking?  Are we not also in a situation where the level of our school leaving qualification is such that a very significant minority of pupils are capable of attaining that level at a physical age, and, perhaps, at an emotional age in the broad sense of emotional maturity, before they are either eligible by the age requirements of third level institutions or, perhaps, emotionally ready for third level institutions?</P>
    <P>There is a bit of a gap here.  The Minister had a proposal some years ago for an advanced leaving certificate which might provide the answer.  Here I am coming back to a point I dealt with before and with which I am in total disagreement.  He has imposed an entry age of 12 years for post-primary schools.  This carries with it extraordinary consequences for individuals. The whole approach is wrong.  He has tried to resolve the problem of the fact that our school leaving qualification is set at a level which most people can attain and the honours level is set at a level which, although most people cannot attain it, quite a big minority can attain a good deal younger than the entry age for third level institutions.</P>
    <P>He has tried to get over that problem <Col N="2053" /> by saying: &ldquo;Let nobody go to post-primary school until they are 12 years.&rdquo;  Stop them going.  Hold them up.  Stunt their growth at that stage so that we do not have the problem of what to do with them if they finish too early.  I am totally opposed to that approach.  The effect of this on the individual children concerned can be disastrous.  I have come across this repeatedly. They are ready to go to post-primary school.  They are the bright children in the primary schools.  They are told by the schools: &ldquo;The Minister will not let us take you.  If we take you, you will have to pay the full fee because we will not get a grant for you. The Minister will not allow it.&rdquo; The child is held back.</P>
    <P>This is quite wrong because, if you hold children back at that point, they cannot benefit.  There is nothing you can do with children aged ten or 11 years who are bright and ready for secondary school.  If they go to the secondary school and work their way through and finish a year early, then you have a chance to do something for them.  That is the time when you can really help them.  That is the time when children having achieved the leaving certificate with the necessary honours for the university, but being too young to go, could attend a course which would give them a real preparation for the university and give them a head-start there.  They could go away for a year and get experience abroad.  They could work for a year.  They could go to a technical college for a year and improve their skills in, for example, the scientific subjects as some children do who come to Dublin from the country for this purpose.  There are all kinds of useful things that could be done at that stage.</P>
    <P>There is nothing much you can do for a child of 11 years who is held back in the top class in a primary school who is more than ready to leave.  I appeal to the Minister who is concerned about education to rethink this attitude.  I have discussed it with him before.  I have discussed it with the INTO.  No good reason has been given for it.  I asked the INTO representatives several years ago to explain to me why they were in favour <Col N="2054" /> of it.  I had to say to them at the end &mdash;again it probably was not a popular thing to say&mdash;that I did not think any argument they put forward was educationally sound and, in the absence of any educational argument, I could only conclude that their reasons were not educational.  We left it at that.</P>
    <P>I came across it again in Waterford with young people there.  The Minister compounds it because some children starting at age 12 years&mdash;or may be they got in before the Minister's rule came into operation; I do not know&mdash; will get their leaving certificate with quite a large number of honours.  They will be ready to go on and, at that stage, the Minister will not let them into the training colleges, I understand. I have not checked this with the training colleges but one of the girls told me that she will get her honours leaving certificate and she cannot go to a training college because she is too young.  I can accept that, the university having its rules on that point. Perhaps there is a reason for it.  I am not in favour of it but I will not argue that point at the moment.</P>
    <P>She has to wait for a year and then what happens?  She is told she cannot go in because she has not got a current honours leaving certificate.  That is what the girl told me and she has gone into the matter.  If that is right it is absolutely intolerable.  Apparently she has got to do an honours leaving certificate at the end of the course, then she has got to sit around for a year and do another honours leaving certificate&mdash;at that stage she has wasted a year&mdash;in order to get into a training college.  If that rule exists the Minister should get rid of it.  It should not exist.</P>
    <P>Let the training colleges have their entry age and the universities their entry age.  I am not keen on this.  I do not think physical age is relevant but it is not as damaging at that stage as it is at the post-primary stage.  There should be no rule that requires a girl, instead of doing something useful to develop herself for the year, to hang around repeating her leaving certificate. I hope the Minister will have a look at that and do something about it.</P>
    <P>The advanced leaving certificate idea <Col N="2055" /> had something in it.  I am sorry that it seems to have gone into some kind of a limbo.  We have heard nothing about it since.  I should like the Minister to discuss it a bit further.  In any event, whether or not you have such a certificate, there are a significant number of children who are capable of&mdash;and who if they got in before the Minister's rule are doing so&mdash;completing their education before they are of an age to go on elsewhere, perhaps before they are old enough to get the benefit of going on elsewhere.</P>
    <P>These pupils need some kind of facilities. Some of them will take jobs. Some of them will go abroad for a year.  We need to give more consideration to them.  They may be a minority but, if we could give them a useful boost at that point, and give them some kind of special treatment that would prepare them more fully for the university, their ability to benefit from university education would be enhanced and they would start with such an advantage going into the university, or technical college, or whereever they go on to&mdash;and pupils with this degree of brilliance normally will go on to third-level education and in many cases to university&mdash;that they would be able to get more out of the university.  They would not be so pushed to keep up all the time with the work because they would start with an advantage.  They would relax more and benefit more from the intellectual atmosphere of the university.</P>
    <P>We need some kind of course at that level and this has not existed to any great extent here.  I had the benefit of such a course about 30 years ago now.  I understand that until two years ago there was no provision for girls in Dublin for this purpose.  Indeed, I tried to make a co-educational arrangement with one of the schools. They were quite interested but they were not able to make the accommodation arrangements at the time.  It was for a boys' school to take in girls. One convent in Sion Hill provided such a course and an excellent course it was.  My own daughter benefited from it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should see what can <Col N="2056" /> be done in these cases because undoubtedly a significant number are still coming to the university too young to benefit from it.  If there were some intermediate stage for them that would be beneficial.  There is a gap in the system.  I do not think a terminal examination for school leaving can be adequately used as a university entrance examination without creating some of these problems.  If it is a terminal examination for school leaving the standard has to be such that the great majority can get it and that a fair proportion of people with ability can get it at the age of 18 years.  There is bound to be a number who will get it earlier.  A problem is being created there.  Something should be done to fill the gap that is involved.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the question of the range of the subjects because I have digressed a bit from that, what range of subjects should there be?  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this.  I simply do not accept his view that you need four or five subjects for four or five groups and that is that, that range is sufficient and you do not need any choice between individual groups.  It seems to me that you must have Irish, English and maths to an honours level so that those who have the ability can go to that level, history, French and German, a classical subject such as Latin, music and art, hand to eye subjects, the scentific subjects such as physics, chemistry and botany and an economic subject as well.  That kind of range is necessary for the senior cycle.</P>
    <P>I am not dogmatic about that.  It may be that the Minister has a different view.  He may feel that the range should be wider or narrow.  I should like to hear his views on the minimum range of subjects.  How would he define the minimum range of subjects necessary at senior cycle to honours level to give children the kind of opportunity they should have at that point?  I should like to see this spelled out.  The schools are entitled to have it spelled out and to be told what is being aimed at.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I do not know what conclusion one has to draw from <Col N="2057" /> that with regard to the size of schools. I am unconvinced, frankly, by the kind of figures the Department of Education have been putting out.  I am sure it is true that to achieve an absolutely minimum cost and full utilisation of all teachers at the honours level you would need quite a large school.  I know something about cost curves in other walks of life, including our transport system, with which I was involved for 12 years, and I think you would find, although you might need a school of 800 or more to achieve an absolutely national economy, the diseconomy of moving down to, say, a school of 400, in terms of the extra costs involved for pupils who are not getting the fullest utilisation through having classes a bit below the 22, or whatever it may be, that you want at senior cycle level would be quite small.  I suspect that when you get down below that they begin to get greater and when you get down to the level of 100/150 they become quite considerable.  I do not think it is sufficient for the Minister to assert that you have to have schools of this size to provide this range of subjects economically.  The adverb &ldquo;economically&rdquo; begs the question: &ldquo;How economically? How uneconomically?&rdquo;  This is a country of low density population. We have to face this.  There are all kinds of diseconomies involved in it. The cost of providing electricity to everybody in this country is much higher than elsewhere because of the low density.  We do not say to people: &ldquo;You cannot have it.  Come into the towns and we will give it to you.&rdquo; We face the fact that you have to provide electricity to people at a higher cost and this is true of a whole range of services.  I do not think we can simply say in the case of education that we will only provide education at the absolutely minimum cost and if that involves having schools of 800 or 1,000 and if that involves pupils having to travel 30 miles every day that is too bad for them.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise that our low density of population makes impossible the achievement, without a greater <Col N="2058" /> social and cultural cost, of the range of choice we have to give at absolute minimum cost.  We should forget about absolute minimum cost and try to establish, looking at the cost curve, what kind of extra costs can we afford in order to give this range of subjects in schools which will not be excessively large and will not be excessively remote from the pupils attending them. I do not believe this exercise has been published.  Perhaps the development branch of the Department have done it, but like so much of their work and contrary to the whole intention of establishing that branch it seems to be secret.</P>
    <P>Could we have some publications from that branch?  There should be broadsheets issued every few weeks setting out the calculations and seminars should be held with educational interests to discuss them and to get other views.  That is how policy should be formulated.  To formulate a policy about the size of schools behind closed doors with figures that are never published, using vague adverbs like &ldquo;economically&rdquo; without defining what it means, is totally unsatisfactory.  It is unsatisfactory not alone because you do not get the right answer behind closed doors, without discussing things with people but because the problem is to convince all the educational interests that the policy as implemented is a wise one.  If you are going to convince them of that you must put your cards on the table.  They are not going to take from any Minister or any civil servant a bald statement: &ldquo;It just has to be a school of 800.  Forget about it.  We have told you.  That is it.&rdquo;  They want to be told why.  They want the chance to examine the figures.  If you go over the figures with them and if you can show them that a school of 250. 300 or 400 is necessary and what the cost margins are you bring them with you eventually. If you are never prepared to put your arguments, if you are never prepared to quantity them, if you are never prepared to discuss them you will not bring people with you.</P>
    <P>A large part of the tension that has built up in our educational system has been this total failure of the Minister's <Col N="2059" /> Department to handle it in the ordinary, open, straightforward way, formulating policy openly in discussion with those concerned and then putting it across to them by arguing the case factually so that people are faced with the realities and have no choice but to accept whatever logical consequences flow from it.  At the moment, anybody who does not like what the Minister is doing can simply say gladly: &ldquo;He has never given us any argument in favour of this, I do not believe him.&rdquo;  They get away with saying: &ldquo;I do not believe him&rdquo; because nobody can say whether he is right or wrong and others cannot say whether they are right or wrong.</P>
    <P>This is the basic defect in the running of our educational system.  It is not the philosophy of the Department as such.  The basic thinking is sound enough.  We will argue about the emphasis but it is the way that it is being handled that has done the damage and has prevented us achieving the objectives which we all share.  Some of these remote rural secondary schools for some reason or other seem to be extraordinarily good in what they achieve because of the dedication and skills of the particular teachers.  They seem to be able to achieve extraordinary final results which compare very favourably with large urban schools in many cases.  These are facts. We cannot just let our preconceptions wipe away these facts.  Where there are such schools, and where it would be possible to provide in such a school a range of subjects of the kind which the Minister and myself would feel was roughly appropriate at a cost somewhat higher in terms of financial cost and teaching manpower, and if you rationalise the whole lot, I think there is a price there to be paid.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what the price is before I decide but I am not convinced by being told &ldquo;we cannot afford it&rdquo;.  What is the cost?  How many of these schools are there?  We are told, and again there has been no announcement&mdash;this only leaks out in some way&mdash;that there are 13 schools that have been told they must close their doors.  I have heard various reports <Col N="2060" /> of this being to close the doors this year or in 1975.  I am not quite sure which is correct, because we are told nothing.  It just leaks back to us as politicians from the particular areas in which the schools get these letters.  I would like to know what are the costs involved?  How many additional teachers would be needed to keep these schools open, compared with the number you would save if you closed them?  What is the cost and how great is the problem?  I would much prefer to see, in cases like this, the school continuing with special provision made for individual pupils who have a particular aptitude at the senior cycle level than to have the school closed.  We are almost at the point where schools are being closed because there are one or two pupils who want honours maths and who, at the senior cycle level, could be sent, with a boarding grant of a few hundred pounds, somewhere else and the school could be left open.  Is that the problem?</P>
    <P>We have not identified them because we have not quantified them.  When I say &ldquo;quantify&rdquo; it is not because I have a particular aptitude for quantifying but because you can only reach a decision on a matter of this kind by measuring the scale of the problem and taking a decision based on that measurement.  If we are told it is not economic to keep them open that means that somebody has measured the cost.  I want to know what the cost is.  I am not opposed to the basic policy.  I am with the basic policy but in a country with a low density of population we must be prepared to pay some cost, even if it is fairly significant.  We do it in other spheres and we should be willing to do it here.</P>
    <P>We want a White Paper on this alone.  We want some kind of document published setting out and quantifying the problems, showing by a few case study examples the scale of the problem involved and identifying what the cost is and how many additional teachers will be needed.  It would be better, if there are particular children who need particular training in a particular subject, if they were dealt <Col N="2061" /> with individually by generous grants rather than that a school should be closed basically because they cannot be catered for in that school.  The way we have implemented this policy may well be wrong.  I feel in the case of schools like those in Durrow, Cloughane, Ballycastle, a number of these schools with very high standards indeed, their closure would be a tragedy unless it is absolutely necessary.  The Minister has convinced no one that it is absolutely necessary because he has not attempted to convince anybody.  I am convincable.  If the Minister produces a compelling case in regard to any of these schools that the cost would be so enormous, and that generalised through the whole country would involve such a provision of teachers at high levels of skill that are unobtainable, then I will accept the logic of that.  We have not had a case put forward in this way.  I am not prepared just to take it because some civil servant somewhere says it.  We have to be given the facts and figures to make up our own minds in this matter.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the basic issue of community schools.  The Minister did not say very much about this.  I would have thought he would have made a few announcements about certain changes which have already appeared in the papers.  Here, as in some other places, he skipped gently over the particular area.  He had a good deal to say about Opposition spokesmen.  One almost had the impression that the Minister and the Cardinal had the same speech writer at certain points because the same accusations were made but not documented.  I cannot speak for anybody in my party but myself but I do not recall having said at any stage&mdash;I have been right through every speech I have made on the subject, and I have kept copies of them all on this particular subject&mdash;that this proposal for community schools originated with the Hirearchy, the Catholic Church authorities, religious schools or anything like that.  On the contrary, I find throughout my speeches a clear statement&mdash;and I recall also in discussion after these speeches bringing this point out and hammering it home <Col N="2062" />&mdash;that the initiative for this came from the Government and, indeed, I have at each time said that it comes from the Government for good reason.  The basic reasoning behind what they are trying to do is something that I think we all agree with.  I have never suggested that the initiative in any way came from the side of the Church.  The Church authorities were faced with a Government initiative undertaken for good reasons and the Church authorities reacted as they are perfectly entitled to do by saying: &ldquo;If you are proposing this change, we would like the following arrangements made.&rdquo; That leaves it to the Minister to decide what he does.</P>
    <P>I may fault what the Minister did.  I do not fault the Minister's initiative in raising the matter.  I do not fault and could not fault the reaction of the Church authorities in stating their position. I may fault and I do not fault the conclusion the Minister drew having consulted the authorities of one Church only and I think that he made a mess of it.  I am entitled to that political view.</P>
    <P>I should like to be told, before we have any more of these accusations from the Minister, where and when and in what speech made where, I am supposed to have said, if it is me, and if it is not I would like to be exonerated on this, that this thing was initiated by the Church, because I said the opposite throughout and, in fact, I think I was the first person to bring out the fact that, contrary to the impression given by the leak of the original document in <i>The Irish Times</i> of October, 1970, in fact, this was not originally raised with the hierarchy at all or communicated to the hierarchy but, in fact, the original document arose in a communication between a particular bishop, who happens to be His Eminence Cardinal Conway, the bishop of the diocese in which Ardee is situated, writing for information about the philosophy behind the proposals for Ardee.  I was the first person to bring that out as I was concerned that there was a wrong impression being formed that the Hierarchy were initiating something of some kind and pressing the Minister on it.  The Minister <Col N="2063" /> will recall my raising this issue and pressing him to make it clear and he did subsequently at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis make it clear how that thing arose.  I am not prepared in those circumstances to have it suggested that I was putting forward the view that this was some kind of a plot by the Church authorities on vocational schools.  The Church authorities reacted to a ministerial proposal by making counter proposals.  The Minister, in my view, was wrong in accepting them as put forward.  The Church authorities had a perfect right to put them forward and it was not their initiative.</P>
    <P>Before we have any more speeches of this smear kind, I would like to have chapter and verse as to who said what. I may say I do not recall anybody else saying it either but my recollection may be at fault.  I can only be responsible for my own speeches, not for other people's.  It may be that somewhere, sometime, somebody on some other benches said something of the kind but I think the Minister has a duty to be specific in this.  He is claiming that the stories were put about from the Fine Gael benches.  I should like him to give chapter and verse for it.  It is important to get that out of the way first because of the confusion caused by the Minister's speech and may I say also by the fact that the Cardinal refers rather vaguely to politicians and publicists and not everybody will recall in detail the speeches I have made on the subject and will recall the trouble I have gone to to identify the source of the initiative. There is a danger when vague accusations are made that they will stick to the wrong person.</P>
    <P>The reason for this community school proposal is evident.  I think it arises largely out of the failure of attempts to get co-operation between schools and in the absence of co-operation the Minister rightly felt that some other more radical proposal should be put forward.  He may have had in mind&mdash;I would not blame him if he had&mdash;that if he put forward a more radical proposal he might get a sudden rash of co-operation as a result and achieve his original objective in <Col N="2064" /> that way.  That would be quite a good political tactic from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Let us just run over this and see how it has been developed.  I do not want to recapitulate on the way it has evolved.  The October statement sent to the Cardinal in relation to his request with regard to Ardee school was the beginning of it.  The next overt act that I am aware of was the Fine Gael statement of January, 1971 in which specifically we criticised the total absence of any reference to the religious issue in the Minister's document, pointing out that this issue had to be confronted, that there were obviously going to be difficulties either way, that religious schools would be reluctant to give up private religious schools to the public authority inter-denominational system and that the inter-denominational vocation schools would not easily accept that they were going to become religious schools, which would be unsatisfactory for some of the denominations attending them.  This we pinpointed at the very beginning as a basic gap in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>Now, a lot happened over that period of which we knew nothing but, subsequently, in reply to a Dáil question, we got some information on it. It is worth while to recapitulate the events of those months as subsequently disclosed to us.  The Minister entered into consultations.  It is interesting to see with whom, when, in what order and how frequently.  The original document was sent to Cardinal Conway on the 12th October, 1970.  On 10th December, 1970, the Minister met representatives of the Catholic Hierarchy and what he described as the council of managers.  I am not quite clear what body this is.  It is described in the relevant Dáil reply in small letters but presumably it is the council of all school managers or is it only a council of Roman Catholic school managers?  I am not clear about that. The Minister might clarify that.  Four days later, on 14th December, 1970, he met with the major religious superiors.  I take it that is a reference to the conference of major religious superiors.  I think the Minister, by the way, might have been more careful in <Col N="2065" /> his reply to the Dáil question in being specific as to the particular groups he met.  On 2nd January, 1971, he met with representatives of the Catholic hierarchy again; 14th January&mdash;meeting with the Vocational Education Association and a further meeting with them on 19th February; on 19th March &mdash;meeting between departmental officers and representatives of the Catholic hierarchy; 7th April, 1971&mdash;I quote here&mdash;please note the quotation marks &mdash;&ldquo;matter referred to&rdquo; at a meeting with representatives of the House of Bishops of the Church of Ireland.  I should like to know what was said in that reference.  I think the Minister could tell us just how fully he referred to it, how fully he disclosed his mind, what consultations took place there. The use of the phrase &ldquo;matter referred to&rdquo; implies to me a certain coyness, implies to me the reference may have been a rather elliptical one. Perhaps I am unfair to him and, perhaps, he is understating what happened at that meeting but Ministers rarely understate anything to their advantage. Anything that would be to their advantage would be fully stated, I think.</P>
    <P>On 23rd April, 1971&mdash;&ldquo;clarification meeting&rdquo;&mdash;not a consultation meeting but a &ldquo;clarification meeting&rdquo; with the Vocational Teachers' Association. They were not consulted; only clarified; 28th April, 1971, &ldquo;clarification meeting&rdquo; with the ASTI.  That is how teachers are treated.  You do not consult these people&mdash;they are not worth consulting&mdash;but you clarify things to them at a certain point; 3rd May, 1971 &mdash;meeting between departmental officers and the Vocational Education Association and, finally, 8th May, 1971, meeting with representatives of the Catholic hierarchy.</P>
    <P>That is the record of meetings.  It is no harm to put it firmly on the records of the House.  It may have been lost in the record at Question Time.  We can see how this thing evolved, what consultations took place, who the first consultations were with, who the last consultations were with.  We can see what group had the matter referred to when they met and can see what group had things clarified to them&mdash;a very interesting pattern, indeed, but it does not suggest that <Col N="2066" /> the Minister really was concerning himself with the educational aspects of the problem primarily.</P>
    <P>Those are the consultations.  Then the announcement came in May and following that I referred to it in my Ard-Fheis speech immediately afterwards and have spoken about it a number of times since then and in order to make our position perfectly clear we issued a policy statement in January, to which the Minister has made reference.</P>
    <P>What has been the reaction to these proposals?  We do not know the reactions at these secret meetings of which the country was told nothing.  We can only guess at what was said from what happened subsequently.  We know the public reactions of various people in May, the adverse reactions from chief executive officers of vocational education authorities.  We know what happened at the five centres where meetings were held.  In June we had adverse reaction from the Vocational Education Association which had been consulted on three occasions, actually, during that period in the spring.  Just going through my files, I find an adverse reaction from the Monaghan Vocational Education Committee, they being particularly concerned, of course, with the interests of the religious minority who make very full use of the schools in that area.</P>
    <P>We had the criticism from the Presbyterian General Assembly followed by the <i>Church of Ireland Gazette</i>, Dr. Kenneth Milne's remarks, Dr. Poyntz's speech, the criticism by the Church of Ireland Archbishop, Dr. Buchanan, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, who subsequently wrote a letter to the Minister, the National Youth Council of Ireland also strongly critical, the mixed group of clergy who sent a petition to the President, the National Council of Parents' Associations, which the Minister does not recognise but which nonetheless exists, and latterly the Diocesan Council of Youth of the Church of Ireland in the Dublin area.  I do not recall any of these statements having been anything other than critical in terms ranging from denunciation to sorrow rather than <Col N="2067" /> anger in some cases.  It is not a record of success and for the Minister to suggest that all this is just political opposition by people trying to make party political capital is unconvincing and worries us little accordingly.  The Minister knows perfectly well it is not party political capital.  He knows that in pressing an issue which concerns 5 per cent of the population, particularly in a country where it is easy to be misrepresented to the other 95 per cent, the political capital is more likely to be on the liability than on the debit side of the balance sheet.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that in raising the issue in the way we did we have been deeply personally concerned with the disastrous effect of this in relation to Northern Ireland and to the minority in this part of the country. The fact that they were not consulted and the Minister did not consider them worthy of consultation was itself a slap in the face which will not be forgotten for a very long time.  The Minister has explained why this happened. He has explained he thought from consultations he had with various Protestant groups that they were not interested in the vocational schools. He had no right to think that.  Every Catholic educational organisation which has talked to him for years past has pressed him, I am sure unremittingly, for assistance for Catholic religious schools.  Did he assume from that that the Catholic Church in Ireland had no interest in vocational schools as places to be attended by Roman Catholics and that therefore there was no need to consult them about vocational schools?  Oh no.  Why then did he assume because he met Protestant school authorities concerned quite properly with maintaining their own denominational schools that they had no interest in vocational schools when he would never assume the same thing in the case of the Catholic Hierarchy?  He should not have assumed that.  It was a mistake.  I know it was an error of omission rather than anything else.  I know the Minister is not a man of whom personally it could be said that he is in any way sectarian.  If anything said in <Col N="2068" /> the heat of any moment in this House suggested that.  I gladly withdraw it; but the effect objectively of what he did was sectarian.  Objectively he acted in a sectarian way, but his intent was not to be sectarian.  He had no thought of being sectarian.  I accept and appreciate that.  But when you consult one religion only, when you ignore the others and when you give as your reason that you assumed from talking to them they were interested only in the secondary side, having made no such assumption from entirely similar contacts with the Catholic ecclesiastical authorities, then you are being unconsciously sectarian and the objective results of what you do are sectarian in their effects because they induce in the minority of the community a feeling that they are not treated equally and on a par with the majority.</P>
    <P>It is no good the Minister saying this is party political talk.  Every Protestant body and spokesman who has spoken on this subject has been explicit on it.  Are they all active members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties prodded into action by Deputy Thornley and myself?  Is that what the Minister thinks of the Presbysterian General Assembly and the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin?  He does not think anything of the kind.  He knows perfectly well that in accusing us of promoting a party political campaign he is saying something that is not true, making a political point.  Perhaps it is fair party politics and perhaps we stung him into it because he was so upset to find the situation he got himself into and because that criticism of him was trenchant and to the point. Naturally he has reacted, and I do not hold it against him, but let nobody think this is a party political matter. It is a matter which concerns a religious minority in this country, all of whose representatives have spoken out, and this letter was written to the Minister in July last making the position of the Church of Ireland entirely clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister should never have got into this position.  He should have consulted at the beginning and he would have arrived as I believe he is now going to arrive at, some kind of solution <Col N="2069" /> without all this bruhaha and the damage done to relations between North and South.  Let the Minister not underestimate that damage.  I am not making a party political point but saying what is a cold fact.  In my contacts with Northern Ireland&mdash;Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, who has accompanied me on some of these occasions, knows what I say is true and can give witness to it himself&mdash;I can see that the one thing above all that has aroused Protestants in Northern Ireland genuinely, as distinct from the propaganda Unionist line from the Unionist Party, about us down here, apart from the question about whether we do or do not deal with the IRA, has been the community schools.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien will recall a meeting we attended not long ago with representatives of all the churches in Northern Ireland, Catholics included, and the representatives of trade unions and other neutral bodies seeking common ground and trying, with us, to find how we could defuse the situation and find a peaceful solution.  He will recall that at that meeting one of the spokesmen for the Protestant churches was listing a number of issues which they find difficult and which if we could do something about them down here it could open the way to a more constructive relationship not excluding eventual reunification.  He had 11 points on his list.  When he came to community schools everybody around that table&mdash;including, if my recollection is correct, the representative of the Roman Catholic Church&mdash;hear heared.</P>

      <P>That is the issue which has struck people in Northern Ireland.  It is the concrete evidence of an attitude of mind down here that Protestants can be swept to one side and ignored.  I know it was unintentional. I know the Minister was not sectarian in intent, but he must face the fact that this is the damage that is being done.  It has got to be undone and undone fairly dramatically at <Col N="2070" /> this stage.  I do not mean that some watered down compromise reluctantly reached on the part of the Protestant denomination can undo the damage done down here.  We are not making a party political point.  We are speaking with sincerity of what we have had direct experience of.  The thing I keep being hit with in the North is community schools.  I suspect in the last week if one had been there it might have been temporarily replaced by the contraception issue.  My correspondence suggests this.  I had a very pertinent letter from one Northern Protestant clergyman who is deeply concerned with peace and good relations in the two parts of the country, deeply upset about the action the Government took the other night on that issue, an unforgivable action at this stage in the development of the country's history&mdash;whatever party political reasons there may be for that, and God knows they must have been party political to have taken that action.  However, we cannot debate that here.</P>
      <P>On the community schools issue grave damage has been done.  I know the Minister is trying now to work his way back to some kind of acceptable solution, but he did not have much to say about it in his speech.  I hope I did not miss anything, but I do not think he told us of changes in the scheme.  The newspapers the other day carried the news that it was said in relation to Tallaght specifically, but it was a reference to the scheme generally, that the trustees would be appointed by the Minister and not by the Catholic bishop.  If this is so why did the Minister not refer to it?  I understand there have been consultations on the subject.  Am I wrong?</P>

      <P>I withdraw.  The Minister referred to this without very much emphasis, but I see the reference now.  It is officially announced that, contrary to the original proposals, they will not be appointed by the bishop of the diocese but by the Minister.  This is a step forward but, by God, we had to work for it.</P>

      <P>It has been worth doing if we are making progress at last.  The scheme now is that originally we started off with a board with four representatives of the religious orders and two of the vocational education committee, regardless, in fact, of whether or not there were two religious schools in the area.  There was an absolute majority of two-to-one in favour of the religious orders.  That subsequently was changed to the religious orders appointing two parents, even though the pupils in some cases were at vocational schools.  That has been changed in recent times to the parents being elected in all schools except Tallaght and Blanchardstown, where the Minister is not prepared to have any type of democratic choice on the technical grounds that there are not enough parents to do the choosing. Many offers concerning how that position might be overcome have been made.  We have got to the stage where the parents will elect their own representatives, except in Tallaght and Blanchardstown.  The original proposal has been changed to that extent.  We have had considerable change there, but we have had to work for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trustees will now be appointed by the Minister rather than by the Catholic bishop.  I understand that trustees will be appointed on the nomination of one each of the two religious orders, if there are two, and one by the vocational education committee.  I take it that the Minister's announcement <Col N="2072" /> is correct.  This has more significance than appears at first sight.  The same people will be the trustees as previously.  The Minister appointing them is more than just symbolism.  A lot depends on the terms of the deeds of trust, which we have not seen.  This is better from the point of view of the Protestant community, who were concerned about the fact that if the trustees were appointed by the Catholic bishop a situation could be created where their right to use the premises for a meeting or something like that outside school hours could be inhibited. They felt that the Catholics could refuse them permission to use the school premises for their own purposes. The change to the Minister appointing the trustees may make a difference. The people may be the same, but the Protestants will feel more reassured about the schools being operated in and out of school hours on a nondenominational basis or rather on an inter-denominational basis.  That is a step forward.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister about the clause referring to faith and morals.  Am I to understand from the omission of any reference to this clause that it has been dropped?  On the top of page 14 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The teachers will be selected by a selection board consisting of two representatives of the religious, the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee, a representative of the Department and an agreed chairman.</P>
    <P>The statement goes on:</P>
    <P>In the matter of religion the schools will be open to pupils of all religious denominations.</P>
    <P>Does the omission of any reference to the faith and morals clause mean that it has been dropped?  We are entitled to know that.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>That is further progress.  I am glad that I have brought out this point.  It is important nationally to the religious minority and also the people in the North that these points should be brought out.  I will defer final comment on this until I have time to assess it.  It is not easy for us to react to something which we discover piecemeal in the course of a debate.</P>
      <P>To sum up the position, we now have schools with three trustees appointed by the Minister, of which two-thirds will be nominated by the religious orders and one-third by the vocational education committee, a management board on which, with the exception temporarily of Blanchardstown and Tallaght, parents will have two representatives, the vocational education committee will have two and the religious orders will have two, and there will be no faith and morals clause in the appointment of teachers.  These proposals are significantly different from those originally set out.  The Opposition parties have done a useful job.  Before saying whether the position is now satisfactory, I would like to consider further all aspects of this question with my colleagues.</P>
      <P>I am concerned also with further aspects of the problem not connected with the denominational issue at all. I refer to the representation of teachers.  It seems to me wrong that in this new structure we are setting up there should be no representation of teachers.  I would like clarification from the Minister as to the precise role and terms of reference of the advisory body.  We cannot really assess the situation properly until we know the terms of the trust deed.  Some things the Minister has said would suggest that the trust deed would be so wide that it would not give the trustees any power to influence teaching in the schools that might be prejudicial to the interests of the religious minority. We must defer final comment until we see the terms of the trust deed.  We must welcome all the changes that have been made and feel that our efforts have been worthwhile over the last few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2074" /> I am not happy with the rigidity of the system.  It is quite unsatisfactory to apply the same system everywhere. If there are only two schools, a vocational school and one religious school. I do not see why the two-thirds and one-third rule should apply.  Some regard should be had to the relative numbers in the schools.  A rigid system does not seem rational.</P>
    <P>When the Minister comes to getting acceptance of his proposals in rural areas&mdash;which, even with the changes, will not be all that easy&mdash;he should remember that there are other solutions to the problem.  I would commend to the Minister the situation in the school in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, as it has been described to me a couple of weeks ago by somebody from that school speaking at a meeting of the parent-teacher movement. What has happened there is that co-operation has been achieved to a very high degree.  They have common enrolment as between the vocational school, the boys' school and the girls' school.  If my understanding of the situation is correct, the pupils go to these schools and they attend class in whichever school the class happens to be.  The classes are so organised in the different houses, or schools, that the pupils do not have to change from house to house except at lunch-time. They, in fact, move from school to school during lunch-time, depending on the timetable and the pattern of classes.  Discipline is dealt with on the basis that if it is a minor offence it is dealt with in the school or house in which the pupil finds himself.  If it is a serious matter, the three heads get together and deal with it.  This has overcome the management problem by the simple and effective process of having no management in a sense. These three schools are really houses within a school and each house has its own house management.  There is no management of the school complex as such, thus evading the management problem.  This is an illustration of the extent to which common sense can overcome problems and the extent to which we can get terribly bogged down in argument about structures. When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean all of us <Col N="2075" /> on both sides of the House.  We are all liable to get &ldquo;het up&rdquo; about structures to a degree which may be unnecessary at times.</P>
    <P>That type of solution may be the answer in many cases.  Where there are existing schools there is an obvious economy in using the existing school premises and an obvious advantage in maintaining the traditions that exist and the loyalties attaching to the school.  If co-operation can be achieved it does not matter to the pupil which school he attends.  His loyalty is to the school as a whole. In Ballinamore the old rivalries between the different schools have disappeared. There is no longer any kind of hostility, at school child level, between the vocational schools, the brothers and the nuns.  They all feel part of the complex and they benefit from the different traditions involved. The whole issue of the control of education by the religious is simply a non-issue in these circumstances.  It does not raise the problem because it has been by-passed by by-passing the management problem.</P>
    <P>I hope I have understood the Ballinamore experiment correctly.  If I have, it seems to be the kind of model on which we should build and, to be fair to the Department of Education, this is originally what they tried to achieve.  They set out to secure co-operation and made great efforts to achieve it.  They failed partly because they did not adjust their own rules and regulations sufficiently quickly to it.  Before launching the attempt at co-operation a few years ago they should have had answers to the kind of problems it would create&mdash;the school managements worried about responsibility from the point of view of anything happening to the children, insurance problems, the problem of common enrolment and problems related to the different teaching organisations and the registration councils, all kinds of practical problems.  If the Department had been able to have the answers to these worked out and if, when people, perhaps some of whom were trying to be difficult, raised these difficulties, the Department had been able to confound the critics and deal <Col N="2076" /> with the objections on the spot, I think co-operation would have gone faster.  To be fair to the Department, although they failed to be sufficiently prepared for the practical problems and gave people who did not want to co-operate an excuse not to co-operate, nevertheless they tried to secure co-operation and perhaps in a number of cases where community schools are proposed the &ldquo;threat&rdquo;, in inverted commas, may have a salutary effect and lead at any rate to a great increase in co-operation which may overcome many of the problems involved.</P>
    <P>We should be as flexible as possible here.  If the people in these areas can produce a scheme for co-operation which meets the necessary criteria, meets the Department's legitimate objectives, I think it should be accepted.  We should not be rigid about having any particular form or structure. The Department are concerned to secure parity of esteem.  If pupils are enrolled by common enrolment in the three schools and if they move from one to the other so that they do not have any identity with any particular building, the question of parity of esteem disappears; it is a non-problem, as is the case, I gather, in Ballinamore.  If, between them the three schools have a sufficient number to justify at a reasonably economic level the range of subjects and the level of teaching that is desirable and which the Department rightly seek, that problem is resolved.  If solutions can be found in that way by by-passing all these difficult, intractable problems of management and control, which seem so irrelevant to the children who never can see what all this is about, then let us find it in that way.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not be dogmatic about this and if the community school proposal does produce a willingness to co-operate and if that co-operation will solve the problem we should accept that solution rather than try to push a particular, rigidly-structured answer to the problem.  In many cases it will not: there are cases where co-operation is impossible; the geographical distance is too great or there may be such an unwillingness to <Col N="2077" /> co-operate in some cases that nothing will knock together the heads of the people concerned and perhaps some more drastic solution is then necessary. Each case should be treated on its merits.</P>
    <P>Here, as everywhere else, the problem has been aggravated by the failure to get across its nature to the people concerned.  In talking about education in different parts of the country I find that I am really having to do the Minister's job.  Instead of being able to get on with criticising the Minister's policies which, politically, would be much more beneficial from my point of view &mdash;and there is much to criticise&mdash;I find myself, as in Waterford the other night, spending a long time trying to explain to people what the Minister is trying to achieve, why he is trying to do so, why the objective is a good one, and where it has gone wrong.  Sometimes my local party supporters are a little critical of the fact that I seem to be acting as the spokesman of the Minister rather than presenting his policies but the truth is that if you are to get people to help to solve these problems, they must understand them. The Minister has failed to get across what the problem is.</P>
    <P>I believe in reason.  I know I am an optimist to believe that reason prevails but ultimately it does prevail.  It is very hard work, as in the case of the dialogue of Deputy Thornley and myself with the Minister over community schools but, even there, reason prevailed. It only took nine months, a reasonable gestation period for anything reasonable to emerge.  If you are to persuade people to make drastic changes where their loyalties are involved they must understand the reasons.  It is quite clear to me, in going around the country, that not only do the parents, never mind the students, not understand the problems but that the school managers and teachers very often do not understand what the Minister is trying to do. Because there has never been a White Paper, never any discussion of policy proper and the Minister even in his opening speech here did not deal really with these basic issues, they have never had it put to them what the <Col N="2078" /> problem is.  I am convinced that if from the beginning the Minister had set out the problem of parity of esteem, the problem of range of subjects in terms that were not capable of the kind of distortion there was in the article to which I referred earlier, and if it were put across in peaceful dialogue with the people concerned and it was put up to them: &ldquo;Are not these good objectives?  Do you not agree they are reasonable?&rdquo;  they would have to agree.  If you then put to them: &ldquo;How do you see them being achieved in your context?&rdquo;  and let them come up with the answer, requiring only that the answer should conform to the criterion which they themselves have accepted in argument as reasonable, you would have solved many of these problems much quicker and with much less bitterness and hostility and tension. Instead, no adequate explanation was given of what the problem was and a solution to a problem that nobody recognised was propounded, totally rigid and inflexible, to be imposed on people whether they liked it or not.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister does not see it that way and that he thinks I am being unfair and exaggerating.  To make one's point one must always exaggerate, at least in emphasis if not in words, but fundamentally I am right.  Fundamentally, this has been the difficulty.  It is not a disagreement in principle over the policy pursued; it has been a political failure to get it across.  Here the Minister is at fault in putting the burden of this on civil servants.  It is quite wrong to send a civil servant out to carry out the political function of persuading people to accept a political solution to a problem of this kind.  That is not a civil servant's function. His job is to advise the Minister as to what the solution is; it is the Minister's job to sell it.  The reason we have a Minister and a Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and I am glad we have both; the Department badly need two &mdash;is to have the personnel to go around and do this job.  The Minister must be able to get away from his desk sufficiently to do the job.  I know it is tough. I was sorry for the Parliamentary Secretary in Tallaght where he was nearly torn to pieces by the crowd.  My sympathies <Col N="2079" /> were with him to a large extent up to the point where he read out a bit of a letter and said: &ldquo;There is nothing more of interest to you in it&rdquo; and was forced to read the remainder of it to discover that it said the opposite to the first part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the particular issue of the letter, I certainly did not.  I was horrified at behaviour which I thought totally uncharacteristic of the Parliamentary Secretary and could only be a mental aberration of some kind on the part of somebody of his integrity.  However, I was sorry for him up to that point.</P>
      <P>Although it is a tough job and although you may be torn to pieces by the people present that is precisely why the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary must do it themselves. It is intolerable to put a civil servant in that position and he will not be able to do the job that is necessary.  He has not been trained to sell something like a public relations officer and we are public relations officers whether good, bad or indifferent.  This is a political job.  It was quite wrong of the Minister to do that and it is not the tradition in other Departments.  There are some Departments where this has happened.  There was the notorious case where the secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries was assigned to give a Press conference denouncing the NFA on behalf of his Minister which was quite a wrong thing to do and it was frowned on within the Civil Service.  Quite rightly, there was much adverse comment on it in the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Departments do not allow this to happen.  I shall not name them as it could be embarrassing to do so but I know one Department where the Minister thought that a civil servant should go around the country doing the same kind of job as the Minister here has required his civil servants to do, selling a particular scheme.  I shall only say that as a result of advice given a contrary decision was taken and I respect <Col N="2080" /> the Minister for having listened to that advice and taken it.  I am sorry it was not done in the Department of Education. However, we all make mistakes and I am sure the Minister will not make that mistake again and that in future he or his Parliamentary Secretary will undertake the political work of the Department and not impose it on civil servants who should not be forced to do it.</P>
    <P>I have been dealing with all this under the heading of the effective use of resources and rationalisation.  I have not quite finished yet.  I now come to deal with the third point to which I referred earlier, the question of standards. I shall not dwell on it at any great length but there are a few points I want to make.  First, I do not think membership of the EEC has enormously significant direct implications for Irish education.  Twice recently I was asked to speak on Irish education within the EEC.  I know I disappointed the audience, on one occasion certainly, and I think on both, by saying that there are not that many implications. Of course, there are indirect implications because EEC membership will transform this country in a number of ways.  This must have implications for education.  The only direct implications which are totally direct are the implications for third level professional education of the equivalence of diplomas and qualifications arising out of the free movement of labour and the right of establishment.  There is a problem there.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say something about this.  I do not think the implications for us are very great but we shall be required under the EEC legislation, if our professional people are to have the right to establish themselves in other countries with free movement of labour, and the right to move as workers and employees, to ensure that our &ldquo;standards&rdquo;&mdash;I put that in inverted commas&mdash;in these professional qualifications are the same as in other EEC countries.  This will be a legal requirement.  The legislation concerned, as far as I know, has not yet been enacted in any instance, or at most in one, but virtually all of it is now in train and is known.  Details of <Col N="2081" /> the broad shape it will take are publicly known.  I know it is a slow process to get it through.  I do not think the agricultural science provisions have been published yet although I have succeeded in acquiring a copy of them. The trend in legislation is to require that courses will be of the same length. The question of standards has been interpreted very crudely.  The obvious difficulty of measuring standards, except objectively, has proved a little too much and so generally the line taken is that courses must be courses of not less than four years, four and a half years or five years.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to tell us, when replying, in which of the professions is the length of course as required by the legislation proposed in the EEC, as published, longer than our present courses and which of the courses are affected.  I know of some of them myself, but I do not think I have a complete picture.  There is, I think, some problem in the case of pharmacy.  I would not from recollection mention the others but there are one or two other cases where courses may need to be slightly lengthened.  I should like the Minister to tell the House whether he has been in touch with the professional bodies concerned because, frankly, I have raised this here over two years in this House with various Ministers and I have the impression that the various professions were never approached by any Government Department to be told the implications of this legislation.  I myself have actually written to them all and provided information for a number of them and, in fact, I have done some research for some of them when they wanted further details.  This is a job the Government should be doing and I should like to know from the Minister has he been in touch with the professions and made them aware of the implications involved and where, in fact, are the implications significant.</P>
    <P>Again, in the case of pharmacy, not only will there be a need to lengthen the course but the actual content of the course will be determined by these regulations. As I understand it, the content of the course&mdash;I have the details at home&mdash;is laid down on the basis that <Col N="2082" /> something like two-thirds of the total number of hours in the four years&mdash;I think it is a four-year course&mdash;is allocated to specific subjects and sub-subjects, down to the detail of not less than 20 hours practical and 20 hours theoretical microbiology, for example. Not all the time is allocated; one-third is left free so that each country can add on to these 20 hours as much as it wishes in individual subjects.  There is a fairly stringent programme proposed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Department has been keeping in touch with all this.  I hope it has been in touch with the professions concerned and notified them of what is involved.  In my contacts with the professions I have never had the slightest inkling from any of them that anyone has approached them on the subject except myself.  The Minister has a duty here and would be doing only his duty if he kept <i>au fait</i> with the developments in the position here and with the professions concerned. Apart from that, and I do not think this will cause much worry, one or two will be lengthened.  There is no direct impact of EEC membership on education in the sense of legislation requiring a change in the educational system; there is, of course, an indirect impact to which I referred earlier on the question of languages.  That whole question will have to be dealt with.  Modern continental languages will become much more important.  Beyond that, all one can say is that the more competitive environment at home that our people will face is one which will mean that any deficiencies in our educational system will be more serious than they have been hitherto.</P>
    <P>We have in the past been extraordinarily unconcerned in the export of our young people without proper education.  I hope that attitude of unconcern is changing.  Hitherto we have not had to worry too much about our position domestically because we have not had to face competition domestically, but we will be moving into a much more open environment and, in that environment, the question of standards at home as well as the standards of those who emigrate will be important.</P>
    <P>We have problems here at each <Col N="2083" /> level, one of which I have dealt with already.  We have at the primary level problems posed by large classes in urban areas and small schools in rural areas.  These have implications for standards.  The Minister is tackling them but, as I said, progress is disturbingly slow and he has not really fully explained why.  We have also a problem&mdash;I know this is a sensitive area and particularly sensitive for the Minister himself&mdash;that we have to face as a fact and that is that in this country, as distinct from our near neighbour, we have to teach two languages in the primary schools.  There is no dissent from this policy.  No one suggests we should not teach Irish as well as English in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>There will be some problems to be considered in the context of reunification. Clearly, we are not intending to impose this on the primary schoolchildren in Northern Ireland and the rationality in a united Ireland of insisting on Irish being taught in a primary school in Monaghan but not in a primary school next door in Armagh may be in doubt.  Leaving the problems of reunification on one side, at this stage, and in the present context, nobody is proposing any change in the system.  We all recognise that the primary school is a single stream school.  There is not a choice of subjects&mdash;there cannot be&mdash;and you, therefore, either teach Irish or you do not and the predominant view of people in this part of the country is that they want their children in the primary schools to be taught Irish.  No choice is possible: as between teaching it and not teaching it, we believe in teaching it.  That is not an issue.</P>
    <P>We have, however, to face the fact that up to some years ago the time given to Irish was so overwhelming that it created a problem of inadequate time for other subjects.  I think this has changed.  I think the Minister, without making any announcement and with no fanfare of trumpets at any Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, has, in fact, encouraged, or permitted, the schools to reduce the predominant time given to Irish to a more reasonable level and the result of that is that <Col N="2084" /> the time available for other subjects has been raised somewhat, but it is still very far away from the kind of time that is available for them in, for example. Northern Ireland and Britain. We must face the fact that this is a problem.  There is no use in closing our eyes to it.</P>
    <P>Up to about 1963, with our shorter school year, the actual volume of teaching in our primary schools over the whole life of the child in terms of teacher contact hours in the case of English, arithmetic and other subjects was about half what it was in the schools in Northern Ireland and Britain. No amount of good teaching, and there is plenty of good teaching in Irish primary schools, could make up for that or do anything other than create a situation where, in those circumstances, Irish children emerged from school less well equipped in English, arithmetic, and other subjects which play a growing part in the primary curriculum, than did the children in Northern Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>To state that is to state a fact.  It is not to state anything hostile to the Irish language and I am not suggesting for a moment it should not be taught, but it has been necessary to try to mitigate this problem, which is inherent in this bilingual country, which neither Britain nor Northern Ireland is, by making some changes and I should like to hear from the Minister what progress there has been in this.  The Minister ought to tell us what has been achieved.  I think the time given to Irish is not now so overwhelming and the time given to other subjects has increased and the problems of retardation, so ably illustrated in Dr. McNamara's Bill of Rights book, must have been somewhat reduced over this period, though they still exist.  I would like the Minister to tell us what progress has been made there.  Let him not be too coy about it.  He will not be replying to this debate until after the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, so nothing he says will be used in evidence against him on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the new curriculum.  He is right in saying <Col N="2085" /> that nothing in Irish education in recent years has received such universal approval.  I think this is true.  I have seen no criticism of it and nothing but commendation from everyone, and I am very glad to see provision being made to ensure the effective introduction of the new curriculum.  The proposals made are satisfactory and the allocation of £250,000 for this period of the current year is a beginning.  Of course, when you spread that over all the schools, it comes out a very small sum.  The Minister did tell us what the sums were&mdash;he did not hide the fact.  A sum of £250,000 spread in this way yields, in the case of a two-teacher school, £20, which is a small sum but it is a beginning, and I am very glad, indeed, that he has introduced this. This, with the introduction of the teacher centres, will certainly, with the other measures taken, help to ensure that the new curriculum is introduced as rapidly and as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>At secondary level, the problem of standards is one which is partly a problem of the size of schools, as I mentioned already, but there are other aspects to which I should like to refer. There is an aspect which we do not hear much of nowadays but it is an issue which we have to concern ourselves with, that is, the extent to which we are approaching a point where the teachers of a subject in these schools or, perhaps, to start with, at senior cycle level in these schools, do have a qualification in the subject in question.  Other countries manage to have this arrangement. Why cannot we?  Of course, I can see that any change here takes time&mdash;nothing like this can be done overnight&mdash;but what progress are we making towards it?  I have heard nothing of progress in this connection for a long time past and I am not clear that we are making any progress.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us if we are, how soon he expects to reach the point at which we will have a situation in which children in, say, senior cycle at least are taught by somebody with a degree in the subject.  That is not too much to ask.  We go on then beyond that to the point where children in junior and senior cycle are taught by people with a degree in the <Col N="2086" /> subject and beyond that to the point at which people in senior cycle at honours level are taught by people with honours degrees.  These are different stages.  Are we making progress to these stages and, if so, at what rate and when do we hope to reach each of these stages?  We cannot hope to produce people as well educated as in other countries if they are not given the opportunities which children in other countries have.  In other countries provision of this kind exists, these requirements exist, and it is possible to fulfil them and I would ask the Minister to tell us something about any progress made in this connection.</P>
    <P>On one particular and specific aspect of standards which has come up recently I should like to say a word, especially on the teaching of French.  I understand&mdash;again the Minister's speech does not reveal anything on this&mdash;a concession has been made on this question of the teaching of French in the schools about which I certainly have received representations. The failure to provide for an oral can have very bad effects, indeed, and I have spoken to teachers who have told me their own experience, that because they were encouraged to undertake all-type teaching and no oral examination was provided, they got into the position in which the children best at French failed while those less good at French did better.  Any Department of Education which so manages its affairs as regards encouraging a development and not providing for it in the examination system as to have that result deserves some criticism, to put it no higher than that. I understand that the Minister has made a change here and there is going to be an option this year of an examination for children who are being taught in the two different ways.  Is this correct?</P>

      <P>I am very glad that is being done because it was certainly a very backward step not to make provision for it before.  I hope&mdash; I have not had a chance to check out the reactions on this&mdash;that it does meet the needs of the situation and if <Col N="2087" /> it does not, I shall be back later to the Minister further on it, but it seems to me <i>prima facie</i> that what the Minister has done may help to ease the situation at this time.  But let us be clear about this: no matter what the logistic problems are, if we are going to teach spoken languages in this country&mdash;our own native Irish language and the other languages, the languages which our people are going to need&mdash;we must be prepared to gear ourselves to the oral teaching and oral examining.  For many people the practical need for languages is a need to be able to speak the language.  There are certain people who want to have a literary knowledge and a total command of the language, but for practical purpose the great bulk of our people want to be in the position that they can speak freely to people in another country in their own language, and we have made extraordinarily slow progress towards that.  I hope the Minister will be able to ensure that we do get to the point where the oral side is adequately examined in all these subjects and that we do not have the kind of situation created by this recent difficulty that has arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think those are the main points I wanted to make in regard to standards. I mentioned earlier the question of this age 12 requirement and I mentioned before the extraordinary results that has had.  Where you have a preparatory school attached to a secondary school, you can get a situation where the brighter children in the preparatory school are the youngest in their classes, and when they come to the stage of going to the secondary school, if they go to the secondary school, the Minister will not allow them to be counted for grant purposes and, therefore, they are kept back.  The secondary school may be short of numbers for grant purposes in some cases and they get more pupils in, and then promote the less able children into the secondary school so as to get the grant for the secondary school.  Any system of assistance to education from a Government that encourages a school to promote the less able children and to keep the others back is a lunatic system.  I put <Col N="2088" /> this to the Minister before and I hope he will see the need for a radical change in this.  Of course, schools should not behave in that way, and most of them do not, but some are so pressed financially, especially those conned into the new free scheme without being able to find the resources to cope with it, that under great pressure they may behave in this way.  It is all wrong that children should be held back at this particular stage.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of equality of opportunity in education &mdash;the fourth of the main issues I want to deal with.  Here we have a number of different problems.  Some of them I have dealt with already in dealing with other aspects of education.  I have dealt with the small schools but one aspect I should like to deal with now relates to the senior cycle.  I think that the Union of Students in Ireland are right in pressing for an extension of the grant system and right in seeking that the anomalies of the present scheme be eliminated and I hope the Minister will be able to do that quickly.  I think they are right in general to seek to have the scheme extended to all students and assimilate the grant level with the entrance level but I think there may be a failure in emphasis here.  I think our problem of equality of education at the moment is really lower down the line than at university level. Most people of ability who manage to get through from a disadvantaged home background from preparatory to secondary, through secondary up to senior cycle and who manage to stay on at school, despite the financial problems this causes for their parents, if they are that good very often do quite well, get a grant and get on to the university or the technical or training college, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would be better if the grants were given at two honours rather than four honours level, but there are many people who do not get as far as doing the leaving certificate, and one feature of Fine Gael policy I very much regret the Minister did not adopt, when he adopted in the case of basic grants a somewhat different approach, was a proposal for grants at senior cycle level.  I think <Col N="2089" /> this is important.  In my own practical experience as a Deputy, I find myself faced with tragic cases, and, unfortunately, I come across too few of the cases that exist&mdash;they do not all come to one's attention&mdash;cases where, especially if the mother has been deserted by the husband, who is an alcoholic or has some problem of that kind, and there is a problem of earning capacity or illness among children.  I had one case recently where the eldest child has to be kept at home to earn or to look after the other children because there is not enough money for the purpose, because the income of the family is so low.  There was the case last year of a girl who had eight honours in her intermediate certificate. The mother had been deserted by the father and, although she realised the importance of education, she did not consider that it would be possible for her to allow her daughter to continue at school, the family having hardly enough to eat.  She had decided to put her to work in a launderette.  However, on the advice of the local priest, I suggested to the mother that the girl return to school and that younger children in the family, boys of 14 or 15 years of age, would take part-time evening work in a bar.  That was not an ideal solution, but it meant that all the children were able to continue at school.  The boys are very clever and are doing extremely well at vocational school.  When there are so many problems of this nature, it is obvious that something must be done.  A brilliant child coming from a disadvantaged home who for some financial reason is kept from school is not only a personal tragedy but a national tragedy.  The contribution of that human being to the future of this country is being inhibited and the individual personal development of the child is being prevented.  We have a national duty to deal with the problem. In financial terms, in so far as numbers are concerned, it is not a very major problem.  I ask the Minister to find some solution to it.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me that it is less than ideal for a TD to be advising a mother in the circumstances I have mentioned to <Col N="2090" /> send children of 14 or 15 years of age to work in a pub.  There is something wrong when we have to do so.  There should be some scheme&mdash;of a discretionary nature, if necessary, but preferably on a more general basis&mdash; whereby when people's incomes are below a certain level a small grant can be made available.  In our policy on education which was published five or six years ago we proposed that a grant of up to £100 a year be paid in necessitous cases.  That amount may not seem very much but it could make all the difference to, say, a deserted wife living on £7 or £8 a week for herself and her children in deciding whether to allow a child to continue at school.  The figure now should be £175 a year.  Something in the region of £3 or £4 a week would be appropriate in relation to what we proposed in 1966 and appropriate in relation to the needs of the situation.  This should take priority over the USI scheme, because unless children can be enabled to complete the senior cycle and obtain the required number of honours in the leaving certificate they will never have a chance of getting near a university.  There is a danger that we provide more funds which go increasingly to middle-class people to enable them to educate their children.  This is not solving the problem of the disadvantaged children who come from working class homes, particularly in the city.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware the whole trend of educational thinking in recent years has been towards the recognition that one does not achieve equality of opportunity simply by providing grants that are available equally to everybody. Children coming from homes that are deprived culturally, as are so many homes in Ireland because of the class system we have inherited, are at such a disadvantage that unless more resources are available for them than for any middle-class child there will never be equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister has read the report of the conference of educational administrators that was held in Paris in 1970&mdash;the second of the two major OECD conferences on education that have been held, the first having been <Col N="2091" /> held in the 1960s.  I considered this report to have been so worthwhile as to warrant my summarising it with some comments in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I found the document to be a very striking one.  It was the result of civil servants from the educational departments of European countries and of North America and, I think, of Japan discussing educational policy.</P>
    <P>One does not think of administrators in the Department of Education as socialist revolutionaries but when one reads this particular document carefully one realises, first, that their policies of the 1960s have failed and that the giving of grants does not resolve anything but enables people who start with a greater advantage to take more advantage of that position and to get further ahead.  There is a very interesting graph in that report showing the attainment of children in rural schools in the US, Negro children and white children.  This graph shows that, by measurements of aptitude tests, Negro children are fractionally behind white children, that there is a 10 per cent difference but that by the time they have finished school the difference is 30 per cent.  More education that is given equally, without giving more attention to those most in need of it, only enables the better equipped child to make more progress.  The consequence of these broad policies of grants given equally to everybody has been to increase educational inequality. This is the conclusion reached from all the studies carried out by these education administrators from all these countries.  What was most interesting of all was their ultimate conclusion that there is need to put in extra effort where disadvantaged children are concerned.  Fundamentally, what they were saying was that, with our present class system within the capitalist system, they did not think the problem could be solved at all.  I found that to be an interesting conclusion to come from a body of men who are scarcely thought of as revolutionary. We should learn from that report and not always be ten years behind in wisdom.</P>
    <P>We must begin to think.  The Rutland <Col N="2092" /> Street experiment is a case in point, and I congratulate the Minister on it.  Perhaps he will let us have some word of the progress being made and also whether there are any interim results from it that will enable us to begin to reorientate our educational polices more acceptably.  We must begin to think in terms of an unequal allocation of educational resources with extra resources being put into the schools in which the majority of children come from educationally deprived backgrounds.  In this way we would be doing our best to eliminate the problems that have resulted from the class system we have inherited.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on the special aspect of equality of opportunity in so far as the Protestant schools here are concerned.  I discussed this at length on the last debate and I read out the ridiculously detailed means test requirement for Protestants to enable them to get some assistance towards reducing the fees in their schools.  That is all they got from free education.  If they are farmers they are required to fill up forms that constitute the most comprehensive farm accounts I have ever seen.  That system is unsatisfactory. I emphasise that point here, because from conversations I have had with a senior ecclesiastic it is clear that, having read my speech in the paper, but not in the Dáil Official Report, the result was that he got the wrong end of the stick as to what I said and I was accused of having said that our system of grants discriminated against Protestants.  Of course, it does not.  If he had read my speech in full, he would have realised that what I said was that our system discriminates in favour of Protestants in that more money per head is available to Protestants; but because of the fact that Protestants have not got the enormous untold advantages of the system of religious orders in planning education and in ploughing their salaries back into education, the money the Government give, although Protestants get a little more of it than Catholics, is insufficient to enable them to provide free education.  Even with discrimination in favour of Protestants financially, the effect on them is that they are discriminated against by the system and <Col N="2093" /> there is no free education in many areas for them but only reduced-fee education on a means test basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried to meet this problem in centres like Dublin and Cork by establishing Protestant comprehensive schools.  I can see why he has done this and, possibly, it is the right answer.  If we overcome the problem regarding Protestant comprehensive schools in Dublin or Cork, will it be possible to reallocate the funds available to the Protestant schools in the rest of the country to enable them to provide free education?  The distribution of the Protestant community in Dublin and Cork is such that this may solve numerically a large proportion of the problem, but there are Protestants throughout the country who are at a disadvantage under the present system.  Does the Minister see the possibility of getting over the situation that exists through no fault of anybody where, even with discrimination in favour of Protestants as regards extra finance, nevertheless they do not have free education?  We look forward to proposals on this matter because it is a source of great irritation among the Protestant community.  They appreciate they are not being treated in an unfair way; in fact, they are getting more than their share and the hostility is directed more at their own co-religionists who organise the means test scheme than at the Government.</P>
    <P>The last of my five points dealing with the general educational philosophy is the question of variety.  I do not propose to deal with this matter at length because I have referred to it previously in relation to the choice of subjects.  On the question of choice of schools I realise that there are two points of view.  It is a fact that if you have schools large enough to allow choice of subjects it will mean that there will be less choice of schools.</P>
    <P>We should not reject the desirability of a choice of schools where this is possible.  In the new suburbs, such as Tallaght and Blanchardstown, I am not enamoured of the idea of establishing community schools on a vast scale with approximately 1,600 pupils.  I should prefer if these communities were planned so that there might be sub-communities <Col N="2094" /> within them, and that for each area with a certain population, which would be likely to produce a secondary school population of a certain number after a number of years, the area should be planned so that it would have its own subcommunity school.</P>
    <P>The idea of planning one community school for Tallaght, which will have a population of approximately 136,000, is nonsense.  To make such a vast suburb a desirable place in which to live it will be necessary to break it down into subunits.  In this way people could live in an area which provided its own facilities, although naturally they could go to a central shopping centre and to a central area for the kind of services that could only be provided for such a large number of people.  Ideally in each neighbourhood there would be essential services; there could be the neighbourhood primary school covering a small area, not like the huge primary school at Crumlin, for instance, where the children feel that they are merely ciphers.  Certainly, they are not treated as ciphers by the teachers and the religious orders who do wonderful work, but the sheer size of the institution can intimidate the children.</P>
    <P>We should plan the new towns in such a way that the primary and post-primary schools do not need to be larger than is necessary to achieve economy.  I hope that in time there will be in Tallaght a number of primary and post-primary schools.  If for some reason parents do not like the nearest community school it should be possible for them to transfer their children to another school.  In offering a choice of this kind we should try to avoid any perpetuation of the dichotomy between the secondary and vocational schools, but it is better to have several schools rather than one enormous community school.  We should avoid having larger institutions than is necessary for sound economic and educational reasons.</P>
    <P>I have a number of individual points to make which do not fit into the structure of the five main issues with which I have been dealing.  First, with regard to post-primary schools, many of them are in financial difficulty.  In the enthusiasm generated by the Minister's <Col N="2095" /> energetic predecessor, the late Deputy Donough O'Malley, many schools joined in the free scheme, but they could not afford it.  The free scheme gave them after a year or two an extra £25 per head by way of grant. That could not meet the problem of schools whose scale of expenditure at that time was such that fees had to be charged.  In some instances fees of £30 to £60 were charged, although it should be pointed out that those schools were not making any profit.  At that time the <i>per capita</i> cost in secondary schools ranged from £60 up to £130.  The amount that was paid through the teacher's salary, incremental scheme, and the existing grants was such that on average schools received approximately £ 50 to £60 from the Government.  This enabled many schools which were operating on a low level of costs, with perhaps an unfavourable teacher-student ratio, to charge minimal fees of £12&mdash;even in some cases many of the schools provided free education for 25 per cent of their pupils.</P>
    <P>The schools whose cost level was above £60 per year, not due to their extravagance but because they provided a better teacher-student ratio and better amenities with regard to library and playing facilities, could not come into the scheme without loss if they received only £25 per head from the Government.  Many of them came into the scheme because there was a mood of antipathy to the idea of having two classes of education&mdash;the fee-paying and the free&mdash;and many of the schools did not want to be part of a snob school system.  In some instances they came into the scheme on the basis that they would ask parents to make voluntary contributions over a number of years to pay off their debts.  In the enthusiasm of the moment the parents agreed to this but, predictably, the schools have got into difficulties.  The new parents do not see why they should be asked to pay off some kind of debt incurred in previous years and a situation has arisen where the schools are not collecting these voluntary payments in sufficient amounts.  Parents are increasingly resentful about this <Col N="2096" /> voluntary payment, which in some cases is great.  I was told recently of a case where the voluntary payment was £95 per year; I cannot verify this because I was not given sufficient details but I was astonished at the figure. Parents who have some children attending school would find it impossible to pay this sum, especially when it is an obligation in whose incurring they had no role.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to let us know the scale of this problem.  I asked him a question on this matter before, but he dismissed it as not being his job.  His Department should know how many of the schools are collecting voluntary contributions, the amount involved and what proportion the parents are paying.  I hope the Minister will look into this matter because it is causing hardship to parents and schools.  He should consider if some scheme could be devised to get over this difficulty.  I hope the Minister will accept some responsibility in this matter.  Many of the schools concerned were encouraged to join a scheme which they could not afford and many of them are regretting it now.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the figure for manufacturing industry published this morning showed that for the latest quarter for which figures are available there is a drop of 3,500 in employment by comparison with the same period last year? Would he agree, therefore, that there is a necessity to stimulate economic growth so that this decline in employment which is causing by no means all but certainly part of the rise in unemployment would be dealt with?

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the importance of British and world opinion in regard to events in the North of Ireland. Although we may at times find that the coverage or comment in foreign news media is less satisfactory than we would wish, I believe that in general there is a wide realisation abroad of the basic facts of the situation as well as the urgent need for changes in the North and the need to move to a political solution.  In regard to the events in Derry, in particular, the reports available to me confirm that world press and public opinion has in general been strongly critical of the actions of the British Army.</P>
      <P>The Government's information services here and abroad are very active in making the facts of the situation known.  Their efforts are being supplemented by the public relations services of Markpress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the importance of an informed British public opinion which would, in turn, influence the Health Government and in view of the deliberately misleading reports which have been put out in particular in relation to the Derry incidents from British Army sources and which have been taken over uncritically by the British media, and also in view of the misleading British reports relayed in the United States which have an effect on public opinion there, would he agree it is important for the people of this part of the country to establish an agency which would put out, we would hope, a fair estimate of the events in Northern Ireland and thus help towards the political solution which is so necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think an agency is necessary for that purpose.  I agree entirely and I admit candidly that we must improve the news service from this country and certainly improve knowledge of the facts rather than make propaganda.  That is the purpose of what we are doing at the present time.  I do not think we should go as <Col N="2100" /> far as establishing a specific press agency for that purpose at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As one formerly connected with an Irish news agency when we had one here, I should like to ask the Taoiseach whether he would consider consulting with representatives of the national newspapers of, I would hope, the entire island, at least those who would be prepared to join in such consultation, to consider the question of whether a national newsagency based on the press and other news media of this country could be established. I make the suggestion having regard to the fact that the weakness of the former Irish News Agency was that it was formed by the Government fiat alone and without consultation or without adequate consultation, I believe, with the newspapers.  Would the Taoiseach consider at least consulting with the press and other media to see whether the time might now be ripe for some such an agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of the establishment of such an agency I would certainly be in favour of seeking assistance and technical advice from the best possible sources, and I will admit the best sources would be in the established news media in this country.  If that eventuality arises I certainly would consider that.</P>

Would he not agree that his reply tended to defer the issue a little until somebody came up with something, and that a general <Col N="2101" /> consultation might yield useful ideas from people who are perpetually involved?</P>

      <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's question, as I understood it, envisaged the establishment of a news agency, in the event of the estabilishment of which he counselled that we ought to consult the technicians in this country, if I may call them that.  I have said already I did not think it was necessary to do that yet.  I have not come to the conclusion that it is.  I am sure that when the eventuality arises that we would consider the establishment of an agency, certainly I would consult&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Have the Government taken any steps to disseminate to people in Britain as widely as possible copies of the factual newspaper reports by journalists about Derry.  I do not suggest the Government send any propaganda material, but I want to know whether anything has been done to bring together the reports of the British and foreign journalists of what actually happened, the eye-witness accounts, the excellent account in the <i>Times</i> of the following Tuesday which itself incorporated eye-witness accounts, and the remarkable reconstructions of events in the <i>Sunday Press</i>, the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and on RTE.  Would the Taoiseach consider it would be desirable that these be brought together, simply as factual statements, with no propaganda attached to them, and disseminated as widely as possible to people in Britain who clearly have not understood the truth of what happened there and who may not discover the truth of what has happened there from the Widgery Tribunal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether repatriation of assets held abroad for investment in the home economy is under consideration, in view of the decrease in foreign investment in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence that a decline in the inflow of capital has hindered industrial or other basic development.  Indeed, there was an exceptionally high inflow of funds in 1971 and, while this may not be repeated in the present year, the indications are that there is still a substantial inflow.  Apart from this, Irish banks have resources to enable them to lend more money for sound productive investment if the demand should be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>With the background as indicated, the question of special action to secure the repatriation of Irish-owned assets abroad does not arise.</P>
      <P>The matter has been examined, however, from time to time.  Assets held abroad can be divided between those held by companies and individuals and those held by the banking system, in particular by the Central Bank.  In the case of assets held by companies and individuals, it is not apparent how such assets could be effectively repatriated except on a voluntary basis. Attempts to achieve this by other means would be difficult if not impossible to implement successfully and could easily discourage foreign investment in this country in the future.  The foreign assets of the Central Bank are the country's official external reserves and, of course, they are held to finance any adverse development in external payments.  The question of repatriation does not arise in the case of the Associated Banks and non-Associated Banks as they are no longer in a net foreign asset position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2108" /> It should, of course, be remembered that our foreign investments earn a valuable income for the country.</P>

      <P>The inflow for 1971 was, as I said, exceptionally high.  This was partially distorted by the bank strike but, leaving that aside, the indications so far in the current year are that there is a substantial inflow still going on.  I would not expect that the inflow this year would be as high as last year for the reasons I have mentioned.  Nevertheless, as of now there is no indication of any difficulty in this regard. The indications are that the inflow is still substantial.</P>

      <P>Agricultural societies are exempt from income tax in respect of any profit or gains arising from an <Col N="2109" /> exhibition or show held for the purposes of the society.

      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that, in practice, the great majority of agricultural societies are not liable for any tax, and in the exceptional case where liability arises it rarely amounts to more than £50.</P>

    <P>In addition, where the importer is not registered for the purposes of turnover and wholesale taxes, spoons are chargeable at importation with turnover and wholesale taxes at the combined rate of 15 per cent calculated on the value of the goods increased by the amount of customs duty chargeable on the goods.</P>
    <P>Thus, it will be seen that imported spoons of base metal which are chargeable with customs duty at the full rate may incur duty amounting to 80 per cent; this together with taxes of 15 per cent based on the duty-paid value amounts to a total charge of 107 per cent on the value of the foods.</P>

I should also draw the attention of the House to the fact that as a result of the recent drop in interest rates the current land bonds of 9¾ per cent are standing at £99.70p which is very close to par, so anybody getting a bond at the moment is getting almost full price.

All of this has been done to try to keep the ultimate price of timber as low as possible and in competition with the rest of the world. This trend is universal.

      <P>The situation in any event is that the Minister for Finance gave to the Minister for Lands in the allocation of moneys last October the sum which I considered it would be possible for us to use for the remaining period of 1971-72.  I should emphasise that the forestry planting programme is at its full target of 25,000 acres but, as the Deputy will also understand, forestry is not something instant like driving stakes into the ground or digging a hole in the ground.  It is something which has to be organised.  At that stage of the year we got from the Department of Finance all the money we could use in order either to preserve employment or create further employment during the existing year.  That will continue next year at a much higher level of expenditure in order to try to keep the employment in forestry at the highest possible level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only 83 pupils in this school.  The first year intake last September was 16 pupils. Whatever arguments there may be about whether the 400 to 800 size school favoured by my Department is the right one, no reputable educationalist would agree that a post-primary school with 83 on roll can provide an adequate service up to leaving certificate level.  The Lacken Cross/Ballycastle area cannot support two post-primary schools and this fact should be faced by all the interests concerned.  The Vocational school at Lacken Cross has 242 pupils on roll and is, therefore, quite obviously the school which is being supported by the great majority of the people in the area.  Any plan for the area must accordingly be based on the development of the latter school, and that is why it is proposed to concentrate senior cycle facilities there.</P>

Are we ever to get a population there? I am quite certain it was not the Minister who made this decision.  It seems to be a bureaucratic decision geared to kill another town in the west of Ireland.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the position.  This school has a widely based curriculum. The people in the area are completely satisfied with it.  They are determined to fight the closure of the school.

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to paragraph 5.30 of the White Paper published last month on the <i>Accession of Ireland to the European Communities</i>.  The general implications for the horticultural industry of Ireland's membership of an enlarged EEC were earlier set out in the study <i>Irish Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC</i> published in April, 1970.</P>
      <P>I would also refer the Deputy to paragraphs 166 and 167 of the appendix to the White Paper which outline the special timetable negotiated for the dismantlement of our tariffs on horticultural products and the special import arrangements which will apply during the transitional period for apples and tomatoes in lieu of the existing quantitative controls.  These arrangements will help the industry to prepare for free conditions which will apply from the beginning of 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2120" /> As indicated in the publications I have mentioned, the extent of increased competition from imports gradually over the transitional period will, of course, vary according to product, but on our home market, where the vast bulk of the Irish output is sold, our producers will have advantages in such matters as transport and handling costs, freshness and quality, especially in the case of low-priced bulky products.  In the case of one of the more important horticultural products, namely tomatoes, we have, in fact, developed a sizeable export trade in recent years against outside competition. It will, however, be important for our horticultural industry to aim at the highest level of efficiency in production, processing and marketing.</P>

The general implications for the pigs and bacon industry were earlier set out in the study <i>Irish Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC</i> which was published in April, <Col N="2121" /> 1970.  As indicated in the latter publication, &ldquo;the trend in the EEC at present is towards larger pig production units, including commercial production units, and it seems unlikely that pricing policy in the Community will encourage the fattening of small numbers of pigs&rdquo;.  Small producers here would, therefore, be well advised to consider expanding their production units as many of them have already been doing in response to official exhortations and with the aid of my Department's schemes such as those for piggery grants and farrowed sow grants.</P>

Surely the Department of Industry and Commerce can tell whether it is a dumped price or not and stop it before it comes in and not have the row afterwards when it is in.  It must be in the country before either a manufacturer or a union can make a complaint because they do not know, particularly the unions, whether it is dumped or not until it is for sale.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity presented by this question to put on the record some facts in relation to the publication of these newspaper articles about Mountjoy Female Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 30th December the writer of the articles informed the Government Information Bureau that, in an interview with her, a number of ex-prisoners had made allegations about conditions in Mountjoy.  She stated that, to give the officials a chance to reply, she wanted permission to have an appointment with the matron of <Col N="2130" /> the prison, permission to visit the prison and an appointment with the chairman of the visiting committee. She was informed that a visiting committee is an independent body and that any application to interview a representative of the body could be made direct.  As regards the other requests, she was informed that I was responsible for dealing with complaints and that, if they were to be dealt with, I would, of course, need, as a first step, to know what they were.  In a reply from the writer received by the Bureau on 5th January she submitted seven questions.  She was reminded of what she had already said and of the fact that the allegations had not yet been conveyed.  It was also mentioned that a great deal of the other information in which she appeared to be interested could be obtained in various published documents, which were specified.</P>
    <P>A further letter and enclosure&mdash;a five-page document containing a list of 13 detailed questions&mdash;were received in my Department late on the evening of Friday, 14th January.  The fact that this material would take time to deal with was recognised by the writer herself, as she asked for an estimate of how long it would take.  A week later, on Friday morning, 21st January, a further seven queries of a statistical character were received.  That afternoon three further queries were received, the answers to which would also involve a good deal of work.  At that point also it was stated on behalf of the newspaper that the publication of the articles that were planned would begin on the following Monday and a reply was sought before then.</P>
    <P>A reply was issued that evening. It pointed out that the writer's letter and enclosure had been received in the Department shortly before the office was due to close on Friday, 14th January and that several, if not most, of the 13 items listed in the five-page document obviously could be dealt with only after checking with the Governor who in turn obviously would have to check with the prison staff; that each of these officers had his or her ordinary work to do and could not set that work aside; that, likewise, the staff in <Col N="2131" /> the Department headquarters had their commitments and priority had to be given to those matters that need to be dealt with urgently&mdash;including prison administration work; that a week had been quite inadequate to enable a reply to be prepared, quite apart from the fact that on that very day a further ten questions had been submitted.  It was further pointed out in the reply that when allegations are made that would, if established, involve a clear breach by prison staff of any important rule&mdash; for instance, an allegation that the prisoner was kicked, punched and had her hair pulled&mdash;the normal way, and the only satisfactory way, in which to have the matter investigated was to supply particulars that would enable alleged incidents to be checked; that no such details had been supplied; and that it had been taken for granted, when the writer said that she wished to give an opportunity for reply to the allegations, that she would supply enough details to enable them to be checked out.</P>
    <P>My Department's reply went on to say that, since apparently a reasonable opportunity was not to be given to reply more effectively, all that could be said was that allegations of beating, <i>et cetera,</i> were flatly denied by the prison staff; that no such allegations had been made to the Governor or to the Visiting Committee or individual members thereof; and that any suggestion that prisoners were afraid to complain was disproved by the fact that complaints of one kind or another were freely made.</P>
    <P>The reply then dealt with one specific complaint that alleged that a portion of cabbage served to a prisoner contained 86 insects.  It said that the original complaint related to very small objects which the prisoner claimed she had seen move, that is to say, live insects.  Nobody in the prison service could suggest how such alleged insects could survive cooking or suggest why no other prisoner found similar ones.  Since the complaint was not made until some hours after the meal was over, they found it even more difficult to get to the bottom of the incident.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2132" /> The reply to the newspaper concluded by saying that, if it was intended to publicise allegations of this kind, on the word of people who in many cases are wholly opposed to anybody who to them represents authority, allegations which in the nature of things can never be wholly disproved, I wished to be taken as entering a strong protest.  I think it regrettable, to say the least, that allegations should be published without any indication whatsoever of the substance of the communications that had passed between the newspaper and my Department. I am aware that, subsequent to the publication of the articles, the author of them has, in letters to the same newspaper, made references in general terms to the fact that she had been in touch with the Department. She did not give details, however, and what she said was inaccurate, as a comparison between the factual account I have given and what she has said will show.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that these allegations were published without providing any genuine opportunity beforehand either to deny or to comment on them and that what purported to be an offer of an opportunity to comment was made in such a way as to imply that it was for the newspaper rather than for me to nominate who should speak for me.  I am not prepared to go along with that.  Neither am I prepared to accept that, in relation to unchecked allegations from questionable sources, it is sufficient for a newspaper to be willing to provide space for a reply after the publication has already taken place and that it would be appropriate or in the public interest for me to reply in that fashion.</P>
    <P>I will, however, say for the information of this House that the allegations, like all allegations, will be&mdash; and, in fact, are already being&mdash;investigated in so far as it is possible to do so on the basis of the published material.  While I would not prejudge the result of the investigation of any particular allegation, I am quite satisfied that, taking the allegations as a whole, they present a gross distortion of the position in the female prison. They amount, of course, to a serious reflection on the prison staff, and not <Col N="2133" /> just on the system, and have been so interpreted by the staff who have expressed to me personally their strong resentment, a resentment which is all the more understandable when the number of staff is so small that allegations of this kind hurt each one personally. I, therefore, am glad to take this opportunity to say publicly that I am in no doubt that the staff of this prison are not as they are depicted in these articles but, on the contrary, that they deserve the praise that has been given to them from many disinterested quarters.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, true that the prison itself is old and unsatisfactory.  One of my first official acts as Minister for Justice was to decide that steps should be taken to acquire a suitable site for a new prison.  Three sites have, each in turn, since been considered for acquisition but for a variety of reasons, none of them proved suitable on full consideration.  However, as I indicated recently, I now have good reason to believe that a suitable site will be available in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I should add that several months ago special measures were taken to re-equip the kitchens in all our prisons and also in Saint Patrick's Institution and in Shanganagh Castle.  A new kitchen has, in fact, since been provided for the women prisoners and is now in operation.  Apart from facilitating the better preparation and serving of food, it will have the important benefit of providing facilities for teaching basic cooking skills to the many prisoners who had not themselves the opportunity to acquire them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 to 48, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The position relating to the monitoring of telephone calls has been explained in Dáil Éireann at various times over the past 22 years by Ministers in reply to Parliamentary Questions and it is clear, therefore, that there can be no possible ground for anybody claiming that the operation of such a system is not common public knowledge.  What I understand to have been the first of these questions was answered as long ago as 15th December, 1949 (Volume 118, column 2380) and, so that nobody may be taken unawares, I mention in passing that the reply on that occasion was given by the present Leader of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His reply stated that such monitoring took place in very exceptional cases where the public interest required it and then only in obedience to warrants issued by the Minister for Justice. The same is true today but the procedures in operation today to guard against any unnecessary or unjustified <Col N="2138" /> use of the system are even more stringent than those that were in operation then.  On this point I would refer the House to my reply of 4th June, 1970 (Volume 247, column 565) which set out in detail the procedures adopted by me.  I have maintained these procedures since.</P>
    <P>The question of the legal authority has also been raised on a number of occasions, of which the first appears to have been on 20th November, 1957 (Volume 164, column 711), when the then Minister for Justice, dealing with a question that related to letters and telegrams as well as to telephone calls, replied to the effect that interceptions were made on the authority of the Minister for Justice in exercise of a long-standing power recognised in section 56 of the Post Office Act, 1908. I invite attention to the fact that what was said was that the power was recognised by the section, not that it was granted by it.  The position, as far as I am concerned, is that the legal advice available to me is that the present practice is perfectly in order.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of allegations affecting particular cases, the position is that, since these latest allegations were made, I have stated specifically, in public, on radio and television, that no warrants have been issued by me in respect of any Member of the Oireachtas.  The similar assurance given by the Taoiseach in this House on 9th May, 1970 (Volume 246, column 1332) was expressly declared to be limited to that occasion only and, in repeating it on this present occasion, I consider that I am going further than is strictly necessary.  I am not prepared to extend the assurance to other categories of persons or to any organisation or group whatsoever.  Initially, I was inclined to think that there might be something to be said for the proposition that an assurance given in respect of Members of the Oireachtas could, without leaving the way open for further extensions, reasonably be widened to include the headquarters telephones of the political parties to which these Members belong, and thus to the head office of the Labour Party. The issue was, however, quickly and <Col N="2139" /> conclusively settled as far as I was concerned by a letter sent to me by the Labour Party&mdash;with, I might mention, full Press publicity&mdash;the substance of which was that the officers of the Party sought not only an assurance that the telephone of the head office was not being tapped but also a separate assurance that the telephones of party officers or members of their National Executive were not tapped. This request illustrates better than any statement of mine why, if I were to extend beyond Members of the Oireachtas the assurance that has already been given, there would be demands to extend it further and further.</P>
    <P>There was a specific allegation that I had signed a warrant in respect of Deputy Thornley's telephone.  That allegation is untrue.  Apart from that specific allegation, about which there can be no ambiguity, it has been suggested that, though I have said that no warrants have been issued by me in respect of Members of the Oireachtas, their telephones may be tapped irregularly by or at the behest of some members of the Garda Síochána.  I want therefore to state categorically that I have long since inquired into such a possibility and I am satisfied that the system is such as to exclude it.</P>
    <P>It has been emphasised, time and again, that warrants are issued only where this is necessary for security purposes or for the prevention or detection of serious crime, information as to which could be got in no other way. They have been issued by every Minister for Justice, and with the knowledge and approval of every Government, since the foundation of the State.  It follows that each and every Government have accepted that this was necessary in the public interest and those whose duty it is to act under these warrants are discharging a duty of national importance.  The only difference between present practice and the practice that had obtained down the years before my appointment is that I introduced additional safeguards.  I am not implying, by this, that my predecessors in office were in any way lax in the issuing of warrants.  The evidence <Col N="2140" /> available to me is that all of them, including those from both the Opposition parties, exercised these powers in a responsible way.  The additional safeguards that I introduced are primarily designed to ensure that warrants are not allowed to remain in force even by inadvertence for any period beyond what is seriously necessary.  I am satisfied that they achieve that objective and that the present system has all the safeguards that could be in any way necessary or appropriate.  This being so, I see no reason to consider the appointment of a commission to deal with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated in his reply that power was recognised under a section of the Act, but not granted to him.  Could he elaborate on that?  What precise statutory authority has he?  This all seems extraordinarily vague and, because of the seriousness of telephone tapping, would the Minister elaborate on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that there is no statutory authority for telephone tapping in the sense that there is no specific section of an Act dealing with telephone tapping, but there is a general residual common law power for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the seriousness of such a security practice which, we know, is carried on and has been carried on by successive Governments, and because of the issue of civil rights and the need to protect the liberty of the individual, would the Minister not think that there should be separate legislation giving specific authority?  It is not enough for the Minister to depend on residual statutory powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think what the Deputy suggests is necessary.  Both the Taoiseach and I have set out the safeguards.  Indeed, my predecessors set them out in great detail.  I am satisfied the power could not be abused. <Col N="2141" /> I should like to emphasise that the Minister for Justice cannot initiate the procedure; in other words, the request must be initiated elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one final supplementary. I have two questions down. I do not accept the Minister's statement that he does not initiate the procedure. He can always ring up and they will ring back and ask him.  Could I ask the Minister why Members of this House should receive a special public assurance?  Why should they be above the law?  Why this special assurance given to Deputies that their telephones are not being tapped?  Why should we have this assurance and every other citizen be denied it?  Have I the Minister's assurance that, if I ring the head office of the Labour Party, the telephone will not be tapped as, otherwise, quite frankly, I think we have an extraordinary political situation?</P>

      <P>So far as individuals and organisations outside of this House are concerned, I have been asked time and again to give assurances in respect of them.  I have explained time and again why I cannot do that.  I cannot make any change in that position now. So far as assurances in relation to Members of the Oireachtas are concerned, the assurance was given for the first time by the Taoiseach and, I think, by me in the same debate on 9th May, 1970, as a result of allegations made by several Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

From time to time allegations have been made by various parties that telephones have been tapped and, because in the opinion of the Taoiseach and in my opinion also, it would be reprehensible to tap the telephone of one's political opponent for political purposes, the assurance was given.</P>

      <P>I am not altogether opposed to that suggestion but in my own experience I have had to sign some of these warrants at very, very short notice indeed and it might simply not be feasible to have a judge countersign. I do not want to enter into an argument on this because the point is really academic but, if prosecutions were to arise out of evidence secured through this operation, considerable problems might arise for the courts.</P>

      <P>In view of that highly unsatisfactory answer by the Minister to Deputy FitzGerald may I say that the Minister quoted replies given to previous Parliamentary Questions on this subject, but he did not quote the reply given by Deputy Haughey, Minister for Justice, to a Parliamentary Question on telephone tapping on 23rd April, 1964.  The reply is as follows:</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to section 56 of the Post Office Act, 1908 as to which an Adaptation Order was made by the President of the Executive Council on 19th July, 1926, under subsection (2) of section 11 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, determining that the Minister for Justice is the appropriate Minister to exercise this function of issuing postal warrants.</P>
      <P>Is this not the point?  Could the Minister tell us now what statutory powers he has in respect of telephone tapping as opposed to this common law assumption that telephone tapping has the same status as postal warrants?</P>

Will he not give the Labour Party the assurance requested, therefore? Finally, would the Minister not agree that&mdash;I do not possess his knowledge of the law and I do not know what his knowledge of technology is&mdash; when he says that it is impossible to tap a telephone in Ireland without his written warrant, this is simple nonsense, that it is child's play?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the first supplementary first, it does presuppose that the telephone in the office of the Labour Party is tapped.  I do not think the Deputy is entitled to make that presupposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question presupposes it and if I were to answer it on the lines I might have been expected to answer, it would make that presupposition. With regard to the fact that I say a phone cannot be tapped without my authority&mdash;and it is perfectly clear from my reply&mdash;I mean that no servant of the State legally and properly can tap a phone without my legal authority.  But there is nothing to stop any individual who has nothing <Col N="2145" /> whatever to do with the Garda Síochána or the Post Office or the service of the State, with the modern gadgets they have now, from listening, I gather.</P>

While the number of prosecutions for such offences brought by other members of the Garda is not available, I understand that the figure would, in fact, be substantial.  I think, therefore, that it is clear that the Garda are giving a good deal of attention to the problem.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are at least 27 English registered lorries operating at the moment at Dublin Docks and that these are not taxed?  Is he aware that this matter has been brought to the attention of the Garda in the area?  Some summonses have been brought but these have been quashed.  I can give the Minister the numbers of four of the vehicles concerned and by the end of the week I can let him have additional numbers.  If this practice is to be allowed to continue the people here who are paying heavy road tax will decide eventually that they are as entitled to operate in this way as are these other people.</P>

In my reply to a previous question on this matter on 4th November, 1971, Volume 256, No. 7, column 128, I gave the information sought at (a), (b) and (d) of the question in respect of seven of these raids.  That information still stands except that in the case where two men had been arrested and charged, informations <Col N="2158" /> were refused in the case of one and the other, who was returned for trial, was found not guilty by a jury.  Three further raids occurred&mdash;one on 10th January and two on 11th January, 1972&mdash;but, to-date, no one has been arrested in connection with them.  As I indicated in my earlier reply, details of the amount of explosives stolen are not given as I consider that to do so would reveal information regarding the disposition of stocks.</P>

Could the Minister explain, then, how there have been continued raids apparently on guarded stocks of gelignite in various parts of the country?  Would he now assure the House that there will be a police escort in respect of gelignite because nothing short of that will satisfy the people, bearing in mind the number of lives that have been lost as a result of the Minister's failure to control stocks of gelignite?</P>

There was one recent serious raid in which, I regret to say, the instructions which were laid down clearly were not followed by the persons concerned.

    <P>This was not accurate but the inaccuracy <Col N="2162" /> was of no consequence because, first of all, the man had in fact complained about the garda to the garda's superior officer, and there is no difference as far as the garda is concerned between that and a complaint to my Department; and, secondly, the man has admitted, in a letter to my Department, that he told the superintendent that he was going to complain to my Department.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but this is subject to clarification as to what is involved.  The reduction in strength of Lusk Garda station was combined with a reduction in the area serviced by that station, a reduction which involved the transfer of the Donabate/Portrane area from Lusk sub-district to Swords.  Of three gardaí transferred from Lusk, two were transferred to Swords to increase the strength of that station and the third was transferred to the district headquarters. This reorganisation was made on the recommendation of the gardaí themselves in the interests of the better policing of the entire area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the reduced area now served by the Lusk station, the number of indictable crimes increased from eight in 1970 to 36 in 1971.  Having regard to the substantial reduction in the area serviced by the station and to a number of other factors such as a general increase in crime, it is by no means certain that there is any element of cause-and-effect relationship between the reorganisation and the increased crime in the smaller area, but, on the face of it, it seems that this may be the case and that a review is necessary.  In <Col N="2163" /> any event, the arrangements for policing the area will be reviewed shortly in the light of the substantial increase in garda strength that is now being effected.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not say by how much crime had increased. I have been assured locally that it has increased by 60 per cent.  In the course of his reply the Minister said that the reduction was as a result of representations from the gardaí themselves.  It certainly was not the gardaí in the station at the time.  They were against it and the local people resisted it very strongly, as the Minister will recall.</P>

I am not saying that it was done on the representations of the gardaí but the methods of reorganisation were on their recommendation.</P>

This principle is accepted in the Extradition Act, 1965, under which Irish citizens as well as others may be extradited to other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past six months, there was only one case where assistance was given by the Garda Síochána in the prosecution of offences in foreign courts.  Since the Deputy has already referred in this House to that case and argued that it was wrong that such assistance should be given in a case where the alleged offence was <Col N="2164" /> politically motivated, I would like to say that I accept the proposition that this is a relevant factor and that the giving of assistance in such a case would at least require special consideration and would be refused as a rule.  However, this was a most exceptional case in that the alleged offence involved a major attempt to smuggle arms into Cobh in breach of the law of this State, though for legal reasons that I do not propose to go into, the people concerned could not be made amenable here.  Arising out of the incident however, people were arrested in England.</P>
    <P>Given the fact that what was attempted was primarily an attempt to contravene the law of this State in a most serious way and in circumstances in which prosecutions would certainly have been brought here if that were possible, we would clearly be stultifying ourselves if we then adopted the attitude that the Garda Síochána would refuse to give any assistance.</P>
    <P>Essentially, therefore, the issue in this case was whether or not we were prepared to condone an effort to smuggle substantial quantities of arms into Cobh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from the end of the Minister's reply that the non-collaboration of our police force with the British police in this case would be a condoning of an attempt to smuggle arms.  Since the attempt had already been foiled, how does the Minister square this with his statement that the non-cooperation of the English courts to prosecute Irishmen for attempting to bring in arms would be a condoning of arms being brought in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This would appear to be a serious breach of our law inasmuch as the arms were being brought into this part of the country.  We regard this as a serious matter and we cannot condone it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we not overlooking the precept that all are innocent until proved guilty?  The prosecution was taken by the English courts and the English police and we proceeded to assist them, no doubt on the basis that we had these people convicted in <Col N="2165" /> our minds prior to their coming before the courts.  I put it to the Minister that there is a very strong belief, which I as well as others hold from information I have received, that there was an assurance sought and an assurance given in this case either by himself, on his behalf or by the Attorney General that no witnesses or material evidence would be produced by our police in those English courts to further the prosecution of these two Irishmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly gave no such assurance and I am not aware that anybody else gave any such assurance.  There are no records from which the information sought could be obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister whether the long-standing decision that no collaboration would be forthcoming from the forces or the servants of this State in the prosecution of any persons on political charges associated with the Northern situation has been reversed or rescinded and has a new decision been taken that we will aid and abet and collaborate in the prosecution of people charged with political offences across the Channel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the terms used are, perhaps, unnessarily emotive, but as I made clear in my reply, if there is any question of an offence being politically motivated, the normal procedure has been and remains that the police in this part of the country do not give assistance.  I also pointed out that this proposition is a relevant factor and that the giving of such assistance would at least require special consideration and would, as a rule, be refused.  I went on to point out that this was a most exceptional case.  Of course, I have no evidence to show that the very large quantity of arms which were brought into Cobh were destined for use in any particular place outside the jurisdiction.  I would draw the House's attention to the provisions of the Firearms Act, 1971, which makes it clear that certain offences would be committed irrespective of where the proposed user of firearms might be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the fees payable in the Land Registry which are the only costs in transactions in registered land over which I have direct control. The Land Registry fees are fixed by statutory order on the basis that, as required by section 14 (2) of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, the fees should produce an annual amount sufficient to pay for the running of the Land Registry.  I have no power to waive those fees either in individual cases or for particular classes of persons. However, I would point out that in the type of case mentioned, where the title to land has not been kept in order for many years, the Land Registry fees are generally very small. For example, for registration of transmission on death where the rateable valuation of the land is £20 the fee is £4.50, and where the rateable valuation <Col N="2167" /> is £40, the fee is £6.  The maximum fee in any such case is £9 and that is where the rateable valuation of the land exceeds £80.  Indeed, where the registered owner died before the 1st June, 1959, no fee at all is payable in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>As the reply to the first part of the question is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to circulate it in the Official Report. No particular limit has been set to recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force during 1972.  It is anticipated, however, that the national recruiting campaign now commencing will result in an intake of about 1,500 men by the end of April next and that a further 1,500 will be recruited before the end of March, 1973.  No recruitment is undertaken in the case of the Reserve First Line.  Recruitment to An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and to An Slua Muirí is a continuing process and special measures to stimulate the normal flow of recruits to them are not at present contemplated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that a period of over 20 years has elapsed since the introduction of this type of gratuity and that when I spoke on the Defence Estimate for 1971-72 the Minister for Defence promised to review the situation?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary now inform the House when we can expect a decision on an upper adjustment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it has been in excess of 20 years since the last increase in the gratuity was made.  Recommendations for increased gratuities were submitted to the Department of Finance on 3rd February, 1971.  In its third report, dated 17th January, 1972, the working party on army pay and allowances recommended increases in the gratuity with effect from 1st January, 1971.  Therefore, I should imagine there will be a decision in the not-too-distant future.  I am not trying to evade the issue and I believe the gratuity should be paid as soon as possible.  That is as far as I can go at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 76 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>The number of officers in the Naval Service at present is 35, 22 of whom have sea-going qualifications.  Six of these are, however, engineer officers for whom no appointment exists in the establishment for the minesweepers and of whom only one is likely to be required to fill a sea-going appointment on L.E. <i>Deirdre</i>.  Of the remaining 16, three officers who fill senior appointments in the Naval Service would not be available for sea-going duties.</P>
      <P>The officer complement of each of the three minesweepers of the Naval Service is four.  That of the L.E. <i>Deirdre</i> has not yet been decided.  As I have indicated in reply to recent questions, there is a shortage of executive branch officers in the Naval Service and Press, television and radio advertisements have been arranged which offer attractive new and improved remuneration and gratuities for temporary executive branch officers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <P>I think that imbalance will be taken care of to a great degree in the near future.  Sea-going and the tradition of the sea might be described as a vocation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Conditions in the Naval Service and in the Army cannot be compared rank for rank as the functions of the two services and the nature of their operations are quite different.  As regards remuneration, the basic rates of pay are the same for corresponding Army and Naval ranks, but all non-commissioned personnel of the Naval Service receive pay at the rate of 22p a day in addition to their basic pay.  All officers and ratings of the Naval Service are paid a sea-going allowance of 33p a day while serving abroad ship.</P>
      <P>It has recently been decided that all qualified executive branch officers of the Naval Service shall receive marine pay at the rate of £329 a year with effect from 1st January, 1972.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no power to make such regulations.  The Local Government (Sanitary Service) Acts empower sanitary authorities to make appropriate provision for the disposal of waste and refuse in their areas, to take action against persons responsible for dumping matter which may be a nuisance or injurious to health, to make by-laws for the prevention of nuisances arising from the deposit of refuse and to take special steps in the case of material brought to their dumps which may be toxic or otherwise dangerous. The enforcement of these powers is a matter for the sanitary authorities.  Furthermore, in the grant of planning permission under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, a condition may be attached in relation to the disposal of waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the disposal of solid toxic wastes represents any serious problem in this country at the present <Col N="2187" /> time but I am aware that the disposal of such wastes may give rise to problems with the increase in industrialisation and mining activities and it is my intention that the matter will be kept under review.</P>

It is an offence to create litter in any public place and an offender is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £10.  Legislation in itself is not, however, sufficient to control the problem of litter. The co-operation of the general public is essential to the success of anti-litter measures.</P>

      <P>The formulation of measures to ease traffic congestion in city and suburban areas is a matter in the first instance for each local authority concerned.  My Department has urged these authorities to proceed with both short and long term plans for urban road improvements, in harmony with their development plans, with the assurance that such funds as can progressively be made available will be applied to the implementation of these plans.  To assist them in drawing up road plans to meet current and future needs, a number of urban authorities have had traffic studies carried out by specialist road traffic consultants.  The reports on these studies are under consideration by the authorities concerned.  A number of recommendations have been or are in the process of being implemented.</P>
      <P>In general, action is proposed on a number of fronts.  First, priority is given to traffic management measures to secure the maximum use of existing streets.  Construction programmes for the improvement of existing street networks are concurrently being planned and where such schemes can be shown to provide worthwhile results in relieving traffic congestion, they will receive special consideration in my Department within the limit of the available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As has already been indicated, in reply to previous Parliamentary questions on the subject, the illumination of pedestrian crossings can best be achieved by the provision of public lighting to traffic route standards.  In the Dublin area improved public lighting is being provided by Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, with the emphasis on the radial routes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not necessary. One can easily see the flashing beacon. I am a pretty careful driver and I often find it difficult to see a person on the crossing, particularly at Swords village where there is a pedestrian crossing in the middle of the village. That is so badly lighted that it is impossible to see a person on the crossing until one is right beside him.  There are a number of those throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply. in introducing improvements to the street lighting system priority is given to areas where pedestrian crossings exist.  Those areas should be improved first if it is possible to do it in the course of carrying out a programme of work.  Secondly, we are reluctant to erect new pedestrian crossings where the existing lighting is inadequate and where it is not expected that this can be improved within a reasonable time of the provision of the pedestrian crossing. This question of adequate lighting of pedestrian crossings is a matter of very great importance and it is something on which we are keeping a close eye.  If there are special cases where lighting is not adequate at the moment, I can only say that we hope to improve the position as quickly as possible within the resources available to us but if there are any particularly bad ones that the Deputy might know of similar to the one that he mentioned, we will have a look at them because, as an interim arrangement, we have erected special lights on some pedestrian crossings where we felt this might be useful but, generally, it creates other problems in that it encourages the pedestrian to have a greater sense of safety than he might otherwise have and not to be as careful as he otherwise might be.  If the area of the crossing is specially lit it may be very clear to him but it might not be so clear to oncoming drivers in certain driving conditions.  It is a matter that is being considered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will consider providing an outside telephone kiosk in the following areas in Donegal: Culdaff, Malin, Gleneely, Clonmany, Ballyliffin; and if he will also arrange for a 24-hour telephone service for the Malin area.</P>

      <P>
        <b>(Mr. G. Collins):</b> A kiosk is likely to be provided at Culdaff under the kiosk programme for the coming financial year.  Provision of kiosks at Malin and Ballyliffin is not warranted at present but kiosks will probably be provided in both places later on under the extended rural kiosk programme. The call office telephone at Gleneely and Clonmany are little used and provision of a kiosk at either place is not contemplated.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a 24-hour telephone service at Malin exchange is not considered warranted at present.  A number of subscribers have continuous service by means of switching to Carndonagh exchange when Malin is closed and several more can be similarly accommodated.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 22nd February, 1972.</P>
