      <P>Investigations have been made by a committee in regard <Col N="330" /> to the possibility of providing standards.  At the moment a representative from the three Departments, Industry and Commerce, Health and Agriculture and Fisheries are proceeding to draft the heads for a food standards Bill, but in relation to this we want to keep in line with what is being done in the EEC on the matter. Therefore, it is unlikely that such a Bill would come before the House for some time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter was eventually deferred after a long examination of the question.  The committee did not go on with the question of compositional standards for sausages, for this raised the whole question of the future departmental responsibility for food standards, and it was felt that the matter should be tackled <i>in globo</i> and not on the basis of dealing with one particular product which was issued to the committee as an experiment, as a try-on.  This also related to negotiations we had, the Codex Alimentarius proceedings, for establishing codes in regard to this matter abroad, so between one thing and another the Ministers for the three Departments felt there should be a substantive Bill prepared in regard to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together. I am aware of the statement referred to by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>Following the decision in July, 1971 of Normandy Ferries to withdraw their ship from the route, I explored with the two State shipping companies and Bord Fáilte as a matter of urgency the possibility of a resumption of the service on this route as early as possible. The withdrawal of the Normandy Ferry vessels without prior consultation had been a severe blow to our tourist trade and Bord Fáilte and the Regional Tourism Organisations were pressing for the restoration of the service in 1972.</P>
      <P>The possibility of including the route in the ferry services operated by the B &amp; I was considered but all concerned were agreed that the B &amp; I Ferries, designed for cross-Channel operation, were not adequate to meet the needs of a continental service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Shipping Ltd. examined the possibility of building a new car ferry, for which Verolme would doubtless have got the order, but the type of ship which the company considered essential for the route was estimated to cost from £5 million to £6 million and the operation of such a service by Irish Shipping alone would <Col N="332" /> have involved unacceptably high losses.  Moreover, the vessel would not have been available before 1974 and apart from the loss to the tourist interest in Ireland in the intervening period, the market developed in connection with the operation of the Normandy Ferries service would be further seriously damaged.  After consideration of all the alternatives, it was finally concluded that the only practical hope of resuming a car ferry service from Rosslare to the Continent on a reasonably economic basis was for Irish Shipping Ltd. to seek a new arrangement with suitable partners on the lines of the previous agreement with Normandy Ferries, with the safeguard that the Irish company should secure a substantial financial stake in the enterprise in order to ensure that service could not again be withdrawn unilaterally.</P>
    <P>I should say that the specifications of the ship which Verolme offered to build were not considered adequate for this service.  It would have cabin accommodation with berths for 260 passengers mainly below car deck and couchettes for an additional 120.  Cabin accommodation below car deck level is an unsatisfactory arrangement for the proposed service.  The accommodation for 350 passengers on the Normandy Ferries vessel was found to be insufficient.  Irish Shipping Ltd. consider that it is necessary for a service of this kind to offer cabin accommodation of a high standard for upwards of 500 passengers.</P>
    <P>In the course of their inquiries, Irish Shipping Ltd. got into contact with Lion Ferry, Sweden, and the Norwegian shipping company, Fearnley and Egers, who were prepared to consider entering into arrangements with them for the provision of a car ferry service between Rosslare and the Continent using a vessel for delivery from a German yard in early 1973 on which the Swedish company held an option. This vessel would provide cabin accommodation of a high standard, including shower and toilet in most cabins, for 540 passengers and would be very suitable for operation of the proposed service.  The contract price for the ship completed to agreed specifications <Col N="333" /> was £4.25 million.  This low price was due to the fact that this was a sister ship to one already in operation with Lion Ferry for which working drawings and berth were available. I am assured that the present cost of such a ship would otherwise be well in excess of £5 million.</P>
    <P>The interest of the two foreign companies in participating in a service from Rosslare is, of course, related directly to the use of this ship and there is no question of their being involved in such a service using any other ship.  These companies wished to retain majority control in the joint enterprise but Irish Shipping have succeeded in securing participation on a 50/50 basis so as to obviate the possibility that this ship could be unilaterally withdrawn from the service as happened with Normandy Ferries.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping consider that the proposed investment on the basis of the price of this ship can be economically justified but it is not, of course, without substantial risk and would not be contemplated but for the urgent necessity of sustaining and expanding tourism from the Continent especially in present circumstances.  In this context, the availability of the ship for the 1973 season is of major importance. These arrangements, in fact, offer the only prospect of getting the continental car ferry service back into operation as early as 1973 and without serious losses.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that what is at issue is not simply a matter of placing an order abroad rather than with Verolme dockyard.  Indeed, the only acceptable alternative to the arrangement now made would not have been to order a new vessel from Verolme but to abandon the car ferry service between Ireland and the Continent for the present at any rate.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited and the B &amp; I are at my request urgently examining the possibilities of placing orders with Verolme for the building of new cargo vessels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if it is correct to say Verolme were not asked to tender?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This is a particular service arrangement reached for the purpose of resuming the car ferry service between Rosslare and Le Havre as quickly as possible.  The other matter is being urgently examined and discussions are taking place between Verolme and the B &amp; I with a view to placing contracts with both of these State-sponsored organisations and that should ensure the continuation of work at the dockyard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any reason why the only shipbuilding firm in the State was not asked if it was interested in this order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw a distinction here between actual shipbuilding and getting a car ferry service going between Ireland and the Continent. I sought to get my priorities right in this respect in view of the representations made by Deputy Corish and other Deputies and to ensure that the Rosslare-Le Havre service would be resumed as quickly as possible and the most effective way to do that was this 50/50 service arrangement by contract for a ship that was ready to start construction with a view to getting the service going in 1973.  The shipbuilding aspect is a separate matter and Irish Shipping has a substantial bulk cargo vessel which they must build and construction of this is being negotiated between Irish Shipping and Verolme and the B &amp; I have another vessel which they require and that also is being discussed and negotiated with Verolme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that Verolme were never even asked to tender in connection with this £2.4 million contract.  They had to take a shot in the dark in the hope of getting a tender and this £2.4 million could have been spent in Cork.  With regard to general policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>Current land settlement policy is that holdings and enlargements are planned to provide family farms of 40 to 45 acres of good land or the equivalent in land of mixed quality. All applicants with holdings below that level, including any which may have previously been enlarged, are eligible for consideration for additional land.</P>
      <P>As regards the allocation of lands on hands before our accession to EEC, I would refer the Deputy to my reply on 22nd February, 1972, to Question No. 39, Volume 260, columns 31 and 32.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to furnish this information in the form requested by the Deputy.  Moneys are made available to local authorities for the purchase of building sites in a number of ways, directly by capital allocations &mdash;which may be drawn by way of loan from the Local Loans Fund or from other sources such as treasurers or insurance companies, or by the use of internal resources, such as capital receipts from the sale of property&mdash;or indirectly by subsidising loan charges on housing schemes for which land acquisition charges are normally included in the appropriate scheme loans. It would be impracticable to give details for each local authority of the amounts of such moneys, as no separate records are kept of the proportion of such loans or subsidies which has been applied to land acquisition.  Separate loans are made available from time to time for the forward acquisition of land which may be used for housing schemes, private building sites or for other purposes such as amenity schemes, open spaces and so on.  Such loans are raised over repayment periods varying from seven to 50 years.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to Question No. 160 on 25th November, 1971, a design for this scheme, which will serve 30 houses by way of an extension of the county council mains, was approved subject to the use of increased pipe sizes to enable it to be integrated into the regional network.  Some further modifications have been found necessary so that the scheme can be incorporated into the public network.  The council are prepared to contribute towards the extra cost involved and the group has been advised to seek quotations for the work on the revised basis.</P>

      <P>Rating authorities are obliged to levy a rate which will produce sufficient revenue to bridge the gap between projected expenditure and anticipated income from State grants and miscellaneous receipts.  While rates must be assessed on the valuation, appearing in the annual lists prepared by the Commissioner of Valuation, rating authorities are empowered to adopt schemes for waiver of rates in the case of persons on whom payment would impose hardship.</P>
      <P>The increase in the municipal rate would be higher if the full cost of housing maintenance, which has been rising sharply in recent years, were to be borne by the rates.  To obviate this the local authority decided to meet a small part of the rising costs by increasing the rents of some pre-1950 houses by 4p per room per week.  I am aware from Press reports that tenants are being encouraged from certain quarters to withhold rents.  As the management and control of their dwellings is primarily the responsibility of the local authority, I do not propose to comment further on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="363" /> for Local Government whether he is satisfied with the administration of the planning law or whether an inquiry into its operation might be in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that criticisms in regard to the operation of planning law have been made from time to time.  This is not surprising. The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, is a farreaching measure involving extensive control over development and affecting property rights accordingly.  A general look at the kind of criticisms that have been made and at the results of the operation of the Act, suggests that in all the circumstances the Act has operated reasonably satisfactorily to achieve its objectives for the proper planning and development of urban and rural areas and the preservation of amenities.  As I have informed the House on previous occasions, the question of proposals for amending the Act is being reviewed and this review is taking account of the criticisms to which I have referred.  I do not consider that an inquiry into the operation of the Act is necessary.</P>
      <P>The administration of the Act is primarily the responsibility of the planning authorities.  As to the making of development plans, these have now been in operation in most areas for some time and many planning authorities are at present engaged in the first review of their plans.  In this review they will no doubt take account of their experience of the operation of the existing plans and as far as possible seek to cure any defects.</P>
      <P>As to planning control, those who fail to secure planning permission will in general feel badly about the operation of the Act.  Any system of control involves restrictions on property owners and a time element to deal with them.  Nevertheless, the number of complaints is quite low and they relate to specific cases or specific authorities.</P>
      <P>Enforcement is a further aspect which is also the responsibility of the planning authorities, but, of course, the courts are concerned as well.  Enforcement of any Act has its problems, and that of planning law is no exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> On the whole, where there is a clear breach of the Act, planning authorities have not hesitated to take the matter to court.</P>
    <P>So far as my own responsibility is concerned, I have taken steps to reduce delays in dealing with planning appeals and the backlog of cases has been reduced considerably.  I have arranged that my Department and An Foras Forbartha afford the maximum assistance possible to the planning authorities to help them to discharge their functions more effectively.  The steps taken include advice and guidance to the planning authorities by way of circular letters and conferences, seminars and discussions to assist their staffs, the commissioning of various studies to help them.  I have also had the question of staff shortages kept under constant review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally they are taken in the order in which they are received, but shortly after going to the Department, in order to accelerate the housing drive, I issued a recommendation to the inspectors that they should deal as quickly as possible with proposals for housing schemes containing 50 or more houses.  I felt it was unfair to the community, to those waiting for homes, that their planning appeals should be delayed if it was possible to deal with them earlier than was the practice up to then.  That was only a recommendation but, generally, it can be taken that appeals are dealt with in the order in which they come in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree in relation to appeals that it is important that not only should justice be done but that it should appear to be done?  In relation to the question tabled by Deputy Blaney, would the Minister not consider that arrangements should be made now to provide that there be public consideration given to all appeals?  When the Minister says some appeals are so simple and clear that they can be dealt with quickly, I might ask by whom?  Of course, they are dealt with by the Minister's staff. Those concerned with an appeal get an intimation that the appeal has either been allowed or refused.  There may be a very proper decision but people would like to feel they had proper consideration given to their appeals. Would the Minister not reconsider the Fine Gael proposal that there should be an open and public hearing of all appeals?</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. As regards the second part, the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to <Col N="369" /> 1971, give the RTE Authority complete freedom regarding programme content, subject to special obligations imposed by sections 17 and 18 of the Act of 1960.

The Minister has general responsibilities in regard to broadcasting and he is free to&mdash;and may indeed at times have an obligation to&mdash;express views to RTE regarding programmes already broadcast or due to be broadcast. Any other Minister or Deputy, or any citizen, can also express their views to RTE.  Except in the case of matters covered by the directive already mentioned, the authority are of course quite free to decide what weight should be attached to any representations about programmes, irrespective of who makes them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, in connection with the supply granted for the years ended 31st March, 1971, and 31st March, 1972, the Dáil takes note of the activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>This motion has been put down in order to give the Dáil an opportunity of debating the affairs of my Department since it did not prove possible to debate, at the time when they were taken, the Estimates for which I am responsible.  It has over the years been customary to catalogue and list in detail my Department's activities and I feel that in this way we sometimes pass over too quickly some general considerations in regard to our position as a nation in the world.</P>
      <P>We are, however, living through a time at present which forces us more and more to face basic issues.  We are considering the very basis and origin of our State and considering in a very fundamental way our relations with neighbouring countries.</P>
      <P>I believe, therefore, that I should speak on this motion in broader terms than in the usual Estimates debate and consider the more basic issues in our foreign relations.  Three issues&mdash;the assertion of its identity, the recognition of that identity by others, and the promotion and development of exchanges with other nations&mdash;are basic aspects of any country's relations with the world.  In our case because each has been emphasised at a particular stage in our history as a State they have been, in a sense, the major issues in our foreign relations.  They cannot in themselves be described as our &ldquo;foreign policy&rdquo;.  They indicate rather the general aim and direction of our foreign relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well, I think, to recognise that <Col N="385" /> the foreign policy properly so called of an Irish Government at any particular time is not a single attitude or a simply stated principle or slogan.  It is the sum of a whole series of actions and decisions at Government level in a wide variety of exchanges&mdash;political, trade and economic, social and cultural. These exchanges take place with a variety of other nations and they vary widely in their importance to us.</P>
    <P>Because our relation to the world is not a single attitude but a network of contacts of every kind, we do not, for the most part, make great sweeping decisions on foreign policy in the abstract and then look to see if and how we will implement them.  Our decisions and actions are generally individual and concrete, related to specific issues.  We do give some overall policy direction to our foreign relations.  But for a small country like ours, the role of Government is not to try to impose a grand &ldquo;foreign policy design&rdquo;.  It is rather to steer and develop our many existing contacts in accordance with some general ideas of what we stand for and what we want to achieve.</P>
    <P>In such decisions, no Government is wholly free in regard to the policies it chooses to follow.  It is limited, on the one hand because no Government can, or would want to, act against the general attitudes, and beliefs of their people; and on the other hand, because any Government must take account of its geographic, economic and political situation in the world. Both set limits to what we can do.  We do not live or act in a vaccum.  We have a range of choice but like every other country&mdash;particularly every other small country&mdash;what we are really free to do is subject to limitations and constraints.</P>
    <P>If we accept these two points&mdash;that our policies cannot be a single grand design and that our freedom to act has certain limits&mdash;we still have a considerable area of choice in foreign affairs.  Beyond the basic issues of asserting our identity as a nation and having this recognised by others, there are other general principles which we must follow in developing our relations with the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> There are three factors which we take into account in our dealings with other countries: one, direct national interest; two, a feeling of concern for common or community interests among nations; three, a due regard for certain values, attitudes and concerns which are basic to our society and culture, and by which our people would wish us to act.</P>
    <P>Any Irish Government must try to act in their country's own national interest.  There is nothing wrong in this and we should not hesitate to accept it as other nations do as a basic principle.  It is the duty of Government to concern itself with the welfare of its own society and a people, however highminded their judgments in the abstract, or where distant problems are concerned, still judge issues largely in terms of national interest wherever this is deeply involved.</P>
    <P>But I would like to make one important qualification.  This is the second factor which we take into account.  We simply cannot define our interest any longer in purely selfish terms.  It is not merely that we should not do so; we cannot do so&mdash;because the world is such that a purely selfish concern does not serve our real interests.  We need a sense of common interest&mdash;if you like, a sense of community&mdash;in international relations in our own long-term interests.  It is the business of an enlightened Government approach to foreign affairs to accept this and see that it is more widely understood.  The need becomes obvious on reflection.</P>
    <P>In every area affecting our interests abroad, a realistic view will show that our people's welfare is directly dependent on how far relations of justice and order exist in the world with which we are dealing.</P>
    <P>To speak of &ldquo;justice&rdquo; and &ldquo;order&rdquo; is not simply to talk of highminded ideals but of very necessary conditions for the well-being of our own society. We cannot trade with benefit in a world which does not have a substantial degree of order and equity in trade relations.  We cannot deal with advantage in other economic exchanges in a world where each nation adopts narrow and unfairly restrictive <Col N="387" /> policies.  And we cannot survive at all as a nation if justice and order and peace in international political relations are not reasonably secure.  Even self-interest therefore requires us to encourage and to contribute, if we can, to a degree of a community between nations in all of these areas.  For this reason I consider a concern for community interest to be a second essential factor in our foreign policy decisions.</P>
    <P>So far I have spoken of &ldquo;interest&rdquo; and &ldquo;advantage&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is a third factor which we must also take into account.  If it is unrealistic to ignore our interests it would also be unrealistic <Col N="388" /> to speak only of interests and not to recognise that other, less pragmatic, motives also move us.  As a people we have certain fairly clear concepts of right and wrong in human relations. We believe that these values should apply to dealings between nations as well as between individuals.  We owe these moral values largely to basic religious beliefs which permeate our culture.  But we also have certain distinctive attitudes and sympathies which are shaped by our view of our own history&mdash;among them a strong fellow-feeling for any people who struggle to maintain their identity against greater force.  As a people we always felt, during our own troubled history, that when and if we attained to independence ourselves, we would try to bring these values and sympathies to our dealings with other nations.</P>
      <P>It is easy to be pretentious about this.  We must not deceive ourselves or exaggerate.  As a nation we are not necessarily more moral than others where our own direct interests are involved. Nor does our own historical experience necessarily make us more compassionate than others, where compassion requires more than mere sympathy.  But it would also be wrong to neglect these motives and to take an entirely pragmatic approach to our foreign relations.  These values and concerns are not necessarily well served by talking about them often and self-consciously. They are real to us.  They do play a part in our decisions; and, even where they are not our primary motivation, they do give us a healthy distrust of policies based entirely on power&mdash;the so-called <i>Realpolitik</i>&mdash; which so often proves mistaken in its neglect of the spirit and values of a people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pointed to three factors which a realistic view of our foreign relations must take into account.  In every one of the many issues which make up our foreign relations, our decisions will emerge from some combination of these three factors; and no Irish Government can conduct their foreign relations without giving due regard to each. In my view, therefore, any account of our foreign policies which does not deal with each, is either too narrow <Col N="389" /> and pragmatic, or too rhetorical and unrealistic.</P>
    <P>There is sometimes debate as to whether foreign policy matters should be decided by reference to abstract moral principles, on the one hand, or national interest, on the other, as if the latter were a purely selfish interest.  In my view, the antithesis is a false one. The welfare of one's fellowmen is involved in what serves the national interest as well as in dealings with other nations.  True morality in international relations, therefore, cannot be something abstract and wholly disinterested. It consists precisely in trying to give due weight to, and achieve proper balance between, the three factors to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Although our international relations must take account of all three factors, there are some issues where we have little option as to the weight to be given to each.  In many areas, however, we do have a choice.  We can decide which will predominate&mdash;immediate national interest as against common interest; more idealistic values as against interests of either kind.  And it is in these areas that limited but real foreign policy choices are open to any Government.</P>
    <P>I would make one further point which I consider of great importance. We are a democracy and a small and intimate one.  The Government can guide and lead on these issues and must at times take courageous decisions. But in the long run neither the Government, nor anyone in my place as Minister for Foreign Affairs, can or should go too far ahead of public opinion in our society, since we do not act in our own name but in that of the society.  We must do what we think right, but we are dependent ultimately on public sanction and support for what we do.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, the public wishes us on any issue to give greater weight to the moral values to which it holds, as against its immediate interests, then it is right for public opinion to make this concern clear through its articulate spokesmen&mdash;individuals, organisations of various kinds, churches and, not least, Opposition spokesmen here in the Dáil.  I do not say that the Government, <Col N="390" /> or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, can abdicate our duty to lead or to do what we think right, but foreign policies without public support will not have real and lasting effect. And our role in the world in the long run should reflect the values to which our society is really committed.</P>
    <P>How in practice do we carry these principles into effect?  Like most small countries we are not equally involved with every country or with every world issue.  In a sense, our relations with the world are a series of concentric circles of interest.  Those closest are usually, but not always, of greatest concern.  Importance is not always determined by geography or economic or power relations alone.  Sometimes less tangible factors such as concern or compassion will involve even a small country like ours in an otherwise distant issue.</P>
    <P>Within the first circle of interest, however, must always be our relations with our nearest, powerful neighbour Britain.  The question of our relations with Britain is almost too large and too vital to be considered as one among many.  In a sense, it involves the whole of our history, the whole of our effort to assert ourselves as a nation and find our national identity.  The long relationship of self-assertion in opposition to assimilation and domination, has deeply involved our two peoples with one another&mdash;economically, socially, by mutual migrations and intermarriage; and by similarity of political institutions.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that one major problem remains between our two countries, preventing a healthier relationship from developing, and breeding misunderstanding and at times ill-feeling. I refer, of course, to the Northern question.  The events of the past three and a half years, and of the past year in particular, have given us all pause, but the night is long that never finds the day.  We must believe that light is, at last, beginning to appear.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government on the North is, of course, primarily a matter for the Taoiseach.  I deal with it here only in so far as it directly affects our relations with another Government. <Col N="391" /> The effect on that relationship is close and immediate, and we have constantly tried in the interests of peace and justice and the general wellbeing of the two islands, to influence the British Government and people in regard to policies pursued by them, or in their name, in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have debated the North at length in the Dáil in recent months and I have frequently made plain my own views on what was happening there.  I reiterated those views in forthright terms during my recent visits to North America and Europe following the killings in Derry.  A forthright approach was warranted by the events.  My sole purpose was to try to bring home, both directly and through countries friendly to both of us, that the policies then being pursued in the North are simply not solving problems with which they were supposed to deal.  I should like to make it clear that on my visits to foreign countries I did not at any stage seek help against Britain.  What I asked for was that those countries which had good relations with both Britain and ourselves should quietly make their concern known.</P>
    <P>I was satisfied from the contacts I made that many governments who are well disposed to both our countries, were deeply concerned about the whole problem of the North.  It was not expected that they should intervene publicly and directly, but the feelings of deep concern which I know that many of them had were not, I feel, without influence.</P>
    <P>All of us, I think, would wish our relations with our near neighbour to be warm and friendly, as is natural between two countries who have been closely linked in so many ways.  The initiative taken by the British Government a few weeks ago is a step forward in seeking a lasting solution to the remaining problem in this historic relationship.</P>
    <P>There is freedom of movement and constant traffic between us.  There have been for many years exchanges, contacts and consultations at every level of Government and throughout <Col N="392" /> our social and political institutions. Britain is, and is likely to remain in the immediate future&mdash;even in the EEC&mdash;our most important supplier, our most important customer and our most important source of tourism and investment.</P>
    <P>We are Britain's third most important customer after the United States and Germany.  We are more important to her as a market even than France which has 16 times our population. And we are now likely to go into the European Communities together.</P>
    <P>It is a pity then that the problem of the fears and loyalties of the Unionist population of the North should come between us for so long.  There must surely be some better way of settling the old issues of relations between the people of these two islands, and some better way of meeting all the legitimate fears and concerns of the Unionist community.  Fifty years have, after all, taught us something&mdash;about the folly of trying to meet those fears in a way which brought separation and instability and also about the naturally easy and friendly relations which can exist between the peoples of the two islands when such relations are not subject to any constraints.  A solution reflecting the broader and more comprehensive national identity is, I believe, the only way to bring peace to Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards this first most vital circle of interest for our foreign relations, such a settlement would meet all three of the concerns to which I have referred. It would serve our national interest&mdash;not in a narrow sense but by bringing peace and stability at last to our island; it would serve our community of interest with Britain which is, and should be, real and close; and it would, I believe, promote values which are shared by Irish people of every tradition at their best and most generous.</P>
    <P>I should like next to move to a second and wider circle of interests for us which is now about to become of prime importance.  As the Dáil is aware, the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities was signed in Brussels on 22nd January, 1972.  Since then, both Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="393" /> have passed a Bill for the amendment of the Constitution, and we have debated the White Paper which sets out the terms agreed for our accession. Subject to the people's decision by referendum we are about to join the new enlarged Communities and I think in this review of our foreign relations I should set out again in broad terms our reasons for doing so.</P>
    <P>Our decision to apply for membership was taken ten years ago, and the application has been maintained since then despite disappointments.  It is one of our most important single foreign policy decisions, certainly since the last war, and, perhaps, since the founding of the State.  It was also a decision which, unlike many others, offered us a clear and definite choice when it was made.  The Government in reaching their decision took explicit account of each of the three factors governing foreign policy to which I have referred; so that an account of our reasons for joining which omits any one of them is incomplete.</P>
    <P>In the first place we are joining the Community because the Government believe that it is in our direct interest to do so, and it would be very much contrary to our interests to remain outside the European Community.  Membership will provide a large and assured market and higher and guaranteed prices for our agricultural products; it will make us less dependent on a single British market with traditionally low food prices; and membership will, if we work to ensure it, open up new export markets for our industrial products.</P>
    <P>Since it is now clear that the Communities are enlarging and Britain is joining, our real options do not lie between joining and remaining as we are; and no discussion is really honest which fails to recognise this.  Our choice must be between joining or putting in jeopardy the special trading relationship which we have with Britain&mdash;the market for some 70 per cent of our exports.  We would then at best be dependent on a trade agreement with the EEC or on some other negotiated concessions to ease our difficulties, and it would be a minor easement indeed which would be poor <Col N="394" /> recompense for the loss of our traditional market for our agricultural products and the sacrifice of the much higher EEC prices which would be available to us as members.  Most important, by staying out we would allow the unhappy boundary in our country to harden into a real frontier. Faced with such a choice the Government could hardly hesitate.  They decided that our direct interests would be well served by joining and that it would be against our interests not to do so.</P>
    <P>In the second place, we are joining Europe because of what I described earlier as a concern for community interest, that common interest among nations which is really a form of enlightened national interest.  We fully share the concern for these common interests which is evident in the preamble to the Treaty of Rome.  We believe that measures at community level can bring economic and social progress and can ensure the constant improvement in the living and working conditions of our peoples and &ldquo;harmonious development&rdquo; for every member and to every region.  We want to contribute to, as well as to benefit from, measures taken at community level to advance these common interests.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, in joining Europe we hope to be able to advance certain values such as I spoke of earlier&mdash;values which our people, I believe, would wish to see promoted at the international level.  I do not want to be pretentious or rhetorical about this. It is easy in international affairs to talk largely and eloquently about &ldquo;values&rdquo; and &ldquo;contributions to civilisation&rdquo;.  Because the debate in Ireland on joining has been largely in terms of interests, we may sometimes suspect that that is just what those concerned with the building of the European Communities think of, that they are, in fact, motivated solely by economic self-interest.  To believe this would be quite wrong.</P>
    <P>The Community is a curious mixture of bargaining and negotiation about prices and quotas, on the one hand, and efforts to build common institutions and to lay the groundwork <Col N="395" /> for a closer unity in Europe on the other.  Underlying all these activities, however, is a strong current of a more idealistic kind&mdash;a determination to promote certain common values; a strong will to ensure that western Europe which has so much in common and so much of worth in its culture will never tear itself apart again in internal hostilities.  A strong motive of its founders was to promote these more idealistic concerns by knitting the members States of the Community together in a multitude of ways affecting their direct as well as their common interests.  It would be a mistake to concentrate so much on each of these individual &ldquo;stitches&rdquo; that we do not see the larger pattern which they are slowly forming.</P>
    <P>In each of the large and pivotal decisions of the Community these concerns have been, and will continue to be, an underlying factor whatever the hard bargaining and self-interest involved. We would do wrong to overlook these concerns or think that they receive lip service only.  In joining with our new partners, however, we also bring with us as a nation certain distinctive values and concerns of our own.  These are values which evolved from our history and which we can promote in the building of the structures of the new and enlarged EEC.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to exaggerate our role. But it would be equally wrong to underestimate it.  I believe that there are some at least among the Community statesmen who welcome us as members precisely because of this outlook, and these distinctive values which we will bring with us into the Communities.  I would emphasise, however, that simply joining the Communities does not in itself serve the interests and the values to which I have referred. What joining does is give us an opportunity to serve them, an opportunity to promote our own interest, our common interest in community, and our ideals and values.  It is up to us to use the opportunity well.  It is a task for the idealist, the vigorous, the young.  It is a task for enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>I have spoken first of our relations <Col N="396" /> with Britain and of our new role in the European Communities, because these are now our most vital concerns.  We are involved also in a network of bilateral relations with many other developed countries.  Though some in Western Europe and North America are of great importance to us, I do not propose to go into detail here in regard to specific countries in this broad survey of our foreign relations.  But I would like to speak in general of that series of wider circles in which we are placed by our membership of international organisations other than the European Communities.  We play a full part in various political, economic, cultural and technical bodies&mdash;in the United Nations and its specialised agencies, the Council of Europe, OECD, the International Atomic Energy Agency and others.</P>
    <P>If we are members of any international organisation I believe that we should be good members.  This means, first, that we must show a certain seriousness of purpose in what we do there; we must show a concern for our reputation as a nation and concern for the organisation itself and its aims which we have joined in order to promote. It means, too, that our votes and decisions, like all others in our international relations, must give weight to the three factors I have mentioned &mdash;national interest, common interests and the moral and other values of our society.</P>
    <P>The influence and respect which a small country gains in any organisation, and its real contribution to the work of the organisation, depends in particular on the extent to which it matches performance to rhetoric.  In an international organisation rhetoric can diverge from performance in two ways: a strong speech which reads well at home may take precedence for that reason only; or a member country's speeches and votes may be quite at variance with its actions and decisions in the real world outside.  This second kind of divergence is probably more damaging and, if widely practised, can make any organisation wholly ineffective.</P>
    <P>As an example of what I mean, I will speak specifically of the United <Col N="397" /> Nations since it is one of the most comprehensive international organisations and probably the most important. If I speak about it mainly in political terms, I do so simply because these are basic.  But I also recognise fully the importance and value of its economic, social and humanitarian work.</P>
    <P>The UN is a body which is idealised or denigrated according to the preference of the observer.  Those who idealise it have an exaggerated notion of what it should be, and those who denigrate it, tend to abuse it for not living up to that notion.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the UN of today is a second and improved effort by nation states to promote their common interest in survival and order.  There are now some 130 members.  Because its members are all nation states, jealous of their sovereignty, the interests it serves are largely those of established nation states.  And because it mirrors the world, the world's conflicts are reflected in it.</P>
    <P>Those who idealise or denigrate the UN, however, tend to see it as something entirely apart from, and above, its members.  They want to see it as a supreme moral arbiter which will judge justly, and impose its judgments in human affairs.  When the UN proves less than this, in their view, it fails and they condemn it as futile and impotent.  Unfortunately, the UN is a good deal less than a supreme moral arbiter&mdash;the world is full of gross injustices with which it cannot deal.</P>
    <P>It would be wiser in my view to see the UN as a forum where nation states can, when they choose, meet to work out their differences.  Sometimes the UN debate may take the place of actual conflict; sometimes both proceed simultaneously and sometimes the problems and injustices may be debated for years without obvious effect.</P>
    <P>Because the UN mirrors the world in this way, it also mirrors the disagreements in the world.  It is unrealistic to blame the UN as an entity for not solving conflicts, if the countries represented there remain in real disagreement or do not choose to settle their conflicts there.</P>
    <P>Although it is not a supreme and <Col N="398" /> impartial moral arbiter, the UN is of value in helping to promote peace, justice and order in the world.  All of its members have subscribed to a common code of conduct&mdash;the Charter &mdash;under which they accept certain principles of international morality. Even if they do not always act by them, they must try to justify their behaviour in terms of these principles. Because of this, and because members may have to vote on problems where their direct national interests are not involved, there is a growing idea of an international moral community with interests in common.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, where more than 130 states debate world issues in terms of a moral code for several months each year, there is a certain amount of empty moralising and often the debate itself has little effect on the outcome since delegates act under instructions from their home governments, based on considerations not always material to the debate.</P>
    <P>Because UN members must take positions on all kinds of issues, and because the real power of the General Assembly is quite limited, it is easy for a delegation to vote by reference only to what I might call &ldquo;the UN reality&rdquo;&mdash;that is the resolutions of previous years and the pressures of the current Assembly&mdash;without regard to &ldquo;the outside reality&rdquo;, that is what it can or will do to implement a resolution. This lack of seriousness of which I have spoken already in general terms, soon becomes apparent, and the member's real influence diminishes.  More important, the UN itself suffers.  It slips a degree further out of connection with any reality beyond its own and it becomes a degree less effective and less useful in dealing with difficult issues.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the recent admission of the Peoples' Republic of China to its place in the UN&mdash;which we supported fully by our voting&mdash;will bring greater relevance and effectiveness to the organisation by making it more representative of world realities.</P>
    <P>While we should be clear-sighted about these and other weaknesses of the UN, I still consider it a useful and at times indispensable organisation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> It is sometimes said here at home that our own UN role was more prominent and independent in the late 1950s than it has been since.  I do not think this criticism makes enough allowance for the enormous changes in the UN since that period.</P>
    <P>Before 1960, at the height of the Cold War, the UN was divided into two large blocs, and it had a limited number of members from what we could call the Third World.  Cold War issues as well as great issues of decolonisation were debated.  In that situation we had a particularly useful role to play for a period.  How we from an independent viewpoint voted on divisive questions was then of added importance because the two blocs chose to regard their UN victories and defeats at that time as important&mdash;or at least as useful propaganda. Our support for anti-colonial resolutions was important then, even at times, perhaps, decisive, and these resolutions themselves made a difference.</P>
    <P>But the UN has changed.  The Cold War blocs have largely dissolved; and the Great Powers have less interest. The great oppositions have died away and the Great Powers play defensive or apathetic roles.  Most of the decolonisation battles have been won. Some 50 newly-independent African and Asian members have joined since the early 1960s and Ireland's role as an independent member with anti-colonial sympathies is no longer unusual. These newly independent countries can and do promote most vigorously their own interests and those of the remaining colonial territories and they put forward their own resolutions on such issues as apartheid and the remaining problems of colonialism.</P>
    <P>As real great power interest in UN voting has faded with changes in the rigid two-bloc structure, these resolutions have become of less effect.  In frustration their sponsors have made them stronger in tone each year.  But stronger resolutions have been even less acceptable to, and more easily ignored by, the Great Powers, wherever their interests are involved.  A series of strong resolutions with less <Col N="400" /> and less real effect has fostered the idea that the UN itself as an organisation is generally ineffectual.  This, to my mind, is harmful and even dangerous.</P>
    <P>I consider that this growing belief that it lacks relevance and effectiveness is now the UN's single and greatest problem.  It is more basic even than financial problems, because it makes the solution of financial problems seem less urgent.  The total cost of running the organisation is high but it is really nothing in Great Power terms&mdash;scarcely more than the cost of a single aircraft carrier and much less than that of a single moon-shot. Financial issues would quickly be solved if the effectiveness and relevance of the UN were clearly established.</P>
    <P>In this situation I consider that the member States who best serve the United Nations concept and are most respected in the organisation today, are not those who speak most often about international morality or those who vote most strongly on resolutions on colonialism and other issues but those who try to maintain relevance and seriousness of purpose in their own actions there.  This means, in particular, trying consistently to maintain a close congruence between speeches and votes on the one hand and subsequent willingness to give effect to the resolutions adopted on the other.  I would like to see Ireland play such a part in the UN at all times&mdash; not that we should speak or vote less strongly on difficult issues but that we should ensure that whatever we are willing to vote for we should also be willing to put into practice.</P>
    <P>I have said that we must weigh three factors in all our foreign policy decisions&mdash;national interest, community interests, and moral concern.  In the UN, our direct interests are not at stake in every issue.  But we do have a common interest as part of world community in maintaining an effective and relevant United Nations.  We, like other members, should always keep this in mind.  Without this sense of real interest and concern to give seriousness of purpose to our actions, we might lapse, as others have sometimes done, into moralising, as distinct from truly <Col N="401" /> moral judgments, and so contribute, as others have done, to the failure to take the UN seriously.</P>
    <P>Having spoken of our relations with Britain, with the European Communities and the developed countries generally, with international organisations and specifically with the United Nations, I should like to deal briefly with our relations with the countries of the developing world.  In recent years, we have made considerable economic progress, but we do not usually think of ourselves as a wealthy country.  Nevertheless, even now, among about 150 countries in the world, we rank among the top 30 in income per head; and by comparison with the vast majority of the world population we are wealthy indeed.</P>
    <P>At one time, it was an easy assumption that great discrepancies in living standards between 25 per cent of the world's population on the one hand, and the 75 per cent that are close to, or below, subsistance level on the other, were due to superior virtue or industry on the part of the developed nations.  This is no longer accepted. There is now more awareness of how the cards have been &ldquo;stacked&rdquo;, so to speak, on the side of a minority of countries in the economic exchanges between nations.  We should be able to see from our own internal history in Ireland, that a society&mdash;or in this case a world&mdash;in which a dominant minority prospers from a system which exploits the misery of a majority, is neither just nor stable.</P>
    <P>Our direct national interest in giving aid to developing countries is not so great perhaps as that of major powers and former colonial countries whose trade and investments may be at risk.  But we are pledged to increase our aid as our resources permit.  In addition, we share with every other country in the world a strong common interest in helping to remove the present gross inequalities which inhibit the economic and social development of the Third World.  We also share an appreciation of the complexity of the problems which they have to solve. There are no ready answers.  Persistent efforts at national, regional and international level alone can make <Col N="402" /> progress towards the desired end.  By our participation in the Third United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at present in progress in Santiago, Chile, we contribute to that essential process.</P>
    <P>I have spoken so far of basic principles in our foreign relations and of areas of interest which are of greatest importance to us.  There are also, of course, more general or functional aspects of our foreign affairs which I should mention.  Such issues as trade, information activities, cultural exchanges and consular protection of the interests of our citizens, for example, are part of our relations with all those countries with which we have dealings.</P>
    <P>I will speak briefly here of two of these&mdash;trade and information activities&mdash;because they are of particular importance at present.  Trade with other countries is a series of individual exchanges and contacts in which private interest, or at least mutual benefit, is usually of greater importance than the broader principles and concerns to which I referred earlier.  But, taken together, the foreign contacts we have developed in trade and foreign earnings form a whole network of relations which link us as a nation with almost every country in the world.</P>
    <P>The role of Government in a society such as ours in relation to foreign earnings is to help to stimulate exchanges organised at the private level, as far as it can, to the general benefit. In doing so it must, of course, have regard to certain more general issues arising from national economic and social development policies.</P>
    <P>For the most part, however, the Government's foreign policy involvement in the matter of export earnings is designed to smooth the path for existing exchanges and to promote opportunities which the private sector can exploit.  The promotion of trade in foreign markets and the attraction of foreign investment and tourist earnings are essential functions of our missions abroad and the business community can count on their full support.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our relations with other countries in general which has become a focus of attention recently is our information and publicity work <Col N="403" /> abroad.  In general, the activities of my Department, and of our missions abroad, complement the specific promotional and other interests of semi-State bodies such as Bord Fáilte, the Industrial Development Authority, Córas Tráchtála and others.  We try to make Ireland better known and to maintain a good general image of the country abroad which will help to advance our specific, economic and other interests.</P>
    <P>Recently, however, a more immediate concern of information work at Government level has been to ensure that the realities of the situation in the North, and Government policy towards it, are widely known and understood. Here I must say something briefly in regard to recent suggestions that we are failing in this and &ldquo;losing the propaganda war&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To speak in this way is doubly wrong.  First, we are not engaged and we should not try to engage in a so-called propaganda war.  Secondly, those aims which we are in fact trying to advance are, on balance, being advanced gradually and on the whole successfully in world public opinion.</P>
    <P>The general aim of Government policy is unity, by agreement, in a friendly relationship with Britain, in such a way as to bring peace and stability to all in this island.  An all-out propaganda war in the sense in which that expression is usually understood might be emotionally stimulating as wars sometimes are.  However, our real aim is not triumph but reconciliation. Our purpose is not simply to indulge in emotional condemnations but to persuade all concerned that a peaceful political solution is vitally necessary. Our aims would be ill-served by an all-out propaganda effort which would inflame emotions and inhibit constructive thought on the complex problems involved.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that we refrain from bringing home the truth of the situation in the North and the truth of such tragedies as Derry to world public opinion.  We can and do make every effort to see that the truth is known.</P>
    <P>The best means of doing this and of <Col N="404" /> obtaining the support of influential world press and public opinion is not necessarily to launch a flow of detailed press releases in distant parts of the world, even though activity of this kind is sometimes necessary.  Usually much more useful work is done indirectly, or in ways which are not publicised.  It is generally true, I think, that the most useful public relations work is that which is least obtrusive.  Where the public relations effort itself becomes a main item of news, it has failed in its primary purpose.  The North and Ireland generally have been a focus of attention for world news media now for several years.  Large numbers of highly professional journalists and correspondents from the resident foreign press corps in London and from world capitals are frequent visitors to both parts of the country and they are by now quite well informed on the realities of the situation.  Government Ministers here, as well as Opposition party spokesmen, regularly give interviews and engage in background discussion on the problems with visiting journalists of all kinds.  My Department and our missions abroad are active in such matters in varying ways.</P>
    <P>We sometimes find particular articles and reports in the foreign press which are inaccurate or sensational and show a lack of understanding of the situation. In general it is clear that there is, by now, a widespread appreciation by the world press of the issues involved. An increasing number of perceptive commentators around the world are also coming to see, as we do, the general direction that a lasting solution must ultimately take.  The progress in understanding this in the world press in general over the past two years is quite surprising.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest simplistically that our information services at Government level are responsible for this.  The facts of the situation speak for themselves when they are exposed to the scrutiny of the world press over a period as the North has been.  Our information services have done a good deal.  It would be ill-advised to engage now in an emotionally satisfying propaganda war which would not advance our real aims and which could <Col N="405" /> damage what has been and is being already achieved.</P>
    <P>I have tried to give a broad survey of our foreign relations rather than a detailed account of the activities of my Department.  I have spoken first of the basic aims we have had as a State taking its place in the world; then of the general principles of which we must take account&mdash;and, in particular, the three factors of national interest, the interests of international community and concern for moral values which must be a part of all our dealings with other countries.  I dealt with the main areas of concern and interest to us&mdash; our relations with Britain, with the European Communities, with international organisations like the UN and with the developing world.  Finally, I have dealt with two of the more important general aspects of our foreign relations&mdash;trade and information activities.</P>
    <P>Throughout I have stressed the view that the foreign policy of a small democratic country like ours is not a single grand design.  It is rather a network of relations, exchanges and contacts of every kind.  The Government here should not and could not impose an arbitrary and abstract foreign policy on these relations.  What it can and does do is try to develop and facilitate them.  In doing this, my Department works through our Embassies and Consulates abroad.</P>
    <P>Our foreign service, and the spread of our diplomatic missions abroad, is quite limited even by comparison with other countries of our size and general position.  Our missions are primarily placed in those countries which are closest to us geographically, or in countries where there has been a particular historic or other link which seemed to require formalisation by means of exchange of diplomatic relations.  Nevertheless, within limits, I think our real interests abroad have been generally well served by our foreign service.  But Ireland's &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; in the true sense are broader than anything done by my Department.  They must include the more specific economic and promotional activities of semi-State bodies such as Bord Fáilte <Col N="406" /> Éireann, Coras Tráchtála and the Industrial Development Authority which work under general Government direction to promote very specific economic interests.  Beyond that again, our international relations in the broadest sense will include all the many individual contacts and exchanges of our citizens with other countries.</P>
    <P>The Government, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, can guide and try to develop all of these relations with other countries.  In some matters, it is necessary to take courageous decisions and initiatives at Government level.  As I said at the outset, no Government can move too far ahead of its own society.  In the last analysis then, because of this and because our foreign relations are much more than merely Government level contacts, it is the concern of our society, as a whole, for the interests and values which it holds which will determine our nation's place in the world.  Our foreign relations and our foreign policy should, after all, in the long run, express the character, values and concerns of the Irish people in their dealings with the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now over two years since we have had a debate in this House on foreign policy other than such debates as were forced upon us by reason of crises which arose from time to time, particularly in our Anglo-Irish relations.  We therefore welcome the Minister's contribution today as an indication of the thinking of the Government in this very important sphere of foreign relations, an area which is at any time for a sovereign country of immense importance but at this great time of change is one of more critical significance to this country than it ever has been before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the original Estimate for the year 1971-72 was entered on the Order Paper of the Dáil, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party I tabled a motion to refer back the Estimate, and our reason for doing so was serious disagreement with the Government on a number of aspects of foreign policy. Because pressure of business in the <Col N="407" /> House prevented the Estimate Vote being taken in the ordinary way, we had to vote the moneys ahead of the debate, which meant that our motion to refer back the Estimate also fell by the wayside.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I wish to use this debate for the purpose of indicating areas of serious disagreement with the policy and behaviour of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and of the Government over the past two years.</P>
    <P>To listen to the Minister's pious sentiments today one would not think this is the man who, after the tragic events of Derry last year, engaged in a propaganda rampage across the North American continent and the European continent, engaging in a battle of national animosities and portraying the stresses and strains of Northern Ireland as a matter of territorial dispute and of ancient rivalries between Ireland and Britain.  It seems to me unsatisfactory for a Minister to have acted in that way at such a time of deep national feeling.  The Minister spoke today, one might think, in sentiments of chastisement of people who would believe in engaging in a propaganda war.  He mentioned that such a war might be emotionally stimulating, but he suggested that it might be self-defeating because it might defeat reconciliation. Is this to be taken as a recognition by him at this stage that his behaviour was, in fact, damaging to the national interest, was more likely to stimulate animosities in the North of Ireland and elsewhere, and was in no way helpful in getting a proper understanding of the real problems involved?</P>
    <P>I sensed also throughout the Minister's speech a note of cynicism, clouded perhaps in pious sentiments. There is no need for this country to be reluctant in giving its vote, its voice and its influence in matters concerning fundamental decencies, fundamental freedoms and human rights.  If the Government had concerned itself with these matters rather than with national animosities over the past three and a half years in relation to the North of <Col N="408" /> Ireland we might be a great deal further on the road to national reconciliation than we are.  The conduct of the Minister in, first of all, going to North America rather than Europe and then proceeding across Europe&mdash;because the proper course of conduct was pointed out to him by Fine Gael &mdash;indicated, from what he said and what we saw him say on television, that he considers it more important to placate the extremists of his own party at home than to get international statesmen to use their good offices to persuade Britain of the need to change her course of conduct.  We know the Minister's words and conduct made friends of Ireland and supporters of human rights fearful to intervene.  We know that the Minister's words and conduct automatically engendered a feeling of self-defence and self-righteousness on the part of Britain and the British Government, who automatically went into self-defence rather than into self-examination.  We know also that the Minister's words and conduct, supported by the Government, gave support to a mistaken notion which some people propagated that the departure of the British Army from the North of Ireland would solve all.  Like the misdirected and ill-conceived press campaign of two years ago, the Minister's excursions were counter-productive.</P>
    <P>Accepting what the Minister said today and has on other occasions said about the importance of the United Nations, we accept that it was appropriate that, after the tragedy of Derry and throughout the travail of the last three years, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should make known in the United Nations the reaction of the people of Ireland to what was occurring there.  But the area of greatest influence open to Ireland today is not North America, is not our former colleague members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, but is Europe.  The Minister would have done a much better service to the afflicted people of Northern Ireland and to all the people of Ireland and of Europe by addressing himself in the first instance to the member nations of the European Economic Community and the Council of Europe. <Col N="409" /> Where does Britain today seek to exert most influence in her own self-interest, the self-interest which the Minister properly recognises as legitimate for any country?  It is in Europe. She seeks not merely to join the EEC like ourselves but also to influence it to accept British thinking, British policies. She knows also she cannot hope to achieve this goal of hers if she antagonises European opinion.  Once the Minister had addressed himself to the United Nations General Secretary and to the agencies of the United Nations, his next call should have been to the EEC in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister's thinking on this matter was that the EEC is not a political community and that it might have been embarrassed had it received a formal political approach in relation to the North of Ireland.  I believe that thinking is perfectly legitimate, but it ignored what the Minister ought to have known and ought to have taken into account, and that was the frightful concern that the member nations of the EEC felt in relation to what was occurring in part of a state which sought to be a member of the EEC.  While the Minister has properly recognised in his address today that formal public approaches are oftentimes dangerous, the reality of the EEC which the Minister should have recognised fully, was and still is concerned with the tensions in the North of Ireland and the strained relations between two applicant nations to join the EEC should be settled before 1st January, 1973, the date upon which it is hoped the two nations concerned will become members of the European Economic Community.  For the Minister to have gone to the United States of America, and addressed himself to United States politicians, and then to Canadian politicians, before speaking to European statemen was a political gaffe of the first magnitude.  What is the effect of American influence in Northern Irish affairs today?  At best, it is counter-productive.  Normally it is harmful because it is based upon a misunderstanding of the situation, upon myths and legends.  I speak now irrespective of whether the influence or the intervention, the monetary aid <Col N="410" /> or the arms supplies come from those connected with the &ldquo;green&rdquo; or the &ldquo;orange&rdquo; elements in our community.</P>
    <P>In addressing himself to an old Commonwealth colleague in Canada before speaking to our European neighbours the Minister discovered what this country should recognise, namely, that Commonwealth countries are really no longer interested in Irish problems and they will certainly not prefer to take the side of nationalist Ireland against sovereign Britain, which is still an equal member and colleague of theirs in the Commonwealth of Nations.  We, of course, value the sympathy we get in the United States, in Canada and throughout the member nations of the Commonwealth of Nations, but let us realise that in the second half of the 20th century our national interest, to which the Minister referred as a legitimate consideration, our common interest with other nations, requires first attention to Europe and, in future, when we seek influence and intervention to assist us, let us look for it in Europe and not in the sphere in which, no matter how well intentioned, is likely to be more harmful than beneficial.</P>
    <P>Throughout recent months there has been a great deal of speculation about the possibility of the establishment of diplomatic relations with Russia.  I would have thought that the Minister would have referred to this in the course of his address.  We are disappointed that he did not do so because he recognised that foreign policy is a matter not alone for the Government but also for the Opposition and for other interested groups in the State. We, in Fine Gael, tabled a motion in this House requesting that before a decision was taken in this matter there would be a debate on this issue.  The Government's response has been that this is a matter for the Government alone to decide.  We cannot accept that and the Minister's contribution today suggests, I think, that a matter of such import is beyond the selfish interest of any Government at any particular time. If a government of this State establishes diplomatic relations with any country such relations cannot be severed without serious consequences because severing diplomatic relations <Col N="411" /> is inevitably regarded as a rejection of relations with the country with which one had formal connections and, before this State is committed to the establishment of diplomatic relations with a country which has no significant trade, cultural or scientific association with this State, it is proper that the matter should be fully debated in this House.</P>
    <P>One wonders why the Government have in fact allowed this kite to be flown for so long.  Perhaps they did not themselves fly the kite in the first instance. Perhaps they did not manufacture the kite or provide the wind for the kite to be flown, but they might at least have taken some steps to pull the kite down.  I suggest they did supply the wind to keep the kite in flight because the Minister himself indicated in a broadcast, which was internationally televised, that in the event of Ireland not getting assistance from her traditional friend in relation to the North of Ireland she might look elsewhere for support.  One may wonder why at a time of immense national strain and worry the Minister should have added the mischievous idea of establishing diplomatic relations with the USSR.  Was it done to taunt the British Government which recently had cause to call upon the USSR to withdraw over 100 of its Embassy staff in London?  Was it done to goad our American and Canadian friends into declaring an interest for Ireland they might not otherwise have declared?  We just do not know.  All this has been left very much up in the air.</P>
    <P>I want not to pull down that kite. If the Minister wants to fly it again, well and good, but let him do it openly and let him give the kind of leadership he says a government has the responsibility of giving.  Our trade with Russia is negligible.  The ratio is ten to one against us.  In 1970 our exports to Russia were nil; we imported from Russia nearly £1½ million worth of goods.  In the following year, 1971, our exports to the USSR were £214,000 worth of goods and we imported nearly £3 million worth of goods from Russia.  It may be argued quite properly <Col N="412" /> that we should endeavour to cure this imbalance.  That is an opinion with which we entirely agree. But one does not have to establish diplomatic relations with a country in order to create a situation of trade balance.  Indeed, if one looks at many of the countries with which we have diplomatic relations, it might conceivably be argued that the way to worsen one's trade balance is by establishing diplomatic relations.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about common interest being a governing factor in foreign policy.  What common interest has this country with the USSR?  We have no cultural associations with Russia.  We have no scientific relations with Russia and we are unlikely in the foreseeable future to be able to benefit by any scientific or technological association with the USSR. There is no point in having arrangements for the purchase of military equipment from the USSR because again in the foreseeable future any conflict in which we might be involved would be with some power that would geographically be between us and the USSR and, therefore, we would not be able to get replacements to maintain such military equipment as we might require from Russia.</P>
    <P>I do not make as little of morality as the Minister seems to suggest in his address.  I do not want to be unfair to the Minister.  He did say that it was proper that we should be concerned with moral values but he put it in a third position.  I do not know whether that was accidental or whether it indicates the priority of his values.  Russia is blatantly in contravention of many United Nations obligations concerning fundamental freedoms and human decencies.  I suspect that the Minister had Russia and other countries in mind when he spoke about the huge void between votes in the UN and action at home on the other hand.  Russia, being in contravention of some of the most fundamental rights of man, how can it be conceived that this country should establish diplomatic relations with Russia?  The USSR is a country which has slightingly condemned the presence of Irish soldiers in Cyprus, speaking of them as foreign soldiers imposed upon <Col N="413" /> the sovereign soil of Cyprus and demanding that Irish soldiers, together with other UN troops, be withdrawn from Cyprus.  Russia is a country which refuses to contribute its share towards the cost of maintaining forces in Cyprus, previously in the Congo and elsewhere, to maintain international peace.  Yet this kite has been flown for many, many months and no attempt has been made by the Minister or the Government to put it down.  We repudiate the suggestion which perhaps might be made by some that mother Ireland should suckle the Russian bear as a contribution to world <i>détente</i>.  I do not think it is necessary that that physical exercise should be engaged in and I think the Minister seems to accept that now, to judge by his reaction, but it is high time that we accepted the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>If there is good cause for establishing diplomatic relations with some State in the eastern bloc, if there is some common interest between ourselves and the eastern bloc, if the argument is that we need diplomatic relations in order to promote trade with the eastern bloc, then let us consider doing it not with a country which is the very antithesis of everything in which we believe but with some country which, like ourselves, is dominated by an imperial power.  We have considerable affinity with a country like Poland and our trade with Poland is seven times greater than our trade with Russia and it is not in the same state of imbalance as our trade with Russia&mdash;though indeed it is not particularly healthy either. There would be something to be said for establishing diplomatic relations with Poland or Czechoslovakia or Hungary or Yugoslavia or Bulgaria or Albania or Rumania or Eastern Germany for all these are victims of imperialism, just as we have been for so long, and if it be that any proposal that we should have diplomatic relations with one of those Comecon countries or Yugoslavia has been found to be unacceptable in Moscow, so be it.  Let us not succumb to any bullying tactic of Moscow.  In fact, disapproval has been uttered by the Soviets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We, in Fine Gael, believe that it would serve this country's interests to endeavour to get a better foothold tradewise, for commercial reasons, in Eastern Europe.  There is an immense growth in the trade between eastern and western Europe and we believe that this is a desirable thing to promote. The very justification for the EEC is a conviction that men will not fight with one another when they become commercially, economically and socially dependent upon one another.  So the likelihood of a conflict between east and west becomes less as they become mutually dependent, but this does not require the sophisticated step of establishment of diplomatic relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not make light of the many problems which would have to be faced in the promotion of trade with any of the Comecon countries.  First of all, the kind of imports which they are at present taking from western Europe, and these are growing at a rate of nearly 14 per cent per annum, are in the sphere of advanced producer goods of which we produce precious little.  We have had a number of trade fairs in Warsaw Pact countries but they have not produced very much trade.  In fact, if we had spent as much time and effort in more fertile markets we would probably have got a better return.  In trade also with Comecon countries we would have the additional difficulty not alone of trading with potential customers at a long distance but we would have to deal not only with the end consumer but also with government agencies.  It may be argued that in order to promote such trade, <Col N="415" /> therefore, we need to have a government agency of our own in eastern Europe.  We accept the possible need for that but that can be done not by means of diplomatic relations but by means of commercial attachés.  There are further difficulties also in trading with eastern Europe and they include the difficulty of getting payment in a convertible currency.  There is little value in our proceeding to develop increased trade with eastern Europe unless we also take steps to ensure that such trade is conducted to our advantage and in such a way as will ensure a proper balance for the future and that any relations will not have political overtones which we may find unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In Fine Gael and in all sensible circles in this country there has been quite an amount of worry in recent times about the worsening of relations between Ireland and our nearest neighbour, Britain.  Even when it was unpopular to do so this party has advocated that Ireland's interests require good relations with our nearest and most powerful neighbour.  I do not think the Government's conduct has particularly helped to promote better relations between Ireland and Britain in recent years.  Where this country's immediate interest was concerned they frequently remained silent and by failing to protest gave Britain justification for believing that they could tread further upon our corns.  It is never a way in which to maintain good relations, to let people believe that you are not particularly worried about their conduct.  It is much better whenever you see misconduct being initiated that you would protest at that stage.</P>
    <P>However, I do not want to go back over too many old sores.  I would perfer, therefore, to refer briefly to the recent initiatives taken by the British Government in relation to the North of Ireland.  We do not quite understand the statement in the Minister's address that the policy of the Government on the North is primarily a matter for the Taoiseach.  The Minister said he dealt with it only in so far as it directly affected his relations with another Government.  Are we to understand that there is some disagreement between <Col N="416" /> the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach in relation to the North of Ireland?</P>

He went on to say that he dealt with it only in so far as it directly affects our relations with another Government. I suspect, and the whole nation suspects, that there is disagreement between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach.  Certainly, the performance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the weeks immediately following Derry was not in keeping with the attitude and statements of the Taoiseach either before or since Derry.  We find it very odd that any member of a Government in making an address to the House on the Estimate for his Department should proceed to say that some particular matter of governmental policy is a matter primarily for the Taoiseach. There is either Government responsibility or there is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have offered a valid criticism of what the Minister said today and of what the Minister's conduct has led the nation to believe in recent times.</P>
      <P>However, we are dealing at the moment primarily with the actions of the British Government and I accept them as being British Government initiatives and not the initiatives of the head of that Government but of the British Government itself.  As a result of these initiatives, British standing in the world has vastly improved and this imposes upon this country, out of self-interest, as the Minister has accepted, a very clear obligation to ensure that any violent action which could defeat the benefit flowing from these initiatives is not encouraged by or tolerated from this State of ours.  There are, however, many signs to cause public concern that the Government are less than committed to the resolution of this House that violence is totally repudiated as a means to achieve a political solution to any outstanding differences in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are disappointed that the Government have not so far publicly expressed disagreement with one dangerous suggestion in the British package proposals and that is the suggestion for a regular plebiscite to determine whether or not the North of Ireland should remain a part of Great Britain or become associated with the Republic of Ireland.  I say that this is a dangerous suggestion although I accept that it is possibly <Col N="418" /> well meaning, because it would, for the first time in international law or national law, build into the fundamental law of a political entity a provision for regular consideration of its own extinction.</P>
    <P>A thing is not necessarily bad because it is novel but it ought to give us cause for concern if it is novel that mankind has never in all its previous experience found it desirable to make such a suggestion.  We ought, as a country which is concerned with national unity and which desires to see peace and harmony restored in these islands, to warn against any proposal which would at regular intervals inflate feeling, artificially promote discontent and misunderstanding and from time to time, out of necessity of law, compel people to go back to their old traditional corners in order to spar at one another continuing whatever prejudices might have existed.</P>
    <P>We live in a very changing situation, a situation which is changing not only internally but also in our international associations with our nearest neighbour. The Stormont Parliament and Government are gone, for how long we do not know but we certainly know, and it is reasonable to anticipate it, that it is gone never to return in its old form.  We have yet to see any reaction of significant value from the Government, from the Minister for Foreign Affairs or from the Taoiseach, commensurate with this tremendously significant event in Anglo-Irish relations. There is now a need to think on a scale never previously dreamt of.  We must, of course, have compassion but we need above all else clarity of vision. These particular aspects have been singularly absent from the Government's policy and the Government's action in recent times.</P>
    <P>We have said from the Opposition that we cannot accept direct rule as a long-term solution.  We do not believe that any well-intentioned foreigner knows the wishes, the anxieties, the fears, the needs, the desires of the Irish people as well as they do themselves and we want to see self-government restored in all parts of Ireland as quickly as possible.  We feel that the <Col N="419" /> Government lack the sense of urgency which the events of recent months demand from them.  We are sorely disappointed that throughout the Minister's otherwise valuable contribution today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we had no reaction to these momentous events of recent times.  Fifty years of legends, myths and intrigues have driven the people of this island further apart.  We were never, I believe, a united people.  Sometimes we are led to believe that because Presbyterians in 1798 found sympathy with Catholics this indicated unanimity of opinion in this island in favour of separation from Britain but this, like many other legends and myths, cannot be well-established.  We need now to take every step we can to promote and to capitalise on common values and common interests.  They are simple if people in this island were given the opportunity to go about their daily work and their lawful vocations free from the fear of violence, whether applied by governmental forces or by people who presume to take the law into their own hands for political objectives, worthy or unworthy.  Our Government here have failed our people in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the Government's silence whenever the vital interests of this State are concerned. From these benches from time to time we have raised a number of these issues and whenever we raised them we were faced with a certain coolness on the part of the Government if not indifference.  The wisdom of our attitude is now clearly to be seen because of the tragedies that have occurred. When first of all incursions occurred across our Border by British military and when our vessels were improperly stopped on the high seas and searched by British naval forces, we raised the matter in the House and we found a general reluctance on the part of the Government to do anything about it. We warned at that time that unless the matter was seriously dealt with and a formal protest made to Britain, this could escalate into a situation in which <Col N="420" /> death could occur because of these incursions.  It was only when violence and tragedy occurred that the Government began to treat the matter seriously.</P>
    <P>When tragedies occurred, and since then, the Taoiseach invited the United Nations to send observers on to our soil in order to satisfy British public opinion that the Government here were doing all they could to seal off the Border.  We repudiated then, we repudiate now and we will always repudiate any suggestion that UN troops should be invited on to our soil, the soil of the Twenty-six counties, in order to get any Government here out of an embarrassing situation.  I would add to that that we view with considerable reserve any suggestion that the UN would be brought in to deal with the Northern Ireland situation at all.  Even if one accepts the good intentions of the UN, and of UN forces if brought in, we must compare our hopes with what we have seen occur elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Cyprus situation is not dissimilar to the Irish one.  We have contributed our share of men and materials and sacrifices to assist the people of Cyprus to resolve their community tensions and to work in harmony. But what has been achieved by the UN in Cyprus?  After their seven year's presence there, they have driven the Turkish and the Greek communities further apart.  They now have less contact with one another than before the UN arrived, and the barriers, the barbed wire, the barricades have risen higher and the two communities are now further apart.</P>
    <P>So let us not assume that we would find anything of value in a UN military presence on any part of Irish soil.  It might well seem to provide a breathing space within which people could put on their thinking caps instead of using guns.  That is the theory but the reality is that the presence of a UN contingent in Ireland as in Cyprus would simply lead to a situation in which both communities would be driven further and further apart.</P>
    <P>We also raised in the House&mdash;the Government treated it with levity&mdash;the illegality of imprisoning people on <Col N="421" /> board the <i>Maidstone</i> in Belfast Lough. The fact that Mr. Whitelaw on his appointment treated as a matter of priority the closing down of the <i>Maidstone</i> is, I think, a matter of considerable significance, but it was not done because of a suggestion of the Irish Government.  Indeed, the Minister in reply to an Adjournment debate indicated that he did not propose to raise the matter.</P>
    <P>What was illegal in relation to the <i>Maidstone?</i> It was that the territory of Northern Ireland extended to only six parliamentary counties and did not include the water where the <i>Maidstone</i> was moored.  Why did the Government not protest?  They did not do so because to protest would mean they would have had to rely on the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 6th December, 1921, which the whole Fianna Fáil Party were founded to reject and which forever since their foundation had spent most of their energies endeavouring to denigrate.</P>
    <P>While it is not now relevant because of subsequent curative action taken by the British parliament, also as a matter of urgency the Government should have protested when the Westminster Parliament passed the Northern Ireland Act, 1972, conferring on the Stormont Parliament power to direct, influence, control and grant immunity to the British Army in Northern Ireland.  That step was in direct conflict with the Ireland Act, 1920 which became an essential part of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 and which, indeed, was referred to ultimately in subsequent British legislation.  Again why did the Government not make any protest?  Why did they not bring it before the World Court in The Hague? It is because it would have meant their relying on what the Fianna Fáil Party have spent their life denigrating, the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921.</P>
    <P>I mention these things not in any spirit of old animosity but simply because I want to draw attention to the unsuitability of the present Government at this time of national crisis, because of their failure to act in the interests of this country since doing so might cause certain tensions and strains within their own party or those <Col N="422" /> who for the time being are supporting them in this House and outside it Although the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others may profess to put the interests of the nation first, it is quite clear they have been pre-occupied throughout all those days of great national strain with maintaining the unity of their party irrespective of the harm this might cause to the national interests.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier my disagreement with the Minister on the emphasis which he put on territorial rivalry and national animosities.  I think it is unfortunate the Government took so long to make a complaint to the European Commission on Human Rights about the manner in which detainees are being treated in Northern Ireland. It may sound churlish at this stage to make this complaint but it is important that we would make this complaint against the Government because this is the first occasion on which we have been able to debate foreign affairs here in two years.  It took them five months to assemble evidence and to make a formal complaint and during all that time, and indeed, for a long time afterwards, Irish people were being tortured and were brutally illtreated in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to believe that human needs and the welfare of our people can await diplomatic convenience. I do not know whether it is that the Department are short of personnel or because they are preoccupied with potential membership of the EEC but we feel they have not given sufficient urgency to the internal situation in Northern Ireland.  If they had moved a little faster, with a little more sincerity and conviction, we might not have had to wait until March of 1972 before British initiatives were implemented in respect of the North of Ireland situation, initiatives which were not, as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested, steps forward but which were simply a shaking out of the situation, an opening up which enabled new steps to be taken.</P>
    <P>I have the privilege to represent Ireland in the Council of Europe and I should like to acknowledge here the <Col N="423" /> immense contribution which was made to Ireland's entry by all three parties who are represented on the council. Although we have the reputation at home, understandably so, of being concerned with party interests and with failing to give priority to the interests of the nation, it is important that Ireland should realise that on the Council of Europe all matters of party rivalry are entirely forgotten and that the Irish delegation to the Council have been able to work unanimously and to achieve considerable progress in the field of human rights, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what steps the Government are taking to expedite some of the matters which came before the Council of Europe.  The Committee of Ministers there appears to be unable to accept the resolution which the European Assembly adopted over two years ago calling for an extension of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms to end discrimination on religious and political grounds in respect of housing, employment and electoral rights.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes argued that the European Social Charter protects the social and economic rights of the people.  This is not true because there is no sanction available, there is no cure available to any person who is wronged under the European Social Charter.  It is very necessary that we as a country would insist that Europe would so strengthen the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms that the right not to be discriminated against would become enforceable in the European Commission and in the European Council. The difficulty which arises arises because of a misunderstanding of the right which it sought to protect.  It is not sought to establish as an enforceable right the right to a house, the right to a job or the right to a vote. What is sought to establish is the right not to be discriminated against.  It should not be beyond the resources of the legal advisers of the Committee of Ministers in the institutions of Europe to devise an enforceable right that a person would not be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> We would therefore urge on the Minister and the Government that they would take every possible step necessary to ensure that the right not to be discriminated against is adequately protected in the European Commission and the European Courts without further delay.  I know it has caused some disappointment to people, who had hoped that the European Council and the Courts and the Commission could deal with the situation in Northern Ireland, that it has not yet effectively intervened.  The reason why it has not intervened is because from 1948 to 1950 when the European Convention was being drawn up the well-intentioned people of Europe could not conceive a situation in which any nation and state would presume to discriminate against people on the grounds of religion or political belief in relation to housing and employment. Ireland's voice raised in those days by our predecessors on the Council of Europe was ignored.  It is perhaps ironic that the reports of British Government Commissions have now established that what was then alleged by the Irish delegation was entirely justified.</P>
    <P>We are not, however, concerned with casting blame on anybody.  We urge on the Minister and the Government to use all their influence to ensure that the correct decision is taken by the Committee of Ministers and the institutions of the Council of Europe in relation to this very important field. It is only by protecting such rights and providing remedies, where they are interfered with, that we can provide the kind of international remedy which would prevent a recurrence in the North of Ireland of the kind of discrimination which has occurred there in the past.</P>
    <P>Last night I heard a spokesman for the Labour Party reiterate one of the myths about the EEC and the North of Ireland which I think we should explode in the course of this debate.  It is often suggested that by signing the Treaty of Accession to the Rome Treaty on the same day as the United Kingdom Government Ireland in some way or other recognises the validity of British presence in the North of Ireland or that in some way this act <Col N="425" /> was an abandonment of our desire to achieve national unity.  I find it extraordinary to hear that kind of criticism come from a party whose spokesmen often argue that we should remove from the Constitution Article 3 which establishes as of right jurisdiction over the North of Ireland, even if for the time being we are unable to exercise it.  The fact is that this State since 1922 has entered into some 12 international agreements with the same United Kingdom Government. We are also members of the United Nations Organisation, of which the United Kingdom Government are members.  We were members of the League of Nations when it existed. We are members of the OECD and we also receive here in Ireland the British Ambassador, who represents the same United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is high time we got clarity of thinking in this regard and it is high time also that we replaced this false claim of right with something which would be of much greater value, that is to declare a desire to achieve the unity of Ireland rather than asserting a right.  The assertion of a right against a neighbour is unlikely ever to win that neighbour to your way of thinking, whereas an expression of a desire to co-operate will probably achieve a great deal more.  I am mentioning that matter in passing when dealing with Northern Ireland and I think that this puerile propaganda which is going on against the EEC, suggesting that it involves to some extent a permanent recognition of the validity of the Border, is something which is contemptuous, is harmful to national interests, is also injurious to other relationships with Britain and is in total conflict with the conduct of this State ever since it achieved its freedom.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that we should establish an all-party committee to review the Constitution and to deal with other matters which might need to be revised in the light of prospects of Irish unity.  We, in Fine Gael, have responded very gladly to these suggestions because we, of course, in the first instance initiated them.  It would be very wrong, however, were <Col N="426" /> the public to believe that because of the Taoiseach's belated initiatives in this regard there is an all-party committee at present functioning in relation to the North of Ireland or indeed Anglo-Irish relations.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We share no responsibility for the Government's actions or inactions in relation to the North of Ireland, to Anglo-Irish relations or to that inaction of the Government in dealing with the threats in our own community to our own security.</P>
    <P>Before the nation is swamped by disenchantment with all parliamentarians is is important for them to understand that we have been refused any participation in the formulation of national policy, in the formulation of policy for the future or the conduct of affairs in relation to the North of Ireland, internal security or Anglo-Irish relations. Ever since the emergency began in the North of Ireland in 1968, we have pleaded with the Government, who apparently are in a state of disagreement amongst themselves or amongst their supporters, to avail of the goodwill and the good intentions of the Opposition in this Parliament so that a more constructive and beneficial approach could be made in the terribly dangerous situation.  However, the fact that we have been spurned so often does not discourage us from once again in this debate renewing this appeal. We renew it, at the same time recognising that the ultimate responsibility in this field must of course lie with the Government of the day but that is no reason why there should not be adequate and continuous consultation.</P>
    <P>In his contribution today, like statements from other Government spokesmen, the Minister has thrown out a certain amount of pious platitudes which would seem to suggest a general outward look, a generosity on the part of the Government.  However, this is very much in conflict with their practice.  I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he would agree to the establishment of a foreign affairs committee of Members of this House which would meet regularly to discuss matters of interest to Ireland in the field of international relations.  So far, all I have received <Col N="427" /> from the Minister is an indication that the Government might consider, in the event of the referendum producing a positive vote, the establishment of a committee which would consider problems affecting this country arising out of membership of the EEC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested for a long time in having a committee of the Dáil but the Opposition did not do anything about it.  I expressed my willingness&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite in accordance with the facts.  The Minister knows that Fine Gael are only too anxious for the establishment of a foreign affairs committee in this Parliament.  In fact, we gave a specific undertaking that in the event of Fine Gael being in power we would establish such a committee as an essential part of democratic and parliamentary procedures here.</P>
      <P>In his statement the Minister has acknowledged that foreign affairs is a collection of wisdom and views, that it reflects not merely the thinking of the Government of the day but of the Opposition, that it represents the pooling of wisdom and experience not only of parliamentarians but also of bodies such as Córas Tráchtála, Bord Fáilte and individuals who travel abroad.  It seems extraordinary in the light of acceptance of that truism that the Minister should continue to drag his feet in relation to the establishment of a foreign affairs committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard the Minister acknowledge that Foreign Affairs was now perhaps the most difficult portfolio for any Minister to hold.  It involves specialised knowledge in a multitude of different disciplines, from fish to the legal interpretation of international <Col N="428" /> documents, from sugar-growing to military involvement, as well as a multitude of other interests.  In fact, the Minister for Foreign Affairs must be better informed on every Government Department than even the Taoiseach. The latter is immediately answerable only to his own Parliament and his own people, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs is answerable not only to the Government and people but to the international bodies with which he is directly associated.</P>
    <P>Because of this highly complex field of international relations, because of the extent of EEC treaties and subsequent directives and regulations which have been made, and because EEC membership in the future will involve not only a study of what has been achieved but also what is in the pipeline, it becomes more important than ever to have a foreign affairs committee in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>One would think this was some extraordinary development, but it exists in each of the Parliaments of the countries with which we propose to be associated in the EEC.  In addition to some other peculiarities which may baffle our European neighbours, we are unique in not having all-party committees on foreign affairs and many other activities.  Even in our own small community of three million people, life is becoming so complex that Members of this House cannot hope to reach any worthwhile understanding of events without having some form of committee system.</P>
    <P>If we go into the EEC there will be another reason for such a committee, namely, that the EEC will take over some of the legislative functions of Oireachtas Éireann.  Without having a foreign affairs committee we will not be in a position to study whatever is proposed in adequate time before the rules and regulations are made.  At the moment, no significant step controlling our society can be taken without the matter coming before the Dáil and Seanad for full debate.  If it is a Bill it must go through all its Stages and if it is a regulation or statutory instrument made by a Minister it must be put before the House where it can be reviewed or set aside by either House before it becomes law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> In the EEC, these legislative functions in respect of some activities will be taken from us.  It will not suffice to leave the review and examination of potential rules and regulations to the civil servants or to the Minister of the day.  We know that the Minister would not have time to consider such proposals in depth, but if we had an all-party committee there would be ample opportunity to consider the applicability of what is proposed having regard to our situation and for us to make our suggestions and amendments in good time to see that our interests were adequately protected.</P>
    <P>Apparently I was misled by the Minister's benign countenance on a previous occasion into believing that the Government were prepared to agree to this.  Now I discover it to be otherwise.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Waters Preservation Bill, 1972: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It occurred to me when we broke off last week on this subject that, although we are very conscious of individual items and particular facets of this problem of pollution, we do not, perhaps, look at the fundamental nature of the problem sufficiently.  It is important that we <Col N="430" /> should do so for two reasons: one is, naturally, to understand the problem as a whole; and the other is from the point of view of convincing sceptics and go-ahead members of humanity who want to get the job done of the necessity for conservation.  From that point of view, it is instructive to try to see basically what the problem is.</P>
      <P>We are all laymen as far as this problem is concerned.  The first fact we tend to forget is that all life on this planet is confined in a very narrow skin surrounding the surface of the earth.  Beneath that skin in the body of the planet there is no life and above it, and out in space, there is no life in our proximity, as visits to the moon seem to have shown&mdash;no life comparable to the highly organised life we have on this planet.</P>
      <P>The point of importance for us here now is that that life is confined in a very thin shell, the biosphere.  It is within that thin skin around the earth that all the life processes take place. That life depends on a whole series of balanced reactions of nature; animal plants, inorganic life, all reacting one on the other in nature's scheme and making it possible for life as we know it to carry on, on the surface of this planet.</P>
      <P>In the scheme of things if there is one material substance that is more important than any other&mdash;or is at least as important as any other in all this complicated life on the face of the planet&mdash;it is water.  Water plays an essential part in all the life processes. It plays an essential part in the whole of the environment which supports life. It is a necessity.  For that reason alone the conservation of water supplies, and their maintenance in adequate purity for the purposes of nature, is one of the prime requirements for mankind and makes the problem of water pollution a primary problem for every living thing on the face of this earth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next fact we have to realise is that nature holds an intricate balance, a wonderful balance, a wonderful equilibrium between a whole host of biological species, biological entities and its inorganic environment, its natural environment on the face of this planet.  That balance depends on <Col N="431" /> the reaction of all these biological elements on each other, each controlling the other in a marvellous way.</P>
    <P>Anything that upsets that balance is perturbing nature.  Within limits, nature can correct it and heretofore she has done so.  Because of the pollution of the planet, and particularly the water pollution of the planet, we are now getting to the stage where nature's ability to redress balances and to secure new equilibria to enable the essential life processes to survive is being threatened.  In other words, the rate at which man is disbalancing these processes now threatens to become more than nature can cope with.  Perhaps this sounds a little bit academic but it is nonetheless a very vital reality.</P>
    <P>In the whole evolution of life on this planet the plants, animals, bacteria, the small and the bigger elements in life, like the plants, all grow and evolve together enabling the animals finally, and man, who is in a material way an animal, to survive and prosper on the planet.  Man's survival and the survival of animals depended and depend on the balance of plants and microscopic life as well as on the immediate sources of our requirements such as air and food.</P>
    <P>While everything was in a primitive state, nature looked after things, but man started to develop nature and brought in his own complications. Perhaps it all started when man began to clear land, to domesticate animals and to take over the surface of the earth more definitely for himself.  He did that to his own profit but at a certain cost to nature.  In our own time, how many species of animals have been obliterated and are now extinct?  How many areas of the planet which were part of nature and which were functioning as part of nature's life symbotic processes have been appropriated to man?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>How many species of fish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in our own day.  Nature could compensate, and even though some wild animals disappeared, and even though forests were cut down, still man's attack was <Col N="432" /> within the competence of nature to defend herself and to compensate. She still had the oceans.  She still had large tracts of land.  The bacteria and the other microscopic agents were still relatively free to operate.  Although man introduced disbalances they were not fatal either to the balance of nature or to himself.  Perhaps, unfortunately, for both nature and man, when nature brought in her compensation, man fought back more. For instance, when man was sparsely scattered over the earth he probably had little trouble with infectious diseases.  When he conquered nature to the extent that men could live in large populations diseases became apparent.</P>
      <P>The microscopic life of nature asserted itself and to meet this man developed hygiene and medicine.  So it was that this battle began and has continued and, perhaps, if the rate of development had been kept to what nature could cope with we should have no cause for worry but, unfortunately, in our time particularly&mdash;one might say in this century although the beginnings of the process are deep in the past&mdash;it has come to the point where man has so attacked nature that he is beating nature's defences and nature, of itself, is not able to maintain the necessary balances.  Therefore, man is now threatening to destroy his own environment and the environment of life on this planet.</P>
      <P>That sounds a very alarming statement but it is the view of certain scientists who have studied the problem. It is nothing less than this we are facing in discussing the question of pollution.  The motion now before us is fundamental in that it deals with the pollution of the waters which can so upset all the balance of nature as to threaten the survival of all our balances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I mentioned a point which for the sake of completeness I shall briefly mention again.  We breathe air every day: our lives and the lives of similar animals depend on breathing air.  We take it for granted.  We could not sit more than one minute or so in this Chamber if deprived of air; we would be dead.  It is very sobering to think that the air we breathe is taking <Col N="433" /> part in a great cycle: we breathe it and other natural users of oxygen use it in this available form and turn it back into the atmosphere in a non-available form as carbon dioxide or something else but nature has marvellously supplied the counterbalance for the requirements of that kind of life in plant life.  Green vegetation and the algae of the sea take in the carbon dioxide, reprocess it to put oxygen back into the atmosphere and we all depend on that process.  There exists a life cycle in which the oxygen we breathe takes part and it is vital for the maintenance of that oxygen and, therefore, for the maintenance of our air supply for breathing that green plants and algae in the sea carry out their function of absorbing what we have turned the oxygen into and generating from it the oxygen we require. That is the wonderful, universal process of nature.</P>
    <P>We now find that pollution of the water in the sea may so threaten oxygen-producing organisms in it that a very significant inroad may be made on the atmosphere's oxygen supply. Couple that with the frightening thought that in our cities and towns and in many ways all over the earth we are destroying much vegetation which plays a similar part and the reality of the danger becomes apparent. Certainly, the need for control and preserving a balance is easily appreciated. That is one aspect of pollution.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal with the whole matter of pollution except in so far as it is relevant to pollution of water but this happens to be at the heart of the problem and must, therefore, be dealt with.  The oxygen cycle is only one example of those wonderful cycles which maintain the balances of nature. There are many others.  Our agricultural supplies have been much more dependent than we realised on the action of micro-organisms in the soil, of insignificant things like worms and insects and so on.  Microscopic life plays its part in the waters also.  They are in sensitive balance.  The next problem is that what we are putting into the waters is destroying those forms of life which play a part in the balances just as the pollution in the water tends to destroy the oxygen-producing algae <Col N="434" /> in the seas.  Nature is again disturbed here and while we pump pollutants with which nature cannot cope into the waters we make the waters more toxie and we kill off natural agencies or destroy natural cycles that would enable nature to cope with our prodigality.</P>
    <P>This is what we are up against.  I do not wish to delay the House but without going into very much more detail we have here in the pollution of waters a threat to the whole balance of nature and the cycles that nature maintains to keep the various biological species alive and in being.  If these cycles breakdown it means death to these species; if they break down completely it would mean death to living things in the very narrow skin in which life is lived in this planet.  This is what we must appreciate is involved.  When we appreciate the danger of it, aesthetic considerations, the ugliness of tin cans on the roadside and so on, pale into insignificance compared with the reality of the threat we face in this matter.</P>
    <P>What is happening to the waters which are necessary for the maintenance of these life cycles?  It is very easy to see broadly what is happening. While nature was well able to cope man dumped all his waste over to nature and nature was able to take care of it: it seems as if we cannot do this much longer.  Where else can that waste go?  Short of firing it into space in rockets&mdash;which would not seem to be economically feasible&mdash;we cannot in the long run get rid of our own pollution. What goes into the air stays with us in the biosphere and pollutes the whole cymbiosis of the planets.</P>
    <P>What we put into the water stays there and, worse, the pollutants, whether of the air or of the waters, enter into a set of cycles that are counter to nature's life-giving cycles. Some of the gases being put into the air&mdash;for instance, carbon dioxide&mdash;tax the capacity of the plants and algae in the ocean to deal with them, to process them back to oxygen; but we put in elements that are more noxious.  These are sulphur compound and lead fumes. Where do these go?  Ultimately, they are washed out and enter the waters. Other waste is being put into sewers <Col N="435" /> and this, in turn, goes into the waters. Even if waste is burned, the produce of the burning goes into the water.</P>
    <P>The other day I noticed a heap of rubbish burning near the city. Obviously, it had been saturated with oil so that it would burn.  There was a mess of pollution going into the atmosphere from that fire.  Of course, all such pollution comes back again and, ultimately, goes into the oceans. For practical purposes, the oceans in the past may have provided a sink of unlimited capacity but even in terms of tonnage, the pollution entering the oceans now is significant but, more than that, the subtle small percentage chemicals that make the difference to life are getting into the ocean in significant quantities and polluting it.</P>
    <P>What are the pollutants that we must worry about in respect of the waters? First there are the inorganic poisons, mainly lead, sulphur and mercury. These do not go to the bottom of the sea.  Recently some fish were barred from the market because they were found to be contaminated with an unacceptable level of mercury, a poison that can act in very small quantities. The threat from lead poisoning is the same.</P>
    <P>Then there are the products from agriculture.  In the past farmers and fishermen constituted the link between nature and the sophisticated man in the cities.  The farmer produced food in a natural way for the community.  In so doing he utilised nature's processes.  He used natural fertilisers and the natural bacteria of the soil.  The fisherman did not interfere with nature.  The amount of fish he took from the oceans and the rivers was not enough to upset the balances and the fish were healthy. Now, however, even the farmer and the fisherman, the very last links of humanity with nature, have found themselves in conflict with nature.  The farmer is using artificial manures.  Of course, he achieves good results in terms of production.  These fertilisers are being pressed on him by industry, but he must use them in concentrations that are threatening the microscopic balance of life in the soil he tills and which are polluting waters and <Col N="436" /> threatening certain forms of life.  The farmer, too, is using pesticides that are designed to kill: DDT and chlorinated hydrocarbons of all sorts are being used.  Their primary effect is the killing of insects but we do not know yet the extent to which that is significant in influencing nature's balances.  Whatever may be the question in that respect, there is no question as to the effect of DDT when it gets into the ocean. Already there is significant pollution of the ocean as a result of that manmade compound, a compound that nature did not develop.  The damage is being done by compounds that are being developed against nature.  Significant levels of this poison have been found in animal and plant life as far away as the Antarctic Ocean.</P>
    <P>The fisherman is now using powered boats and contributing inevitably, with the modern mechanical boat, to oil and other pollutants of the waters. Regarding pesticides, it has been proved that bird life in agricultural countries is being affected seriously, probably because of dressings for seeds.  However, we are not concerned here on this Bill with the preservation of bird life, so I shall get back to the question of the waters.  Sewage in concentrated loads is being channelled into the sea.  Animal sewage in reasonable proportions could be dealt with by nature.  Nature has provided bacteria and other chemical and biological agencies for dealing with sewage.  The problem in connection with sewage, as in the case of fertilisers, is the high concentration at which it is being put in at local points.  Animal sewage pollutes local waters more so than the ocean as a whole because of this concentration.  It is not only animal sewage that is being channelled into the waters from households but there are also the detergents and other items that are sold in the supermarket for the convenience of the housewife.  Also, industrial waste of all kinds is being channelled in together with sewage. There is also the problem of plastics &mdash;something that was not in nature's scheme&mdash;and there is the all-pervasive problem of oil.</P>
    <P>The pollution that results from oil is more serious than merely a question of dirt in the water.  The incident <Col N="437" /> regarding the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> caused much anxiety and there is much talk of the pollution of the seas by commercial oil.  Oil covers the surface of the water and that is significant in that it covers the natural biological reactions in the surface layers of the sea which are essential, but the trouble concerning oil is that it goes further than that.  Oil happens to be a perfect absorbent for many of the other poisons that we are putting into the waters.  It is a very fine vehicle for distributing these poisons over the oceans and also of keeping them in the areas where life is threatened.</P>
    <P>The last element I wish to deal with is nuclear waste.  There is radioactive waste, highly toxic industrial refuse, chemical warfare gases, and waste from munitions.  Anything that people want to get rid of is dumped into the sea.  How can mankind cope with this problem?  Since man has brought this problem upon himself there is the necessity for using his inventive genius and technology to process this dangerous waste which he has created and which he finds Mother Nature can no longer handle for him.  This is not only a social problem but an economic one also.  It will involve the whole earth.  It cannot be solved in any particular area.  There is very little we can do even about the purity of our territorial waters.  We can try to keep our beaches clean.  The areas around our own shores must be kept clean. We must allow as little pollution as possible into the sea.</P>
    <P>As was said last week, we are still in a fortunate position in regard to our water supply as compared with others. Now is the time to take precautions and to exercise strict control.  We must be careful of what is allowed into our rivers, streams and lakes.  By doing so we will keep our own environment clean.  We will preserve life in our own area.  We will also help mankind.  Such a programme will require monetary assistance.  Many economic forces are acting in the other direction.  While we have still much unpolluted water, we have all seen the warning signs in the River Liffey, the River Blackwater and some of our lakes.  Deputy Sir A. Esmonde and Deputy Carter spoke <Col N="438" /> about these problems.  There is the problem of silage and of the discharge from piggeries, to say nothing of the local government problems of waste and of the effects of detergents of one kind or another.  We must define the problem in practical terms and decide how to cope with it.</P>
    <P>Again I should like to stress that this is not just a local problem.  It is not a problem of convenience or aesthetics.  It is a problem which we ourselves have created in our own particular way.  It is part of a problem which involves the survival of ourselves as well as the survival of the rest of mankind.</P>

      <P>Last Saturday week in my home town in the constituency of Carlow/Kilkenny the results of a competition run by the National Waters Conservation Association were announced. I was saddened to see the winning poster with the plea &ldquo;Let It Live&rdquo;, which won first prize.  This was a plea from a young student for the River Barrow in Carlow.  The poster portrayed a pipe with a fluid running from it into the river, and two fishing rods.  I would like to show that poster in this House tonight but I believe it is against the regulations to do so.</P>

      <P>One rod caught a kettle and the other one the skeleton of a fish.  There were many posters with similar themes.  The competition was for students in the age group seven to 17 years.  This brought home to me that the young people of today are very conscious of the serious problem of pollution and are asking for a solution to it.  It is up to us as legislators to heed the plea of these young people and to ensure that they have unpolluted water in which to swim and fish.</P>
      <P>On the 6th May, 1968&mdash;I think that is the correct date&mdash;the European Waters Charter of the Council of Europe declared that there is no life without water and that it is a treasure indispensable to all human activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> In this country we have inadequate and archaic laws governing pollution. The penalties for their contravention are also inadequate and archaic.  We are in a favourable position to outlaw pollution.  Our national waters are wholly under our control and with the co-operation of the people of this island can become a very special place where people can live in pleasant surroundings.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry is very much to the forefront today and has been much discussed in this House.  In the future, it will repay one hundredfold every effort made to eradicate the pollution of our rivers and lakes, and of the sea.  We are trying to attract tourists.  The introduction of legislation to deal with pollution should be a priority of the Minister.  There are 100,000 anglers in this country.  Each year competitions are organised which attract visitors from all over the world.  There was an article in the <i>Evening Press</i> on 29th July, 1971, which would make one wonder why such tourists should come.  It read:</P>
    <P>Thousands of trout, bream, perch and rudd floated dead or dying on the surface of a score of lakes and rivers throughout the country this morning as pollution of Irish waters reached its worst-ever level.</P>
    <P>I believe the necessity for centralising responsibility for pollution control has been clear for a long time.  Deputy Luke Belton's Bill seeks to do this. Local authorities&mdash;and I must confess I am a member of a local authority, the Carlow Council&mdash;have been irresponsible to a certain extent in their approach to sewage disposal, and industry has for too long been free from the kind of control this Bill proposes to introduce.</P>
    <P>The problem of pollution will become every year more and more expensive to solve.  Now is the time to tackle it and to create the natural environment which can be the envy of every country in Europe.  Past generations have created city slums. This generation has gone far in destroying natural amenities and turning beautiful lakes and rivers into dumps for sewage and industrial waste.  We <Col N="440" /> have our chance here in this House to reverse all this.  We owe it to future generations to pass on unashamed a heritage of natural amenities.  We can make a beginning with this Bill.</P>
    <P>The appeal of the Carlow student poster &ldquo;Let It Live&rdquo; was a plea for the River Barrow.  It is echoed and reechoed not alone in my own constituency but all over Ireland wherever a river flows or the waters of a lake reflect a family picnic or a fisherman. We have an opportunity in this House to answer the appeal of this youth who was so interested in the River Barrow, which flows through Carlow. I say: let all our lakes and all our rivers live, so that this young schoolboy and all our youth may, as adults, live a life enriched by the natural beauty we have played our small part to preserve.  Let me appeal to the Members on every side of this House to give their wholehearted support to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the initiative shown by the Deputies who were responsible for preparing and introducing this Bill.  I wish also to thank those who contributed in a commendably reasoned way to the debate.  I accept that the Bill is intended as a constructive attempt to solve the water pollution problem which, as Deputy de Valera very ably stated, is a world problem.</P>
      <P>The water pollution problem is a very complex one, and while the Bill would throw heavy responsibilities on to local authorities and on to certain private individuals, I have no guarantee that it would achieve its purpose, praiseworthy though that purpose is. It would be a pity to try to combat pollution with the wrong weapons, and I am sure Deputy Belton would agree wholeheartedly with that statement. To do so could seriously jeopardise the prospects of success of the more comprehensive proposals which I hope to bring forward in the House in the not too distant future and to which I referred before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before commenting on the provisions of the Bill I should say that a necessary preliminary to the preparation of sound legislation is to secure adequate control, <Col N="441" /> and to secure that control is, first of all, to establish the nature and extent of the problem.  Informed policy decisions cannot be taken in the absence of sound information on the facts of the situation.  Furthermore, the various aspects of the problem, the administrative, financial and legislative ones are all inter-related, and ultimately the legislation must reflect the conclusions as to what needs to be done and what can be done.</P>
    <P>These are some of the main reasons which influenced me already in setting up the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Air and Water Pollution, and, as I have told the House before, this group are examining all aspects of the problem, including the question of legislation.  I have received a statement from the working group outlining the progress which they have made to date. While up to the present they have examined the various aspects of the problem which I referred to them, of necessity much of the time that they have spent working on this has been devoted to obtaining and analysing information, reviewing existing procedures for control of pollution and examining various possible lines of action to deal with it.  A number of surveys and investigations have been or are being carried out by or for Departments represented on the working group and by semi-State and other public bodies.  These include the national survey of rivers by An Foras Forbartha, to which I shall refer later. The report on this survey has not yet been published, but the results have already been available to the group. My own Department is carrying out a comprehensive survey of local authority sewage systems.  These will identify systems which are causing pollution in the receiving waters and will give information about the remedial works which should be undertaken in these cases, together with estimates of the cost of these works.  It will also produce other relevant information, including details of the population equivalent of industrial wastes accepted into the systems.  Another important survey being carried out by my Department covers industries which are liable to give rise to major effluent problems. This survey is designed to obtain <Col N="442" /> information on the nature of the effluents, the planning and other conditions applicable and the system of checks in operation to ensure compliance with the conditions.</P>
    <P>Some of the basic information required by the working group has only recently come to hand and other relevant material is not yet available. The group is concerned with air as well as water pollution but, at my request, they are preparing, as a matter of urgency, an interim report dealing with the water pollution aspect.  The group expect to produce this report within three to four months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did indeed.  I am now giving the Deputy a fair assessment of how long it will take to have the report available and I am committing myself to that period of time. This is, I think, reasonable.  It is the only thing I can do in the circumstances because the job is both comprehensive and complex.  The group will deal with the nature and extent of the whole problem of water pollution, the administrative framework required, including the question of securing co-ordination between the various agencies involved, and also the economic aspects, including capital cost and incentives, the legal framework required, including enforcement powers and penalties, and the need for further research and technical consideration of water quality criteria and standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the House to remember that, without the results of an investigation such as that being undertaken by the working group, it would be unwise to frame legislation to control water pollution.  As the Minister who would be responsible for implementing any legislation enacted, I deem it my duty to be satisfied that it is the right legislation and, above all, that it will <Col N="443" /> be effective.  I cannot, I am afraid, regard the present Bill as meeting those requirements, however much I endorse the intentions of the proposers.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the Minister shall declare standards of purity for all waters, shall then ascertain whether, and to what extent, the waters are being or have been polluted and, if he is satisfied that pollution is occurring, shall require the local authority, or local authorities, concerned to take immediate steps to bring the water up to standard.  It proposes to utilise receiving water standards as opposed to effluent standards as the criteria for the protection of waters from pollution.</P>
    <P>It also provides that, if pollution is being caused by the acts of a local authority, it must cease such acts within such period as may be specified by the Minister.  Similarly, if pollution is being caused by any other person, that person must cease such acts within such period as may be specified by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Whether receiving water standards or effluent standards should be selected as the basis for controls, or, as seems more likely, whether some combination of the two is required, is a difficult question and one on which I hope the interdepartmental working group will give advice: but, even if the principle of receiving water standards were adopted, the Bill would leave many problems and, if I may say so, the real practical problems unanswered. For example, our rivers are generally small and not infrequently a number of sources of pollution can occur at close intervals.  In the case of organic discharges in particular the maximum depression in stream quality may occur at a considerable distance&mdash;in some cases, some miles&mdash;downstream of the discharge point.  The allocation of responsibility for pollution as defined in this Bill to any single discharge would, therefore, be extremely difficult to prove.  It would be virtually impossible in many instances to determine which of a number of discharges upstream of a polluted stretch of river is responsible for the pollution and it <Col N="444" /> would, indeed, be impossible to allocate responsibility between them. Again, it might be that a number of discharges contribute to pollution, but that any one or more of them, without the others, could be safely absorbed by the receiving waters.  It would take more than a Solomon to decide under the Bill which of the effluents should cease.  Furthermore, the control of sea and estuarine pollution by reference to a prescribed standard for the receiving water raises extraordinary, if not insoluble, problems owing to the difficulty in defining a standard in such circumstances and in allocating responsibility for pollution.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that this shows that the Bill is premature in the sense that it precedes the preliminary investigation of all the difficult issues which must be resolved before effective legislation can be produced.  The Bill raises many other problems, but it is, I think, sufficient to point out those that seem to present the most basic difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is quite likely that there is need for new legislation, but on this question I must reserve my position until the working group have reported and the position can be assessed in the light of fuller information than is available at present.  Major issues will arise in any consideration of a new statutory system for the control or management of water resources.  We would have to be quite sure, therefore, that any new system was well calculated to suit our particular conditions.  A system which seems to work well in another country might or might not work well here. One possibility is&mdash;I throw it out as a suggestion&mdash;that water boards might be set up to assume responsibility for water control and anti-pollution measures on a river catchment basis.  This is the approach in some countries and it has some attractions; it would, however, tend towards a fragmentation and division of responsibility as between local and regional bodies.  The question is whether it would solve some problems of co-ordination at the expense of creating others?  As an alternative, a new system might be based on the local authority areas with a co-ordinating committee of interests concerned at regional level.  It might <Col N="445" /> be that such an arrangement would better enable environmental considerations to be taken into account in basic planning.  Clearly, many environmental matters, and questions of air and water pollution particularly, are no respecters of administrative boundaries and cannot be determined entirely on a local basis.  Whatever arrangements are decided on will, therefore, have to include adequate provision for co-ordination and direction of all the overall anti-pollution programmes at higher level.</P>
    <P>To be effective, new legislation would need to be supported by a complete system of water standards based on suitable criteria.  These would have to cover what might be termed the permissible level of pollution in any stretch of water, taking account of the purposes for which the water is needed, and of such complicating factors as local conditions of climate, geography and geology.  There would also have to be standards with which effluents to that water would have to comply and such standards would have to be consistent on a national basis and would also have to take account of local conditions. To develop a complete system of this kind will take a great deal of research into such matters as appropriate quality criteria, flow variations, the existing and potential demand for water for various purposes and the self-purification capacity of certain waters.</P>
    <P>I would envisage such detailed research being undertaken by An Foras Forbartha as a follow-up to the national water survey it has completed. More detailed studies have already been undertaken in a number of regions. The purpose of this survey was to examine the quality and quantity aspects of Irish rivers.  It was carried out at my request by the water resources division of An Foras Forbartha and a national survey has now been completed of 121 of the main rivers, using 765 sampling stations at strategic locations.  In most cases both the chemical and biological features of the rivers were examined.  A report on the preliminary survey will be published shortly.  Basically, it will show that water quality is satisfactory over more than 80 per cent of the total <Col N="446" /> length surveyed; that serious pollution now exists over about 7 per cent and that the condition of a further 10 per cent gives cause for some concern.</P>
    <P>I think it is a reasonable assumption that the rivers not covered in the survey are generally in a satisfactory condition though there are no doubt problem stretches in some areas.  The report will be a significant addition to our knowledge of the problem we are up against and a valuable basis for future research on the lines I have already referred to.</P>
    <P>As I have a copy of the report.  I should like to quote briefly from it.  It is The National Survey of Irish Rivers, a Report on Water Quality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this report public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not public yet but it will be within the next few days.  I shall just read the conclusions.  It is a rather long report.  I quote:</P>
      <P>A total of 2,900 km of river length,</P>
      <P>that is roughly 1,812 miles</P>
      <P>excluding estuarine waters, was examined in this survey.  While this is a small proportion of the total length of freshwater river channel in the country, it represents the more important fraction of this resource both in regard to population distribution and industrial concentration.  On the basis of biological examination, the river length surveyed is distributed in three quality classes in the following manner:</P>
      <P>It then gives the figures I have already given.  The quality rating &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo; was given to 2,400 km, &ldquo;Doubtful&rdquo; to 300 km and &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; to 200 km, which is roughly 125 miles. It goes on:</P>
      <P>Thus some 83 per cent of the river length examined is in a satisfactory condition, while some 17 per cent is less than satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most cases the reaches seriously affected are quite short although on some major rivers the polluted zones extend for a considerable length. However, even a short stretch in which bad conditions prevail may <Col N="447" /> seriously affect fish.  It is important to note that major rivers like the Barrow, Clare and Suir, in the catchments of which are some large towns and industries, and which are of prime fishing interest, all show serious deterioration over relatively long stretches.  At places conditions are acute on these and other rivers, for example, the Ara, Camlin and Castlebar.  It is quite evident that the waste-carrying capacities of these rivers have at times been exceeded.</P>
    <P>The survey shows, therefore, that there is significant pollution on some stretches of Irish rivers.  Most of the pollution results from the discharge of organic wastes, not necessarily sewage, and in only a few instances were there indications of toxic pollution. With the growth of industrialisation, however, it is perhaps inevitable that toxic pollution will become more widespread.  The present survey has identified the polluted reaches of the rivers examined. The next planned step is to study these in depth to define the extent of the problems.  Not less important, a continuing check will be kept on the presently clean rivers to ensure that adverse changes are detected.</P>
    <P>This booklet will be available to the public some time next week.  It contains a very detailed scientific analysis of the biological quality of all the rivers that were examined.</P>

      <P>The overall impression given in that report confirms the view I have expressed on previous occasions that the water pollution problem is limited in scale but of sufficient dimension to warrant special attention in view particularly of the prospects of intensified urban, industrial and agricultural development in the future. That is why I set up the working group. I have already indicated that their work is progressing and that I expect a report from them within the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> The issues involved in water pollution are complex.  The completion and consideration of the group's report, the further detailed research which will be essential, the preparation and enactment of whatever legislative measures may be decided on and bringing them into operation will take considerable time.  It is essential that the right decisions are made and that new arrangements are based on adequate research and information.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy Belton, who has introduced this Bill, and all Members of the House, that it is my intention to introduce a comprehensive code for this country controlling all forms of air and water pollution that will be adequate to deal effectively with these forms of pollution over the next 50 years.  I want also to assure the House that I am dedicated to this task.  I believe the House and the people will support me in my desire to introduce comprehensive measures.  Piecemeal measures aimed at blocking a gap here and there are not what is required to deal with this problem.  I have accepted criticism for the delay so far in bringing forward the measures I speak of now.  Because of the need for careful research and the dangers of premature legislation I am prepared to accept criticism of some further delays until the best measures possible have been worked out.  I want to assure the House, however, that I would be in no way satisfied to allow the position to drift in the meantime. To judge from some of the contributions to the debate one would think that there is at present no control worth talking about over the discharge of effluent.  This is far from the actual position.  There are extensive controls and on the whole they are reasonably effective.  Furthermore, I have made some arrangements and have further steps under consideration to tighten up loopholes in the period until the need for comprehensive new arrangements can be fully assessed.</P>
    <P>At a time when local authorities are revising their plans under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, it is well to remember that any planning authority may include in their plans objectives for prohibiting, regulating or controlling the <Col N="449" /> deposit or disposal of waste material and refuse, the disposal of sewage and the pollution of rivers, lakes, ponds, gullies and the seashore.  All significant private development and the local authorities' own working must be essentially consistent with the development plan objectives.  Development generally is subject to local planning control.  The agricultural sector generally is an exception and does not come within this control but steps are being taken to reduce the problems of water pollution arising from agricultural activities.  I shall come to that later.</P>
    <P>It can be taken, therefore, that close control can be and is exercised by local authorities on the discharge of effluent from new industrial, residential and other physical developments. Powers to take action to remedy existing pollution are conferred on local authorities by older legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether as an interim measure the planning control of local authorities under the Planning and Development Act should be strengthened particularly as regards established activities which are causing pollution is something I have under active consideration at present.  The problems the Deputy is referring to are all being <Col N="450" /> considered by the group I have mentioned. I recently wrote to all planning authorities urging them to use their powers to prevent any new sources of serious water pollution being created and to assist them in this task and to achieve a consistent approach, I have underlined the main considerations which should be taken into account in examining proposals for new or expanded industries.  These considerations include such matters as the degree of spare capacity in the existing sewers and treatment works and in the case of any extensions of capacity proposed whether it is intended that the spare capacity should be allocated to a single industry or should be spread between a number, the possibility of balancing industrial flows over an extended period or limiting them to particular times, the expected future demand for disposal facilities for effluent through the sewers and treatment works.  Other important aspects of the problem which I have pointed out are whether in a particular case it might be reasonable to allow an industry to install treatment by stages as the industry expands gradually to full production, and whether as a condition of planning permission an industry should be required to contribute financially to the provision of special treatment or disposal facilities.</P>
    <P>The findings of the Foras Forbartha water survey have already been made available to local authorities and this information will be of considerable assistance to them when they come to review their development plans, as they are doing at the moment, and in considering the conditions that need to be attached to planning permissions.</P>
    <P>As an even further guide to local authorities, I have drawn their attention to various relevant publications, including recommendations for the disposal of industrial effluent waters, produced by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and, indeed, if I may say so, to judge from the contribution of Deputy Belton and others, there seems to be considerable misunderstanding about the powers of local authorities to control industrial effluent.  The effluent recommendations of the institute to which I have referred are used by the Industrial Development <Col N="451" /> Authority in their dealings with applicants for industrial grant assistance and such assistance is conditional on satisfactory arrangements being undertaken in regard to the treatment and disposal of effluent.  But, independently of this, these standards or other appropriate standards or conditions relating to the satisfactory treatment and disposal of effluent may be attached by a planning authority as conditions of a planning permission and such conditions are enforceable by law under the 1963 Planning Act. So there is no question about this and I am urging on planning authorities the need for prompt enforcement action wherever approved plans are not followed or conditions attached are not complied with.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, I am asking the planning authorities to let me have a list of industrial and other activities in their areas which are likely to give rise to major effluent problems and have given them a list of the most likely types of activities to look out for.  I have also asked for full details of the effluent treatment standards being applied by local authorities at present and of any problems that exist and any new works that are proposed by them.  This information is complementary to the information on river pollution level which is being assembled by An Foras.  It will give immediate assistance to the inter-departmental working group and it is essential groundwork for the future anti-pollution programme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the response from the local authorities.  I should like to deal with agriculture and special problems arising from agricultural developments.  We know that changes in farming methods and more intensive types of farming have greatly <Col N="452" /> increased the dangers of water pollution from agriculture.  As it stands, the use of land for agricultural purposes and the provision of agricultural buildings are not subject to control under the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1963.  A great deal depends, therefore, on the efforts of the agricultural advisory service to secure voluntary co-operation of farmers in measures to remedy the existing problems and to prevent future pollution.  Fairly good progress has been made through the advisory service and in connection with the administration of the farm buildings grants scheme towards a greater awareness in the farming community of the pollution dangers and a greater readiness to take action to prevent pollution. Still, problems of pollution from agricultural activity continue and some of these can be serious.  This is one of the aspects being considered by the inter-departmental working group.  The position has been the subject of special discussions between my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and in consequence of these discussions I have written to all sanitary authorities advising them of new arrangements to secure closer co-operation between the parties concerned in agricultural developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is being recommended that where pollution from farming is suspected the first approach by the local authority should be to the chief agricultural officer so that the possibilities of getting the position remedied by voluntary action will be fully explored before there is any question of invoking statutory powers.  If a farmer does not act on the advice of the chief agricultural officer in the matter it will be open to the local authority to take all necessary steps to secure abatement of the pollution.  This approach is designed to ensure that the agricultural advisory services are fully availed of to achieve remedial action on a voluntary basis.  To assist them further, the local authorities have been issued with appropriate material and advice dealing with silage effluent and farmyard waste problems, as prepared by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  In general, planning authorities are strongly urged to consult with <Col N="453" /> the chief agricultural officer concerned in dealing with applications for planning permission for agricultural development which may pose particular problems in regard to pollution.</P>
    <P>This voluntary approach backed up by the agricultural advisory services and the grants schemes is expected to yield good progress.  However, it may not be the complete answer and avoidable abuses may remain.  So, I am also considering, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, whether some modification of the present exemption from control under the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1963, of certain forms of large-scale and intensive agricultural activities would not be in the public interest.  This is not an easy matter to decide.  Controls which would be an undue impost on the farming community or that would impose a great deal of additional work on planning authorities should be avoided.  On the other hand, there clearly needs to be an effective system of control, whether voluntary or statutory, on such intensive farming activities as large-scale piggeries or poultry houses which can give rise to serious pollution and amenity problems.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion that came up during the course of the debate here and that was mentioned a few times is that there should be unified responsibility in matters relating to water pollution.  I am not too clear as to what exactly is meant by the suggestion but I know that in some countries a separate department has been set up for the environment.  This has been done in an attempt to get all the relevant activities under one roof, as it were.  This kind of arrangement has a strong appeal on paper but so far as I know it does not always work out that well.  I do not think it should be overlooked that in this country we have already a high degree of unified responsibility and control in matters relating to the use of water resources and this operates through the local government system as a whole.  So we can take it that at local level development plans are in operation already in all areas, indicating the local development objectives, including <Col N="454" /> amenities of course, and conservation objectives and development control is exercised in the spirit and the context of these objectives.</P>
    <P>At national level my Department has a co-ordinating role in relation to the local development and environmental plans.  It also has responsibility for regional planning, housing, the roads programme and for the sanitary services programme.  More recently my Department has taken on central and co-ordinating responsibility in relation to air and water pollution problems as is reflected in the setting up of the inter-departmental group in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>An Foras is, of course, the national body basically involved in environmental research and works in close liaison with my Department.  The working group on air and water pollution and, in its own area, the regional development committee which also works for my Department, are all means of securing basic liaison with other Departments and public bodies concerned with a view to ensuring consistency in planning and development objectives with proper regard to environmental considerations.</P>
    <P>It will be for this working group to advise whether further organisational measures are needed.  At this stage, however, I must say that I am not at all convinced that any attempt to have a completely unified responsibility for environmental matters or matters bearing on the use of water resources would not create more problems than it would solve.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I have gone into it in greater detail than anybody, through dealing with it in my Department. It is an essential principle that environmental implications should be considered in the basic planning for any sector.</P>
      <P>From this point of view, segregation of environmental from developmental responsibility could well be a step in the wrong direction.  I believe that at the moment we have a reasonable balance in unified responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> Arrangements have been made in my Department to proceed with suitable environmental measures in the context of physical and regional development programmes and taking account in due course of the report of the working group.</P>
    <P>During the debate Deputy Bruton criticised the staffing arrangements in the Department for dealing with pollution matters.  He said that one section, the sanitary services section, is responsible for pollution matters and sanitary services functions generally. This is not so.  As the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cunningham, pointed out to Deputy Bruton when he made this statement, I had already informed the House on the 27th October last &mdash;column 440, Volume 256 of the Official Report&mdash;that, in view of the importance I attached to pollution, a new section to deal specifically with environmental matters had been established in my Department.</P>
    <P>The sections of the Department are not all shown separately in the Book of Estimates from which Deputy Bruton quoted.  It is normal practice to group related sections in this publication. The new section, the environmental services section, will of course be shown separately in the Directory of State Services for 1972 which will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also compared the number of staff in the sanitary and environmental service sections with that in the roads sections.  In this connection it should be borne in mind that there are four separate roads and traffic sections which are responsible for various aspects of roads administration, including motor taxation, driver testing, road safety, vehicle fitness, <i>et cetera,</i> in addition to the roads works programme involving large scale expenditure. The staffing requirements of the new environmental services section will, of course, be kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that in their ongoing programmes of work for the provision and improvement of sanitary services, local authorities are doing work of real practical value in regard to pollution.  Every new treatment <Col N="456" /> works built, every improvement of public water supplies, is of value.  I should like now to give a few facts.  I recently announced my approval of the contract documents submitted by Dublin Corporation for the construction of the first major stage, costing £2.2 million, of a scheme designed to provide modern sewage treatment works for Dublin.  The estimated cost is in the region of £3.5 million.  This will deal in the first instance with flows coming through the new Dodder Valley sewer, which is costing £2.5 million and which is scheduled for completion in 1974.  This sewer, in addition to opening up 6,300 acres of new land for development in the Tallaght area, will ensure that the Dodder river will be free from pollution. Already there has been substantial improvement in the Dodder as a result of the interception by the Dodder Valley scheme of certain discharges which previously contributed to the pollution of that river.</P>
    <P>There has also been some improvement in the Tolka as a result of special works carried out by the corporation. The treatment works will also cater for flows from the Greater Dublin Drainage Scheme, on sections of which work has already commenced.  This is estimated to cost £6.5 million.  This scheme will eliminate the main cause of pollution of the Liffey and the Camac.  The total estimated cost of these schemes is £12½ million.  That is a commitment to deal in a practical way with the problem.  Work is already under way.</P>
    <P>Another capital expenditure in water and sewerage schemes is the annual sum which has been increased from £2.28 million in 1967-68 to £4.89 million in 1970-71.  The outgoings for last year are estimated at £6.25 million. There again is ample evidence of increasing commitments by way of practical allocations.  There is also the recent Government decision to provide additional capital for sanitary services in 1972-73.  It has enabled the commencement of additional water and sewerage schemes to a total value of approximately £2.2 million.</P>
    <P>Another point made during the debate was the health aspect.  In particular. Deputy Belton tried hard to <Col N="457" /> suggest that there is or that there could be a health hazard for bathers on Dublin beaches.  He was quite unable to substantiate that with any relevant information or expert advice when challenged to do so by me.  The evidence available to me is that there is nothing to support the view that swimmers in the sea around Dublin are putting their health at risk.  The evidence is that no relationship can be established between the incidence of communicable diseases and bathing in sea water contaminated by sewage.  The view has been expressed by expert authorities that no major outbreak of serious disease has ever been traced to sea bathing, even in the most heavily contaminated waters.  This of course is not to suggest that having to swim through sewage is a pleasant or acceptable condition.  It is not, and I have indicated what is being done spent on by way of the moneys being spent on new sewage works, but I want to nail any suggestion, whether intentional or not, that existing conditions in the sea around Dublin or anywhere else present health hazards.  There is absolutely nothing to support that view.  Pollution in coastal waters is an amenity problem, not a health problem.</P>
    <P>On the question of oil pollution of the sea, at national level responsibility for arrangements for the clearance of oil pollution in and around the coast has now been vested in my Department and arrangements are now in hand to set up a system to deal with it.  In the meantime, local authorities have been asked to see what they can do to deal with any local problem that may arise.  Any larger problems will be handled through co-operation between the various bodies that are in a position to help.</P>
    <P>My concern will be with the clearance of such pollution as may occur in and around the coastline at any time. Control of pollution from the sea, whether from discharges or accidental spillages of oil or noxious substances, will depend heavily on international agreements being made and, of course, being observed.  The inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation have sponsored a number of conventions on oil pollution of the sea by ships which this country has <Col N="458" /> either implemented or is considering implementing.  The organisation are considering soon extending to all noxious substances the existing restrictions on oil pollution of the sea by ships.</P>
    <P>In this country, the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts apply to all ships in Irish territorial waters and to Irish ships on the high seas.  Proceedings for contravention of any Acts may be taken by the Minister for Transport and Power or where the contravention occurs in a harbour, by the appropriate harbour authorities.  Harbour authorities also have powers to make bye-laws on the discharge and handling of petroleum in their areas and there are additional controls of discharges into the sea or on State owned foreshores without authority and also on the dumping of rubbish into harbours.  I would recommend strongly to harbour authorities to exercise to the fullest the powers they have been given.  I know many of them are very vigilant in this respect.</P>
    <P>The question of cost, of course, is something of which there was very little mention during the debate.  There was great silence on this whole question of cost although it must be accepted that it is a vital aspect.  There is no use introducing measures unless we are satisfied they are financially as well as technically feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned the debate I was having words with the Minister about a question which I raised in the House and the reply to which I attributed to him.  I attributed it to him wrongly because I now see that the reply was given by the Taoiseach. It it a question referred to in <Col N="459" /> the Dáil Official Report for 29th February last at column 509.  I asked the Taoiseach:</P>
      <P>if, having regard to the large number of existing and future draft rules, regulations and directives of the European Communities he will agree to the establishment of an all-party permanent committee of the Dáil to study the existing body of the Communities' legislation and future draft amendments and addenda, so that the Dáil may make comments and proposals thereon as the need may arise and thereby continue its prime function as a legislative body; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's reply was:</P>
      <P>The question of procedures to facilitate the examination by the Oireachtas of Community legislation and, in particular, proposals for new legislation, is receiving attention.  It is my intention at the appropriate time to seek the views of the other political parties on this question.</P>
      <P>I asked a further question of the Taoiseach:</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that this is a very urgent matter, that there is a vast number of rules and regulations and a vast amount of legislation, actual or intended, building up in Brussels, and that it is highly desirable that this House, as one of the legislative arms of the State&mdash;the Seanad is the other&mdash; should be aware in advance of all that is even contemplated?  This is essential if our function as legislators is to continue in the future.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach replied:</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be sure that I have sympathy with that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have the strange revelation today that the Taoiseach, having expressed sympathy with that point of view, having said it in the Dáil on the 29th February, &ldquo;the question of setting up a committee of the House is receiving attention&rdquo;, the Minister <Col N="460" /> for Foreign Affairs is not quite in sympathy with the proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I did not answer the question.  The Deputy said I answered it.  I said I did not but I did not reject the principle.  The Deputy is being inaccurate.  His charity only extends to his memory of long distance statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My charity is all embracing in both time and location.  I would not wish to misconstrue what the Minister said or intended.  I certainly interpreted not only from what he said but from the gestures and intonations that accompanied it, that he was not in sympathy with the Fine Gael proposal that there should be a foreign affairs committee of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is resolved now.  We know the Taoiseach is in agreement with a foreign affairs committee, that he is giving the matter his attention, but the Minister is not apparently aware that the matter is receiving attention or he surely would not have spoken the way he did earlier. This is not a revolutionary suggestion. It is now the accepted practice in all modern democracies.  It is a necessity because of the complexity of international relations, because of the all-embracing nature of international obligations.  We should not delay any longer in this much needed reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think people have sufficiently copped on to the prospect that if the referendum is carried on the 10th of May this year we will have to nominate ten Members of the Oireachtas to represent this country in the European Parliament and that these Members will be absent from this country for about six months of the year at the European Parliament and the various Committees of the Parliament doing the nation's work.  These people will be as important&mdash;in some respects more important&mdash;as some of the Ministers who may be attending the ordinary Ministerial conferences, who will have available to them the most expert advice from our own Civil Service and from our own Diplomatic <Col N="461" /> Corps.  Our Parliamentarians in the European Parliament and the various Committees will have to be very well aware of what is going on and what is anticipated in order that they can bring proper influence to bear in Europe and in turn acquaint this House and the people of this country with what is happening in Europe.  If we are going in we will only be in a minority in the European Parliament, but it is important that that minority be as effective as it can be.  This will not be so unless we treat this as a matter of urgency.  I hope before the month of May is out that we will have established as a permanent part of our parliamentary institutions an active, regularly meeting and properly informed foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as I mentioned, in his brief spoke about foreign affairs being a network of relations, exchanges and contacts of every kind. We cannot adequately cope with all the intricacies and depth of international relations, exchanges and contacts without having an active foreign affairs committee.  It is quite probable that as the years go no Members of this House will have to become more specialised in a limited number of topics to give adequate service to our people, but we will not be able to do that as long as we carry on everything in the slipshod way we have been doing in the past.  As I pointed out at the outset, it is two years since this House, to any sensible degree, discussed foreign affairs.  On a number of occasions when we raised matters at Question Time we were told by the Minister and the Taoiseach that it was not a suitable way in which to discuss the problem, that it would need to be thoroughly debated.  This is a view that we shared over the last two years of the most challenging and changing time in our own affairs and international relations, a time during which we have been stopped because of the pressure of other business from having an adequate discussion or examination of where we were going in international affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister by the depth of his contribution has recognised the need for this study in depth of our particular <Col N="462" /> position in the modern world. I think he probably shares with me a realisation that this is not good enough, that we need to be more extensive in our coverage of foreign relations in future.  Of course, world relations will certainly be foreign and will involve very many countries, not only those in the EEC but also the reaction of other countries, the eastern bloc, the American, Asian and Australian continents and the rest of the world, the Third World with the new entity, the political, economic and social forces that will grow in the world with the expansion of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Irish nationalism will be as relevant as ever within this new environment. Indeed, I believe it will become more important to be truly nationalist in the full and generous meaning of that term.  Nationalism has come under attack because of excesses which were committed in its name, but it is as invalid to attack nationalism because of the sins committed by people who strongly adhere to their patriotic views as it is to attack religion because of atrocities that have been committed by people in the name of their own religious convictions.  We mean by nationalism true patriotism, true love of country, which does not necessarily involve making attacks on others or taking unfair advantages of others.  It is by being mindful of and exercising positive Irish nationalism within the European Economic Community or any other political organisation that we may join that we can best promote our own self interest legitimately.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the need always to have regard to one's own national interest when conducting international affairs, suggesting almost that we should not act unless to our own advantage.  I do not particularly warm to this because it suggests something of the cynicism which is expressed in the idea that we should not bother spitting into an international spitoon until several other people have done the same before us.  This is the kind of thing which has led Ireland into what I think is a very disappointing situation of always waiting until other people move to do the right <Col N="463" /> thing before we think of doing it ourselves. If we have strong faith in what is right we should not hesitate to express our own viewpoint.  We have slipped in the leadership in international affairs in recent times.  The Minister suggests that this is due to a change in the structure of the United Nations caused by nations which were subjected to colonial domination achieving their own independence and now being member states in their own right in the United Nations.  It is argued that they do not need to look to or require the leadership of Ireland in the particular battles they want to conduct because they are able to do it themselves.</P>
    <P>There is some validity in that argument but I do not think it is the full picture.  We have become too anxious not to displease anybody and we will end up in a situation of all too often being, if not at the end of the queue, so far down it that by the time we do the right thing it is not of any significance when we do it.</P>
    <P>Our tardiness in recognising Bangladesh is a case in point.  There 75 million people were subjected to the most appalling tyranny since the tyranny of Nazism.  Throughout that holocaust this country remained silent and even when, with the assistance of India, the people of Bangladesh achieved freedom, when at last there was some hope provided for the ten million refugees who had to leave their country and go to India, we held back from recognising the Republic of Bangladesh.  For a long time before we gave our recognition Bangladesh had fulfilled every known requirement for such recognition.  It had effective control over its own territory, it had its own elected government and had its democratically elected parliament before the country was subjected to tyranny by West Pakistan.  It was totally freed from the domination of West Pakistan because the government of that country were no longer in a position to exert any jurisdiction over the east.</P>
    <P>In our day of struggling for freedom we were only too glad to get recognition from abroad.  We sent people like Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly and others across <Col N="464" /> the world looking for recognition and were glad to get it anywhere.  Yet, after 50 years of our own sovereignty we held back from recognising Bangladesh because we did not want to offend Britain, we did not want to offend any nations in the Commonwealth or to hurt a government which had disgraced themselves before the world in the acts of tyranny and cruelty they had inflicted on their own people.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of timidity which justifies the criticism that our Government have lost that sense of integrity that was once the identifying mark of our conduct in international affairs.  I hope the Government will move away from that &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; all too-cautious do nothing approach.  This approach, apart from being unworthy in itself, has meant that we were not in a position to command support which otherwise would have been made available to us in our own troubles in the last few years.</P>
    <P>In this time of great change we must look to the future.  The Minister's address was a statement of principles of foreign affairs at any time.  It was a useful exercise but it was a pity he did not tell us more about the particular problems of the future and how we might approach them.  I have emphasised the need for true and worthwhile Irish nationalism in relation to our international activities.  We will also need to have a more direct and effective commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms than we have exhibited in recent times.  We must shake off the diplomatic hesitancy and moral cowardice exhibited by us in the last decade.</P>
    <P>Without any equivocation we must renew our declaration of and commitment to military neutrality.  This stand, which at one time I thought to be unchallenged within our own domain, has been qualified by statements of both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach, and by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, in the last decade.  Having for some years embarrassed our European friends as much as they startled home opinion by some of their declarations about readiness to accept military obligations, in recent times they have gone to some pains to assert that membership of the <Col N="465" /> EEC does not involve any military or arms responsibility.  We must not only state what is a fact; we must also not be afraid to state that so long as we have any control over our own affairs we will not be involved in a war.  We must state that we repudiate the use of force or the threat of force to achieve political objectives.</P>
    <P>Our aim has been, and must always be, to work unceasingly for a more just and better balanced European and world order.  This cannot be achieved by the use of force or by the threat of force, either by the Irish nation or by any other nation or bloc.  We want to see an end to hostility not only between nations but between blocs of nations.  Everything we can do to make the EEC and Europe a neutral zone, the more we will contribute positively to the happiness of mankind.</P>
    <P>What is Ireland's position within the EEC?  It does not, as has been acknowledged now, involve any military or arms obligations.  However, we must make of our neutrality something more positive than that.  We must declare that we value our neutrality, and that this will be of benefit to the European Community. We believe there is virtue in keeping the peace and declare to the world that peaceful methods are the best way to achieve worthwhile and lasting objectives.</P>
    <P>We must also be concerned to unite Europe not only in the west but throughout the entire continent.  We must work to achieve membership of the EEC for Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Finland and every other European democracy.  These countries are quoted by people as evidence of countries which are unable to join the EEC because of their commitment to neutrality.  This is an oversimplification of the situation.  Austria and Finland are bound by an international obligation with the USSR not to involve themselves in international association unacceptable to the USSR. Both Austria and Finland want to join the EEC.</P>
    <P>Sweden is tinkering with the problem. Swedish representatives in the Council of Europe usually are irritated when people speak of the four applicants to the EEC because <Col N="466" /> Sweden regards herself as an applicant. Perhaps at the moment she is unable to accept the terms available but she is interested in joining the EEC.  If she does not join now it is more out of regard for Finland and the Nordic alliance than because of any difficulty she might have in relation to the EEC.  Switzerland has such a conception of neutrality that she regards it as a politically sterile condition which prevents her even playing a part as a peaceful nation in bringing peace to mankind, in case she might be interpreted as acting in a hostile manner to some power.</P>
    <P>By preserving our neutrality in the EEC, by keeping it intact and by not allowing it to be sullied, we can help to keep Europe a force interested in peace, not only within itself but for the world.  The member nations of the EEC are as anxious as we should be to see Irish neutrality preserved without any interference or qualification. It is only by respecting our neutrality in that way that the EEC can convince the Doubting Thomases in Sweden and Switzerland of the EEC's total commitment to non-military activity and allay the suspicions of the eastern bloc regarding the intentions of the EEC.  I hope we will renew without qualification our commitment to the principle of neutrality. It fits the three tests mentioned by the Minister&mdash;the national interest, the common interest and a fulfilment to moral and cultural values.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the EEC is portrayed as an association of former colonial states that came together because they lost their colonies.  This may be true so far as a description of the states is concerned, but it is not a true description of the purpose of establishing the EEC.  This resulted out of the sense of shock and disgust that Europeans, by their own deliberate actions and folly, had killed 50 million fellow-Europeans in this century.  Fifty million Europeans were killed by fellow-Europeans in pursuit of policies of non-co-operation which led to hostility and hate between nations and peoples.</P>
    <P>It is because of our conviction that there is no future for mankind in policies of non-co-operation which lead to hostility and hatred that we believe <Col N="467" /> positively in joining the EEC, with the rest of Europe and other nations in order to promote the positive virtues of co-operation and common interest. There is one law of political physics which cannot be too often stated and it is that small powers get most out of large bodies.  There is a general feeling in some spheres in this country that Irish sovereignty will be lost in the EEC and that from now on Ireland will lose more than anybody else.  The truth is that the mighty powers lose more in large bodies than smaller ones.</P>

      <P>DDT is going out of use because it has done more harm to users of it than to the small bodies. I am talking of the value the small powers get out of large bodies and I think the flea world to which Deputy O'Leary refers would acknowledge that small powers get a great deal of value out of large bodies.</P>
      <P>An interesting speech from the Norwegian Foreign Minister might be usefully read into this debate.  It was delivered at the Storting on 14th January and last night I heard Deputy Keating quote the same scripture for another purpose.  His Excellency said:</P>
      <P>History has taught us that small nations have experienced great difficulties in having their sovereignty respected in the international context. Power politics and the dictates of the great powers have often been the fate of small states.  They were often not even consulted but had to accept the result presented to them by the great powers.</P>
      <P>International organisations, however, give small nations the right of being consulted.  That is what we are working to achieve, the right of consultation and the right to ensure our future is determined, not by the <i>ex-parte</i> wishes of the great powers, but after consultation with the little five foot high nations of the world who have a great role to play.  And we can play it so long as we approach it in the positive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every international involvement by <Col N="468" /> this country has been opposed in the past by the &ldquo;little Irelanders&rdquo;.  When first we achieved our independence we did so at that time as a State which was described as a dominion of the British Commonwealth.  But those who at the time said that this would not give us freedom to achieve greater freedom were proved wrong in the event. When in 1923 this State sought to have the Treaty of 1921 recognised as an international treaty they were again laughed at and jeered by the &ldquo;little Irelanders&rdquo; here who professed to be more nationalistic than those they were attacking.  Just as the &ldquo;little Irelanders&rdquo; at home jeered them so did the British Government of the day but nonetheless the Treaty of 1921 was accepted and registered in Geneva as an international agreement.  When we sought to join the League of Nations the &ldquo;little Irelanders&rdquo; were against it saying that Ireland would be destroyed in this new mighty international organisation which would not respect the rights of small nations.  There were those who saw little purpose and possible danger in joining the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>There was not quite as much sneering when we joined the United Nations many years later and, perhaps, there was still less when we went to join OECD but we have a resurrection of the same narrow outlook in these days when we are contemplating joining the EEC.  One hopes the &ldquo;little Irelanders&rdquo; would read something of history and see that this little nation, the first in this century to achieve its freedom, has proved to the world what small bodies can get out of the larger ones and see that it is only by joining such associations and playing a full and positive part in them that we can get something for this country which would never be available to us if we stayed in isolation.</P>
    <P>The EEC is committed not merely to economic growth but to human and social progress.  It has political intentions; it desires to strengthen its own welfare by political developments. These are things which can come about in the course of time and we can be influenced by them if we stay outside whether or not we want to, or we can go in and influence the decisions in <Col N="469" /> our favour by making our contribution there.  Just as we showed Britain and the world that we can bend dominion status to convert a state of being a second rate nation into a state of being a first rate nation, so we can use the institutions and rules and influence within the EEC to work to our national interest and the common interest of all European nations and to promote what we believe in.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I mentioned the need to promote nationalism in its true and worthwhile sense.  I suppose it is because nationalism was related to the old Parliamentary Party that in certain circles it became an unacceptable doctrine and republicanism became the great national ethos.  We need to get away from the arrogance we have seen associated with the self-appointed and self-styled republicans of the past 50 years who have often arrogated to themselves, without the authority of the people, the right to control events. In fact, we have seen them from time to time purport to exercise the very sovereignty of the people.  What many so-called republicans have forgotten is that republicanism is, in fact, in conflict with democracy because republicanism involves representation only through representatives, whereas democracy is government directly or indirectly by all classes for the benefit of all classes.  If we would contemplate our future, both internally and externally, in an atmosphere of democratic nationalism we might get a more beneficial future than the rather sterile past we have got from arrogant republicanism in the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>What matters is not the form of government but rather the number of people who can achieve a contented existence under any form of government. If we can get away from the forms and the theories, we might, perhaps, achieve something worthwhile but we can only do it by escaping from all the symbols and paraphernalia of the past which have done so much harm and can only strangle us even more in the future.</P>
    <P>The enlargement of the EEC is a world event of shattering significance because it will shatter many relationships, associations, attitudes and stands <Col N="470" /> not only in Ireland but throughout the world.  We live, therefore, in, perhaps, the most exciting time internationally since the foundation of the State.  At present our Tricolour is ready to be unfurled together with the flags of nine other European nations.  On 10th May our people are being asked to say whether or not they want the Irish Tricolour to be unfurled along with nine other flags of Europe.  It is disappointing to see so many &ldquo;small Irelanders&rdquo; suggesting that the Irish flag should not be displayed with nine other European flags to show that Ireland is ready to play its part in a new and better Europe.  It is the kind of mistake which if it were successful &mdash;I do not believe it will be&mdash;would certainly disgrace us not merely in this generation but for many generations to come.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the question of the developing nations, the nations of the Third World, to those people who, as the Minister correctly stated, once looked on us as their leader, as their fighter, as the state which they sought to emulate. There have been a number of unhappy developments in some of these countries.  In Rhodesia, for example, we see a terrible state of distress, and certain political developments which are in conflict with every accepted democratic principle.  We have lent our vote in the United Nations to a resolution which says that there should be no settlement in Rhodesia without majority rule.</P>
    <P>We sometimes seem to use the procedure of the United Nations to give us a let out.  We feel that we can just cast our vote or deliver an oration in the United Nations and we need do no more.  I do not think that is good enough.  The United Nations is not there to make life easier for us as a state, or to make life easier for individual states.  There is still individual responsibility.  We should continue to conduct our own diplomatic onslaught wherever we see injustice occurring.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde asked the Taoiseach recently whether the Government will take steps to assist in the sending <Col N="471" /> of volunteers to work in developing countries.  Again the Government seem to be too anxious to rely upon international agencies rather than taking initiatives in this field.  I do not think it is good enough for a country such as ours to rely upon international agencies to do work which we believe should be done.  For humanitarian reasons, we should like to see the Government making their own arrangements to assist the developing countries directly.</P>
    <P>I know that an organisation such as Gorta does this, but there is a great deal more talent and readiness to help available in this country than can be translated into monetary subscriptions to Gorta.  Many of our young people are skilled beyond the immediate capacity of this society of ours to absorb them.  Sometimes they go to Britain, to America or elsewhere to work in a temporary capacity, but many of them would be only too willing to work in developing nations if the Government would provide the machinery and the facilities to allow them to go there directly as representatives of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Were we to apply the Minister's three principles on foreign policy we would find that this is an acceptable activity because it would serve the national interest&mdash;we would get a good name by doing it&mdash;it would serve the common interest by serving the interests of the countries we would be helping as well as our own, and it would give us an opportunity to act as well as to preach on moral and social values.  At the Chile conference yesterday, where I understand we were represented, Dr. Mansholt, who is much abused by some socialists in this country, made a suggestion which I would hope would be accepted by all in the EEC.  His suggestion was that the EEC should take an additional 15 per cent annually of produce from each of the developing nations so that they could be assured that the EEC would take 15 per cent more in imports from them.  This kind of help would be of great value.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and suggest that we can expand those exports by staying outside.  This is not possible.  The realities of the modern world, and indeed the world at all times, require that you maintain good relations with the people with whom you wish to trade.  Unless we maintain a good and sound relationship with such states in the future, we will have to rely solely upon our own resources.  We can do that, just as any person is free, if he wants to, to live a life of self-sufficiency on top of a mountain depriving himself of all other benefits and contacts in and with the outer world.</P>
      <P>I do not think our people are prepared&mdash;and I certainly hope they are not prepared&mdash;to accept a lower standard of living.  I do not think that, having had valuable relationships with the world, our people believe that we should now sever those connections. We cannot do it.  We should not do it. We will not do it.  I believe that on 10th May our people will vote to join the larger and more worthwhile Community in which we can achieve in our time what we have been striving to achieve for generations: a worthwhile existence for our people with better opportunities in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>In his speech the Minister attempted something which, I suppose, was a welcome feature in <Col N="473" /> a debate of this nature.  He attempted tentatively to chart what should be the guiding principles of an Irish foreign policy.  I am not saying that I am very satisfied with the type of guidelines he provided.  He seemed to me to err too much in the direction of a grand philosophy and to fly a little bit too far from reality, and the governing reality of an Irish foreign policy as I would see it.  It is an elegant piece of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a polished piece of work.  I do not know that it adds up to very much but it consisted of six or seven pages of good prose.  I commend the Minister on what he was attempting.  I suppose in blunt language Irish foreign policy is Anglo-Irish relations writ large.  If it is not that, it is nothing.  That may cut out a lot of the subtleties, but largely that is what it is: relations between here and Britain and our attempts around the world to right that relationship, to balance it up, and to make up for our inferiority politically and economically to our larger next door neighbour.</P>
      <P>In general, the pursuit of our foreign policy is the pursuit of independence, subject to all the limitations of the pursuit of independence politically and economically by a small country in today's tough world. In a country which suffers from a surfeit of official idealism, at any rate, I do not think we have any need to invoke idealistic motives for our foreign policy.  It goes without saying that we do not wish to conquer anybody else.  It goes without saying that we pose a threat to no other power in this part of the world.  I do not think this inability should be made into some big idealistic commitment to peace.  We pursue our independence economically and politically and this obviously poses a threat to no other country.  Therefore, by necessity we are committed to peace. Peace is in our own interests economically and politically.  We pose a military threat to nobody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously our relations with our <Col N="474" /> large neighbour have never been so bad.  Whatever about a slight change in the relations between both Governments over the past few weeks since the Heath initiative, the fact of the matter is that, as between the people, the relationship between both countries has never been as bad.  A concreate result of this deterioration in relations between the people is the probable fall-off this year in tourism and the obvious but as yet unpublished fall-off in industrial orders for our products in Britain.  From reading the Minister's speech one would not be aware of this point of crisis in Anglo-Irish relations.  Rather, one would get the impression from the speech that things are as they were in former years during the term of office of Deputy Aiken when we could take it for granted that there would be good relations between this country and Britain. That was a time when the Northern problem had not become the issue that it has become since.  At page nine of his speech the Minister says that the initiative taken by the British Government is a step forward in seeking a lasting solution to the remaining problem of this historic relationship.  I suppose that is a roundabout way of saying that what has happened as a result of the Heath initiative has at least been some improvement in the deterioration in relations between this country and Britain.  That initiative is in grave peril as the Minister knows very well.  If the violence continues, if the men of violence persist in their own campaign, this whole struggle in the North will enter a deeper and more serious phrase, one in which the spectrum of a war over the whole island and in which brother would be fighting against brother, becomes a dreadful reality.</P>
    <P>Obviously, all internees must be released. This is the only way in which the elected representatives of the SDLP can take part in talks.  The Health initiative is barren and holds no possibility of an improvement in the situation and all the efforts of Mr. Whitelaw will be of no avail unless the elected leaders of the Opposition are enabled to take part in talks.  The continuation of detention means that these talks cannot take place.  The abolishing of <Col N="475" /> Stormont cannot be said to have been a retrograde step.  I have always been of the opinion that those who foresaw Stormont as the germ of the future assembly of the Irish people were not examining the creature that was Stormont and had been Stormont down through the years.  Stormont was the local centre that meted out discrimination in jobs and housing.  It was the signification of the triumph of Unionism in that part of the country.  It was the headquarters of the Orange Order. Therefore, for anybody to have regarded it as the germ of a future assembly of the Irish people was not to have appreciated the facts.</P>
    <P>If the initiative is to have any chance, the elected leaders must be enabled to take part in talks whereby all the people of the North can reach agreement as to what arrangement they can come to regarding government of the area.  This Dáil from being totally silent on the North up to 1967 has, since 1969, become interested in the whole Northern question and since then we have had more debates on the issue than we had before then from the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to turn this debate into a discussion on the North but the Minister might have dealt in greater detail with this matter and given us his own ideas on it.  I regard him as being correct in saying that important though it was to speak to people around the world about this particular problem the fact is that we as Irish people are left with the problem in which almost one million Irishmen and women have a different political allegiance to the majority of the other people of this island who favour independence and a separation from Britain.  This problem cannot be settled by people living outside our shores but it can be helped by co-operation from Britain. Anglo-Irish relations are a basic factor in Irish foreign policy but some of the work towards unity must be begun and ended on this island.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody who knows the problem will suggest that it is possible to have unity as a result of armed conflict or that gunfire is a good means of changing Unionists <Col N="476" /> from their political allegiance.  We all appreciate that the job of getting reconciliation under way means that the North must go through a period in which Catholic and Protestant learn once more to acknowledge each other as human beings.  We know that the price of the violence, the price of making the wrong assessment and of thinking that violence can bring about unity, has been paid during the past few years in a total breakdown of any kind of relationship that existed between Catholic and Protestant.  This is a price which all the people of this island must meet yet and nobody outside our shores can prevent us having to meet the cost of the events of the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>An initiative is required from our side.  I endeavoured to table a question today asking the Taoiseach whether he would not utilise the referendum on votes at 18 to present a new Constitution to the people of this State. The question was disallowed on the grounds that somebody had asked a question on similar lines about two months ago.</P>
    <P>To hear some people talk of changes in the Constitution, one would imagine that the whole path to unity would be simplified and brought forward in date as a result of certain changes.  I do not follow such argument.  I agree that the Constitution is an important aspect of this whole question but the economic dimension of unity probably poses the greater problem in the long run.</P>

      <P>We could set about having a new Constitution tomorrow and surely nobody here would suggest that we should delay in respect of anything we could do towards solving the problem.  We could frame a new Constitution that would be free of the sections contained in the present one that offend.  That would not be a gigantic task.  Much to the horror of some of my friends, I suggested here before that we could do worse than look at the first Free State Constitution, the Constitution of 1922.  Admittedly, that particular Constitution contained certain provisions regarding relationships between this <Col N="477" /> country and Britain which we would not need to incorporate now but in relation to civil rights the 1922 Constitution was superior to the Constitution of 1937.  It was nearer the spirit of a united Ireland than was its successor and, to my knowledge, it contained no feature to which Irishmen in the North of Ireland, regardless of whatever might be their tradition, could find objection.  Therefore, we do not need a great deal of preparation. In the course of a few months we could prepare a new Constitution, consult the people in Northern Ireland, ensure that it anticipated in all its provisions a future all-Ireland Constitution, whenever that would come about, but ensure that Unionists were deprived of one argument when talking about a united Ireland and when charging that the Constitution of this Republic involved provisions which many of them found repugnant and which involved for them a limitation of their civil rights, as they saw them. We could at least do that tomorrow. That is a step that, for political reasons which I do not understand, we refuse to take.  I do not exaggerate its impact.  I do not suggest that it will convert one Unionist to the belief in the justness of the unity of this country. I suggest that it would deprive many enemies of the unity of this country of a strong argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who has taken part in any discussions or programmes, in the United States or anywhere outside this country, on the desirability of the unity of this country will know how powerful an argument it is in the hands of Unionists that our Constitution has provisions which do not faithfully anticipate the Constitution of a future united Ireland.  Yet, this is a step we could take now without any further delay.  We do not have to have the permission of Mr. Heath.  We do not have to go to London or Belfast to do it.  We can do it ourselves. We can enact a new Constitution with updated social directives.  We can provide in that Constitution a fundamental guarantee which our own Constitution does, to some extent, at present.  I do not suggest this would be something to be examined solely by politicians.  We could consult with people in outside life, such as the <Col N="478" /> judiciary and various organisations.  We could also consult with Northern people, and with whoever, in fact, would be willing to talk with us.</P>
    <P>The weakness of the 1937 Constitution may be due to the fact that it was the work of too few people.  There was not sufficient consultation with the Irish people.  Too few people were involved in its production.  This is an initiative which I suggest.  We do not need to go anywhere.  This is an initiative on which we can embark ourselves.  I do not exaggerate its value or suggest that it would ease all problems.  It would deprive the enemies of Irish unity of one strong argument which they have at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on a trip abroad when affairs here were in a bad way a few months ago.  The Minister went to Washington.  I do not see anything wrong about his going there.  That acknowledges that the US is probably the primary world power.  The Minister's visit to Washington did not make that claim any stronger or weaker.  It was correct that he should go there. I said at the time, and I still believe, that if one consults with one great power on a problem one should equally have contacted his opposite number in Moscow.  The Minister should have done so if he was serious about explaining, as he says he was, our problems. The Minister said that we simply wished to consult with a great power and to explain our problem to our friends in the US so that they could speak to their friends in Britain, and ask them to stop being a nuisance to us.  The Minister should logically have contacted his opposite number in Moscow.  That may seem to be an inflammatory thing to say.  Another country in similar straits would have done so.</P>
    <P>It is trumpeted abroad that we should have gone to speak with the EEC countries.  I believe we should have done so.  There is a lot in what Deputy Ryan said.  The Deputy said that we should have consulted in Europe first and then gone to Washington. I do not know which way it should have been done, but since Washington has so much to do with the shape of Europe it probably does <Col N="479" /> not make any difference.  If our problem was serious enough to be discussed with one great power it should have been discussed also with another great power.  I am not suggesting that one great power would have been more impressed by our story than another. No matter what social system they may say they have, all great powers, in fact, are much the same in their principles at home or abroad in relation to foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how it was suggested that we, of all the so-called future partners in the EEC, should not have diplomatic relations with an Eastern European country.  All the EEC countries have diplomatic relations with an Eastern European country. Is it suggested that Ireland, on becoming a member of the EEC, should have no diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union?  What rule of life suggests that while Italy, France, Germany or Norway all have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union Ireland should not have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union?  What danger does this hold?  What temptation is there?  What approval would it entail of the social system in the Soviet Union?  Having diplomatic relations with a country does not convery that one approves of the social system of the country involved.  Nobody would suggest that the Soviet Union's record in freedom operations is to be admired.  Let us not forget Budapest or Czechoslovakia.  That does not get away from the fact that the Soviet Union is a great world power with every bit as much legitimacy to be regarded as a world power as the US.  It does not turn us all into young pioneer communists to suggest that we should have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I suggested that we should have diplomatic relations with Poland if people objected to our having diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, as if that country were the scarlet woman herself.  We should have considered having diplomatic relations with Poland.  It is ludicrous that we should be entering the EEC without having such diplomatic relations, <Col N="480" /> when every other country in the EEC has diplomatic relations with Eastern European countries.  So far as I know all these countries have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.  It portrays a colonial attitude to say that we may not do as others do in this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not see how a country can be taken as having a foreign policy that is adequate if it ignores one whole side of this part of the world in which we live.  How can we suggest that our country has a foreign policy when we ignore one such large country?  How can we suggest that we are neutral? What is the meaning of neutrality if we have no diplomatic relations with the damned on the other side?  What is the point of indulging in the making of strident anti-British speeches here when, in fact a campaign is launched by several of the cheaper versions of the British press, which we have seen dealing so blindly with the North of Ireland, suggesting that we should not have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union?  Why should we run when these newspapers suggest that it would be a dangerous thing for Ireland to have diplomatic relations with Eastern European countries?  Is this why politicans here should run for cover in this so-called supreme Parliament and call for a debate in this House?  Must we be for ever frightened of the Mother Macree vote in this country?  Have we a foreign policy or have we not?  Have we only a pretence of a foreign policy or one on loan from the Foreign Office?</P>
    <P>I am under no illusion about our reasons for joining the EEC.  Our wish to join the EEC arises from our economic dependence, which the Minister frankly admits, on the British market.  Once Britain decided she was going in we were left with very little choice.  Considering the economic policies pursued by the State over 40 or 50 years, very strong arguments could be adduced favouring the membership of this country in the EEC.  Therefore, we cannot point to any philosophical reasons that would compare with the strong material reason involved in that dependent relationship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> However, I was disappointed in the Minister's speech.  Those of us who oppose membership would have expected to be given some reasons for qualifying our opposition, that the Minister would have mentioned some of the political objectives we would have in that community.  The Minister's speech reads like the speech of any other Minister in the Cabinet. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, as Deputy Ryan rightly says, must have built up, by now, a bank of sophisticated knowledge as a result of his numerous visits in Europe, America and elsewhere, for six or seven pages dallies with the idea of enunciating a foreign policy.  We were entitled to expect something distinctive from the Minister in regard to the EEC, that the Minister would say: &ldquo;Here are the political goals and the kind of political future I would see in the Europe we propose to join.&rdquo; Certain political decisions have to be made if this country joins the EEC. Is it proposed to bring a political illiterate into the EEC?  Our foreign policy so far would suggest we lie in that kind of country.  Have we any viewpoint on European security?  Do we know there is such a thing as a Warsaw Pact?  Do we wait until the decision is made for or against before we open up diplomatic relations with East European countries?</P>
    <P>Surely the day has arrived when we may say that the &ldquo;Reds under the bed&rdquo; league have finally taken leave of Irish politics.  To listen to certain politicians one might believe they were still in their heyday.  I have confidence enough in the maturity of Irish people to believe that those bad old days are gone.  The very same speech which did not mention the question as to whether we should have diplomatic relations with East European countries, in three or four lines disposed of the matter that our vote had been behind the admission of the People's Republic of China.  Not so many years ago mentioning the name of the People's Republic of China was enough to drive a politician out of public life.  Some years ago the Minister's predecessor faced strong opposition in this House stretching over almost two years of a Dáil's life, as <Col N="482" /> politicians pitched into him every day on the mere suspicion that he might have permitted a discussion of the admission of China into the United Nations.  Today there is no comment. Today everybody accepts the admission into the United Nations of the People's Republic of China whose social system is no more desirable than that of the Soviet Union. Freedom is just as scarce in the People's Republic of China.  Yet there is no protest in this Assembly about the support which we gave to the admission of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I am all for discussion in this House on widening our diplomatic contacts, and I see nothing wrong with the Fine Gael motion saying that the matter should be discussed here.  I think it would be a very useful convention if, before we open up diplomatic relations with any country, this House could discuss it.  However, we should not be dishonest in this matter.  We should not seek to stroke the prejudices of people, to suggest that some people are more Christian or more democratic than others because they do not approve of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.  I predict that, before a Minister for Foreign Affairs comes with his next speech on this Estimate, in two or three lines, he will also be writing off the fact that we have opened up diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>If the objective of our foreign policy is independence, political and economic, and if no less a body than the Exporters Association, which is certainly not a home for subversives, of dangerous revolutionaries, can say that our trade could possibly be helped by the opening up of diplomatic relations with these countries, how can any one here who wishes to see an expansion in Irish jobs in conscience stand up and argue against it?  As I say, it does not imply approval of these regimes.  I do not approve of these regimes; they have little respect for human freedom or democracy, but they certainly exist and will continue to exist with or without diplomatic relations with us.  In the meantime, we may help our job situation and our balance <Col N="483" /> of trade with these countries by opening up diplomatic relations with at least some of them.  I see nothing wrong with having a discussion on the extension of our diplomatic relations. I know that in foreign policy heretofore the whole content of the debate was related to who had the last sherry at the last embassy reception in which foreign capital.  That may be an over-generalisation, but Deputy Burke will recall those stirring debates on such topics over many years.</P>
    <P>The smaller the country the more essential is an adequate foreign service. A powerful country with a strong home market can afford to ignore the eddies of international opinion.  It can afford to ignore the sensitivities of its neighbours, can afford to miss opportunities, but not a small country. Ideally, we should try to have a diplomatic presence in all the major countries, always attempting to improve our trading position.  In our straitened circumstances, with only a limited amount of money available, more could be done in those countries where we have consular or diplomatic status to involve any Irish people who might be in such countries, private citizens, in the work of the consulate or embassy.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints.  I read one lately that a British consular office in Belgium, I think, dealt with a request by either a university or a drama group in a matter of Irish cultural interest. The tragedy is that so thin is our diplomatic representation around the world that I suppose British consular offices very often supply matter of Irish interest.  We must be more imaginative than the ordinary protocol connected with diplomatic relations would require.  In many countries there are Irish graduates or professional people or Irish people in some other capacity who would very willingly give their service <i>gratis</i> in this connection. It should be possible for the embassy or consulate to involve such Irish nationals in the work of the embassy or consulate.  It would be of some assistance, I think, to have part-time diplomats who could lecture on matters of Irish interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> The Minister should look into this. In most European countries and in the United States of America there are Irish professional people who could take on this particular work.  It would certainly be some improvement on the British consular office sending out pictures of the Lakes of Killarney when it is really Lough Neagh and describing James Joyce and George Bernard Shaw as British.  This would put an end to the cultural pilfering that goes on because we do not have adequate diplomatic representation.  I do not suggest that the personnel in our diplomatic service is deficient in any way or unacquainted with Irish culture.  I suggest we might even have some economists in our foreign service. Careerists might suggest that this would be doing what the shift workers allege the other ESB operatives have been doing in the last few days, taking away their jobs, but we should have room in our diplomatic service for one or two people from outside the service.  The Minister should explore this idea.  It may not be a popular idea with those who work their way up the ill-paid ladder of the foreign service, and ill-paid it is.  Our diplomats are at a great disadvantage in comparison with their opposite numbers in other embassies and consulates. They do excellent work, the maximum that can be humanly expected from them.  I am a bit worried about a possible &ldquo;Old Boys&rdquo; network growing up in our foreign service and it would do no harm at all if one or two posts were reserved to meet what Mr. Macmillan in South Africa described as &ldquo;the wind of change&rdquo;.  It is an idea that could be examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister devoted a great deal of his speech to the United Nations.  If our entry into the EEC becomes a reality possibly so much space will not be devoted to the United Nations in the future since we will have to be more concerned with events in Europe. The disappointing feature is that we do not seem to have taken any decision on the kind of foreign policy we would like to see in that Europe.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to say that Ireland renders aid to underdeveloped nations through her voluntary agencies.  Only the other day I was hearing about a <Col N="485" /> British mission to Nepal where six doctors and 12 nurses have been sent to combat tuberculosis.  We have a proud missionary tradition and one would imagine that long before now the State itself would have become involved in providing aid to underdeveloped countries.  Youth today is more committed than it was in the selfish days of the Minister's youth and surely the State should assist these young people after university to go abroad and help these underdeveloped countries instead of losing them to some impersonal international body. The world gives no credit for hiding one's light under a bushel and we should examine the question of sending our young people abroad for two or three years to help the underdeveloped countries.  We have doctors, engineers, architects and so on who would be only too willing to work abroad.  If we have a good name as a non-colonial nation, then let us capitalise on that good name and ensure that the work done by this State on behalf of underdeveloped nations is known and admired.  If we cannot send powerful armies to help our friends when they are in trouble we can at least help them in peacetime to combat disease and to spread education.  This is the more christian way of helping as against making speeches about peace at international forums like the United Nations.  The tragedy of the underdeveloped countries is that the countries with the money which trade with them trade with them to their further degradation and oppression. The help that is given is paltry.  We are a small country.  We are not fully developed, but we have to some extent a sophisticated structure educationally and we could provide the personnel to help these underdeveloped countries. There would be no strings attached. The State could continue the historic and generous work of the missionaries of the past by ensuring that our young lay people can go out and work for two or three years in the underdeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be an indictment of our so-called Christianity and of the kind of charitable nation we are supposed to be that this has not yet been done and this State has not yet <Col N="486" /> put its hand to the wheel to try to help those less fortunate countries.  I hope the Minister will consider this a bit more seriously and come up with certain proposals.  It need not cost a great deal.  I think we have the young people who are willing to work in these countries for a period of years. All it need cost is the will to set up the organisation and to invoke the aid of these young people.  We have been proud of the peace work of Irish soldiers abroad.  Equally, we could be proud of the work of Irish youth abroad if human standards in these countries are to be preserved.  We have an embassy in India.  How much more valuable it would be to have in India also, a country with which we have many historic ties, a group of young people working in some area of need there&mdash;in agriculture, in irrigation, in the medical field, in the setting-up of factories.  All these capacities are ours.  We have only to tap them to send the young people out to help in these areas.  We would not be the losers.  Our young people would have participated in the most exciting work of this century.  If it is a dark century the thing that marks it off from other centuries is that at least it has displayed in some areas, such as the ones I am talking about, a greater compassion between man and man.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning I would not speak for long and I intend to follow that advice given to myself.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not given us any information on the kind of political direction he would like to see in Europe.  I am disappointed that the Minister gave no indication of the establishment of diplomatic relations with one or other of the East European countries again carefully saying, lest somebody misunderstand us, misinterpret us, and we know that such people, unfortunately, are abroad, that the establishment of such diplomatic relations would not imply approval of these regimes.  It would simply mean that we had grown up at least in relation to foreign affairs.  I do not believe that a country can be said to have foreign policy where all its embassies, all its contacts, are with what are roughly called the western <Col N="487" /> countries without any diplomatic contact with the East European countries. I suggest that if we do join the EEC it would be ludicrous to think that every one of our so-called partners in the EEC would be enjoying diplomatic relations with East European countries, ourselves alone having none.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody would suggest that any of these countries are in any way soft on communism, that in any way they approve of these regimes, but, obviously, they find that their trade is advanced by having diplomatic relations with these countries.  No less a body than the Irish Exporters' Association has called frequently for the establishment of such relations which they imagine would help our trade.  Certain sections of the British press would not be pleased. That well known Republican, Mr. Enoch Powell, would not be pleased, but if the worth of our so-called foreign policy is that if the British press does not like what we are doing we must stop, then I suggest it is time we packed up the whole myth of having a foreign policy.  I think we should go ahead despite the British newspapers. I think we would gain if not greater activity on the part of those to whom we seek at least greater appreciation of our problems.  If Washington knew that we spoke also to Moscow I do not think it would alarm Washington that we were suddenly going Red or anything like that.  I do not think it would be suggested that this was happening simply by the ordinary job of setting up diplomatic relations.</P>
    <P>I urge also that since Irish foreign policy is simply Anglo-Irish relations writ large, since that relationship has deteriorated very badly ever since the eruption of the Northern tragedy, since it now hangs by the very delicate balance indeed of the Heath initiative, if the internees are not released and political talks take place and the violence becomes intensive, then, quite obviously, on this island we face a bloody kind of doom, certainly a very bad turn of events.  I simply say it is disappointing that this Government cannot take one initiative which is open to them and that is to produce a Constitution for the attention of the <Col N="488" /> people of this State which will, to the greatest extent possible, anticipate the provisions of a future all-Ireland Constitution.  I repeat that I do not suggest that such a Constitution being passed here would mean that Unionists would from that moment be committed to the idea of a united Ireland.  I simply say that it would deprive many people who oppose a united Ireland of the argument that our Constitution includes clauses that are repugnant and that it would limit their civil rights.  It has already been announced that Mr. Roibeárd Molloy will go to the country with a referendum in October seeking votes at 18.  This is a very non-contentious matter.  None of the parties here is likely to oppose that.  None of the parties represented here is likely to get many votes at 18.  I suggest we should avail of that opportunity in October of presenting a new Constitution to the people.</P>

      <P>One of these days they are going to do a chart on the content.  I know the great bond that exists between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach, how much they hold one another in trust, how close they have been over the months and years of crisis.  How <Col N="489" /> much closer they may be now I do not know.  I would urge on the Minister who has met the kind of opposition I am talking about abroad, the people who say: &ldquo;Of course your country's Constitution has certain provisions which the Northern people do not like&rdquo; and then you must go through a rigmarole explaining that in reality we do not have Protestants for breakfast here.  If we could eliminate from our Constitution the provisions that are repugnant to many Unionists we would be doing a good day's work on the long road to Irish unity.</P>
      <P>If somebody says this is an arduous task I say there is a good working model in the Free State Constitution of 1922.  I am not suggesting that the citizen status is not much the same but I would say that the 1922 Constitution is silent where it should be silent and if it cured some of the garrulousness of the 1937 Constitution it would be no harm.  The most perfect Constitutions are those that have said little and the ones that have always got humanity into trouble are the ones that have gone on over 100 pages.</P>
      <P>I would urge on the Minister, who must be as embarassed as I am, and probably more, that he should speak to the Taoiseach about this matter and that they could avail of the referendum in October which will have a very bare look about it, votes at 18 which nobody opposes, and we could have a brand new Constitution for October.  We could have consulted with the Northern Opposition&mdash; Unionists, SDLP and any other person who wishes to talk to us&mdash;we could have consulted with organisations in Irish life, we could send a copy to Mr. Ted Heath on the following day, when it has been passed, informing him that no longer could there be any objection to the Irish Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a worthwhile initiative.  There are certain dangers, admittedly: we may, in fact, be bringing about the possibility at some future stage of Irish unity.  What I find in this assembly and elsewhere is that we talk about this matter endlessly but any move in that direction is taboo.  I know&mdash;and the Minister for Foreign Affairs knows <Col N="490" /> this&mdash;that the Taoiseach holds very strongly to the view that constitutional changes are as much part of the bargaining in relation to a future united Ireland as anything else.  I do not hold to such a view.  The leader of my party does not hold to such a view. This party does not hold to such a view.  It is time that we tested the will of the Irish people on this matter, found out how much real desire for unity lurks behind all the rhetorical adherence to unity that there has been over the last few years.  There are several unpleasant features in that unity which we must face up to.  I am not denying that the economic aspects are the big major problems but I certainly think that the constitutional matter is one that we could take into our own hands immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister is guarded in saying that the Northern problem in no way can be settled by the intervention of any big international brother.  I am not suggesting that it can, because there are certain problems to be settled between Irishmen at home.  It must be settled at some stage.  I certainly would suggest that our consular representatives in the United States could possibly be not as strict on protocol in refusing to see American politicians who may be interested in the Irish question.  They could do a bit more in that direction.  I am not suggesting that we have to join the democratic bandwagon in this presidential election year.  I am simply saying that we could certainly utilise more on the ground in the United States.  We should not be too chary of talking to people who wish to talk to us.  Perhaps we suffer there from being a little over-sensitive about our actions being misunderstood, perhaps, by the present incumbent of the American Presidential Office.  We should talk to American politicians in Congress or Senate or wherever they are, who wish to talk to us.  Our consulate doors should be open to them and full information should be available to them.  I do not think we would have anything to worry about in that direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister said very guardedly that he hoped the Heath initiative was a step forward.  We all think it is a step <Col N="491" /> forward.  It is surrounded by difficulties, of course.  It is certainly true to say that if the men of violence continue with their campaign, if they think that a united Ireland can be gained by wading through the blood of Catholics and Protestants, they are woefully wrong and, worse than that, they will involve the whole country in an awful ruin.  A North/South confrontation is the next stage, remember, if we do not succeed in providing for the North of Ireland a period, a phase, which could allow people once more to talk to one another, a period of reconstruction. If conditions do not permit that to happen then the next step, the final act, is a really bloody confrontation over the whole island.  It gives me no satisfaction to say that.  I can almost see this entire island disappearing into the Atlantic, becoming an Atlantic Haiti&mdash;that is not an exaggeration&mdash; subsiding&mdash;explosions, murders and pillage, no country outside knowing what the quarrel was all about except that it was something left over from the 17th century occurring in 1972, a religious war on a massive scale.</P>
    <P>Anybody who thinks that this complicated question can be settled by bombs on the roads or shootings, anybody who thinks that it is the grand follow up of the 1922 struggle, is woefully inadequately provided with the facts of that situation.  The Government here could do more in providing leadership on that issue.  There is a grave silence, so to speak, on the part of Government Ministers at the present time.  Other politicians have spoken but there appears to be a tendency on the part of Dublin leaders at present to stand by and to let the hierarchy do the work.  I can see that internees must be released.  Otherwise talks cannot take place.  If this period of reconstruction cannot take place, I despair of seeing a united Ireland in this century.</P>
    <P>Outside this House, in the country, there has been a great cowardice on the whole issue.  It has been a very chastening period.  Those who talked about our Irish democracy have seen several people slink away and say nothing when it was in peril.  It may <Col N="492" /> yet be in greater peril over the weeks to come.  I have been astonished at the journalists who have fallen by the wayside. I have been astonished at the politicians who have fallen by the wayside.  They may come out yet when the sun shines again to say that they were on the side of democracy all the time.  I hope the sun comes out very soon for them.  I notice that the Government numbers very few persons of ministerial rank who have come out and spoken honestly, taken certain risks, and said what they believed to be true of the situation.</P>
    <P>I have never believed, in relation to the Northern question, that it was a time for ordinary politics.  Certain Opposition persons in this House believe that great electoral riches are to be won by being as silent as possible &mdash;the Opposition of silence.  They believe that with these awful events unfolding in the North, the more what one says is indistinguishable from the most thoughtless slogans, the more it approximates to that kind of talk, the safer one is.  Perhaps they are right.  I do not know.  Those who believe that are certainly not fulfilling their obligations as elected representatives in this time of peril for all elected representatives and for democracy.</P>
    <P>I am often amused by the people, the civil servants, those in settled positions, who think that democracy can go down the high road but that they will remain where they are.  I am amused by those journalists who think that they will be as free to talk about various people under the new regime as they were under the old.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one very small thing that we could do.  I plead with the Minister.  We could have a new Constitution before the electorate come October.  We could take the bare look off the Minister for Local Government's innocuous little Bill for votes at 18.  Who opposes votes at 18?  In fact, there is a body of constitutional thought that a constitutional amendment may not in fact be necessary for that purpose.  At least, some people <Col N="493" /> talk in this way.  I would suggest that we can have this new constitution by October.  I am not saying that it will change one Unionist's opinion in relation to a united Ireland, but it will at least deprive some of their spokesmen abroad and at home of a strong arm against unity.  Again I appeal to the Minister to talk with the Taoiseach, to try to budge the Taoiseach from his incorrigible position on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach appears to see no difference between altering a provision of the Constitution and talking about the price of bullocks.  He seems to think that it is all part of the economic, political, philosophical pack of cards that will be dealt out on that wonderful day of unity.  What the Taoiseach is, in fact, doing at present is stalling in an area of activity in which, in fact, he could take an initiative. We could take an initiative here in Dublin.  There are few enough things that we can do solely on our own in Dublin to help but here is one area in which we could help and we would have enthusiastic support.  We would be helping the people like John Hume in the North who have been urging over many years about the necessity for a kind of secular united Ireland.  We would be speaking across the barricades.  We would be suggesting that people here in Dublin were not simply willing to hide behind the gunsmoke and once it cleared willing to come out and say that we were sorry for their plight.  It would suggest we are serious about unity.</P>
      <P>This is the kind of gesture that is called for after the Heath initiative. God knows we have no reason to like Tory Prime Ministers, but let us not all say now that that initiative was all we expected.  It was a major initiative and it should be met by an initiative here in Dublin.  It should not be one of these initiatives over many months and weeks as we see the old acts coming in again, the old incidents recur and multiply.  We should meet that initiative and admit that it was a big initiative which attempted honestly and genuinely to do something, to make something of the sorry Northern Ireland state, to make something more normal of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> It permitted, I think, of the only road forward towards unity.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think Dublin must now give some gesture, some acknowledgement and at least recognise the seriousness of the situation.  I read where one of those visiting British Opposition politicians in Dublin last week talked about an easy relaxed atmosphere in Dublin.  I do not know which constituency he was talking about or to which politicians he was talking but I can see what he means.  If he went around official quarters he would get very little impression that we were doing very much at present.  The game has changed.  It may be true to say that by doing nothing the Taoiseach has forced others to take the initiative. Probably we will be hearing that claim shortly elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is no longer time for sitting in silence without an initiative from here in sight.  The Taoiseach owes it to the country to make a gesture.  He owes it to that ambition which he has said prompted him to enter politics in the first place&mdash;he said he entered politics to bring about unity in Ireland and he did not mean unity in his party.  He said at another time that he would leave politics if it helped to create unity.  One gesture, one strong act on the part of the Government, which would have the enthusiastic support of my party, would be to put a new Constitution before the people in October.  Of course one may take the lawyer's excuse and say this is too large a task, that we do not have the time. I say we could profit from it.  We can look at the Free State Constitution of 1922, a Constitution which in its civil rights provisions, a phrase probably unknown in those days, understood more the temper, the problems and anticipated more accurately a future all-Ireland Constitution than the thing we have been living under since 1937.</P>
    <P>If I would fault the Minister's opening speech it is because it seems to me to evade several vital matters such as the EEC and diplomatic relations with eastern European countries.  In the latter case we should refuse to take orders from Enoch Powell or the British newspapers.  We should set up diplomatic relations if other EEC <Col N="495" /> countries with whom we propose to unite in the near future have diplomatic relations with eastern Europe.  By having such diplomatic relations they do not signify that they necessarily approve of these political regimes.  Why should we be the odd one out, the last knights of Europe when it comes to having anything to do with these nefarious regimes?</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech in four lines congratulated himself on the support he gave to the People's Republic of China when they were seeking entry to the United Nations.  As I have said, that cost the Minister's predecessor in office two years of blood and sweat in this House as he explained over and over again that he had simply sought permission to have the whole China issue debated.  We live in changed times and we should meet these changed times in the directions I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My first duty tonight is to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the excellent work he has been doing abroad in respect of the Irish people.  Deputy Hillery's work has been outstanding, particularly in relation to the Northern situation.  We can hear enemies of our democratic system say that the Minister or the other members of the Government did not do anything for the people of Northern Ireland.  That has not been said in the friendly nations of the world where opinion of the Minister is very high.  I had the pleasure of being in New Delhi at a meeting of the inter-Parliamentary Union and I was very pleased to hear the high opinions of him expressed by the diplomats who received us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the North, the Minister succeeded in bringing pressure to bear on the British Government to bring forward initiatives.  That was a big job and he did it well.  When he went abroad among the friendly nations the Minister did not, as he has told the House, press those nations in respect of Northern Ireland.  All he did was to bring to their attention the tragedies in the North and to get them to use their influence with Britain to end them.  We who fought in the Civil War <Col N="496" /> and earlier have become mature and we realise that after thousands of people have been killed and left homeless the end must come around the table.  After 13 people had been killed in Derry, the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw our Ambassador in London but they did not break the diplomatic link. We as an independent State are most anxious to see the whole country united.  There are people who feel they have a right to this and that we have no right.  We fought a civil war and shot one another down over the Six Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will keep to the point.  I appeal to the people who criticise us in our regard to foreign policy.  Their criticisms are completely undeserved.  As a party we are anxious for a united Ireland.  We had gradually built up the economy of this country and if nothing had happened in the North we would have overtaken the British economy in a few years.  The people who started the trouble in the North of Ireland were the Orangemen who were responsible for holding down 40 per cent of the population for over 50 years.  England are trying to rectify that now with direct rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the Orangemen or Brian Faulkner.  He came to Dublin on many occasions and he knows that his fellow-kinsmen are treated well enough by us and that he was welcome on any occasion he came here.  People like him are trying to divide the Irish <Col N="497" /> nation.  They say they could not come in here under our Constitution but 40 per cent of our people have lived under the Constitution in the North when they said it was a Protestant Parliament for Protestant people.</P>
    <P>We want people of goodwill to go to the North and meet the people there.  There are some men of goodwill in the North.  Captain Terence O'Neill as Prime Minister was a man of goodwill and he could see that it was right to come to Dublin and he welcomed the late Seán Lemass when he went to the North.  He lost his Prime Ministership over this spirit of goodwill.  He was up against the hardcore bigots in the North.  Some of those people still preach about things which happened 300 years ago.</P>
    <P>When I was a member of the Council of Europe I visited Berlin and I was shown the Berlin Wall. My first reaction on looking at it was to condemn East Germany and communism for it.  When I spoke at the Council of Europe I suggested that East Germany and West Germany should get together and should establish good relations.  The present Chancellor of West Germany was Lord Mayor of Berlin at that time and he came across the House with the German delegation at the Council of Europe and spoke to me after I said they should start talking to one another and try to knock down the barriers which were very bitter at that period.  They succeeded in doing that. Recently there has been a breakthrough and there are diplomatic relations between East and West Germany.  Relations between East and West Germany were one hundred times more bitter than those of the Orangemen in the North towards the South of Ireland.</P>
    <P>When the civil war in the United States was over and when General Lee surrendered to General Grant at an impromptu gathering in Washington some of the hardcore Northerners said to Abraham Lincoln: &ldquo;We have badly beaten the South.  We will disfranchise the members of the South, especially the big cotton plantation farmers, and we will confiscate their lands.  We will see there will never be <Col N="498" /> a civil war again.&rdquo;  A few days before he was shot, in one of the most charitable speeches that was ever made by a conqueror, he said: &ldquo;I am at a loss for words to thank each and every one of you for the contribution you have made towards making it possible that this great nation should have existed.&rdquo;  He said that the army, the navy, the diplomats and the civil servants had supported him but that he could not accept any suggestions that they had made.  He said that he would bring together General Lee and General Grant.  He said that General Lee was an honourable man and he would advise all his soldiers to return to their homes.  He said he would have General Lee and all the public representatives of the South at one function. He said he would build a union between the North and the South, a union of goodwill that would make another war impossible.</P>
    <P>It is not impossible here to build goodwill between the North and the South.  There are people of goodwill in England and in the North of Ireland and there has been goodwill between the British and Irish Governments. During the events in the North there was constant communication between London and Dublin.  The Taoiseach visited the British Prime Minister and this was the right course to adopt.  He tried to do everything possible to achieve an understanding between the two countries.</P>
    <P>We are working for a united Ireland and we will not surrender that right. I wish to compliment the spokesmen dealing with foreign affairs in the Fine Gael Party and in the Labour Party. We are all proud of the contributions they have made in the international field.  We are proud of some of the speeches that have been made by Deputy Ryan when he was abroad&mdash; they were worthy of any true Irishman. The same can be said for the Labour Party who have been in agreement with us on these matters.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Justice recently I said that some people were anxious to pull down this assembly. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has a tremendous task in trying to help <Col N="499" /> our country in these serious times but he has the goodwill of every true Irishman. Everyone who wants to see Ireland prosper, who wants to avoid shootings, murders and the burning of property, wishes the Minister to carry on with his good work.</P>
    <P>Irish soldiers abroad have distinguished themselves in the missions to which they have been assigned. I had the pleasure of visiting some of them in Israel and in Jordan and I was very proud of them.  I wish to take this opportunity of complimenting our ambassadors and their staffs.  They have upheld the dignity of our country and have given valuable help to our tourist, commercial and export trade.  They have distinguished themselves in their jobs and have improved the image of Ireland abroad.</P>
    <P>Our export and tourist trade has developed considerably.  At one time out export trade consisted of the sale of a few cattle and some Guinness but that situation has changed drastically. I hope that nothing will happen to disrupt the progress that has been made.  There are vicious people who want to upset our tourist trade and to take the bread and butter from the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Our representatives at the Council of Europe and other international organisations are helping to build a fund of goodwill for this country. Although the rules of the United Nations meant that our Minister could not speak at a certain time, friendly nations in the organisation were anxious to allow him to make a statement.  The Minister's friendly personality made a lot of friends for us during that period.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary said we should send more of our young people abroad.  I should like to tell the Deputy that many of our young people go abroad. After the war I was a regional director of the Red Cross for County Dublin and a member of the executive.  At that time we were regarded as &ldquo;untouchables&rdquo; by some countries because we remained neutral.  However, we went to St. Lo in France and set up a Red Cross hospital there.  It cost us a considerable amount but the goodwill <Col N="500" /> it created tore down the paper wall that had been around our country.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Council of Europe enabled us to work with other nations.  Many of our young people have volunteered to work for various services and they work for six months in the underdeveloped countries.  All this helps to create a good image of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand those who say that this country should live in isolation and not have any communication with other nations.  This is an attitude of some highly intelligent people, or at least they profess to be intelligent. They want us to build a wall around our country or they seek associate membership of the EEC in order to give themselves some way out.  In ordinary life people know that at some time they will need their next-door neighbour, but there are recluses here who want us to keep away from everyone. However, a day will come when they must meet their neighbour.  I cannot understand how anyone could say: &ldquo;Stay on your own.  You will have a lot of unemployment if you go into the Common Market.  The standard of living will go down,&rdquo; and all the other misrepresentations we have heard.  We are told that we are selling our nationality.  Germany, France and Italy were very nationalistic.  When they formed the Common Market they did not have to give up their language or their national identity.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a wonderful job in all the negotiations with the people in Brussels.  I cannot understand how anybody could say that this country could stand alone, or that the Twenty-six Countries could stand alone and the Six Counties go in with Britain unless we achieve a united Ireland before that, which I hope we do. If we isolate ourselves our export market will disappear.  Thousands of our people will be unemployed and our standard of living will go down.  No individual family can stand alone. Even if they are multi-millionaires, at some time or other they have to depend on their neighbours.  We are all pro-Irish on every side of the House.  We do not want to say anything that will injure the dignity of our <Col N="501" /> country.  We are anxious that posterity should remember the things we have done to try to help them.</P>
    <P>A British Prime Minister said behind the backs of the plenipotentiaries: &ldquo;We have given them the agricultural south and they will not be able to carry on economically.&rdquo;  We have come a long way and various Irish Governments have made great contributions since then.  We had to depend on the money we got from the Irish people.  We did not get money from any foreign country.  A number of misguided people are now trying to keep us from entering the EEC.  They are putting up arguments which are totally wrong.  They are doing everything they can to stop us from entering. People from whom I expected more want us to stand alone.  In America, President Wilson went from coast to coast appealing to the American people not to adopt an isolationist policy.  He got a stroke and died. It took Pearl Harbour to bring it home to the American people that they could not stand alone.</P>
    <P>There are a number of people who want us to stand alone.  We are a very small country.  The State of New York is larger than Ireland, England or Scotland.  The politicians who advocated an isolationist policy in America were directly responsible for what happened at Pearl Harbour.  Deputy O'Leary made a great case for a unity of nations.  He spoke about international goodwill.  The trend of his statement was that he was pro-EEC, although his party have made another decision.  He is entitled to his personal views.</P>
    <P>I hope that the people of Ireland will consider seriously what they are doing at the referendum.  I hope they will vote nationally and not narrowly.  I hope they will not destroy what I believe to be an advantage.  If it were not an advantage to France, Germany and Italy over the past ten years, they would have broken away from it.  They have a great deal of tradition behind them.  They are trying to improve conditions in the EEC.  I hope commonsense will prevail amongst all our people.  I am not going into the details of the benefits of membership.  The <Col N="502" /> standard of living in Italy improved very much in the EEC and the standard of living in other countries improved also.</P>
    <P>If certain goods will be dearer here the agricultural community will have the opportunity of having a higher standard of living.  We were always able to move with the times.  We can increase the purchasing power of our people by giving them increased wages. These things will settle themselves.  If we stay out, the standard of living of our people will go down in a very short time.  I should like to thank the national press.  They have been a great help during this period.  They must also report the contributions of those who are against entry.  That is democracy. I hope that until 10th May our national press will continue to do a good job.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that on my visits to foreign countries I did not at any stage seek help against Britain.  What I asked for was that those countries which had good relations with both Britain and ourselves should quietly make their concern known.</P>
    <P>That was as far as any diplomat could go.  He said:</P>
    <P>I was satisfied from the contacts I made that many Governments who are well disposed to both our countries, were deeply concerned about the whole problem of the North. It was not expected that they should intervene publicly and directly, but the feelings of deep concern which I know that many of them had were not, I feel, without influence. All of us, I think, would wish our relations with our near neighbour to be warm and friendly, as is natural between two countries who have been closely linked in so many ways.  The initiative taken by the British Government a few weeks ago is a step forward in seeking a lasting solution to the remaining problem in this historic relationship.</P>
    <P>Down the years one would imagine that it was only the Orangemen in the North who stood by England.  In the <Col N="503" /> South there were few families that had not relations who took part on the side of Britain in both wars.  It is to the English people I wish to address this. Very few people had not some friend or relation from their own town or village in both World War No. 1 and World War No. 2.  According to some statistics&mdash;I am open to correction&mdash; while one out of every five went from the South to take part in the Second World War the figure was only one in every seven in the North of Ireland. Some British Conservatives, including Enoch Powell and a few others who are trying to sabotage this country, seem to think that the Orangemen are their friends.  If we were speaking in England to an English audience this is an argument we should make.</P>
    <P>There is freedom of movement and constant traffic between us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall not transgress but I felt I had to refer to this passage in the Minister's speech which for me was one of the best in the speech and was a real contribution.  I hope the Minister will live to see the fruits of his work and that the people will help him.  I hope that those who are trying to injure us and injure the country and this assembly will be left to God to see if he will change their minds and their ways.  We are not dictators: we do not want to interfere with others: we want to be left alone to carry out the wishes of the Irish people in this democratic assembly.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Burke, I am prompted to ask whether he or Deputy Hillery is the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We all did a bit of globetrotting as Deputy Burke did.  He boasted of having shaken Willy Brandt's hand in some <Col N="504" /> assembly and of crossing from East to West Germany.  I did that also. On St. Patrick's Day, I presented Willy Brandt with shamrock.  I am sorry Deputy Burke is not within hearing. I drove from the Waldorf Astoria to the saluting base on St. Patrick's Day.  I had Willy Brandt on one side and Governor Dempsey on the other.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke mentioned having crossed from East to West Germany. I did this also and it is a lesson for anyone.  We were part of a parliamentary delegation and we had the privilege of seeing for ourselves the difference between East and West, which is as great as that between night and day.  I do not want to see any eastern tendencies here.  I should like the Minister to know that the Irish people want no Soviet embassy planted here.  An embassy was burned down here: I do not know for what reason.  Are we to shake the bloodstained hands of diplomats who travelled through eastern Europe?  If we want more diplomatic relations let us have them with Poland or Czechoslovakia with whom we have certain things in common.  No, we must go to the top.  The grassroots of this country want no connection with this element.  The ordinary people here do not forget what their sons and daughters, our Irish missionaries, suffered through Communism.  We see May Day celebrations on television; we see the rockets and the jackboots ready to crush wherever they get a footing.  We see what is being done in prolonging the war in Vietnam.</P>

I experienced this when I travelled abroad with the parliamentary delegation. It is up to us to enhance this at every opportunity.  Irrespective of party I must say that we took that opportunity. I remember an incident on a boat when representatives of the different nations began to sing their own country's songs.  We got together and began to sing Irish songs and after a while the coloured people joined us, Americans, Australians, Canadians.  I asked them how they knew these songs and they said they had learned them from the Irish missionaries.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that there was no mention of the matter in the Minister's statement. This indicates his agreement with the idea.  I would like him either to deny or to confirm whether we are to have a Russian Embassy.  For my part I would much prefer to see an embassy in the North of Ireland for the purpose of fostering goodwill among all <Col N="507" /> Irish people.  The green in our national flag signifies the nationalists, the orange is for the Orangeman and the white is the bond between the two, but we are hypocrites if we claim the green.  If this question of a Russian Embassy is a kite that has been flown, I should like to know who flew it in the first place.  I have no wish to taste salt from the Russian saltmines.</P>
      <P>We are told sometimes of the great opportunities that await Irish people in other countries and that the world has much to offer such people as academics or technicians.  However, many Irish people are prepared to sacrifice their large salaries abroad so that they can rear their children in this country and I hope that the atmosphere here will continue to be suitable in that regard.</P>
      <P>I shall refer briefly to the EEC. We have the banner carriers who have the shoes worn from their feet in walking around and telling the people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum.  It is the same crowd who are carrying the banners all the time.  We are fed up with them.  Their purpose is to destroy the trade we have.  They have not as much as a rabbit to sell in the Common Market.  Their only wish is for discord.  There is much Russian money in the country already for the purpose of promoting such discord.  Some of this money is being spent in an effort to prevent people voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum.  What we have here we have earned hard.  There was a time when Fianna Fáil said that the British market was gone forever.  They said &ldquo;the bullock for the road and the farmer for the land&rdquo;.  They have matured a lot since then and are glad of the British market now.  We are slow to change in this country but it is about time we grew up.  I know that the Chair will rule me out of order now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an ócáid seo chun cúpla focal a rá i nGaeilge.  Feicim an focal &ldquo;identity&rdquo; anseo.  Tá baint ag sin leis an dteagmháil atá againn le tíortha eile.  Is maith liom é sin a fheiscint.  Is mar sin ba cheart don scéal a bheith ach caithfidh mé a rá anois is arís go raibh saghas díomá orm nach raibh dóithin á dhéanamh againn chun an cuspóir sin a chur i bhfeidhm.  Ba bhreá liom freisin dá ndéarfadh an tAire focal nó dhó mar gheall ar an dtábhacht a bhaineann leis an gcuspóir sin agus leis an dteanga. Caithfimid bheith carthanach linn féin.  Scaití nuair a labhartar i nGaeilge nó nuair a dhéantar trácht uirthi bíonn mí-thuiscint ann b'fhéidir. Tuigim an fáth atá leis sin i roinnt mhaith áiteanna.  Tá clamhsán beag amháin agam.  Ó thárla go bhfuil seo leagtha síos mar chuspóir is ait liom nach bhfuil tagairt éigin don mhéid atá á dhéanamh againn nó don dhearcadh atá againn an Ghaeilge a úsáid mar chomhartha náisiúnta&mdash;an t-aon chomhartha amháin atá againn <Col N="509" />&mdash;an comhartha is tábhachtaí&mdash;gur náisiún muid.</P>
      <P>I welcome particularly in the Minister's speech the reference to three issues which are described as being basic aspects of any country's relationship with the world.  The first mentioned of those is the assertion of a country's identity.  I am happy to see that fundamental written into the Minister's speech.  I have said in Irish that I regret that while aspiring to this, and while accepting the basic aspect of it we have not, in the Department of Foreign Affairs a section which, in the fulfilment of this basic aspect, are paying particular attention to the part which should be played in the matter of the Irish language.  If there is any one aspect of Irish life which will bring to us this international recognition of our having our own identity, it must be in having a language of our own. I am not saying that it is the only factor but it is possibly one of the most forcible factors which we have. If we are sincere in this, we must be concerned&mdash;and, perhaps, more concerned than we have been to date&mdash; regarding the use of the Irish language as it should be used in displaying to other countries that we have our own identity.  Naturally, this would not be confined to the Irish language.  In matters of culture, education and philosophy we should be making our contribution. I understand how we have been inhibited to date in this regard. I was reared here in circumstances in which I believed in my innocence that there was a knowledge and a recognition throughout the world of the importance of the Irish people and of the important role that Ireland as a country has played.  On the occasion of my visits to Europe to meet people who had, perhaps, even a university education, I was disappointed to be looked upon an an Englishman.  This happened in Paris, Rome and Brussels. I can understand this happening because for many years we lived in the shadow of our neighbours with our lives in much the same pattern as theirs, having done nothing that would distinguish us from them, and not having used our language which would have helped towards this identification and segregation to which we all aspire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> We are now getting the opportunity of indicating at least in Europe that we are a nation.  I should be very sincere here in saying that I do not accept, nor does any Irishman accept, that we are yet a full nation.  On the other hand, I accept that we are a sovereign State and that we enjoy that status.  We all hope that soon we will enjoy a nationhood which will embrace the Thirty-two counties of Ireland. I welcome entry to the EEC for that reason more than any other.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the case which is being made by people who call themselves the anti-marketeers. There are people moving around the city of Dublin defacing walls with the slogan &ldquo;EEC means unemployment&rdquo;. I have not seen any of these people in operation, but I am quite sure that the persons who so deface our walls with this slogan are people who never were gainfully employed in their lives and who, if an opportunity for gainful employment were presented to them, would not accept it.</P>
    <P>I have here a handout from these people.  It comes from a group calling themselves the Robert Emmet Cumann and contains a subhead &ldquo;Agriculture&rdquo;. It says that inside the Common Market no farm or holding earning less than £4,000 per annum is allowed to exist.  We are expected to accept that as a statement of fact coming from a group under the banner of Sinn Féin and taking unto themselves the name of Robert Emmet. This does an injustice to the people who are responsible for Sinn Féin and from whom Sinn Féin came.  It does an injustice to Robert Emmet who asked that his epitaph should not be written until Ireland took her place among the nations of the earth: If these people were making the point that Ireland is not yet a full nation in so far as her nationhood does not embrace the Thirty-two counties, and that we should not take our place in the EEC because of that, then I must admit that I should be sympathetically disposed towards them.  However, in this particular handout there is no reference at all to anything connected with nationhood.  All references are to things material.  They claim to make the case against our entry to the EEC <Col N="511" /> on questions dealing with industry, agriculture and what they call &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo;. That is an indication of the opposition which exists to the EEC. I do not wish to generate any complacency in the matter of the outcome of the referendum but I venture to say that if this is an indication of the opposition we have not much to worry about.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are discussing the Department of Foreign Affairs and its activities over the past two years, I am saddened that we should be discussing what is called the Northern Ireland problem.  The assumption that Northern Ireland is foreign, however factual, is one which I regret very much.  I accept that there are difficulties and that difficulties will continue.  I agree with every other Member of this House that there is only one good and lasting way in which these difficulties can be solved, and that is by peaceful means.  However, a little more is required than a statement of peaceful intentions.  Patriotism requires sacrifice. In this regard I would be critical of fellow Irishmen and, indeed, of myself in so far as we would be exceedingly happy if our ideals could be realised through the efforts and sacrifices of other Irishmen or Irish women.</P>
    <P>I do not think the expression of the hope of solving the problem by peaceful means is sufficient.  A certain element of force is necessary, and by that I do not mean the gun.  I mean the force of example, the example that comes from self-sacrifice or self-denial. I said something here on a former occasion with certain reservations and certain doubts, but the longer I think of it the more I am attracted to restating it.  I said we must be prepared to make sacrifices for what we believe is necessary and not expect our fellow countrymen, in our anxiety to have them with us, to make these sacrifices to fullfil our aspirations.  The sacrifice I have in mind is not the spilling of blood or the throwing of bombs but one that requires the payment of money.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the time has come for us to indicate an initiative. As part of our initiative and an indication <Col N="512" /> of our preparedness to help, I would like to see the payment in respect of the next financial year of £X million towards the phasing out of the subvention which the Six Counties enjoys at the moment.  I know that suggestion will not be acceptable by everyone but, on the other hand, it is one which I personally would be prepared to put to the people in my constituency and on which I would be prepared to stand or fall in a future election.  Sacrifices must be made if we are to achieve the real unification we all desire, the unification of hearts and minds.  I doubt very much if it can be achieved by juggling around or changing the phraseology of our Constitution. I am not dismissing the necessity for changes in our Constitution, but constitutional changes, however attractive they may be, will not satisfy the need unless simultaneously we can indicate in a more telling fashion the sincerity of our feelings and our desire to live in harmony with our fellow Irishmen in the North.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Appointment of Rate Collectors.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in raising this matter on the Adjournment is to expose what many consider to be a national scandal.  I refer to the current system of appointment of rate collectors by county councils.  There is evidence&mdash;there has been evidence for many decades now&mdash;of blatent political corruption in the making of these appointments.  To the most unenlightened political observer it is obvious that there is extreme political chicanery in operation.  It is obvious too that political patronage of the most perverse kind exercises considerable influence in these appointments.  It is obvious there is bribery&mdash;I use the term advisedly&mdash;in some of these appointments.  It is obvious that there is rank political jobbery with its con-commitant corruption.  There is also evidence of nepotism.  All this is, I submit, both undesirable and unhealthy in an alleged democratic system of local government, a system which should be seen by the electorate to have elementary integrity, and it is <Col N="513" /> both undemocratic and unhealthy to allow the present system to continue.</P>
      <P>I have been in political life now for 15 years.  I know very many councillors from many political parties.  I know a number of rate collectors.  I know that aspirants to the job of rate collector must be prepared to offer bribes, bribes equivalent to a year's salary, in advance if one wants to get the job. The instructions sent out by county secretaries to applicants specifies that there must be no question of using influence and no question of canvassing. Both are allegedly prohibited. Nevertheless corruption takes place.</P>
      <P>Who gets these jobs, one may ask? Is it an ordinary unemployed worker? I doubt it very much.  Is it someone from the ranks of the ordinary working people seeking promotion?  I doubt it very much.  Are these jobs given on merit?  Again, I doubt it very much. Are they given on the basis that the person appointed will be full-time and permanently employed?  I doubt it very much.  We have evidence to the contrary. These appointments are given to political supporters.  Those appointed may be farmers seeking an additional perk, or shop keepers wanting a second income.  It may be a local auctioneer looking for a sideline.  It may be a middleman.  These are the kind of people who seek such appointments. One has to be a person of some political substance and influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many councillors will maintain that the appointment of rate collectors is one of the few reserved functions they possess and to take this power from them would be to lesson their democratic rights and would be hurtful to their efforts at local democracy.  I suggest that it is a perversion of democratic procedure to continue to tolerate such an alleged right.  It is no secret that the party which benefits most and which has practised this odious perversion most is the Government party, the majority party in many county councils.  In saying this, I do not exonerate Labour and Fine Gael councillors who might feel they should share in this kind of practice.  The fact is we cannot tolerate this from any political party.  I am convinced that the leader of my party shares the view that <Col N="514" /> it is high time for a general reform and if the Minister wants support in bringing in reform he will have the support of the leader of the Labour Party in that reform.  I am confident that the spokesman on local government in the Labour Party, Deputy Sean Treacy, would wish to see a reformed system introduced.  None of us has precise ideas as to the areas of reform, but we would all wish to see councillors relieved of the pestering which goes on in relation to these appointments of rate collector.</P>
    <P>I have never heard the Taoiseach on the occasions on which this matter has been raised say that he is opposed to the present method of appointment. With his typical ambivalent attitude, he will simply say to one to go ahead and bring in the reforms or he will maintain an utter silence and exhibit a hypocritical innocence.  Deputy Cosgrave has not spoken out against this system.  In respect of a recent appointment in Dublin County Council he saw his party take its share of the loot.  He did not say: &ldquo;Let us call a halt to this&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I exonerate nobody &mdash;Labour, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. We had a typical example in Dublin on 14th March last when two brothers of two councillors, one Fine Gael and one Fianna Fáil, were appointed as rate collectors.  Kevin McMahon, a brother of Councillor Larry McMahon, who is also a TD, got one of the jobs and the other was given to Mr. Tom Murphy, brother of Councillor Jim Murphy.  These were not selected by the Labour councillors, the Fine Gael councillors and the Fianna Fáil councillors working together.  They were selected in the back rooms of both political parties.  That is where they were selected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently in Donegal we had evidence of a newfound conscience by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Senator Bernard McGlinchey, who is going to purify the remnants of Deputy Blaney's rate <Col N="515" /> collectorships, has now taken over.  He stated that educational qualifications are not necessary and a knowledge of the Irish language is not necessary either.  That is what Senator Bernard McGlinchey said as reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  Indeed, in an area where many electors speak the native language, in a Gaeltacht area, Senator Bernard McGlinchey, because he has to ensure that &ldquo;a certain very important person in Fianna Fáil&rdquo; gets the job, a person who is not qualified educationally nor qualified to speak the Irish language, Senator Bernard McGlinchey, the heir apparent of Deputy Jack Lynch in Donegal, decides that he is going to screw this job out of the corrupt system and by about 16 votes to ten the man got the job and the Minister for Local Government has the responsibility of sanctioning that kind of approach or not.</P>
    <P>With respect to County Dublin or Donegal and I represent a part of County Dublin, we are not the only people who act undemocratically and act with injustice on our hands on such a matter.  The Minister is well aware of this.  How many rate collectorships in County Galway go to anybody other than a Fianna Fáil nominee?  Deputy Coogan could, perhaps, inform us.  I do not intend ever to be a Senator. I would rather emigrate than be a Senator because I would never, I am sure, get the votes of the county councillors. I am sure anyway the Minister is aware that in County Galway Fianna Fáil rule the roost.</P>

      <P>County Carlow in a fortnight's time.  County Meath in another fortnight.  I gather that in County Galway the Fianna Fáil bloc vote is exercised with such skill under PR that they can put forward two nominees and know that one or other is a certainty to get the job.  It is down to a fine art in County Galway. Deputy Bobby Molloy knows of the protests in this House when ratepayers in County Galway have had to go <Col N="516" /> through pubs, into backyards, to pay their rates and so on.  We have protested about that kind of practice. Whether it is Dublin, Galway, Donegal or elsewhere the notorious practice is there and it is something which should be stopped.  It gives me no pleasure to raise it.</P>
      <P>Is this the kind of democracy into which we would invite the minority and the majority of Northern Ireland?  Who are we to dare to lecture the Unionist Party on corruption in the matter of public appointments?  Who are we in the Republic and who, above all, are the Fianna Fáil Party to issue such strictures?  They are a political party who have been in office for so long and have had umpteen opportunities to remedy this.  Therefore, I want to assert that the Government party in particular&mdash;the party in power has the prime responsibility in this area&mdash;is, indeed, just as corrupt as the most hard-faced, wheeler-dealer, bigoted member of an Orange Lodge in Northern Ireland when it comes to giving jobs to the boys.  We cannot tolerate this situation any longer.  Are we to invite into the new Ireland the Taoiseach talks about or the Ireland of the Seventies that Deputy Dr. Hillery talks so fluently about&mdash;he is not very articulate at the best of times &mdash;the people of Northern Ireland, into that kind of political situation?</P>
      <P>It gives me no pleasure to raise this and may be the Minister will reply that I am casting aspersions on unfortunate rate collectors.  I simply state the practice and I do not propose to impute anything to any particular rate collector. I am attacking basically the system.  If there is a corrupt system the temptation is to avail of it.  The Irish Local Government and Public Services Union has repeatedly, at successive annual conferences, asked the Minister to change the system of appointment, to change what they have called a rotten system of corruption. There are many areas where the Minister can bring in reforms.</P>

      <P>The Minister should consider amending the County Management Act, 1940, in terms of the reserved function.  He could easily insist that there be introduced the system that operates in the urban area generally.  There are substantial variations available to the Minister.  I am referring now to county council rate collector appointments.  The whole procedure could be developed on the Local Appointments Commission. I do not think that is necessary. I think we have a much more effective system in operation.  In Dublin Corporation we have a special system for the creation of such collectorships.  It is a question of internal competition.  Notices are made out, basic educational standards apply, a full interview system is in operation by an impartial general board composed of representatives of the legal, the valuation and the personnel departments of that corporation. They do the general interviewing and candidates emerge on merit.  This is the most fair system and the most effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not adopt the attitude of wiping his hands clean and saying this is the responsibility of any county council who wants to do it and that he as Minister will support it. This is not good enough.  He should take his courage in his hands and not slide away from the responsibility which is his.  We should not bring democracy into disrepute any further. The electorate are disillusioned and disenchanted enough with Dáil Éireann.  The electorate are apathetic enough in relation to Dáil Éireann, cynical enough about politicians, but <Col N="518" /> when there is exhibited, as in recent weeks, such examples of political corruption then it is high time the Minister stood up and said he will change the system for the better and make it much more effective and democratic than it is at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct the impression given by Deputy Desmond when he referred to the vacancy for a rate collector in Donegal.  I did not give my sanction; I refused to give it to the person proposed by Donegal County Council as that person did not meet the minimum qualifications required for the post.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw a clear distinction between the role of the Minister and that of the local authority.  Under the law as it stands the actual selection of county rate collectors who possess the standard qualifications as regards age, health and education is solely a matter for the county council.  It is true that at one stage the appointment was subject to the sanction of the Minister but this power, together with a wide range of other powers, was devolved on local authorities on 2nd March, 1970.  The usual criticism is that too much power is centred in the Custom House and this devolution was one of a series of steps to meet that type of criticism.  The recent appointments in Dublin, assuming that the persons appointed possessed the qualifications declared for the office, are entirely a matter for the county council. It is possible to question the wisdom of a policy of devolution not only in relation to the appointment of rate collectors but many other matters in relation to which allegations are often made.  I am only mentioning this in passing.  My main purpose is to stress that the appointments referred to are entirely within the competence of the county council and that no proposals were submitted to me as this was not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to outline briefly the relevant procedures dealing with this matter.  Under the provisions of section 16 (7) of the County Management Act, 1940, the appointment of county rate collectors is reserved to the elected county members.  All other appointments <Col N="519" /> are executive functions, that is, the appointments are made by the managers.  But, subject to some preliminary procedures aimed at establishing that candidates have the necessary qualifications, the actual selection of the collectors is left to each local authority to decide for itself.  The method of selection generally used is that of selection by ballot by the elected members.  Some local authorities have resorted to the appointment of county council officials as office rate collectors.</P>
    <P>The power of the county council to decide the method of selection is given in Article 26 (g) of the Local Government Officers Regulations, 1943. Specific sanction of the Minister to the individual appointments is no longer required because general sanctions have been given to local authorities covering a wide range of staff matters and I have referred to that.</P>
    <P>Arguments which have been put forward in the past by county councillors for retaining the present system are that the appointment of rate collectors could be said to be related to the council's control of financial and rating matters; that the office of rate collector does not require the qualities best assessed by competition or interview; that it is important that a local man be selected who will have knowledge of and be sympathetic with local conditions and the financial circumstances of the ratepayers.  As against this, it is well known that there is extensive canvassing before appointments and the possibility of underhand abuses always exist under the present system.</P>
    <P>To remove this power from the elected members would require amending legislation.  In March, 1955, a proposal to change the method of appointment of rate collectors was put to a free vote of the Dáil and was lost by 77 votes to 18.  The proposal was by way of an amendment to the City and County Management (Amendment) Bill, 1954.  The arguments which were used by those who were opposing the amendment were to the effect that this represented a whittling down of the existing powers of members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> I have gone back to that debate and, contrary to what Deputy Desmond has been saying here that if Labour were in government they certainly would have changed this law, it is rather strange that a Labour Deputy, who was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government at that time, defended the present system.  I should like to quote from the Official Report of the 29th March, 1955.  This Deputy, the Parliamentary Secretary at that time, said:</P>
    <P>When I sought the votes of the people of my native constituency for the 14th time during the last general election campaign I promised them, among other things, that I would use my influence to secure the restoration of some of the powers that had been taken away from local authorities by the various City and County Management Acts, Acts against which I myself have voted on almost every occasion.  I never even hinted privately or publicly, either in my election address or in any speech, that I would proceed to take from local authorities one of the few powers left in their possession.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, I was present with the Minister when he met a very representative group of the members of the Laois County Council. There are three groups there, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour. There are no Independents.  On that occasion they unanimously asked the Minister to allow them to retain this power of appointing rate collectors.</P>
    <P>When it went to a vote, it was a free vote and quite a number of influential Labour Members voted to retain the present system.  Among those were Deputy James Everett and Deputy William Norton, who was the leader of the Labour Party at that time.  Both of these gentlemen have since&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To come to the posts that are referred to in the newspaper report.  These posts that the newspaper refers to were new posts which the council created after an intensive examination of their collection areas and which examination, in the local authority's view, established that the rate collector was more successful and less costly than the office method of collecting. That was their opinion at that time.  The question that the Deputy has raised here on the Adjournment states that the method of appointment of rate collectors has been criticised from time to time by the Irish Local <Col N="522" /> Government and Public Services Union. This may be so but no recent communication from the union about this appears to be on record in the Department.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would just like to say that, as I have indicated here, this is a matter which has been considered on a number of occasions in the House. It was considered in 1940 and again in 1955 and, as is evident from what I have said, opinions differed among the Opposition parties who were in Government at that time.  The Fine Gael and Labour Members differed on it. All I can say finally is that when the House gets an opportunity to discuss legislation dealing with the general question of the powers and functions of members of local authorities, this matter would fall to be considered in that context.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 19th April, 1972.</P>
