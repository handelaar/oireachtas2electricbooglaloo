      <P>I understand that it is agreed that the House will hear a statement from the Taoiseach now.  The Leader of Fine Gael and the Leader of the Labour Party will be called subsequently and the House will then adjourn until Thursday next at 10.30 a.m.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, do I understand that as representing Aontacht Éireann here my right to speak will not be recognised by the Chair?  Further, could I ask from you if it is proposed on Thursday to discuss the situation in the North or is it proposed virtually to ignore that situation and continue the business of the Dáil?</P>

      <P>On the question put by the Deputy, if he can be called now to speak on behalf of his party, the position is that the Chair does not recognise that he represents a party for this purpose since only those elected as a party at a General Election can be recognised by the Chair. So far as the business on Thursday is concerned that is a matter for the Government.</P>

      <P>Further, on the matter of business on Thursday, what opportunity will we have in the House before it adjourns this afternoon&mdash;I am not in any way trying to prevent the adjournment, in fact I am in full agreement with it&mdash;to consider whether in fact this very important matter will be taken on Thursday as I requested a fortnight ago that it should be?</P>

      <P>As a matter of information, while I appreciate that it is a matter for the Government to order business, I made a request a fortnight ago, on the first day we met in this session, for time to discuss the situation in the Six Counties.  Since then, unfortunately, circumstances have altered very considerably and makes even more urgent now that there should be such a discussion.  All I am asking from the Chair as guidance is whether there will be any opportunity before we adjourn this evening, as we rightfully should adjourn, to discuss what the business will be on Thursday, because this matter is urgent and is not one that we can put on the long finger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the saddest occasion on which I have ever addressed this House.  We share with the people of Derry the tragedy which has befallen them.</P>
      <P>Derry has a special place in the history of Ireland.  It was there that Columcille founded a church and it was from there that he carried his torch to Iona.  Columcille is claimed as much by Protestants as by Catholics as one of the great Irish pilgrims of Christianity.</P>
      <P>Derry has been magnificent also in other ways.  It has been fought over, been attacked and defended heroically. Derry is a city which could be beautiful. Its people have the desire, the ability and, above all, the pride to make it so.  To have misunderstood this about Derry's character is the most ignoble thing of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The madness that brought death to Derry last Sunday will never be forgotten. <Col N="825" /> In time it will be forgiven&mdash;out of charity.  I can say no more about this and nothing better than Columcille said:</P>
    <P>Is aire charaim Doire ar a réide, ar a gloine;</P>
    <P>ar is iomlan aingel finn on chinn co n-ice ar-oile.</P>
    <P>Which translated, means &ldquo;This is why I love Derry, it is so calm and bright; for it is all full of white angels from one end to the other&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What we can do now and resolve to do is to bend every effort to ensure that these days and months, indeed years, of refusal to govern justly in Northern Ireland shall end and never again will recur.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that there must now be</P>
    <P>(i)  an immediate withdrawal of British troops from Derry and Catholic ghettos elsewhere in the North and cessation of harassment of the minority population;</P>
    <P>(ii)  an end to internment without trial; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  a declaration of Britain's intention to achieve a final settlement of the Irish question and the convocation of a conference for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that nothing less can bring about peace. We also believe that these proposals will put an end to violence.</P>
    <P>I know the two Opposition parties support these proposals in the main.  I had discussions on the present situation with their leaders, Deputies Cosgrave and Corish.  We are united in our concern to show national solidarity at this time without letting other differences we may have intervene.  I ask all the people to stand behind and to support this united endeavour to secure the unity that really matters and which alone will be enduring&mdash;the unity of minds and hearts of all the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs is leaving today to visit other Governments and the Secretariat General of the United Nations to explain our <Col N="826" /> position and to seek support wherever we can find it.</P>
    <P>As I said in my broadcast statement last night, subject to the approval of the House, the Government have also decided to provide out of public moneys finance through suitable channels for political and peaceful action by the minority in Northern Ireland, designed to obtain their freedom from Unionist misgovernment.</P>
    <P>I would also repeat that in this time of grave national danger Irish men and women will show to the world their patriotism by their dignity and their discipline.  I have already indicated that the Government have called for a national day of mourning tomorrow. Many organisations had already undertaken to do this.  Civil servants will be given permission to attend religious services and local authority employees will be given similar permission.  I hope business and other undertakings will make suitable arrangements likewise. To mark the mourning of the nation, Dáil Éireann will not meet tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The unusual nature of the short debate here this evening I think emphasises very clearly the deep sense of sorrow that everyone in this country feels for the people who were so wantonly killed in Derry last Sunday.  On behalf of this Party I have already expressed the very deep sympathy we feel for the relatives of the bereaved and the wish on this occasion to repeat that expression of sympathy and to join in the united expression of regret which the Dáil is formally making by holding this emergency debate and adjourning until after the funerals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In expressing sympathy with those who have died, I think it is right that we should once again condemn the circumstances in which they were killed. In doing so, it is essential to realise that the prime cause of this situation is the fact that this country was partitioned just more than 50 years ago and that the reaction of all right-thinking people, including many who are in the majority in the area that was partitioned, realise that that decision was a mistake and that it was not permanent. We have consistently endeavoured in this part of the country to bring not <Col N="827" /> only before the British Government but before the bar of world opinion our united aim to see the country reunited.</P>
    <P>We have publicly expressed on behalf of all sections of opinion here that the vast majority of the people of this country want unity by peaceful means. Probably the greatest evil next to the suffering of the people who have been directly bereaved is the fact that the British approach to this problem has, unfortunately, resulted in a great many people thinking that only violence can achieve unity, and I think that while we are expressing our great concern at what has happened and our sympathy with the people who have suffered, we should realise it is predictable that something like this could happen again unless the British Government and people move towards making a political solution possible.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I think it is important on this occasion to look calmly and realistically at the situation, that there is a great risk, an understandable justification for it but a risk, involved in a wave of emotionalism sweeping the country.  If it is for one reason more than another that we have endeavoured to make it quite clear that as far as the Opposition are concerned we are united in our determination to bring this tragic situation to an end, it is because we believe that only Dáil Éireann and those organs responsible to the Dáil can speak and act for the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no double thinks about this.  We have to face the reality of the issue of peace or war and because of our history and because the British have learned nothing by their experience&mdash;indeed recent events would indicate that the present British Government and probably a large share of British opinion, because they are uninformed on it, have learned nothing from the history of this country, especially in the last 50 years if not longer&mdash;I should like to make it quite clear that it is neither in the interests of those we all seek to relieve from the oppressive burdens which they have borne for so <Col N="828" /> long with such restraint and such forbearance, that any policy of reprisals would be against their interests as well as against the interests of the nation.</P>
      <P>This, of course, is not easy to say. It is not the kind of approach that gets any recognisable support but opinions are, in many cases, on matters of this sort, transient things and I think it is important that it should go clearly from this House to the country and particularly to those who may be, because of their natural human reactions, which everyone understands, disposed to indulge in reprisals or to take action of that character.</P>
      <P>In addition, I think it is important that we should make sure that purposeful, political initiatives are taken at the very highest level and while I understand the difficulty of getting the feelings of this country across to the present British Government I believe the time has come for a delegation consisting of the Taoiseach, Deputy Corish and myself to have a meeting with the British Prime Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If no good can come out of discussions certainly they can hardly do any harm.  In addition, I believe we should send an all-party delegation to the United Nations to emphasise to that international body that on this issue there are no shades of different opinions between the elected representatives of the people in this State.  We should endeavour to raise at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, under the terms of Article 2 of the Convention on Human Rights, the question of an international inquiry.  I say this because there is no faith among any section of the people in a British inquiry into what happened last Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It used to be a boast that British justice was seen to operate as well as operating in practice.  All the recent inquiries refute that assertion and claim and we want to see an international inquiry conducted by independent qualified jurists of standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we should make representations <Col N="829" /> to the Governments with which Ireland has diplomatic relations because I believe that the role this State has played since Independence has entitled us to the respect of many countries, some old friends but a number of new ones, because of the particular qualities that our representatives in these organisations have secured not only for themselves but for the country.</P>
    <P>In uniting for this particular purpose it is right that we should fully understand that we do so because we believe that in this matter of the evil of the partition of Ireland and everything that has flowed from it we want to present a united front in representing the people as a whole and to bring the force of that unity to bear on the British Government as well as those who are responsible for continuing the present state of affairs in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I should like again on this occasion to repeat what has been so often said not only on behalf of this party but in this House and throughout the country that the Unionists have nothing to fear in a united Ireland.  This party and this State guarantees that, not without considerable sacrifice, not without considerable suffering.  We have demonstrated in this State since it was established, what can be said of few emergent, independent States: the scrupulous care that was taken to guarantee the rights of religious and other minorities which is the most cogent evidence of our determination to ensure that if a political settlement is secured for this last remaining political problem of relations between Ireland and Britain this State will play its part fully and with scrupulous regard for the interests of every section.</P>
    <P>The present situation is one in which we should as a nation not only pause and take stock but endeavour to profit by what has happened in making the most strenuous efforts to see that nothing like it will occur again and that the political initiative which could and should result in a settlement acceptable to every section will get the support and the impetus necessary to bring it into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On an occasion like this one is excused if one speaks with a certain amount of emotion but I trust that I will speak with restraint.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my party I would also wish to offer my deep and sincere sympathy to the families, friends and all the people of the minority in the North on the deaths of the 13 young people in Derry last Sunday caused by the murderous and unprovoked attack by the British Army on a peaceful march and meeting.  Sympathy at this stage is, however, little consolation to the innocent victims who died but it will help the relatives who must live on with this horror.  It was with a sense of shock and horror that the news was received by the people in all parts of the island and indeed by the other civilised nations of the world.</P>
      <P>We commend and support the call for tomorrow to be designated as a day of mourning by the entire population. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have asked that tomorrow be regarded as a day of mourning and of reparation. My own union, the Irish Transport and General Workers Union and the other large union, the Workers Union of Ireland, have made similar calls to their members which we fully support and in which we will participate. This, in itself, will demonstrate the solidarity of the entire people in their opposition to the military activity of the British Army in the Six Counties under the direction of the Stormont regime and with the approval of the Tory Government.</P>
      <P>I support the Taoiseach's recall of the ambassador from London in order to demonstrate to the British Government and people the seriousness with which we regard the present situation and I want him to be assured of our solidarity in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present crisis in the North of Ireland began with the violence instituted by the RUC and the B Specials in Derry on 5th October, 1968.  It reached its tragic climax with the violence instituted by the British Army in Derry last Sunday.  This Parliament is united in saying to the British Government that that must be the end of the violence and never again should <Col N="831" /> armed troops shoot down unarmed civilians demonstrating in their own streets.</P>
    <P>The tragic and ominous signs, however, after reading the debate on the shootings in the British House of Commons yesterday, are that there does not seem to be any change of policy whatsoever contemplated by the British Government in their total dependence on military suppression rather than on political initiatives and action designed to bring peace to the war-ridden area of our country.  The contributions of many of the Tory MPs would lead one to believe that the British have learned nothing in dealing with this centuries old problem of British domination over Ireland and, for the last 50 years, part of the island.</P>
    <P>The murderous tragedy of last Sunday must never again be repeated.  For that reason the Taoiseach is right in recalling the ambassador and in sending the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hillery, to the United Nations because dramatic action must be taken to shake the British Government out of its indolence, indifference, lethargy and apathy.  The attitude of the British Government can only be characterised as callous in the extreme.  As of this moment it seems that the British Government is intent upon repeating last Sunday's carnage in Newry next weekend when another Civil Rights demonstration will take place.  It seems that, no matter what bans are imposed or advice given, this march will go on because of the passions aroused by last Sunday's events.  Therefore, in the few days that remain, I stress that the Irish Government must explore and exploit every opportunity to mobilise British and international public opinion in order to make it impossible for the British Government to repeat in Newry next Sunday what happened in Derry last Sunday.</P>
    <P>This is the most immediate and urgent task now facing this Government and this House.  The British Government must be stopped in its present policies which are nothing more than a total reliance on its army to repress <Col N="832" /> unarmed demonstrations.  If a further holocaust is to be prevented next Sunday in Newry and if further holocausts are to be prevented in other centres in the Six Counties immediate action is necessary by both the Irish and the British Governments.  For our part, the Labour Party ask our Government to take the following steps without delay.  First, further to demonstrate to the British Government the national solidarity of this country and the unity of the political parties in this House on the specific questions of both civil rights and reunification, there should be established, and established without delay, the all-party committee on the Northern question which has been the subject of informal discussions between the Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave and myself.  I support this idea and my party will take part in such a committee if the committee is given responsibility for policy-making as well as for consideration of a new constitution for all the people of Ireland in a united Ireland, together with the social and economic consequences of unity.  It is essential that this committee be established straight away so that the British may know that they are dealing with a united people.  Our position on the adumbrated constitutional changes is well known.  We want them.  As a further demonstration of the Government's sense of urgency, I suggest that the Taoiseach should appoint without delay a Minister with sole responsibility for the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs, because of its preoccupations with the EEC, is not the most appropriate agency to deal with Northern affairs in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, in order to expose the British Government to the maximum so as to spotlight its callous policies and force it to abandon them, the Government should demand that either the Council of Europe or the United Nations set up an international inquiry into the Derry murders.  From all accounts, it appears that Westminster will give support only to the establishment <Col N="833" /> of a British judicial inquiry. We have had too many of these.  With all due respect to those who have officiated on them, there has been, as there must be, an element of bias in their reports.  That was abundantly apparent in the disgraceful Compton Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, I do not believe that those who participated in last Sunday's march and meeting and those who witnessed the indiscriminate shooting will give any support or evidence to any British commission of inquiry.  The reports of other British commissions neither satisfied nor convinced the minority and the only way in which to ascertain the facts is through a commission of inquiry composed of representatives of countries which cannot be said to be in any degree partial one way or the other. The underlying principle of any tribunal of inquiry should simply be that the British Government is accused and the British Government cannot, therefore, be the prosecutor.  If, however, the British Government persists in its refusal to agree to an international commission of inquiry, then I say our Government should establish its own commission of inquiry so that a balanced and comprehensive report can be made to inform world opinion of what really happened in Derry.  The world will not get this from a purely British tribunal but it can get it if our own Government established a parallel judicial inquiry to that of the British.</P>
      <P>Today, the British press has almost totally accepted the British Army version of what happened: three bullets killed 13 people.  This distortion must be exposed.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, our peace-keeping forces in Cyprus should be completely withdrawn in order that they may be able to engage in peace-keeping duties at home.  It is cynical that we should be engaged in peace-keeping operations in Cyprus whilst the British Army, who entered the Six Counties as an alleged peace-keeping force, are now seen to be acting in the role of oppressors.  Our present Army strength must be augmented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> Lastly, we will support the Taoiseach's proposal to give immediate financial assistance to the Social Democratic and Labour Party and other political organisations in the North which have as their aim the immediate achievement of civil rights and the reunification of our country. My party has a special relationship with the Social Democratic and Labour Party.  We have a deep admiration for the strength of character they have shown in this hour of crisis. They, as we do, reject any form of violence as a solution.  They deserve the moral and financial support of this House and of our people.</P>
    <P>As for the Unionist Government, it must go immediately.  I must admit to a sense of despair when I address myself to that quarter for, in the past, the members of that Government have shown themselves totally deaf and indifferent to voices from this side of the Border.  In fact, one could say they have been positively hostile to what they regard as outside interference.  In the name of sanity, humanity and reason I ask the British Government to do the following: it should abolish Stormont forthwith, as my party requested the British Labour Government to do in August, 1969.  Stormont is distintegrating anyway as can be seen from the splits and factions within the Unionist Party itself.  It has been abundantly clear since August, 1969, that Stormont was prepared to use every device to block the granting of civil rights to the minority there.  The Unionist Party showed in the debate that they were prepared to deny these rights by every legal trick&mdash;by, if necessary, resorting to physical methods in order to maintain the superiority of the Unionist Party and the privilege and patronage that go with support for that party and that regime.</P>
    <P>The advent of the Tory Government in Britain has made the task of Stormont infinitely easier in this respect because the Tories have demonstrated their willingness to use the forces of the Crown as the military arm of Unionism rather than as a peace-keeping force which could contribute to a situation leading to a political solution. <Col N="835" /> Mr. Heath, apparently, thinks he is operating back in the nineteenth century; he believes the might of the British Army is sufficient to crush the aspirations of people to live a free life with equality of rights.  In this he is absolutely mistaken.  If he continues to permit Stormont to exist for one more week it is positive proof that he is prepared to permit a sectarian regime to continue, a regime which cynically manipulates power so as to deny one section of the community the civil rights which the same Mr. Heath so proudly proclaims as being the basis of the British way of life.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the demand of the Social, Democratic and Labour Party for the ending of internment without trial as a precondition of political talks must be granted forthwith.  Lord Balneil admitted last night on television that the position had drastically deteriorated since the introduction of internment without trial.  This admission is shared publicly by many of the Tory Party in Britain and privately by members of the Unionist Government in Stormont. Everybody admits that internment was the turning point but Lord Balneil last night defended the policy which has led directly to the deaths of nearly 150 people by stating that they could not let loose bombers and murderers.  But these men were at liberty before internment when he admits that the situation was not as bad as it became immediately after internment.  If he believes these men to be bombers and murderers why does he not test this in any court of law?</P>
    <P>We oppose internment without trial on two counts: first, because we are against internment without trial in principle and believe that if any man breaks the law he should be charged immediately, and that includes those responsible for British Army behaviour in Derry last Sunday; secondly, because it is an obstacle to political talks, an obstacle which the minority will not remove since they did not put it there. The Stormont Government put it there and so long as it remains people will die.  If the British Government want peace they should end internment because it prevents men of peace from <Col N="836" /> participating in talks that could produce peace.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the Social Democratic and Labour Party have long been calling for the withdrawl of the British forces from the mainly Catholic areas where, in the words of their party leader, Gerry Fitt, these forces have been nothing more than a provocation to the minority.  Their very presence has been, on occasion, a contributing factor to violence and loss of life, as was seen by millions of television viewers last Sunday in Derry.  They have humiliated and brutalised the minority; they have lost all credibility as a peace-keeping force.  They are regarded as nothing more than a latterday B Special force, and just as that body had to be withdrawn from Derry in August, 1969, so today the British Army must be withdrawn in a similar fashion.</P>
    <P>Specifically and immediately I say to the British Government&mdash;this is my fifth point&mdash;the British paratroopers should be withdrawn totally from Northern Ireland and sent back to England where they should be confined to barracks.  Anybody with elementary knowledge of military forces knows that they are the antithesis of peacekeepers: they are skilled and highly-trained killers who know nothing about police work or crowd control except to shoot and beat those who get in their way.  The very fact that Mr. Heath allowed these particular troops to be used in the highly-charged situation of last Sunday demonstrates how totally out of touch he is with the situation.  Send these troops home immediately; indeed, send all British troops out of the North of Ireland as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Civil Rights Association has announced its intention to proceed with a peaceful march on Sunday in Newry in a just demand for civil rights.  It must not be interfered with. This is a peaceful demonstration for a just cause by a deprived people and must be totally distinguished from those Orange marches such as the Apprentice Boys, which are nothing more than provocative demonstrations of power and superiority.  The whole world will be watching Newry next Sunday.  The British Government must <Col N="837" /> not allow its name to be written once more in blood in the world's headlines.</P>
    <P>One last point for Mr. Heath: yesterday my party conveyed to Mr. Harold Wilson, leader of the British Opposition, the sense of revulsion felt by the entire population here at the killings in Derry last Sunday.  I say from these benches in this House to the British Government that they should be aware of it also.  They are dealing with an enraged people.  Powerful emotions have been unloosed that could destroy us all.  If the British Government have any intention of reaching a just solution, of restoring Anglo-Irish relations, then I say they should put those responsible for last Sunday's killings on trial for murder. If the American Army faced up to its moral responsibilities in dealing with its My Lai, then the British should do the same in respect of Derry.  I hope even at this late hour Mr. Heath and his Government will listen to voices of sanity from this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> These are my views on this terrible and immediate crisis.  The need of the moment is action with immediate answers such as I have outlined.  They will contribute to the solution but will not solve the whole question of unity.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I say to all our people and all our public representatives and all Members of Dáil and Seanad Éireann: we must prepare the country for unification and be prepared to make the changes and the sacrifices which up to now we have been unwilling to make. Our Constitution needs to be changed; our whole economic and social system needs to be changed and our legal code needs to be changed.  In these matters, therefore, this House must give the lead if it wants to retain the confidence of the people.  We must show courage and not alone courage but honesty if we are to retain public respect.  Let us begin now.</P>
