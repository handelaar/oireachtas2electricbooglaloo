    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on it already. May I read out the amendment since there was so much hugger-mugger last night and so many interruptions?  It reads:</P>
      <P>Before section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The enactments mentioned in the Schedule to this Act (being enactments that are superseded or to be superseded by reason of the European Communities' obligations and of the provision made by this Act in relation thereto or which are not compatible with the European Communities' obligations) are hereby repealed or amended, as the case may be, to the extent specified in the said <Col N="1227" /> Schedule with effect from the 1st day of January, 1973&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The only answer to that amendment given by the Minister last night was that there is such a thing as repeal by implication.  It is true that any subsequent Act which conflicts with an earlier Act does, in fact, under the Interpretation Act, repeal the earlier Act but this is not the case of an Act conflicting with an earlier Act. This is the case of an Act which was drafted in such a global fashion that it did not repeal the earlier Act by implication or otherwise.  This lazy man's method was adopted by the Minister to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as repeal by implication.  If there is a conflict between a new Act and an earlier Act, the new Act prevails but it only prevails if it is specifically laid down in the Act.  I am right.  The Minister can shake his head if he likes but I am quite clear about this.  This refers not only to the Interpretation Act, 1937, but also to the Interpretation Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>It is no use the Minister coming in here pretending to us that there can be repeal by implication.  It cannot be done.  It is not a proper method of legislating.  We had another extreme the day before in the Marriages Bill when it was spelled out three or four times.  We have gone from one extreme to the other.  The purpose of the amendment, with which I am in complete agreement&mdash;this is the first amendment on which I have spoken&mdash;is to set this out in words of one syllable.  It is the right way to legislate.  Is the Minister prepared to listen to reason at all?  If the Minister accepts the amendment, the debate is over.  He is consorting with his colleague at the moment.  Is he prepared to accept the amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Repeal by implication is not a reason for refusing <Col N="1228" /> to do the thing properly.  I have said everything I want to say, subject to what the Minister will say in reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a great deal of frustration one speaks to an amendment knowing that no matter what arguments we produce the Minister will still say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  As I said last night, this shows the utter contempt of the Government for the processes of democracy.  When the Minister, who is in alleged control of his Department, shows this disregard while he is here with us, we can well imagine what indifference he will display towards Ireland when he goes as Commissioner to Brussels.</P>
      <P>Nothing is more essential than that we should know the law, that people would know the effects of EEC obligations, and unless the Government spell this out here, as is done in numerous other Acts, it will be impossible to know the effects of EEC obligations. The only possible explanation is that the Minister and his legal advisers do not know the ramifications of European obligation.  That is a considerable difficulty but I do not think it is a sufficient reason for not spelling out what they do know in the schedule to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Possibly a preamble to our amendment might overcome any difficulty. When we have provided in Acts in the past that a Minister may make regulations, we have used such phrases as &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred&rdquo; and so on. Then the particular heads the Minister may bear in mind in making regulations are spelled out.  If the legal advisers to the Government are yet unable to say what will be the total effects of EEC obligations, I would suggest that some words at the outset of the amendment might cover the matter, such as &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of the effect of appeals and amendments consequent on this legislation&rdquo;, <i>et cetera</i>.  This is the least guidance that should be given.  I believe it should be done in the Bill itself and not in a separate publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan referred to the difficulty people have in chasing documentation. That is the situation here. <Col N="1229" /> People should be able to go to some source instrument to quickly ascertain the legal consequences of European involvement. If it be that the Government are not willing to accede in this regard, I have some other questions to put very specifically to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The cost of books for one European Law Library in Dublin containing all necessary documents would be £13,000. Are the Government prepared to put up that money so that by 1st January, 1973, people would be able to go to such a law library for reference?  That is the least obligation they should fulfil. Are they prepared to provide the cost of this annual publication for such a library, which would be £1,800 per year?  The legal fraternity in Dublin would be glad to staff and advise on such a library.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister that Government Departments will need such a reference library.  So will Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and so will the legal profession. The legal fraternity have asked, have begged the Government to make this available but the Government have turned a deaf ear.  They are prepared to have consultations and discussions on this matter, but it looks as if Ireland will be a hoary old man in the EEC before we have an essential reference library and legal reference facilities. This means that the Irish people will have to engage the services of foreign lawyers.  We may be obliged by the Treaty of Accession to facilitate foreign lawyers coming here but we do not have to open our doors and invite them in simply because we do not provide in Ireland the very minimum legal necessities.</P>
    <P>Other member countries have found it possible to write in a schedule of amended Acts in the legislation they had to initiate in order to give effect to their obligations to the EEC.  In Britain, for instance, they have schedules which run to 26 pages and the legislation they are amending goes back much further than ours.  The earliest Act we make reference to in the explanatory memorandum, which is in no way complete, is no more than about 100 years old.  Most of the statutes are laws of our own making <Col N="1230" /> since the establishment of the State.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum while incomplete is of some help, but any lawyer knows it is unwise to rely upon some casual reference, when an exhaustive search of the law is necessary before giving advice.  Nothing is more misleading than to look only at one particular Act.  You have to search to see whether the Minister made regulations and you must look into the whole ambit of the regulations and refer to a date as recent as the previous day. While the memorandum is of some guidance to scholars who may have time to make studies, it is of no assistance to the ordinary legal practitioner. It is to the legal practitioner that the ordinary man and woman, the ordinary businessman, will have to refer.  This is not an abstract matter, far away from the people's way of life.  The legislation which is rather casually referred to in the appendix to the explanatory memorandum deals with a multitude of things, from industrial relations to company law to agricultural produce. Surely these affect people very materially and, therefore, the people ought to know precisely the effect of European law.  It is not an answer to say that the people answered these matters on 10th May last.  They had an overall problem to decide and they decided it.  That is no answer for those who have a point of law needing clarification.</P>
    <P>This is most important when we realise that this House has given to Ministers absolute power of absolute legislation and that there is nothing to curtail a Minister's freedom to amend all the statute law.  We should at least know the position as of 1st January next as of that date and thereafter we can look to various regulations which may be under the European Communities Act, 1972, to see what the future legislative steps may be.  If we do not do this, we will end up in chaos.  This is the least the Government can do for our people who gave their votes to enter Europe, but did not give this vote to entitle the Government to strip the people of their clothes, and to render the people's representatives impotent. That is what the Government are doing. They are destroying this Parliament. They are not giving the Dáil any supervisory <Col N="1231" /> powers, or any opportunity to give assistance or advice, or to express opinions.  They are going to operate in isolation, ignoring this House and without giving this House an opportunity of knowing what is happening until it is an accomplished fact.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to the basic knowledge of what is happening as at the 1st January next.  We can assess the position thereafter, but it is expecting the impossible to expect that one person will know the law as on that date. If we brought in a Bill here saying that in future the legal principle that &ldquo;everybody is expected to know the law&rdquo; shall not apply there might be some justification for the Government's attitude.  People in this House and others could find themselves personally charged with offences, civil or criminal, under European law and it would be no answer for them to say that they did not know the law.  Why will the legal advisers not know the law?  They will not know it because the Government apparently do not know it, or if they do, they are not prepared to tell us.</P>
    <P>I put two questions to the Minister: does the Minister know all the consequences of the Communities' obligations, and, if so, why does the Minister not write them into the Schedule of this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this point last night.  Deputy Ryan made that speech last night.  Anything I have to say I said last night.  There seems to be no chance of finality if we keep going around on this point. Perhaps we should go back to thinking about how the legal profession works.  It should be the task of a lawyer, if consulted by a member of the public, to find out what the law is. Already, there are laws which have been changed by implied repeals, even though Deputy O'Donovan indicated that he never heard of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I indicated what it meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the Deputy said he never heard of it.  In the case of a person having to deal with <Col N="1232" /> matters of law which may have been changed by ministerial regulation arising out of membership of the European Economic Community, if he goes to a lawyer the lawyer has an indication, in so far as it could be done although it is not said to be exhaustive, from the Schedule what laws have already been changed. In the future new laws will be changing as regulations are made.  The lawyer will know from the indication given what laws are affected and the way in which they are affected.  It is his job to find out now.  I do not know of any other profession saying that the Government should provide their instruments and do their research for them.</P>
      <P>We have a difficult time ahead&mdash; parliamentarians, lawyers, businessmen, farmers and workers alike.  We will all have extra work to do.  Our work will be more difficult also.  The lawyers share of this difficulty will be to find the laws which are changed and the way in which they are changed.  In this Schedule we have given a large example of laws which are affected.  This will put lawyers on their guard and they should search out in what way the laws are affected by seeking to find the regulations affecting them.  Since there is a difficult time ahead and since there are added burdens, the Departments of State will be available to lawyers to guide them to find the regulations in so far as they can help.  It will still be for the lawyer to find out what the law is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan said last night that not a lawyer in Dublin could know the effects of the changes and still he expects the lawyers in the Department of Foreign Affairs to write down immediately the effect of what is going to happen.  The legal profession will have difficulties.  Their work will be harder just as the work of many people in this country will be more difficult.  The principles of their finding out what the law is will remain the same.  The method of finding out will be clear because we have added this Schedule.  The Departments of State, in the various areas in which regulations are made, will do everything in their power to help lawyers <Col N="1233" /> or members of the public to clarify how the law stands having been changed by implied repeal.</P>
    <P>There will be cases where it will not be possible to say what the extent, if any, the conflict will be between the new law and any regulations and the old law.  This will be a matter for the courts.  The lawyers know that. It would not be possible for us to do it all now.  From the point of view of manpower and the availability of people to see us legally into the European Communities, it would not be possible to repeal specifically the conflicting items here where we are certain there is conflict in the legislation, but we have listed, though not exhaustively, many of the measures affected.  It would be misleading them to give them a list of specifically repealed measures or amended legislation while there are other measures affected by regulations which can only be found out in the specific instances.  To have a body of law right up to date will not be possible here or in any other country, but Statute law revision Acts which are specifically aimed at making appropriate amendments will have to be undertaken frequently here and that will bring us as near as possible to what Deputy Ryan wants in terms of having the law available.  I do not know what state the finances of the legal profession are in or anything about providing a library for the legal profession.  I do not know why the taxpayers should provide such a library.  I would not discuss the merits of the case at the moment.  Last night the Deputy suggested that they have a proposal in some form before the Government that their library should be paid for by the taxpayers.  This refers to a library dealing with EEC affairs.</P>

      <P>Without having examined the proposal, I would not discuss it because I might produce arguments against it and there may be merits in it.  At the same time, I should like to suggest to the House that it is the <Col N="1234" /> lawyers' job to know what the law is. The Departments of State have produced this list of legislation to guide them so that a lawyer dealing with a case coming under particular legislation will find in this list that the legislation may have been affected by Community membership.  He will then have an opportunity of studying the regulations or Acts which could have changed the law and if he finds difficulty, especially in the earlier days, the Departments of State here will do everything in their power to assist him.</P>
      <P>It would be misleading specifically to amend some of the Acts affected. This would confuse rather than enlighten the public.  Frankly, we could not do that at this stage.  Our resources are fully employed in the matters of undertaking the obligations of Membership.  Even if it were possible from the manpower point of view, it would be misleading and certainly not desirable at all in cases where the conflict between different legislative acts are not quite clear and where there is some doubt.  The question of conflict and its extent would have to be determined by the courts. The Taoiseach indicated that we would have much greater use of Statute law revision Acts, and there will be a good deal more deadwood provisions in our legislation arising out of directly applicable Communities legislation.  These statute law revision Acts repeal only those provisions which are clearly either obsolete or impliedly repealed.  It has been my practice, as a Minister, in regard to legislation to set out what I want done, what the Government want done, and to achieve that and, at the same time, to come into the House and accept as far as is possible from the House improvements.  It has been my experience that the House has frequently improved Bills for which I have had responsibility.  I have never rejected an amendment unless it did violence to my original intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about myself.  I am only talking about an attitude.  For that reason, while we accepted amendments here the main one from Fine Gael last night would totally change the intention of the Bill. It may be that after some experience we would find it possible to undertake the obligations of membership and take advantage quickly of Community legislation, and that we would find it possible to bring more and more changes through the full legislative process beforehand but the principle we had in this Bill was to make sure that we could act quickly.  As I said, in the vast majority of cases it will be to our great benefit to act quickly.  For that reason we made provision in the Bill so that we could act quickly to have the directives and decisions of the Community apply here quickly.  One can imagine what would happen if we found that we were not keeping up, that we were not able to allow the directives to apply here and that our farmers were not able to benefit quickly?  That is only an example and, perhaps, it should not be taken but it is the most frequent example.  Common agricultural policy legislation accounts for 90 per cent of the total.  If our farmers could not quickly benefit from changes we would quickly suffer in this House for not having made provision whereby the directives of the Community could come quickly into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all-important, I allow, that this House should be able to say that a particular way of implementing a Community directive is not the best way. To cover both points&mdash;to be able to act quickly and to give the House that say &mdash;we have provided that the legislation shall come in a confirmatory way, that the regulation of the Ministers should lapse if the Dáil did not confirm it.  Any system we had up to now of dealing with ministerial motions or orders is not as effective as that.  They are laid before the House; there is a motion and a vote.  The legislative process from beginning to end&mdash;First Stage, Second Stage, Committee Stage, Report Stage&mdash; is a much more thorough, more searching procedure and this will be the procedure in the case of every regulation made.  If a regulation does not survive <Col N="1236" /> this procedure, then it lapses.  Apart from the fact, the very fact that it will be done in that way will, of course, by nature, have to influence the Minister making his regulation because no Minister and no Government would want to make a regulation implementing Community legislation which would lapse in a period of time.  It is for that reason that I felt the House was right last night in saying that the period of time which we have in the Bill, the end of the following year might be too long.</P>
    <P>If it was the end of the year, we would have 70 regulations this December and they could not be done in time to have a Bill through the Dáil the same year.  So the end of the following year was selected.  I agree that for regulations made in January, February or March of the year the end of the following year gives a two-year life to a regulation without confirmation in the Dáil and I agree that this is not desirable. For that reason we agreed last night that we would have this confirmatory legislation coming through the Dáil at least each six months.  It will be necessary for me to have that drafted in an amendment.</P>
    <P>I take everything that Deputy Ryan says in terms of the difficulties created for the legal profession as true.  We are all going to have difficulties but I do not think it is up to the Government to do the work of the legal profession. Certainly any assistance whatever from the Department which can be given to them to overcome the difficulties, which I do not deny, will be given, but the job of the lawyer will be the same.  He will have an indication of what law is likely to be changed.  His normal researchers will go through the regulations, but to make it more easy for him the Department will be there to help him.</P>

      <P>The Minister ended on the same note as that on which he started.  It is absolutely wrong.  His first statement was that there is no other profession where it is suggested that the Government should provide their instruments for them.  This is a complete misunderstanding of the position.  The fact is that this House passes the laws for the country, that Ministers make certain statutory instruments and these, so far as the Government are concerned, are the instruments with which the lawyers operate.  They have no option but to operate with these instruments. They are not, in fact, the responsibility of the Government but the responsibility of the House and the Government.  The Minister ended on the same note and the whole of his speech was an example of what he said, that in England you can say what you like so long as you end up by doing the right thing and in Ireland you can do what you like so long as you say the right thing.  The Minister was saying all the right things this morning.  He talked all the time about acting quickly.  In other words, he wants to act and then come along and say the right thing. What use to the general public is saying the right thing if the action is all wrong?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Departments of State being available to people, it is well-known that there are excellent Departments which no matter what question is put to them they will answer it quickly and there are other Departments which whatever question you put to them, they will not answer it either quickly or ever.  It is not good enough to prepare this Schedule in this way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan's amendment, which I support, accepts the Schedule, disgraceful though it is.  It gives a long list of Acts.  The very first item relates to the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, 1933-1969.  I wonder how many Members know the number of Acts involved here.  Then there are provisions regarding discrimination on the grounds of nationality and the common agricultural policy.  One would have to search through a foot thick of Acts to get at the facts.  This should have been done before it was put into the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister claims he accepts amendments which do not totally change the intention.  This amendment does not change the intention at all.  All it does is lay down a certain well-known principle.  The Minister claims he cannot be certain of this because his Department cannot be sure they have got everything in they should have got in.  This can be dealt with by an amending measure. The late Seán Lemass was the great exponent of this method of legislation. He would produce an Act and <Col N="1239" /> say that if anything was wrong with it he would amend it.  He did that afterwards.  This is a method of getting over the Minister's difficulty but he has not made any promise like that to us.  He has not promised if this thing proves inadequate that he will change the whole thing to meet the inadequacy.</P>
    <P>It is not true that this method of only keeping those orders in operation for 12 months is put into legislation for the first time.  It is in the Emergency Imposition of Duties measure for years.  A qualification Act is passed every year.  It used to be every eight months but now it is every year.  This is not an original idea because it is in the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1933.  The Minister has built his argument on sand and it disappears once one clears it.</P>

      <P>We support this amendment but we should make some distinction in our position and what appears to be a position suggested by the Fine Gael speakers, particularly Deputy Ryan.  There has been talk of the difficulties which this will present to the lawyers.  They thrive on difficulties, both intellectually and materially.  I have great respect for the legal profession but I do not think we should be too sentimental about them.</P>
      <P>One of the things we pointed out when we were working for &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the referendum was that this would be a bonanza for the lawyers and it will be.  The die has been cast.  The decision has been taken but pity for the lawyers should not be part of the emotion in our breasts at the present time.  We are told that the lawyers will need more books but they will be able to buy them.  I do not think the lawyers should ask the taxpayers of this country, many of whom will be hard hit by these arrangements, to subsidise their efforts.  Their clients will ultimately pay for the new books they will need and for the efforts they will need to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan has apparently a softer heart than I have about the lawyers.  There should be no subsidy to the lawyers.  There is a certain danger, which is implicit in the Minister's reply, that some kind of indirect subsidy may go their way.  The Minister talks about the services of Departments of State being available to lawyers.  I can see the need for that in the beginning because some lawyers will need some guidance as to where they should go to get their material but I hope we will not face the situation where the taxpayer is setting up large legal units inside Departments of State, which are, in fact, doing most of the European work for private lawyers, who are also collecting fees from their clients for work which the taxpayer is subsidising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a socialist State we might have a situation in which free legal advice was forthcoming to industry and to ordinary individuals from Departments of State.  The lawyers would be the first to object to that.  We should not have a system whereby Departments of State at the taxpayers' expense do the work and private lawyers collect the fees.  I do not believe self-respecting lawyers would expect that and I am not suggesting that has been the suggestion from the Fine Gael benches.  One of the strengths of Fine Gael is the amount of legal acumen which is represented there and which I do not intend to speak about with any disrespect at all.  In these benches we understand the trade union spirit and there is a trade union spirit in this matter too.  Most of us here do not belong to that particular trade union and we have a right to raise these issues.  The kind of aid supplied by the Departments of State should be initial guidance for a transitional period and after that the lawyers should do their work.  I agree with much of the Minister's reply on that with, however, the query about Departments of State.  I would not like to see very large legal branches <Col N="1241" /> grow up inside Departments of State because this could become parasitic on the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera should remain orderly and allow me make my speech to which he may reply if he wishes.  The Government's failure to put a Schedule into this Bill setting out what is the law forces everybody into the hands of lawyers for the purpose of ascertaining what is the law. It is in defence of the individual, in defence of the poorest of the poor who has a right to know the law without having to pay a lawyer for the information, that we put down this amendment.  Not only have I a right but I have a duty also to use any knowledge or experience I may have to the benefit of the people of the country.  I must use that knowledge or experience in this House to their advantage.  Therefore, I can speak as a practising lawyer.  I know a great deal more about the practice of the law than the Minister knows because he is not a lawyer.  He is a doctor and what he is inferring is that it would be appropriate to give to a doctor or a surgeon a tray of new drugs and instruments that he had never used before and to say to him: &ldquo;cure that sick person with those&rdquo;. That is the type of irresponsibility that is being meted out now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not asking for any subsidy for the legal profession, who will certainly grow fat on the opportunities that will be presented as a result of this Bill, but the law is supposed to be known by everybody.  It should be available to everybody and it ought to be in the Schedule to this Bill.  I have no doubt that the legal profession will do well because the research fees they will be entitled to for looking up the law will be considerable; so immense that they will be prohibitive so far as poor people are concerned.  If we had here a genuine system of free legal aid, the injustice <Col N="1242" /> would not be so great but we have not any such system and, consequently, poor people who wish to find out what is the law are not able to find it out and must go to the legal profession.</P>

I would say that we have almost no system of free legal aid because it is available in very few circumstances and under the greatest of difficulties.</P>

The function of Parliament is to state the law but that is not being done because the Government are giving a &ldquo;no&rdquo; to this amendment.

I did not desire to make any wholesale onslaught on the legal profession, nor do I think that I fell into that trap.  It would be very unjust to do so.  Neither do I believe the Minister did it.  Deputy Ryan is being a little oversensitive on this matter in respect of his particular profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has referred to the right <Col N="1243" /> of the poorest of the poor to know the law without having to pay a lawyer for the information.  That is a fine high principle and I wish it were possible but it is not.  There is no good claiming that to pay for all these goods from Europe and to put them together in a library would result in the poorest of the poor being able to walk in and find out what is the law.  Of course they could not and, in any case, it will not be the poorest of the poor who will be seeking to find out what is the law on <Col N="1244" /> these matters.  Unless we are saying that Departments of State ought to provide free legal advice to those affected&mdash;I do not know whether that is what Deputy Ryan is suggesting&mdash; the lawyers will be the people who will encounter both these difficulties and these opportunities.  That is what we are saying from here.  We support this amendment but we do not consider that it should be accompanied by cant concerning the difficulties for lawyers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £46,397,000 be granted to defray <Col N="1247" /> the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1973, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>At the outset I would like to refer to the notes which I have had circulated to Deputies.  I hope that Deputies will find the statistical and other information in them useful in their consideration of the current year's Estimate for my Department.</P>
    <P>The net Estimate of £46,397,000 for 1972-73 shown in the Estimates volume represents an increase of £6,416,000 on the corresponding figure for 1971-72, including Supplementary Estimates and the amount transferred from the Vote for Pension Increases and Allowances.  The increase is made up of extra provisions totalling £8,677,990 under 12 subheads, offset by a reduction of £20,000 in one, and higher receipts amounting to £2,241,990 under Appropriations in Aid.</P>
    <P>The increase shown under subhead A is £3,422,000, of which approximately £1,800,000 is to meet the extra cost during the current year of the pay awards, including the first phase of the 13th round, which were granted last year.  Most of the balance is to provide for additional staff, mainly for the telephone service.</P>
    <P>The following comments are offered on the other subheads which show substantial variations from last year's provisions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Under subhead B an additional £288,000 is required mainly for higher rates of travelling and subsistence allowances and increased payment to the Civil Service Commission for recruitment costs.</P>
    <P>The extra £750,000 under subhead C is required to meet higher expenditure on new sites and buildings, the cost of additional leased accommodation, extra cost arising out of the abolition of the &ldquo;half rent&rdquo; rating system for Government property and higher charges for maintenance, electricity and fuel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> Subhead D is up by £188,000 because of increases in charges for the conveyance of mails.</P>
    <P>Under subhead E an extra £508,000 is required for additional and replacement vehicles for the postal motor fleet, payment of computer rental and increased costs of postal and general stores.</P>
    <P>Under subhead F £1,706,000 more is required to cover the cost of engineering stores and equipment and contract works, arising from expansion of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>Subhead G, which provides for telephone capital repayments, is one which automatically grows from year to year with the continuous investment of capital in the telephone service. The extra amount required in the current year is £1,420,000.</P>
    <P>Under subhead J £109,000 more is needed, mainly to meet the cost of higher pensions and gratuities following increases in rates of pay.</P>
    <P>The extra £258,000 provided under subhead L.1. reflects the estimated receipts for a full year from the higher television licence fee which came into operation as from 1st September, 1971.</P>
    <P>On the receipts side, the increase of £2,241,990 shown under subhead T arises mainly because an extra £2,620,000 making £13,730,000 in all, is being provided this year for telephone development.  Perhaps I should explain that expenditure on telephone development is first charged to the ordinary subheads&mdash;principally subheads F and A and to a lesser extent subheads C and B.  The cost is subsequently recouped from telephone capital funds and brought in as an Appropriation in Aid.</P>
    <P>There has been no striking change in the pattern of development of the postal and telecommunications services. Postal traffic in general remained in 1971 on a par with that of the previous year; the telephone service continued its rapid growth; the number of telegrams handled fell away; and the telex service continued to surge ahead, to the advantage of the community and of the Post Office revenues.</P>
    <P>As regards the quality of service given, I think that on the whole there is general satisfaction with the postal <Col N="1249" /> service although some complaints are inevitable, and well-founded complaints are always welcomed as an opportunity to put things right which have gone wrong.</P>
    <P>The telex service is being given very special attention.  To ensure that its progress will continue unimpeded arrangements have been made to double the capacity of the system in the next two years.</P>
    <P>Demand for telephones during 1971-72 was 13 per cent higher than in the previous year and has since accelerated. There were 21,000 connections made in the year but the waiting list grew by 7,000 to 22,500.  The fact that there are corresponding waiting lists in virtually every country in the world is, I know, small consolation to those people waiting patiently or impatiently for service.</P>
    <P>Much has been done to improve the quality of the telephone service and to meet the constantly growing demand, but I am fully conscious of the fact that what has been done is not enough. In my Estimate speech last year I mentioned that it had been necessary in the previous year to curtail the programme of works owing to shortage of capital funds.</P>
    <P>It is clearly essential that even greater efforts be made to meet public demand for telephones and to see to it that those who have telephones get first class service.  I am glad to say that in 1971-72 the Government agreed to increase the original allocation of capital for telephone development from £9.48 million to £11.11 million, and for 1972-73 the allocation of £13.73 million has been approved.  Forward commitments for major works contracts &mdash;mostly exchanges, trunk and other equipment&mdash;amounted to over £11 million at 31st March last.</P>
    <P>Lack of spare capacity and, indeed, overloading of exchange and trunk plant have been the cause of difficulties experienced by subscribers and callers during the year.  In many exchange areas delays in taking on new subscribers are due to the same cause. Particulars of what has been done by way of providing extra trunk circuits and of the major trunk schemes in progress or contracted for are given in <Col N="1250" /> the notes circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>A provisional five-year contract for the supply of exchange equipment has been entered into with L. M. Ericsson of Stockholm who for some years past have been successful in getting most of such orders in competitions open to all manufacturers.  This contract will enable manufacture of equipment to be planned by the company well in advance and delivery and installation to be effected more speedily.</P>
    <P>We have long felt that with the big investment being made by the State in telecommunications it would be very desirable to have more exchange equipment manufactured here if the manufacture could be the base for development of an export industry.  The home market alone is not big enough to support such an industry on competitive terms even if given all Post Office orders.  The IDA in consultation with my Department, invited all the principal suppliers of such equipment to submit proposals for establishment of an industry, with the attraction of a guarantee of orders for portion of the Post Office requirements over a period. In the event, the offer made by L. M. Ericsson was the most attractive and the IDA is engaged in negotiations for the establishment of the factory.  Details have not been finally settled as yet.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the factory, apart from the employment it would give, would bring the advantage of a source of supply and manufacturing expertise to the country.  I should stress that the contract with L. M. Ericsson will not be exclusive&mdash;part of the Department's requirements of exchange equipment will continue to be bought by open competition.  I shall return later to the general question of telephone development problems.</P>
    <P>Data for computers can be transmitted over the public telephone and telex networks or by means of leased telephone and telegraph circuits.  This service, although relatively small at present, has a considerable potential for growth.  Developments in the data transmission field generally are being kept under close review.  I mentioned in my speech on last year's Estimate that my Department had joined with other European telecommunications <Col N="1251" /> administrations in a special study of future prospects in this field.  The study is in progress and a report is expected early in 1973.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in the provision of new post office buildings and in the extension and improvement of existing buildings. New telephone buildings or extensions were completed at many centres including, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dundalk, Limerick, Longford and in Dublin at Dundrum, Nutley Park, Phibsboro and Rathcoole.  Improvements in manual telephone exchanges or postal accommodation were carried out at Ceanannus Mór, Cork, Lifford and Newcastle West.</P>
    <P>Works in progress or contracted for include a new post office at Nenagh, improvements to the public offices at Bandon, Dundalk and Roscommon post offices, a new auto-manual exchange and engineering headquarters at Castlebar, and new telephone buildings or extensions at Monaghan, Roscommon and 21 other provincial centres; and in Dublin the reconstruction of Phibsboro Post Office, a new district sorting office at Glenageary, an extension to Harmonstown district office, a computer centre at Dundrum and new telephone buildings or extensions at Crown Alley, Dame Court, Harmonstown, Malahide, Merrion Exchange, Shelbourne Road and Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The savings services had a successful year.  Details regarding new investments, repayments and totals remaining invested for the savings media with which my Department is directly concerned are contained in the notes circulated to Deputies.  The notes also give particulars of the growth of Trustee Savings Bank business.  I should like to express my special appreciation of the excellent work being done by the National Savings Committee in the cultivation of the savings habit.</P>
    <P>The value of money orders issued in 1971 was £55.7 million as compared with £86.2 million the previous year. The value of postal orders issued in 1971 was £12.7 million compared with £14.2 million in 1970.  The figures for both money order and postal order business in 1970 were, of course, abnormally <Col N="1252" /> high because of the banks dispute. Agency service payments made by the Post Office, mainly on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare, increased from £81.5 million in 1970 to £92.7 million in 1971.  Post offices took part as usual in the sales of prize bonds, handling about 29 per cent of the total collected in 1971.</P>
    <P>The Department as the employer of a staff of about 22,000 men and women is naturally concerned with the efficiency and welfare of these employees. With so big a staff in a great number of grades, problems will inevitably crop up from time to time.  I am happy to say, however, that in the period under review it has been possible to solve almost all the problems that arose by reasonable negotiation. For the settlement of such difficulties there must be a high degree of trust between both sides and a willingness to see the other side's point of view.</P>
    <P>These do not grow up overnight. They require careful cultivation and both the staff organisations and management have been working together for many years to create a climate of good relations by bringing regulations into line with current needs, by improving channels of management-staff communications&mdash;and by involving staff to a greater extent in the conduct of affairs.  Good staff management relations benefit both the staff and the public Staff co-operation is, of course essential for the improvement of efficiency to offset in part the effect of increases in pay and other costs.</P>
    <P>The 13th round pay settlement for the Civil Service generally will cost the Department about £3.1 million in the current year and £4.7 million next year.  In addition, as I said in the debate on last year's Estimate, claims for pay increases on an individual grade basis were being negotiated on behalf of the staff.  The cost of settling these grade claims will add close on £2 million a year to the Department's wages bill.  The increases granted are in harmony with the provisions of the National Employer-Labour Pay Agreement.  Improvements in other conditions which have been secured by the staff will also add to the Department's costs.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that, as a result <Col N="1253" /> of an agreement last year on a staff claim at the General Council under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration, a substantial improvement was made in the retirement gratuities for part-time staff and a pension scheme for full-time unestablished staff was introduced.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the introduction of computer working in the Department are well advanced.  Delivery of the Department's own computer is expected next year, and in the meantime it is expected that much of the Savings Bank work will be processed by other computers.  All telephone trunk statements are already being processed by a computer bureau.  The pace at which the Department will be able to computerise its major clerical operations will depend largely on the availability of the necessary specialist staff.  This staff is being built up and trained as quickly as possible.  It is hoped that over the next few years most of the major blocks of clerical work in the Department will be converted to computer operation, and that, in addition, the use of computer techniques will assist in the flow of management information.</P>
    <P>My Department has felt for some considerable time that it would be advantageous to have the Department's accounting system examined by experts from outside the Civil Service. An incidental benefit which it is hoped would flow from such an examination would be the provision of earlier and more comprehensive management information.  A firm of consultants has now been commissioned to do this work.  They began their assignment early in September and it is hoped that they will have completed their examination by next summer.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Department publishes commercial accounts which present its position as a trading concern.  It is largely on the basis of these accounts that financial policy, including the fixing of charges, has been determined. The accounts for 1970-71, preparation of which was heavily delayed in the aftermath of the banks strike, were recently laid before the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> Appendix C of the Estimates volume provides a summary of the commercial account results for the four years 1966-67 to 1969-70 and provisional figures for 1970-71.  It will be seen that there was an overall surplus of £513,000 in 1969-70.  The accounts for 1970-71 show an overall deficit of £1,707,000 approximately, made up of deficits of £1,608,000 on the postal service and £261,000 on the telegraph service partly offset by a surplus of £162,000 on the telephone service.</P>
    <P>The overall deficit of £1,707,000 in 1970-71 is somewhat higher than was expected when we were discussing last year's Estimate in November. On the other hand the deficit for 1971-72 is not now expected to be as high as appeared likely at that time.  Present indications are that the outturn for 1971-72 was an overall deficit of about £1½ million.  Costs will rise substantially in 1972-73, mainly because of pay increases which have already been authorised or which will become due under the second phase of the 13th round.  Expenditure in 1973-74 will rise further as a result of the first phase of the 14th round pay increase which comes into effect on 1st June, 1973.  The financial position is being kept under review and if changes in rates of charges become unavoidable ample advance notice will be given.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some general observations about the postal and telecommunications services.  These two services present quite different problems.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, the quality of the postal service is generally regarded as satisfactory.  It is certainly superior to that of most countries in Europe and indeed in the world.  But inflation is constantly forcing up costs in money terms while the redistribution of population causes additional expenditure in new areas without enabling economies to be effected elsewhere.  In 1970-71, the latest year for which audited figures are available, staff and associated charges were responsible for 77 per cent of expenditure.  The costs are only marginally affected by the volume of <Col N="1255" /> mails.  Dublin is the only centre with sufficient mail volume to permit of any significant use of mechanical aids and even there economies to be secured are marginal.</P>
    <P>The notes circulated to Deputies show clearly how costs are rising and the unfavourable effect on the financial position.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to enter into the subject in any detail at this stage.  The Departmental Committee which I set up in September, 1970, to consider the structure, operation and finances of the postal services, including counter services, are expected to report early in the New Year.  I may mention that through our membership of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administration (CEPT) the committee have available to them the result of similar studies carried out in many other postal administrations all of which are confronted with many similar problems.</P>
    <P>The telephone service has quite different difficulties.  The greatest of these is shortage of capital and failure to earmark sufficient capital for telephone purposes for the necessary number of years ahead.  For an efficient telephone organisation, which should be able to give satisfactory service to all its customers, and to provide telephones for all newcomers who want them, it is an absolutely indispensable requirement that works be planned five to ten years ahead so that sites may be got, buildings erected, exchange equipment manufactured and installed and cables provided well in advance of demand. To do this there must be assurance that adequate capital will be available and that the capital needed will not be withheld when some Exchequer financial problems crop up.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that these vital conditions have never been met for the telephone service, although everyone recognises it as fundamentally necessary for the commercial and social life of the country.  My Department have had the experience repeatedly of being pulled up short in their construction programme because of lack of funds and having to devote engineering resources to make-shift and uneconomic <Col N="1256" /> expedients which multiply difficulties for the future.  It follows that on each occasion when money is again stated to be available a fresh start has to be made and works replanned, and we have to take a place further back in the queue for delivery of equipment from manufacturers.  All this would be bad enough if Ireland were highly developed telephonically but we are only at the early stages of the telephone intensity which public demand will require.</P>
    <P>The surge in demand for telephones in recent years has taken even intensively developed telephone administrations by surprise and caused waiting lists for new telephones and congestion of calls for existing subscribers in every country.  The rapid acceleration of demand in Ireland did not take us by surprise but the Department simply had not the resources to deal with it adequately.  It is no pleasure to me or to the staff of my Department to be placed in this situation and we are doing everything possible to have it remedied, but the effects of past restrictions, unfortunately, will continue to be felt for some years yet even if all the capital needed is guaranteed for a long term of years, as I have some reason to hope may be possible as a result of our joining the EEC.</P>
    <P>Financial problems are not, of course, the only ones.  There are serious staffing problems also in this highly technical service but I am convinced that these can be overcome. Moreover, I am aiming at securing a substantial continuing gain in productivity by use of new improved methods and equipment which will help to reduce costs.  Technical developments in telecommunications are coming fast and continuously, and I am more than hopeful that they will be sufficient to offset the financial effects of inflation in this less labour-intensive service.  Happily, we have been assured by staff organisations of their full co-operation in improving efficiency.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the financial side of the telephone service.  Few people realise that the final figures of profit and loss on Post Office services are determined after charging not only full depreciation on a replacement <Col N="1257" /> basis but also interest on the entire net capital invested in buildings, plant and equipment.  The entire capital is treated as loan capital.  If the Department were to present figures on the basis of &ldquo;operating&rdquo; or &ldquo;trading profits&rdquo; arrived at before charging interest a very different picture would be shown.</P>
    <P>For example, in 1969-70, the amount charged for interest on telephone capital was £3,491,000.  Taking this into account it could be claimed that there was a surplus, not of £893,000 as shown but of £4,384,000. Similarly for 1970-71, in respect of which I have mentioned a surplus of £162,000, the position is that before payment of interest on capital there was a profit of £4,052,000 and we estimate that in 1971-72 a corresponding calculation would show a profit of about £4 million instead of a deficit of about £½ million.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for consideration whether the Department should remain such an outstanding exception to the general accounting practices of the business world and whether there is not good reason to present the results of their operations in a more realistic fashion.  Such a change would bring out the favourable return on capital invested in the service.</P>
    <P>Departing from the telephone service, I wish to mention that another matter which is receiving my consideration is whether we should continue to lump in totally uneconomic services provided for social reasons with normal commercial services.  For example, the telegraph service has been a financial burden on the Post Office continuously since 1922-23, and indeed for long before.  Any ordinary business organisation would long since have dispensed with such an uneconomic service, provided solely for the benefit of the community and not for commercial reasons.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there are extensive sections of the postal service in rural areas which are hopelessly uneconomic, and should be modified substantially if commercial considerations were to prevail.  Many totally uneconomic telephone lines also are provided at heavy cost.  I do not <Col N="1258" /> suggest that the Department should discontinue any of these services but I must consider, and am doing so, whether services needed more for social than economic reasons should be financed by the taxpayer rather than carried by the Department at the expense of economic services.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of our present accounting in regard to which we might well be accused of being over-conservative.  For example, all the agency services for other Government Departments are provided by my Department at cost, with no addition for profit, although such an addition could well be justified.</P>
    <P>Also we are continuing to make financial provision for depreciation of buildings although many business firms, having regard to the inflationary rise in building costs regard such depreciation as unnecessary.</P>
    <P>One could reasonably argue, too, in respect of services provided by the Department at a loss for social reasons, that the capital employed should be written off, as it has been on a generous scale for other less economic organisations.</P>
    <P>Still in the accounting field, I have mentioned that the Department's whole capital is loan capital.  This clearly is an artificial situation which would not be permitted to exist in any efficient privately-owned business. We must keep in mind, especially in connection with the development of the capital-intensive telephone service &mdash;essential as it is to the community and profitable to the Department&mdash; the possibility of securing an injection of equity capital and eventually arriving at a reasonable balance between loan and equity capital.</P>
    <P>I have adverted to these subjects as some of the matters engaging my attention where I feel there may be justification for radical changes.  But my present intention is not to reach firm conclusions about radical accounting changes before receiving and considering the report of the committee examining the postal service and the report of the consultants who, I have stated, have been engaged to examine the Department's whole accounting procedures.</P>
    <P>As in previous years my remarks on <Col N="1259" /> broadcasting will be confined to the more important aspects and to matters in which, as Minister, I have a statutory function.</P>
    <P>Statutory authority for paying RTE grants equivalent to the net receipts from licence fees expired on 31st March, 1972, but pending the passing of fresh legislation the grant for the current year has been calculated in the normal manner.  Accordingly, provision is made in this Estimate for a grant of £3,463,000 to RTE in respect of licence fees.  Provision is also made for a grant of £180,000 in respect of capital expenditure by the authority on Radio na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>RTE's annual report for 1971-72 will be available in a few weeks and I understand that the accounts will show a very modest surplus of about £9,000.</P>
    <P>The Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1972, which was passed before Easter is aimed at reducing to a minimum the evasion of payment of licence fees on television sets.  Plans to implement the new Act are going ahead but progress has not been as fast as I had hoped. My Department have had consultations with representatives of the dealers' organisations about details of the arrangements for furnishing information regarding transactions in television sets and some further consultations will be necessary before decisions are taken on the various points.  In the meantime my Department have arranged for the holding of a special campaign, which started on 30th October, to detect television set holders who have failed to take out licences.</P>
    <P>RTE's capital expenditure on new works during 1971-72 was about £1.75 million.  This includes £711,000 on wired television development, which is being financed through banks, and £295,000 on Radio na Gaeltachta, which is being financed by means of special Exchequer grants.  Approximately £748,000 was spent on general broadcasting works, mainly the new radio building and equipment at Donnybrook.  During 1971-72 a repayable advance of £600,000 for capital purposes was made to RTE from the Exchequer in respect of general broadcasting works.  Apart from a small capital advance for the Ballymun <Col N="1260" /> multi-channel communal aerial system, this was the first Exchequer advance made to the authority since 1963-64.</P>
    <P>RTE's capital programme for 1972-73 provides for a provisional expenditure of £700,000 on general broadcasting works, £180,000 on Radio na Gaeltachta and £200,000 on wired television development.  A repayable advance of up to £500,000 under section 23 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, has been authorised this year for certain general broadcasting works.  The total amount which may be advanced to RTE under section 23 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, as amended by the Act of 1964, is £3 million.  If the full advance of £500,000 authorised for 1972-73 is taken up £2.951 million will have been made available by 31st March next.</P>
    <P>The opening of Radio na Gaeltachta, which commenced broadcasting on Easter Sunday, 2nd April, 1972, is a significant development in the broadcasting history of the State.  At present the service is broadcasting for about two hours per day.  RTE intend to consider extending the number of hours of broadcasting at the end of this year when all studios are fully operational.  At present the service is available in the western Gaeltacht areas on both VHF and medium-wave. Reception on VHF is available west of a line roughly from Derry to Cork and it is expected that VHF reception will be extended to the rest of the country next spring.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Review Committee, which I set up in June, 1971, to review the progress of the television and sound broadcasting services and to make recommendations regarding these services, are pursuing their studies but I am not yet able to say when their report will be available.</P>
    <P>Finally, I gladly take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation to all the staff of the Department for their services in the period since the Estimate of my Department was last debated.  The Department and the public are fortunate in the staff at their service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> The first thing I would like to say about the remarks which we have just heard from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is that I detect for the first time in listening to many Estimate speeches a note of restrained exasperation running through the document, not merely in relation to the telephone services but also in regard to accounting procedures and the need for a fresh look at affairs.</P>
    <P>I will agree with the Minister in relation to what I suggest is his feeling of exasperation.  Successive Ministers of Posts and Telegraphs have said that the Department publish commercial accounts which present their position as a trading concern and that they consist of income and expenditure accounts and a balance sheet compiled in accordance with commercial practices.  It is often said that these are used to determine financial policy.  In the introductory note on the commercial account I notice, taking the last one which I have here, which is for 1969-70, that the point is made that the Oireachtas control both in total and in some detail the money spent by Government Departments, but the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in this instance obtain authority from the Oireachtas for their expenditure other than on capital works financed by borrowings from the Exchequer under the Telephone Capital Acts 1924 to 1960, by way of an annual Estimate, and account for it in the appropriation account, and that cash revenue is paid into the Exchequer and is accounted for in the finance accounts.</P>
    <P>This is stated quite regularly but the Comptroller and Auditor General does not seem to be quite satisfied or has not been quite satisfied for a number of years if one is to judge by his comments which I have noticed down the years 1958 to 1970.  On page 18 of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs commercial accounts 1969-70 the Comptroller and Auditor General said that the accounting system of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is on a receipts and payments basis which is designed primarily to serve the purposes of parliamentary control of expenditure. He said that this system does not facilitate <Col N="1262" /> the production of an income and expenditure account and balance sheets.  The Comptroller and Auditor General also said that some progress has been made to bring the post office commercial accounts into line with the best commercial standards.  He said that he had been urging on the Department the need for introducing accounting procedures and records designed to facilitate the production of improved commercial accounts. He was informed that the Department proposed to employ consultants to review and advise on the accounting system in general.  The date of the remarks of the Comptroller and Auditor General was 15th June, 1971.</P>
    <P>We are glad to know from the Minister's speech that these consultants have been brought in.  It would be fair to say, as is said in Irish &ldquo;má's maith is mithid&rdquo;.  It has been delayed for quite a number of years. This goes back to the sixties.  The Minister referred to the necessity for another look at the accountancy procedures. I agree with him.  I have found it almost impossible, from the commercial accounts to determine the financial status of individual sections of the Department.  For example, how can one break down the fixed assets of such separate services as the postal, telegraph and telephone services?  I notice that the Minister says that land has been depreciated over the years and that this should not be on account of the generally accepted appreciation of property values.  This is rather important.  If we want to assess the position of the post office and what return they are making in their capital we can only do so on a basis of a revaluation of their assets, particularly their fixed assets.  Unless this is done and done quickly, and I hope the consultants will do this, the basis on which we can judge performances is inadequate.</P>
    <P>I have found it disturbing, in looking over the accounts for the various years&mdash;the Book of Estimates refers to the surplus or deficit over a four or five year period&mdash;that this revaluation that I speak of has not been done.  I would urge on the Minister to speed up the process of the consultants and, if possible, get <Col N="1263" /> it in as a matter of urgent priority. I suspect that he is working on these lines but I would urge all possible speed in the production of these accounts.</P>
    <P>That is not the only problem I have detected in looking at the commercial accounts.  I note, too, that the Comptroller and Auditor General has been, for a number of years, unhappy about the reserve for depreciation.  At page 18 of the most recent commercial accounts which I have to hand he says:</P>
    <P>In my recent reports I also referred to the investigations being carried out into the adequacy of the provision for telephone plant depreciation. I understand that these investigations have now been completed but that the revision of the basis of calculation of depreciation has been deferred with the agreement of the Minister for Finance. Supplementary provision, £650,000 in the year under review, has been made in the accounts of the past few years in view of the probable effects of rising costs on replacement.</P>
    <P>Again, referring to the consultants, he says:</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the consultants will be of assistance in the matter of arriving at a more satisfactory basis for assessing telephone depreciation.</P>
    <P>There is the other point which may be noticed from a look through these accounts that up to the early 1960s the actuarial basis on which pension liability was assessed was based on figures worked out in 1916.  It was, to some extent, a satisfaction then to notice that in this particular field his reports down the years have met with some success because on the same page he says:</P>
    <P>In my reports on the accounts in recent years I referred to the investigations being carried out with regard to the adequacy of the provision for pension liability.  A definite basis for calculating this liability has now been introduced based essentially on an actuarial investigation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> I think the Minister will agree&mdash;I hasten to add that this whole matter arose before his tenure of office&mdash; that to have continued into the 1960s basing the pension provision on an actuarial basis of some 50 years earlier was quite unworthy of a Department of State.  Particularly when the matter has been drawn continuously to the attention of this House, I find it strange that improvements were not made a little earlier.  Having said that, I should like to welcome the notice which we have been given now that these consultants have come in and are going to subject the Post Office to what I hope will be a very searching economic and accountancy analysis from which we would hope to get the basis on which to continue and improve the service.</P>
    <P>Based on this new analysis then I would suggest the Minister will be in a position to search for what I would term a standard of efficiency.  I think this is very important in regard to all the services.  Without this vital information, this management information, how can one assess the efficiency of, say, the postal service, the telex service, the data transmission service or any other service within the aegis of the Department?  A lot of the problems about efficiency in the Department can be put down to the lack of these vital pieces of information. Without such information, talking about a return on capital, even in the amended form that the Minister used, of £4 million odd, is meaningless as a diagnostic tool in remedying the ills of individual sections and is useless as a piece of information.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the vexed question of the telephone service. Looking through the ministerial speeches of the last few years I have noticed what I would call a remarkable candour running through the speeches&mdash; almost a cry from the heart &mdash;that the fault lies not with the Minister or his Department but elsewhere. This is refreshing, if it is true. If the problems of the telephone service can be laid at the feet of some other Minister or some other Department or aspect of Government then we should know it, because we owe it <Col N="1265" /> to the morale of those working in the various aspects of this service that they should not be unfairly blamed for what is not their fault.  I take it that the Minister would agree with this.</P>
    <P>For example, in recent speeches I have noticed it was said that it had been necessary in a previous year to curtail the programme of works owing to shortage of capital funds. Shortage of capital funds is not a new phenomenon in any country.  It happens from time to time&mdash;stop/go &mdash;but why is it that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be the service which is put at the tail end of the queue?  It has often seemed to me that this Department has been wrongly regarded by people who should know better as a cinderella Department.  If one turns to the recently-issued Devlin Report, about which we have heard so much, establishing a basis of importance, I would take it, based on salary structure, it says at paragraph 272, page 96 of the Report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector:</P>
    <P>Between the Secretary of the Department of Finance and the ordinary Secretary, we are satisfied that there is a need for another level for a number of Secretaries having regard to their responsibilities and the nature and complexity of their tasks.  Having carefully examined the functions of each Secretary we have concluded that the following should be placed on this intermediate rate.</P>
    <P>The three chosen are the Secretaries of Agriculture, Posts and Telegraphs and the Revenue Commissioners.  If the Secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has duties which merited the attention of the Devlin Committee, that speaks for itself in relation to the importance and public standing of this Department.  I would say that not everybody in this present House is blameless in this regard.  We need only refer to the fact that when politicians meet on various occasions the Posts and Telegraphs section of matters is pushed to the tail end as if it were the least important of all.  I think a vital aspect of anything is the <Col N="1266" /> morale of a Department of State.  We should try to remedy anything which may be regarded as militating against such morale.  I think the unnecessarily devalued public image of the Department is one such.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last year, in regard to the telephone service, that they were now paying, and would be paying for a considerable time in the future, for the curtailment of the capital funds necessary which resulted in fewer additional people being taken on for training and in the deferment of the placing of contracts.  It was pointed out to Deputies that, as they well knew, it took years to secure the delivery and installation of items such as exchange equipment on which the quality of service and the ability to service new subscribers was based. Various Ministers have said from time to time it is impossible to provide an efficient telephone service unless plans for approximately five years ahead are made.  This was instanced in a previous year when the then Minister, Deputy Childers, in introducing a Telephone Capital Bill referred to his predecessor in 1963.  I am drawing attention to this because I think an error of judgement may have been made at this point in time.  He said:</P>
    <P>When my predecessor was introducing the last Telephone Capital Bill in 1963 he emphasised that the main effort would be concentrated on improving the quality of the service to existing users at the expense of delaying connections of new telephones and running up the waiting list.  This policy was followed but from 1965-66 on when the trunk capacity of the system had been greatly enlarged it was possible to devote more engineering effort to providing service for new applicants and the waiting list was substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>We could, perhaps, trace the present difficulties of the telephone service to that decision in 1963 when the Telephone Capital Bill was introduced to the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Childers, when speaking on the 27th February, 1969, in volume 238, column 1861 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> At present we are entering on a period which I am convinced will be one of great opportunity as well as of challenge for development of the telephone service, to the immense benefit of the whole community. A first-class telephone service is today essential to industrial and commercial progress because efficiency and competitiveness depend more and more on reliable and rapid communications.  The telephone is at the nerve-centre of the nation's economic life.  Socially also, its value is high contributing so much as it does to the improvement to the general standard of living.</P>
    <P>He made further points about the comparatively early stage of the telephone development in this country. The year 1969 was the beginning of a five-year period which lasts to 1974. It brings into focus the question whether the projections of 1969 were soundly based.  If they were not, then the Department's officials at the time must bear some of the blame.  I qualify that by saying that they may reply that stop-go policies in relation to capital advancement may have been the cause.  I think the Minister's speech refers to the same thing.</P>
    <P>We could, therefore, legitimately lay the charge that successive Governments&mdash;in this instance regrettably Fianna Fáil Governments&mdash;have been lax in the provision of the necessary capital and in not planning ahead in a proper fashion.  The situation of the telephone service, as has been pointed out in the House before, illustrates a crazy economic point that you have a service which is in great demand yet you penalise people by asking them to pay a rental fee which acts as a depressant to that demand. The Minister may not agree with my point but administrations in other countries are in the position where they can almost say: &ldquo;Please take a telephone.  We will give it to you.&rdquo; If my point that the rental fee is a hindrance is not fairly taken I would like to know why.  The aviation service is not in a position where <Col N="1268" /> it asks people to pay money in advance in order to avail of its services so why should this be the case in regard to our telephone service.  This is also the case in regard to the telex service, to which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>In case this be taken as merely political opposition in the House, I would like to point out to the Minister that this matter of an inadequate telephone service is causing disturbance and disquiet to many sections of the community, not only to the ordinary subscribers who are waiting for telephones but particularly to the business community. I have before me a copy of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Saturday, 21st October, 1972, in which there is the heading: &ldquo;Company Slams `Awful' Phone Service&rdquo;.  The gentleman in question was a British businessman who is setting up in this country.  He said he was appalled at the long delay in having telephones connected, the poor service on the company's only existing line and the preconditions laid down before a telex machine could be installed.  He criticised the difficulties in making trunk calls which he said sometimes needed to be attempted six or seven times before an attempt succeeded. He also said that in all his experience in Britain and in Europe he had never come across a more frustrating time in this respect.</P>
    <P>We must allow for exaggeration which a man in that position could be guilty of but I still think there is a good deal of substance in his complaint that the business community are exasperated with the telephone service.  The position is bad enough there but it is even worse when you consider that in 1972 the Department are still operating, although I hope a small advance is being made, with the old Strowger telephone equipment, the electro-mechanical equipment of joining up with the exchange.  This Strowger equipment has been there with very minor modifications for something like 50 years.</P>
    <P>The name of the system goes back to a Chicago undertaker who ran into difficulties.  He found that a telephone operator was diverting his business calls to a competitor and, necessity being the mother of invention, he decided to try to set up his own automatic exchange <Col N="1269" /> system.  He succeeded, but only in terms of the earlier part of this century.  I would like to know what percentage of the plant in use by the Post Office is this Strowger equipment.  This is a serious point.  I am glad the Minister agrees.  Much of the difficulty which subscribers experience in telephoning is due to the fact that these electro-mechanical systems have certain drawbacks. One of these is that since there are so many different moving elements in this particular system there are many opportunities for breakdowns.  This is in contradistinction to more recent developments where the number of moving parts is fewer.</P>
    <P>If one refers for a moment to the latest edition of <i>The Postal Worker</i>, the organ of the Post Office Workers' Union, one finds that they, too, are experiencing this particular difficulty and are talking of more up-to-date methods that are in use in other countries such as Canada.  I shall refer to these later.</P>
    <P>Anybody who lifts the telephone and is lucky enough to have a reasonably good service will find a delay of some seconds before getting a connection. This appreciable delay occurs because the call must be routed along a number of mechanical parts.  I wonder to what extent the Department have been aware of newer developments, at what point in time they became so aware and what they have decided to do about getting the more up-to-date system.  I would be the most pleased member of the Opposition if I were told that a substantial part of the plant and equipment of the Post Office is not the old Strowger system but something more up-to-date.  I would concede the point gladly to the Minister if he can tell me in his reply that that is the position.</P>
    <P>It is important, too, from another point of view.  Now that we have joined the EEC one of the vital preconditions of our success in the Community will be our ability to effect and conduct business readily and easily with the other member countries. The reason I speak of the electro-mechanical equipment as distinct from the electronic system is <Col N="1270" /> that if we are using circuits that are connected with European mainland countries anything that will obviate mechanical delays will be very precious in terms of time and, consequently, of money.  Let us take a way-out example.  If, at the moment a subscriber in Switzerland wishes to get in touch with an office in San Francisco, it would probably be necessary for him to rotate a dial covering, perhaps, 16 different numbers so as to put the call through the various exchanges concerned.  One can imagine the amount of time that would take in an ordinary business transaction and while the operation takes place expensive telecommunications equipment is being held up on trans-Atlantic and trans-continental routes.</P>
    <P>I understand that is not the case and that with the new electronic systems that are coming into use quickly, especially the SPI Programme, one can press buttons on a type of telephone which does not effect any connection until the entire number is dialled and then in one-twentieth of a second, because of the latest developments, one can put a call through vast distances to the required number.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me that, if we are to be able effectively to compete in Europe, the sooner we try to bring about changes the better, because we must put our business communities into a position where they will not be at any disadvantage in relation to geographical location with their competitors on the Continent. The analogous field of air transport and so on comes to mind immediately. Perhaps it was this line of thinking which resulted in the Devlin Committee suggesting a Department of Transport and Communications.</P>
    <P>In the latest issue of <i>The Postal Worker</i> one of the authors refers to the particular type of electronic equipment to which I have adverted. He speaks of the Canadian development in the SPI system and says that this is a Canadian response to the computer age demand for advanced technology, for new and specialised forms of communication.  He says that <Col N="1271" /> the system combines compactness, speed and economy with other capabilities required for computer communication.</P>
    <P>If Canada, with large continental requirements of distances to be covered, can, in the Quebec region at least, instal an efficient electronic system, I would like the Minister to tell me why we, with a small geographical distance to cover, cannot avail of the same type of equipment.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter, referred to in the notes for Deputies, is the micro-wave development. Shortly after being appointed to the position I hold in this party I had the opportunity of visiting the British Post Office Tower and I saw there the very up-to-date methods under which the British telephone system is operating.  I am glad to know that we have also got some of this new equipment, but is it only because we had to slot in effectively with the British system?  I am referring to the link which joins Dublin, Dundalk and Belfast with Carlisle and the rest of the British network.  If the motivation for our new development in this field was caused by developments overseas, we welcome that.  I would hope we would be in the vanguard of these developments ourselves and I welcome the indications given in the notes that we are getting ahead with the installation of high speed and efficient methods of communication.</P>
    <P>If I might refer briefly to the micro-wave system, it is based on a series of repeater stations placed, say, 25 to 30 mile intervals apart, and they beam the channels from one to another. There are facilities there, as the Minister for Health, Deputy Childers, said in a speech some years back, for carrying 960 telephone channels or even greater numbers now from Dublin, for example, right through to the British network and from there to the European network.  This development is desirable from a number of points of view, but from the environmental standpoint, one does not wish to see a proliferation of cables right round the country.  First of all, they <Col N="1272" /> are expensive, and secondly, they are not the thing nowadays, anyhow. These micro-wave systems not alone can carry telephone circuits but also television circuits.  In these various ways we can slot ourselves in effectively into the communications network of Europe.</P>
    <P>The reason why we should take a firm look at this development of micro-wave systems is, as I have said, that although the initial cost may be pretty high, further developments are more economical.  When one hears stories as I have heard in the last while, of post office engineers popping down manholes in different parts of the country trying to squeeze in extra lines where it is already overcrowded with lines, one can see that developments do not lie in that direction.</P>
    <P>The main point I wanted to come to is that as we move into the future there is a great necessity for an efficient planning section in the Minister's Department.  One of the problems about being in Opposition is that one does not get to know too clearly what is going on.  I can only speak from what I think should be the situation. If the Minister can assure me that all these things are being looked after, I shall be very pleased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Deputy might not even have the Estimate referred back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall see about that.  If our communications system is to meet the requirements of the future, apart from the question of capital injection, there is the vitally important aspect of proper planning.  As I understand the situation, it takes any number of years up to five to plan ahead for a proper and efficient network and these plans are subject to modification from year to year and, in fact, from month to month.  I should like to know if studies have been made of the likely requirements for trunk circuits over a five-year period.  First of all, have we got a planning section and, if we have, what liaison is there between it and the other important sections of our governmental apparatus, such as regional planning, industrial development and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I should like to <Col N="1273" /> know what criteria are used in determining whether one particular type of system is going to be installed rather than another.  What, for example, determines the engineering decision to connect two locations by coaxial cable rather than micro-wave link or ordinary overhead wires, as the case may be?  Recent studies have shown that the cost of the provision of a network drops appreciably as one goes in for the higher forms of technology in this connection.</P>
    <P>There is another subhead, F, under which there is a total of £10,490,000 for stores and equipment and on which there is a little note about satellite and other international telecommunications. In looking through the commercial accounts, I find that roughly the following amounts were used for similar purposes since 1965; £50,000, £92,000, £124,000, £188,000, £483,000, and £533,000, which is the latest figure I have.  I welcome the expenditure of these sums because this country must think big if it is to remain in the forefront of economic and industrial advance.  It is an amazing thing, though, that while on the one hand, we are spending reasonably large sums of money on the provision of these latest types of communication, our domestic services still remain the problem.  In fairness, it is not a problem only here; it is a problem in many European countries.  It is quite easy to say that we are the people who are most backward. We are relatively backward but we are not the only people; I do not see that France, for example, is a country of which the Minister for Communications could be extremely proud. There are, of course, other countries in Europe which are advanced, but in an era in which these new developments are taking place the weakness of the whole system is the domestic one.  The old story about a person in one part of County Cork wanting to contact another person in County Cork and having to do so through America is a joke, but there is this little element of truth in it, that it emphasises the domestic weakness in most countries of the world.</P>
    <P>I notice also in the Minister's notes a reference to a new development to <Col N="1274" /> which he also referred last year, pulse-code modulation.  This is a desirable development because it increases the capacity of our existing telephone lines something like twelve fold, so that twelve conversations can take place where before only one could.  We were told last year that other systems of this type were being considered, and I should like to know if any further developments have taken place in this regard.  I notice that these systems are put in in Cork-Cobh, Cork-Midleton, Limerick-Rathkeale, and Bray-Dublin. Are there any other ones in line?  Will this system be widely utilised to improve our situation?</P>
    <P>The only other reference I want to make to subhead F, in respect of satellite communication, is to ask what liaison, if any, there is between the Department and Radio Telefís Éireann. Is the equipment which is being purchased, or to which this sum is attributed, being used solely by the post office or is it being used also by RTE, because there is a possibility, perhaps, of saving in this regard.  I should like to know if RTE, for example, bears in its accounting system any of the cost of this or if it is spread between the Departments or if the Department bears the whole cost.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the ministerial notes for Deputies has been the reference to data transmission.  I make no apology for stressing these matters. I welcome the developments taking place in this field because, given our entry into our Europe, there is no point in anybody suggesting that we can be satisfied with second best.  I welcome the references in previous years and in the notes this year to the development of the data transmission service.  Such services, for example, join up the College of Science next door with the university complex in Belfield in a system whereby by leasing a circuit the various parts of University College are in a position to utilise the computer on their premises to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>However, the problem, as I am sure the Minister knows, is that if you are using this service on the same <Col N="1275" /> general circuits as the ordinary telephone service and given the high level of noise on some occasions or the possibility of breakdown, the performance of the data transmission service might be impaired or affected by the fact that our telephone service is not, perhaps, as efficient as it should be due to the electro-mechanical nature of the system. Could the Minister tell us if any of the subscribers are experiencing difficulty in this service?  Do any complaints come to his notice and, if so, what he is able to do about them, given the nature of our telephonic system?  As I say, I stress the importance of these various things in view of our entry to the European Community.</P>
    <P>There is, finally, in this particular regard the importance, as the Minister has mentioned, of keeping in touch with the various other broadcasting authorities and telecommunications authorities in regard to the latest developments in data transmission. On various occasions over the years the Minister has referred to the fact that a group is conducting a study on this question.  I should like to know if this group is anywhere near reaching finality, what changes, if any, are required as a result of the co-operation and common action of the various European countries?  Will we have to make any changes which, for example, will involve us in a great deal of capital expenditure because, if we have to do it, we have to do it and, as I say, our peripheral position in Europe means that we must not allow ourselves to fall down on any of these developments.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the domestic situation, there is no need for me to add very much to the volume of criticism which arises almost daily in regard to the telephone system.  The Minister is quite aware of the volume of complaint. The fact that he says that other European countries are experiencing similar difficulties is, of course, a good point but it is no satisfaction to the subscriber who fails to make a connection. We must as a matter of priority get to the bottom of this telephone <Col N="1276" /> problem and see if we cannot improve the service.  Even when one gets a connection there are problems of hissing on the line, noise, crossed lines, all due to the outdated and obsolete nature of the equipment which is being used, I would suggest.  There is the overloading of exchanges.  There is the impossibility, for example, in my constituency of getting new connections in certain areas.  Admittedly, the population in my constituency, as will probably be reflected in the very near future, is expanding more than in most but this is where planning comes in.  We must plan ahead for the various new developments and, if necessary, see to it that we have all the equipment to hand in time.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the telecommunications staff.  It is interesting to note that under subhead A, of £3,422,000 left after taking £1,800,000 for pay awards including the first part of the 13th round, about £1.6 million is provided for additional staff, mainly for the telephone service.  I should like the Minister to tell us a little more about this because it is obvious that a staff of professionally qualified engineers is a vital aspect of this service. How, for example, are the engineers recruited?  Are there sufficient of them available to the community from the university faculties and, if so, are there any difficulties of organisation or remuneration which prevent them from accepting a position in the Post Office? A force of professionally qualified engineers is necessary for the planning, development and maintenance of the system.  For example, in the last five years, what were the recruitment figures through the Civil Service Commission? What were the recruitment figures directly?  Does the Minister or his Department receive co-operation from university faculties in relation to the various schemes for scholarships, and so on?  Is there, for example, good job satisfaction and high morale in this service among the various grades?  It is not only the professional engineers one has in mind here; there is also the question of technicians who perform a very vital service in the telecommunications system.  In fact, the smooth functioning of the engineering section <Col N="1277" /> depends on the skilled technicians for the practical work and the maintenance of the system.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell us about trainee systems and schemes?  Are these successful?  How many, for example, are in training at the moment and of those who are taken into the service what is the drop-out rate and, if there is a drop-out rate, what are the causes of this, because if one engages in good schemes for trainee recruitment and then finds another factor which is causing them to drop out, it would seem that there is something to be remedied.</P>
    <P>I would stress the importance of communications within the Department between the various grades and personnel.  I do not need to labour the obvious, that very many of these technicians at ground level in the Department must from time to time become aware of and hopefully offer to the higher grades of the service useful ideas for improving the service.</P>
    <P>One such idea for improving the service has been brought to my attention and I commend it to the Minister for what it is worth.  I am aware of the fact that schemes may not always be easy of implementation even though on the surface they may seem to be so.  One of the problems which besets many telephone subscribers, particularly in the Dublin area, is the difficulty of getting a telephone fault corrected.  I understand that the system is that, if one's telephone goes out of order, one must ring the operator at 191, I think.  The operator takes the report and passes it on to the engineering repair staff, a staff of young technicians.  These young technicians need not necessarily be well versed, and very often are not well versed, in the right procedures for the repair of faults.</P>
    <P>The transfer of the report may be delayed.  Secondly, the operator may not be technically equipped to appreciate what the angry subscriber wishes to convey, with the result that the report may reach the wrong members of the staff, or may reach the right members of the staff in the wrong form.  Operators of telephone systems are not normally, I would think, <Col N="1278" /> geared to be able to appreciate technical problems.  If wrong reports are reaching the repair staff, trained men are very often wasting their time running after the wrong diagnosis.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  There is duplication after duplication of the same report.  It takes a lot of time to record.  I want the Minister to tell me whether this system, particularly for the Dublin region&mdash;we will confine ourselves to Dublin for the moment&mdash; would operate properly.  For example, if my telephone number, beginning with 88, goes out of order, is it possible to have at that exchange a person waiting at a particular number which would be made up of a trebling of the first two numbers, that would be 888888, or if my number began with 37 it would be 373737, or whatever the exchange number might be.  At the end of that line could there be a fully trained person with whom the angry subscriber could get in touch directly and explain the problem?  Then professionally trained staff could home in on the right diagnosis and effect a repair more readily.  If this scheme is feasible there is the possibility of the release of staff who are at present tied up in the central trunk exchange and who could, perhaps, be more usefully employed elsewhere.  If the scheme has any merit. I commend it to the Minister who might let me know if it can be worked. Communication between angry subscribers and the proper personnel in the Department might do something to ameliorate the situation.</P>
    <P>In passing, I want to say that I was glad to note from <i>The Postal Worker</i> magazine that classes in French, for example, are being provided for the people who operate the international telephone exchange.  It is useful to highlight that fact to show that we are at least aware of the requirements of our new connection with Europe and that something is being done about it.</P>
    <P>The next matter in relation to the telephone service to which I wish to refer is the incidence of vandalism.  As the Minister is fully aware, this is a great problem in many areas of Dublin city.  I know from other tele-communications administrations that efforts <Col N="1279" /> are being made to do something about it by the provision, for example, of recessed dials and other methods by which vandals are frustrated.  The question of vandalism is a serious one, not merely because of the inconvenience caused to the public in general, but because in some cases questions of life and death may depend on its eradication.</P>
    <P>I have illusions about very few things but I have no great illusions about the difficulty of this problem.  Perhaps the best thing we could do in this House is to make a strong appeal to those who are engaged in this kind of mindless activity to cease what they are doing.  Recently in my constituency a woman was waiting patiently outside a telephone box to make a telephone call and when the person inside had finished with the telephone he wrenched it out and threw it at her feet.  Needless to say I do not blame the Department for this. It is a social phenomenon which it is not within the power of society to correct perhaps.  I should like to know if any efforts are being made by mechanical means to see that the capital expended on the provision of kiosks in various areas in the city can be fruitfully utilised in the sense that when people go to use the telephone they have a telephone to use.  I do not know whether these problems exists in other parts of the country.</P>

      <P>I want to turn now to some questions about the Post Office side of things.  The Minister referred to the desirability of taking a new look at the Post Office side of things and to examine whether the cost of uneconomic services might not be borne by the taxpayer.  I am quoting from memory.  I would urge that there should be some hesitation in this regard because, even in places like Dublin city where the volume of mail is fairly strong, there is cause for complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have got the general impression from talking to colleagues in Dublin city that the service on the postal side is not being kept up to the standards of previous years.  As the Minister <Col N="1280" /> knows, I have been making representations to him fairly constantly on behalf of businessmen who complain that their post is not being delivered on time.  There is a difficulty here that as the Post Office attempts to introduce necessary economies by, say, lengthening routes and so on, some people who were in receipt of an early post will be pushed back a bit, but the situation has been reached where a significant number of business people are using messengers to effect deliveries of letters between different parts of this city. This is not something I welcome and that is why I bring it to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>The experiments which are going on, for example in my area, of balanced delivery services were not referred to in the Minister's speech.  I hold that it is necessary at all times to try to experiment to improve things.  On the introduction of the five-day week in the Dublin area, it was the case that some postmen had hours which they had to make up.  They did it, I believe, by coming in every fifth and sixth Saturday.  As a result of this, they had to find some system by which they could make up for the loss of Saturday work.  Under voluntary experiment, based I understand on the Blackrock area of Dublin, something like six postmen have been taken off the routes and the routes of other postmen have been lengthened to compensate.  This has meant later delivery for some people, but in my area no complaint has been received about this&mdash;it is more a matter of curiosity as to why this is taking place.</P>
    <P>The previous system was such that the postman got a three-hour mid-morning break but this, during the experiment, has been reduced and that man who knocks off at 9.45 a.m. must return at 10.45 a.m. to prepare the second delivery.  One of the effects of the system is that the early morning letters posted in Dublin cannot be out in time to be sorted in this early system for distribution in the suburbs. I hope I will be corrected if I am wrong in saying that the effect of this is to reduce deliveries to one per day. As things stand in this experiment, I believe the men deal with fully paid <Col N="1281" /> items such as parcels and airmail on the first delivery and try to leave printed matter and so forth for later delivery.</P>
    <P>I understand this is still going on and I should like to know about it. One thing I am glad about is that there is no redundancy involved. However, one problem about it is that, whereas a postman previously had three hours off in mid-morning, he now has only one and in that time, particularly in wet weather when he has to change, he will not be able to get home, have a meal and get back in time.</P>
    <P>I think the public could assist postman by using a little thought.  I have in mind particularly a local case.  The postman ties up his little bundles of mail with pieces of twine while sorting in the morning.  He comes to this business establishment which has a rather large volume of mail and he finds the letter box is unduly small. He has to untie his little bundle of letters and put them through in small groups.  If the public were made aware of these matters they could help the postman who sometimes has a rather difficult job.  There is a further difficulty because sometimes business houses have little iron gates two or three feet away from their front doors and the postman has to lean over the gate to effect delivery at arm's length. It seems to me the attention of such firms should be directed to these matters.  Of course, there is always the door without a letter box in which case the postman has to stoop down to push the letters under the door. All these matters could easily be remedied through the exercise of a little thought by the general public. This is the place to air these points so that public attention may be drawn to them.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to an allied topic, the conditions of work in post offices.  Like most other mortals, postal workers are affected by heat and cold, and where the Post Office provides heaters there can be difficulty of maintaining compromise between those who find the conditions difficult and those who find them acceptable. Perhaps a proper ventilation <Col N="1282" /> system might effect an improvement. We all know the old joke about the two women in the train where one found it too hot and the other found it too cold&mdash;the old film comedy situation.</P>
    <P>There is the associated problem of the Central Sorting Office in Sheriff Street.  I think it was in 1967 that a new sorting system was introduced. I shall quote from <i>The Postal Worker,</i> volume 50, for 9th September, 1972:</P>
    <P>Six years ago we were told that an air-conditioning unit would be installed in the CSO.  We are still working in an atmosphere almost beyond endurance.  The people who should be getting the job done sit in their offices all day and could not care less.  We hope that 1992 is not the new date for the secret installing, because rumour has it that people will not be breathing air by that time.</P>
    <P>Colourful, perhaps, but a problem. What is being done about this and when may we hope to see an improvement in the situation?  There is the other related matter of the five-day delivery for postmen working in rural parts.  I cannot recollect whether the Minister referred to this matter in his speech.  Is the staggered system in operation or is it still under negotiation? If it is not yet in operation, when will it be introduced?</P>
    <P>In the paper some time ago I noticed that the Minister was brought to task in his corporate capacity for the conditions which were alleged to have then obtained at St. Andrew Street Sorting Office.  Generally the application of the provision of the Factory Acts has been mentioned from time to time.  I am not in a position to say whether accusations made from time to time about conditions in post offices have any substance.  I hesitate to accuse when I have not got the information. At the same time, when a matter like this is given public notice perhaps we might hear something about improvements.  I have heard that improvements were carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister will meet with co-operation from me if he is finding difficulties about buildings or conditions <Col N="1283" /> of employment.  I do not suggest that everything can be improved overnight.  I want to see an atmosphere or a mentality in the Department of straining at the leash to effect improvements in the working conditions of the Post Office staff.</P>
    <P>Reverting for a moment to the staffing and structure of the Department itself, it is not generally appreciated that something like one in every 50 persons at work in the country is an employee of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  In my opening remarks I spoke about the poor image of the Department.  An appreciation of the fact that the Department is such a large employer would also help to dissipate that image.  We must face the fact that this is a very labour-intensive organisation.  In each of the years 1959-60 to 1969-70, as referred to in the commercial accounts, per £ expenditure on salaries and wages in respect of those years was expressed in old terms as follows: 11s 5d, 11s 6d, 11s 8d, 11s 8d, 11s 7d, 11s 10d, 11s 4d, 11s, 11s and 10s 7d.  I take it that that is in reference to the general aspect of the Post Office situation.  Income from postal services in respect of the same years was as follows: 9s 4d, 9s, 8s 9d, 8s 8d, 8s 5d, 8s 5d, 8s, 7s 8d, 7s 3d, 6s 11d, 7s 3d per £ income received. Income from the telephone service in respect of those years was: 8s, 8s 3d, 8s 5d, 8s 8d, 8s 9d, 9s, 9s 5d, 9s 5d, 9s 11d, 10s 2d, and 10s 5d.  I have not got the more recent figures.  It is obvious that some improvements are being achieved and economies are having some success.  I urge the Minister to push these measures of economy as vigorously as possible by automation of exchange, motorisation of postal deliveries where that is possible&mdash;and I appreciate the difficulties&mdash;and by the processing of sections of the Department's clerical work by computers.  In trying to achieve greater productivity the Department must be careful to enlist the support of their staff organisations and other groups involved.  In another Department to which I was attached&mdash;the Taoiseach's Department &mdash;at one stage the common complaint was that staff associations were not <Col N="1284" /> given adequate consultation facilities by that Department and this led to certain difficulties over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister doing to enlist the support of the staff organisations? I take it that he is endeavouring to enlist their support and hopefully is getting it.  Given the fact that the tele-communications side brings in increased income and is obviously expanding, there should be no need for redundancies in the overall Post Office service as a result of measures taken for reasons of economy.  Obviously, I would be the last person to advocate measures which would result in redundancy. I do not see that they are necessary.  In an expanding section people who can with retraining more profitably serve in some other part can make that change.</P>
    <P>Members of this House over many years have welcomed the introduction of consultative councils in the major centres.  I hope that these are being set up in all areas.  I would like to know if that is the case and if there is continuing expansion and whether any difficulties are being experienced in regard to this point.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know, if, as mentioned in other years, what are termed the behavioural sciences are being used to identify, isolate and remove causes of friction which may exist.  Industrial psychology, sociology and human relations can provide much help to those whose function it is to supervise others in the performance of their duties.  There is also the other factor which is too often called the ergonomic which, translated into simple English, means the relationship of a man to the machine he is working. This, in other tele-communications administrations, is receiving a lot of attention.  With a little thought on the matter certain machines used by postal staff could be made suitable for their use.</P>
    <P>Any service in which 60 per cent of the expenditure is on wages, salaries and related superannuation payments is bound to suffer losses if greater efficiency and productivity do not minimise the effect of these losses in a situation where increased business does <Col N="1285" /> not automatically result.  The Minister referred to the increases in pay of £3.7 million and £4.7 million without including the normal grade claims which come almost automatically from time to time.  The House should realise that these claims are being made, that these grade claims are based on relativities, that there is the effect of the shorter working week and that there are higher overtime payments, interest and depreciation charges and payments to foreign administrations.  These increases in pay, which are negotiated in the normal way, are welcomed by Members of this House as they are based on comparisons with the pay of people outside the Post Office.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would like to place on the record of the House, as the Minister has done at the end of his speech, our appreciation of the services which the various members of the Post Office organisation give to the public in conditions which sometimes can be very trying.  I heard recently of the difficult conditions, for example, in which telephone operators have to carry out their functions, particularly the point that the sub-post offices originally were meant to carry out a certain volume of business in the locality and the increase in the number of telephone subscribers has led to difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Sub-Postmasters Union recently came out rather strongly about the matter and the Government were accused of having failed to provide sufficient capital, unlike the ESB, who provided capital for rural electrification. It was said that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were not at all as businesslike in their outlook. Referring to members of that union it was said that 38,000 of the 750,000 subscribers still operate through 630 manual exchanges, staffed by members, and that it was not good enough for the Minister to say that 80 per cent of the country is automatic if the remaining 20 per cent is being subjected to growth in traffic and difficulty in manual exchanges which was never envisaged in the early days.  These sentiments are worthy of the attention of the Minister and I should like to know if the sub-post office telephone operators are <Col N="1286" /> being subjected to a volume of work which is greater than that which they used to have to do.</P>
    <P>In regard to the postal service, I agree with the Minister in regard to the increase in the salary aspect.  Between 1959-60 and 1969-70 per £ expenditure in the postal service the element for wages and pensions increased from 14s 1d to 15s 5d per £. The telephone income, by counter-distinction with that, increased from 8s to 10s 5d.  We see that a very large percentage of the expenditure on the postal service is on wages and pensions. The Minister should be careful in any measure he may take to effect economy in relation to the service, particularly in rural parts.  I am sure that he, as a representative of a rural area, is more aware than I, as a Deputy representing a city area, of the necessity for maintaining the service at the level to which people have been accustomed.  In the postal service one might say superficially that greater mechanisation might effect an improvement but we must remember that we are faced here with a large volume of single items which do not lend themselves easily to mechanisation.  The social factor involved here is that increasing populations in large suburban estates call for more postmen and declining populations in rural areas are perhaps not prepared to forego the service to which they have been accustomed.  Before any decision is made in these matters it would be helpful to know, in relation to various areas, what is the cost per item delivered, the cost of, say, a letter delivered to some of the places which I had the good fortune to visit recently in mid-Cork as distinct from volumes of letters delivered in a large suburban estate in my constituency.  There is no doubt that there is a large element of social subsidy involved in relation to the provision of a rural postal service. I do not know whether there are any routes where the volume of mail is down to, say, single figures.  If there are, it is quite obvious that the expenditure of 4p on a stamp will not be able to pay for the service.</P>
    <P>We in this Oireachtas are faced with a number of situations in respect of <Col N="1287" /> services of a generally similar type, such as the problem which arises between road and rail transport or, on another level, between radio and television where you have one part of the service bringing in a surplus and the other a deficit.  In the case of transport and communications it is quite clear that there is an imbalance in population, distribution.  However, and I am sure I am speaking here to a Minister who will receive this quite readily, it is not up to bureaucrats safely situated in Dublin&mdash;I do not mean to use that word pejoratively but people who are perhaps divorced from the scene&mdash;to take decisions affecting populations in isolated areas, people who through no fault of their own are living in districts which have suffered a decline in population, over, say, the last 100 years.  It is to the credit of various Governments down the years that they have tried to, in a sense, pay back through community action for the difficulties which certain parts of our community have had to suffer down through the years.  My reaction would be for positive discrimination in favour of continuing a high level of service to our rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister in 1970 set up a departmental committee to consider the structure, operation and finances of the postal services, including the operation of the counter services but, as he has mentioned, the report is not yet available to this House.  One can only wait and hope that it will be available soon so that those of us engaged in looking after the activities of this Department will have some facts on which to base our judgments.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn briefly to the question of the Devlin Report, that is the Report of the Review Body on the Public Services.  There are some very interesting comments in that report on the structure and organisation of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I think the Minister will agree that this House should be told whether or not a decision has been taken in relation to the suggestions in that report.  It is mentioned on page 373 that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is one of the oldest Government agencies and that <Col N="1288" /> on the basis of the criteria they were using there is little to differentiate between the combination of the social and economic functions of this Department and the task in different fields of, say, CIE or the ESB.  They raised the question of whether there should be one unit or two.  Arguments for and against the separation of the postal and telecommunication services are given.  It is pointed out that the telecommunications service is capital intensive while the postal service is not.  The telecommunications service is expanding while the postal service is static or at best breaks even. They also state that the telecommunications service requires a high level of expertise while the postal service is comparatively easy to operate.  They say in their notes on page 373:</P>
    <P>After consideration and discussion with the Minister and representatives of his Department that it was not feasible to separate the two services...</P>
    <P>They give their reasons why this is. Briefly they are:</P>
    <P>Both are a communication service to the public and due to technological innovations the mix will change over the years and there should be a single body to decide the changes in this mix.</P>
    <P>Physical facilities are largely tied together in the post offices throughout the country and would be difficult to disentangle.</P>
    <P>This is a point which is not readily appreciated by those who speak on these matters without having given sufficient thought to them.  I may be open to criticism but I think one should delve deeply into examination of these problems before offering easy solutions.  Some further points made by them are:</P>
    <P>The separation of the expanding telecommunications service from the static postal service would tend to demoralise the latter, no less important, service.  The staff have been traditionally under a single management and, on questions of conditions of service, would continue to regard themselves as members of a single service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> There is, then, the whole question of putting the postal service and the tele-communications service under the new Department of Transport and Tele-communications. That is a sufficiently important matter to require the Minister to tell the House his thoughts on it.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that in 1972, which we all know was the 50th anniversary of the deaths of great men of the political traditions of this country, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the Government did not feel able to commemorate these great men by issuing commemorative stamps.  I know that a symbolic stamp has been issued to cover all those who gave their lives in that period of our history.  Certain individual names &mdash;I may be pardoned for referring to two of them.  Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins&mdash;are sufficiently revered by the great majority of the people to have been commemorated by the issuing of commemorative stamps.  I would not exclude the commemoration of other important figures of other traditions in this regard.  It would show a certain degree of maturity if we did this.</P>
    <P>Another commemoration which takes place next month is the adoption of the Constitution of 1922.  As we are engaged in a constitutional amendment process and getting back to the general terms of the earlier one perhaps the Minister and his Department might give some thought to the commemoration of this event in the history of our State.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to the other services which have been mentioned by the Minister, particularly the telex and telegraph services.  We are glad to note that the telex service has been given special attention by the Department over the years.  This is probably the service which has shown greatest expansion over the last few years.  I note, looking through the various documents, that it was inaugurated in 1955 with 12 subscribers but, particularly since the middle sixties, it has undergone rapid development.  At the end of 1969 there were 968 subscribers and in June, 1971, 1,223 subscribers.  I am sure the <Col N="1290" /> number is much higher now.  I understand this telex service is in operation to practically all the countries in the world.  To how many countries is this service automatic?  I understand that the United Kingdom, Western Europe and most parts of the USA, have automatic connection services with us.  We should be told if there is an increase in this service.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to the gentleman, to whom I referred earlier, when quoting from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 21st October, 1972.  He was also critical of the telex service. He said when he requested a telex machine he was told that a year's rent, or more than £300, was payable in advance but that the Post Office could give no guarantee when it would be installed.  Perhaps the Minister would explain to me why the figure is so high.</P>
    <P>I understand that the operation of this service is based on the Dublin exchange and that facilities are available throughout the country on the basis of paying a mileage charge&mdash;in effect, the operation of the service on the basis of a local call from the Dublin exchange. Even with inflation and the high cost of living at present, the £300 is fairly high. I refer to my remarks earlier as to the £20 for the telephone installation.  Is this £300 or whatever figure is appropriate in a given location a disincentive to those firms who wish to avail themselves of the service? Is there a waiting list for the service and, if so, how many applicants are there and what percentage increase has there been as compared, say, with last year?  What can be done to improve the system?  Perhaps the Minister would tell us, too, whether the satellite exchanges have been opened in Limerick and Galway.  These were envisaged last year.  How many circuits are available to the USA? Some time ago the number was increased from six to 27 and further extended circuits were planned.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, it is a desirable situation that telex subscribers are charged by way of local call and that provincial subscribers, on payment of a mileage charge, can have their calls regarded as local Dublin calls.  I <Col N="1291" /> mentioned earlier in another context the desirability of minimising geographical disparities in this country. I shall refer to that later in another context.  The telex service is available day and night and messages transmitted can be received regardless of whether the telex printer is attended provided, of course, that it is left switched on.  This is understandable because the service might be used between countries as far apart as Ireland and Australia and there would be no point in having a telex service without having this open facility available because when it is night-time in one part of the world it is day-time in another.</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's remarks that he is not very pleased with the telegraph service.  I quote from page 18 of his brief:</P>
    <P>Departing from the telephone service, I wish to mention that another matter which is receiving my consideration is whether we should continue to lump in totally uneconomic services provided for social reasons with normal commercial services.  For example, the telegraph service has been a financial burden on the Post Office continuously since 1922-23, and indeed for long before.  Any ordinary business organisation would long since have dispensed with such an uneconomic service, provided solely for the benefit of the community and not for commercial reasons.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that this seems to be an area of declining economic worth but I would draw his attention to the fact that in his Department's accounts, the telex and telegraph incomes are put together.  While in the years 1959-60 to 1969-70, the telegram income per £ from the telegraph service has reduced from 9s 7d to 8s 5d, there has been a dramatic increase in the income per £ available to that particular account from the telex service.  In the ten years the amounts have been 2s, 2s 8d, 2s 7d, 2s 4d, 3s 7d, and about the mid-1960s we note an increasing figure from 3s 10d to 4s 9d, 4s 6d to 7s 5d.  No doubt the latest figures are higher.  I <Col N="1292" /> should like the Minister to tell us why he regards the telegraph service as being a financial burden if it is combined with the telex service which is an improving one.</P>
    <P>I concede that, viewed on its own, the telegraph service is losing money but coupled here with the telex service it would seem to be in a less drastic position than the Minister would have us believe.  In the accounts I notice an element which I wish to have explained. This is that from about 1965 onwards an item referred to as &ldquo;foreign outpayments&rdquo; became a significant part of the expenditure on the telegraph service.  From 1965 onwards the figures per £ expended were 2s 10d, 3s 0d, 2s 8d, 3s 3d, 3s 10d and 4s 5d.  What is involved in this particular item and why has it risen to such an extent during the years?  I note, too, that the Department have made a slight advance on the previous accounting procedure in placing the telex income on an accural basis since about the end of the 1960s rather than on a payment-on-receipts basis.  This is to be welcomed because if we are to gauge the work of the service we must do it on figures which relate to the year of operation and for reasons that have been explained before in this House, all of the telex income may not come in in the year in which it is due.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to another part of the Minister's speech in which he adverted to capital payments for Radio na Gaeltachta.  Ba maith liom cúpla focal a rá i nGaeilge ar an gceist seo.  Chím gur leagadh amach £180,000 mar chaipitil do Radio na Gaeltachta don bhliain 1972 agus gur íocadh seo as an Lár-Chiste. Is mór an chúis áthais domsa agus is mór an chúis bhróid don phairtí seo agamsa d'Oireachtas Éireann agus do mhuintir na hÉireann go h-uile gur cuireadh tús leis an seirbhís seo Domhnach Cásca seo caite.</P>
    <P>Cloisim, áfach, go bhfuil daoine áirithe míshásta le caighdeán na gclár atá á gcraoladh ag an radio seo.  Ní féidir liomsa na tuairimí seo a mheas nó a mheádh go cruinn agus go ceart mar níl gléas radio ardmhinicíochta agam sa taobh seo tíre.  Agus, fiú, dá <Col N="1293" /> mbeadh an gléas sin agam ní fhéadfainn an radio sin d'fháil i mBaile Átha Cliath go fóillín beag.  Ba mhaith liom téarma eacnamaíochta a úsáid.  Ceapaim nach bhfuil táirgeadh &mdash;&ldquo;output&rdquo;&mdash;an radio seo le fáil ach ar tarchuireadoirí i Mullach an Ois, i Machaire agus san Trosc Mór agus ar na príomh-tharchuireadóirí Ghaeltachta i dtír Chonaill, i gConamara agus i gCorca Dhuibhne.</P>
    <P>Deirtear liom, leis, go bhfuil tairbhe le fáil as an radio seo os rud é go bhfuil na ceantair Ghaeltachta éagsúla ag cur aithne ar a chéile don chéad uair b'fhéidir.  Sin rud a fuair mise amach nuair a bhí mé ag obair sa toghcháin sin a luaigh mé cheana thíos i nGaeltacht Mhúscraí.</P>
    <P>Tá súl agam go bhfuil cothram na Féinne á thúirt do na dúthaigh eile consúil leis An Rinn i bPortláirge, dúthaigh Mhúscraí, Uibh Ráthach, Iorras i gContae Mhuigheo agus Rath Chairn anseo i gContae na Mí.</P>
    <P>Caithfear an dul chun cinn seo a fheiceál mar chuid den bheartas chun an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt, mar ghléas a ligfidh do na ceantair Gaeltachta aithne a chur ar a cheile.  Deis is ea í seo don na Gaeltachtaí cur in a luí ar mhuintir na hÉireann go bhfuil cúltúr ar leith acu go mba cheart go mbeadh meas ag muintir na hÉireann air.  Do léigh mé sa pháipéar cupla mí ó shoin go raibh gearán á dhéanamh ag Aire na Gaeltachta nár chloí Radio na Gaeltachta le h-alt 18 den Acht um Udarás Craolacháin, 1960. Mar is eol don Aire, de réir forálacha an ailt sin caithfidh Udarás RTE, nuair a chraolann sé aon eolas, nuacht nó rud mar sin, féachaint chuige nuair a bhíonn adhbhar conspóide á phlé, go ndéanfar an t-eolas agus an nuacht a fhoilsiú go neamh-chlaon, gan tuairimí an Udaráis a nochtadh.  Deirtear liomsa nár deineadh a leithéid i rith an reifrinn seo dul tharainn.  Do léigh mé a raibh le rá ag an Aire cupla mí a shoin agus ba mhaith liom tuairimí an Aire seo a fháil ar an cheist.  Tá Comhairle Radio na Gaeltachta curtha ar bun ag an Aire seo faoi réir alt 21 den Acht, ach is ar Udarás RTE atá an dualgas go ndéantar tagairt dóibh san alt san thuas, ní ar Chomhairle Radio na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> Mar a deirim, le linn an reifrinn deirtear liom nár tugadh cothrom na Féinne i bplé na ceiste agus fiú go bhfachthas postaerí i gcoinne na ceiste a bhí á phlé ansin ar ghluaisteán a bhain le Radio na Gaeltachta.  Má's fíor san, is mithid deireadh a chur le cúrsaí mar sin.  Ní féidir liomsa a rá go bhfuil an scéal amhlaidh mar ní raibh mé thiar ansin ag an am.</P>

      <P>Ag comhlíonadh a fheidhmeanna don Udarás coiméadfhaidh sé i gcuimhne i gconaí na haidhmeanna náisiúnta atá ann an Ghaeilge a aisiriú agus an tsaoícht náisiúnta a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt agus déanfaidh sé dícheall ag cabhrú leis na haidhmeanna sin a chur i gcrích.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire, nuair a bhíonn aon rud le rá i dtaobh Radio na Gaeltachta, go ndéanfadh sé féin é agus gan an dualgas san a chur ar an Aire eile, Aire na Gaeltachta, mar, do réir mó thuairimse, is ar an Aire seo, an tAire Poist agus Teileagrafa, atá an dualgas féachaint chuige go gclóinn Radio na Gaeltachta leis na forálacha a léigh mé amach ansin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reverting to another aspect of the Department's activities, we have the question of savings.  The Minister made only a passing reference to the savings situation.  I should like that the whole question of the Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Bank would be more fully outlined to the House to show us what contribution these services are making to the national economy.  I should like to pay a tribute, as has been done in previous years, to the good work which has been done in regard to this whole savings situation by the National Savings Committee.  Were I not spokesman <Col N="1295" /> for Posts and Telegraphs for my party the activities of the National Savings Committee, which I am sure are worthy of praise, might have escaped my attention.  I should like to know what efforts, if any, are being made, by the Minister to see that the National Savings Committee is given adequate facilities to publicise the activities which it has in relation to the savings service.</P>
    <P>Turning briefly to the Radio Éireann situation again, I should like to refer for a few moments to the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra.  I do not think it is right, in debating the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs, that certain activities not directly under the Minister's administration but within the general area of the Department should be glossed over, because under one of the subheads of this Estimate this Oireachtas annually devotes money to Radio Telefís Éireann which is utilised to finance this particular part of the service.</P>
    <P>The first point which can be made about the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra is that it is the only organisation, to my knowledge, engaged in serious music making in a professional sense.  This has placed a very heavy burden on the Radio Éireann Authority. The figure for expenditure on the symphony orchestra is in the region of £500,000, and I should think that if the figure is correct the money is well spent.  No country can afford to stress any one aspect of its development to the exclusion of another, to stress economic advance on the one hand without giving emphasis to some degree to the development of the cultural aspect.  The symphony orchestra not alone is used in a broadcasting sense to broadcast music over the network but it is also performing a public service by giving concerts all over the country.  These activities are of the nature of a public service in the musical education field.  It is not generally appreciated that, if the figure of £500,000 is correct, this represents something like £1 of the licence fee which subscribers to the broadcasting service pay.  In this sense I stress that it deserves the attention of the House <Col N="1296" /> and should not be simply glossed over or given mere mention.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra is probably the most heavily occupied unit of the RTE service.  I understand that they work, either rehearsing or giving concerts and so on, approximately 11 months of each year.  In this way they provide an educational service which the Oireachtas should appreciate and about which it should express its appreciation.  I wonder if the activities of the symphony orchestra are being utilised to the full.  For example, there could be better integration between broadcasts and our educational system. I have in mind the possibility that certain broadcasts might be scheduled at times when schools are in session so that musical appreciation classes could be conducted.  One could go on at some length referring to this aspect of things, but I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I should also like to express the appreciation of the Oireachtas of the enjoyment given to the public by the Radio Éireann Light Orchestra which engages the attention of the public more often, perhaps, than the symphony orchestra, the Radio Éireann Quartet, and so on.</P>
    <P>In raising this matter of the symphony orchestra I should like to ask the Minister if any request has been made to his Department or to any other Department that the public service content of the symphony orchestra's output as distinct from its broadcasting output should be subsidised or paid for in some other way than through the licence fee income which is passed on to them by this House each year.  If such a request has been made perhaps the House could be told what the Minister's thinking is in the matter and if he would be prepared to see his way to making funds available from some other source, say, from the Education Estimate rather than his own.  If this request has not been made, my question does not arise for answer.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House too long in dealing with the matter of radio.  We are all very pleased with the excellence of the radio service over recent years.  I am referring particularly <Col N="1297" /> to programmes which seek to engage the public in discussion.  I have in mind particularly a programme which involves the public in discussion of public issues.  The very name of the programme suggests this.  I am glad to see that from time to time Government Ministers have appeared on this programme and have been put through their paces, as is only right and proper, by members of the public.  I wonder if we can look forward to the day when the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs might singly or in company with Opposition spokesmen allow himself to be involved in this programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is less satisfactory, I would suggest, than the other but, at least, members of the Opposition can become members of the public for the occasion.</P>
      <P>I would also like to pay tribute to those programmes on current affairs which, as is the duty of a broadcasting company, cast a searching eye on the affairs of the nation.  There is the mid-morning programme which is very widely listened to and which is performing a very useful function.  I happen to be very partial to that programme because I get the opportunity from time to time to listen to it, if for no other reason.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the news broadcasts which are put out on Radio Éireann, which are very comprehensive and which enjoy, with the television service, the services of what can only be described as one of the most excellent staffs available to any television service in this part of the world.  It would be invidious to single out persons for special mention.  I shall refer to this at another stage of my remarks.  This country is very well served by the news services given by Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that from time to time persons <Col N="1298" /> of particular views may feel, rightly or wrongly, that a particular slant may be given to certain items of news but, by and large, the service is run objectively and is a very good and useful service.</P>
    <P>One thing which disturbs me slightly about the radio service is the almost saturation point which has been reached in regard to advertising. I shall develop this more fully in another part of my remarks.  It seems that the public service nature of some programmes and the high incidence of advertising are exerting opposing influences which are not in the best interests of the station.  The one good thing we can say about radio advertising is that it is of the spot variety rather than the sponsored type that one had been used to previously but the intensity of advertising spots on Radio Éireann has now reached a point where, it must be stated bluntly, the top point has been reached and if any more advertising is put out on the radio it will have a counterproductive effect.</P>
    <P>One could make the same point, of course, in relation to the television service. The Oireachtas has laid down the method of payment for the radio and television services.  As we know, they are paid by a combination of licence fee income on the one hand and advertising services fees on the other.  It is interesting to see from the accounts of RTE that whereas the proportion of income from licence fees at an early stage of the last decade was 50 per cent, now the proportions are: the advertising income has gone beyond 60 per cent whereas licence fee income has been reduced to about 40 per cent.  I move to report progress.</P>

This is vital if Parliament is to function properly.</P>

      <Col N="1303" /> The latest information on industrial earnings relates to June, 1972. The index of weekly industrial earnings in transportable goods industries increased by 41.5 per cent between mid-March, 1970, and mid-June, 1972.  Between mid-February, 1970, and mid-May, 1972, the consumer price index rose by 22.0 per cent.  A corresponding short-term indicator for salaries is not available.</P>

      <P>A detailed survey of the kind mentioned has not been made but I have been considering, in consultation with the Economic and Social Research Institute, the question of undertaking a substantial research project on unemployment.  The matters to be covered in such a project are under discussion.</P>
      <P>The live register and the various analyses of it which are published periodically do, of course, contain a great deal of information about the extent and nature of unemployment.

      <P>The answer is in the negative.  VAT is ordinarily payable only in respect of goods sold and <Col N="1314" /> services rendered on or after November 1st, 1972.  Certain traders may elect to be taxable on the basis of cash actually received on or after November 1st, but since wholesale tax which was chargeable on the same basis would relate only to receipts before November 1st, there could be no question of any double taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The general strategy of the budget which I introduced last April was designed to improve the growth performance of the economy and to safeguard and increase employment. <Col N="1315" /> The combined capital and current budgets this year amounted to almost £920 million, or some £115 million more than actual expenditure in 1971-72.  This substantial increase in expenditure, to be financed without recourse to new taxation, was designed to stimulate growth and economic activity generally.</P>
      <P>The public capital programme forms a major part of national investment and, therefore, it directly promotes growth of employment.  This year's programme was settled in April at £251.3 million which represented a large increase over the 1971-72 programme which itself had been specially expanded in order to help employment. In August I increased this year's programme by a special addition of £4.8 million to give a further stimulus to output and employment in the building and construction industry. This increase brought the total capital programme to £256 million or £42 million more than expenditure in 1971-72.</P>
      <P>On the non-capital side, the total budget figure for expenditure was just over £650 million.  I explained in my budget speech that, being faced with the competing requirements of acting to contain inflationary pressures or stimulating the growth performance of the economy, the Government decided to opt for growth. The level of expenditure was, therefore, fixed by reference to our economic requirements&mdash;including the need to help employment&mdash;and was not cut back to the estimated yield of revenue.  There were no increases in taxation and the deficit in the current budget was, therefore, to be financed mainly by borrowing.  The intention was that the budget measures would restore us to our potential growth path of 4 per cent or more per annum.  All the indications are that this objective will be realised.</P>
      <P>Finally, I might mention that&mdash;as the Taoiseach indicated to the House on 25th October&mdash;in a further measure to help in the creation of jobs the Industrial Development Authority have been authorised to step up their promotional activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is now general agreement that the present international monetary system is inadequate and the question of its reform has been under discussion over the past year or more by the international bodies concerned and by governments the world over.  It was decided at Washington last September, on the occasion of the last annual general meeting of the International Monetary Fund, to set up a special group known as the Committee of Twenty to examine the whole system and recommend desirable reforms.  This country is represented in the Committee of Twenty.  In view of the complexities <Col N="1317" /> of the subject it will probably be some time before the committee will be able to complete their deliberations.</P>
      <P>I would hope that the proposals forthcoming from the committee and the decisions made on them will help in combating the inflationary forces. For example, better machinery for the adjustment of exchange rates should help to bring about earlier alignment of costs and prices as between the different countries, making for greater stability all round. Similarly, improved arrangements for the control and distribution of international liquidity would be beneficial. Such measures could provide a more congenial climate in which world trade could expand without being hampered by exchange rate and liquidity difficulties.</P>
      <P>However, we must not assume that an improved monetary system would of itself solve our inflationary problems. The basic position will remain that we can only prosper if we avoid excessive price and income increases in relation to the levels of those abroad and in relation to our national production. Policy must continue to be directed to this end.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that this internal matter is something separate from whatever plans may be mooted in Europe.</P>

      <P>When there were very many small schools it was necessary to reduce the pupil/teacher ratio to 1 to 15.  That position has changed considerably.  We are endeavouring to form larger units in one way or another or to get co-operation between the various schools.  I pointed out on previous occasions that I discussed the pupil/teacher ratio with Ministers for Education and educational authorities in other countries. I found that what we were sanctioning was a very much lower pupil/ teacher ratio than that prevailing or in some instances even contemplated in those countries.  Indeed, in this country the vast majority of the schools did not find it necessary to go anywhere near the ratio of 1 to 5. The basic point I want to make is that what we are proposing is educationally sound and within our capacity to finance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy in regard to the closure of small schools relates <Col N="1330" /> mainly to one-and two-teacher schools.</P>
    <P>The ideal arrangement would be one where a school would have a teacher for each separate class.  This in relation to many rural areas would be capable of attainment only through transport services which would cover very wide areas and would result in many children having to spend an undue length of time in travelling.  Furthermore it would entail bringing children to school outside their own parish, something that is to be avoided wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if it became a practical proposition to provide, in the parish, a central school with five or more teachers and this involved the closing of a three-teacher school which was due for replacement then efforts would be made to have the three-teacher school closed and to give all the children in the parish the benefits of the larger school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 to 61, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Grants Scheme has been amended with effect as from the beginning of the present academic year so as to provide for the revision of the rates of grant payable and the division of grants into two elements&mdash;a fee element and a maintenance element.  Originally the grant consisted of a lump sum not exceeding £300 in the case of a student not resident in or adjacent to a university town and £175 in the case of a student residing in or adjacent to a university town.  The new maxima are £406 and £256 respectively.  These are made up of a sum not exceeding £156 in respect of fees and sums of £250 and £100 respectively in respect of maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original scheme was less advantageous for students in the high-fee faculties in that such students had less for their maintenance and other expenses.  The imbalance in amounts <Col N="1336" /> available for maintenance and other expenses has now been eliminated.</P>
    <P>Grants under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, may be held by eligible students at university degree courses in the National College of Art, in the Colleges of Technology, Bolton Street and Kevin Street, Dublin, and in the Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  These courses are recognised as equivalent to university degree courses but, as yet, no courses in regional technical colleges are so recognised.  The total number of students holding higher education grants in the academic year 1971-72 was 4,333 of which 4,306 were in the universities and 27 were in other institutions of higher education. Figures for the present academic year are not yet available.</P>
    <P>I might add that the vocational education committees operate separate schemes for the award of scholarships to the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>The student referred to in Question No. 60 is not in receipt of a higher education grant of £250 per annum plus fees, because she lives in Dublin and her grant is calculated on the scale for pupils living in or near a university town.  Her grant this year is £100, plus fees of £103, making a total of £203, against £200 last year.</P>
    <P>With regard to late applications the position is that intending applicants were given ample time to apply for these grants as the latest date was the 31st August.  I do not propose to allow local authorities to extend the date for the receipt of applications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas has been considering, in consultation with all the higher education institutions, how funds might be allocated (a) to acquire additional equipment to update the several existing systems and improve their capacity and flexibility; and (b) to provide experimental linkages between the various computers to ascertain to what extent the needs of all the institutions concerned for computer services could be met by co-operation in the use of the individual systems now in operation.  An tÚdarás considers that experience of such linking arrangements should be of assistance in the planning of future developments and, in particular, in deciding when and the extent to which 4th generation computer equipment may be necessary. No proposals for the acquisition or location of 4th generation computers in the Dublin colleges have yet been formulated.</P>

      <P>The legal position is that the Benchers of The Honourable Society of Kings Inns are at liberty <Col N="1364" /> to dispose of books from their library within the provisions of the Documents and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Act, 1945, and, in the circumstances, I am not satisfied that any useful purpose would be served at present by entering into discussions with the Benchers in the matter.  As I indicated on an earlier occasion, the terms of the Act are being reviewed for the purpose of ascertaining whether amending legislation may be necessary or desirable.</P>
      <P>I may mention that at the forthcoming sale of the books in question the National Library proposes to seek to acquire one item which is not already in its possession.</P>

      <P>In addition some 55 more text books in Irish are at present at various stages of printing, translation or preparation.</P>

The improved services came into operation on Wednesday, 8th November, and will resolve the problem to which the Deputy refers.</P>

The prices now being received by Irish milk producers are at record levels, the creamery milk intake this year will be by far the highest ever, and a greater volume and range of processed dairy products are being turned out by an increased number of processing plants. The achievement of this satisfactory position has been greatly helped by the restructuring of the creamery milk price support arrangements which I effected last December and by the encouragement that I have given, and continue to give, to creamery rationalisation and to the expansion of milk processing facilities.</P>

      <P>Assuming the Community agree on accepting a common scheme, it is unlikely that the shape of that scheme would be the same as the beef cattle incentive scheme as we know it.  There is one proposal that approximates to the old in-calf heifer scheme of some years ago but nothing has been agreed as yet.  I should say, of course, that the situation as far as the beef incentive scheme for the coming year is concerned is that that would go ahead because the cows that are in that scheme are already in calf.</P>

There is nothing compulsory or obligatory implied in the arrangement at all. It is a means by which, let us say, an elderly farmer who is not really able to work his land efficiently any more can be induced to allow the use of his land by somebody else by offering him the attraction of a pension.</P>

      <P>The draft regulations (C. 68, 28.6. 1972) have since been adopted by the Community.  They lay down general rules for the granting and financing of producer aids in the seeds sector.

One of the draft directives under 59, 8.6. 1972, which has since been adopted by the Community includes amendments to existing provisions for the granting of equivalence with EEC certified seed to certified seed of third country origin.

      <P>EEC requirements in relation to producer groups in the horticultural sector have been discussed with the producer interests concerned by whom action for the formation of groups falls to be taken.  Grants are available from my Department.  The formation of a promotional body is also a matter for action by these interests and I have always favoured this.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell us if any applications for grants for the setting-up of producer groups have <Col N="1399" /> been received and if any money has been paid out?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is comparing things that are not similar. It rests with the horticultural industry itself to form these producer groups.  It is the best way and it is the way in which EEC regulations will be best complied with.  I do not think it would be appropriate at this stage to introduce some kind of State-sponsored producer group.  I do not think it would accord with EEC regulations.  The other body the Deputy referred to was in existence at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the situation with regard to applications for grants or the payment of such grants.  However, I think it remains to the industry to form this group and I attempted to explain that.  In the case of CBF, the farming organisations asked that a beef promotion body be set up by the Government.  I do not think it would be appropriate on the eve of our entry into the EEC to take a similar line with regard to horticultural products.  It would be more in conformity with the concept of the EEC for the industry to form producer groups.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that is so.  Since the horticultural industry <Col N="1400" /> is of a relatively small size&mdash;I do not say relatively small importance&mdash;it is not unreasonable to say that it should be an easily attainable objective to form a producer group.</P>

      <P>No application for such aid has so far been received. Horticultural producer groups do not receive grants direct from EEC but member countries may give them financial assistance during the first three years of their establishment and receive recoupment of up to 50 per cent of the aid given from EEC funds.  It is understood that producers in different horticultural sectors are taking steps to organise groups and that applications for grant aid under the present scheme are likely to be made in due course.</P>

      <P>The meeting in Luxembourg on 31st October of the Agricultural Ministers of the six member states of the Community and the three acceding states was devoted primarily to consideration of proposals relating to fruit and vegetables, and beef.</P>
      <P>In the case of fruit and vegetables the proposals related mainly to the system of fixing basic and buying-in prices for the principal products, the arrangements for intervention by producer groups and member states, and the arrangements for regulating imports for third countries.  They also covered the extension and modification of the existing arrangements for subsidies for grubbing-up fruit trees. The proposals were generally acceptable from our point of view but I sought to have the proposal relating to grubbing-up subsidies extended so that the new member states could benefit from them in the case of apple trees.  This is to be further considered by the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal proposals on beef related to measures designed to increase beef production.  These included a premium or grant for once-calved <Col N="1406" /> heifers sent for slaughter, a grant on calves sired by beef bulls, and a grant for certain milk producers who switch to beef production.  I indicated that we had no objection in principle to these proposals but that in order to achieve a significant and lasting expansion in beef production something more would be necessary&mdash;for example, a grant in respect of increases in beef breeding herds.  No final conclusions on these various proposals were reached at the meeting, or at a later meeting of the six Ministers of the existing Community, and the whole matter is to be further considered.</P>
    <P>Other proposals in regard to beef which were considered at the meeting of the nine Ministers related to the amount of grant to be paid in respect of beef and sheepmeat production on certain development farms under the Community's farm modernisation directive, to strengthening the beef intervention system, and to changes in the arrangements for imports from third countries.  I supported the proposal for strengthening the intervention system, which was adopted.  However, I opposed the making of any arrangements for imports from third countries which would extend beyond 1st February next until the detailed arrangements to apply to trade within the enlarged Community as from that date had first been settled.</P>
    <P>This question of imports from third countries was considered further at a subsequent joint meeting of the Agriculture and Finance Ministers of the Nine on the agricultural aspects of proposals for action against inflation. It was decided at the joint meeting that until 1st February the duties on imports of cattle and beef from third countries would be halved and the reduced duties currently applicable to imports of calves and veal would be suspended entirely.  New arrangements to apply from 1st February will be decided by that date by the enlarged Community.  This is a very satisfactory outcome from our point of view as it enables us to benefit from the duty reductions until 1st February and we will be participating as a full member in the decision on the arrangements to apply from that date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> Other decisions taken at the joint meeting were that measures should be taken to encourage Community beef production, that quantitative restrictions on imports of potatoes into the Community should be suspended from mid-November to mid-February, and that decisions regarding export restitutions for agricultural products should be the subject of special vigilance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister's reply was very long I should like to ask one supplementary, with your indulgence. Is the Minister aware that the reduction in the levy which was decided on at this meeting was a matter of great importance to the beef market, and that the fact that he did not make a public statement on this matter on his return from the meeting meant that certain speculators who had privileged information were able to get beef for less than they should have got it, for less than the real value?  Would he agree to make an early statement on these matters so that people with privileged information will not be at an advantage over ordinary Irish farmers who are relying on statements from the Minister and his Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of certain privileged people taking advantage of the agreement reached in Luxembourg but I am aware that decisions reached in Luxembourg were given wide publicity in the international press.  I do not think I failed in any way in reporting to the proper channels.</P>
