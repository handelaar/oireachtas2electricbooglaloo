      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1 :</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>1.  Before section 1 a new section inserted as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.  (1)  A marriage solemnised between persons either of whom is under the age of sixteen shall, subject to the next subsection, not be valid in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply where exemption <Col N="1572" /> from it has been obtained before the marriage from the President of the High Court (or a Judge of that Court nominated by the President thereof).</P>
    <P>(3)  The following provisions shall have effect in relation to an application under subsection (2) of this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it may be made by or on behalf of either party to the intended marriage and without the intervention of a next friend,</P>
    <P>(b)  it may be made informally through the Registrar of Wards of Court in accordance with rules of procedure directed by the President of the High Court,</P>
    <P>(c)  it may be heard and determined in private,</P>
    <P>(d)  it shall not be granted unless the applicant shows that its grant is justified by serious reasons and is in the interests of the parties to the intended marriage,</P>
    <P>(e)  no court fee shall be charged in respect of it, and</P>
    <P>(f)  no further application in respect of the marriage may be made under that subsection.</P>
    <P>(4)  Any person to whom application is made in relation to the solemnisation of an intended marriage may, if he so thinks fit, request the production of evidence of age with respect to both parties or either party.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where a request is made under subsection (4) of this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  refusal or failure to comply with the request shall be proper reason for refusal of the application,</P>
    <P>(b)  if the request is complied with and the evidence shows that both parties or either party are or is under the age of sixteen, the application shall be refused unless the evidence is accompanied by the appropriate exemption under subsection (2) of this section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> (6)  Where a person knowingly&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  solemnises or permits the solemnisation of a marriage which, consequent on the provisions of this section, is not valid in law, or</P>
    <P>(b)  is a party to such a marriage,</P>
    <P>such person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds.</P>
    <P>(7)  Where a marriage would not be regarded as valid in law unless an exemption under subsection (2) of this section in respect of it has been granted, it shall not be registered save on production, to the person effecting the registration, of such exemption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In connection with the debate in the Seanad I altered section 1 of the Bill to provide that any person under 16 contemplating marriage will have to have consent of the courts and I secured the agreement of the Roman Catholic religious authority for this. As I explained in the Dáil, there have been some differences of opinion.  The other religious denominations were anxious that this matter should be left to the courts.  In view of what was said in the Seanad I decided to make a change.  It is now agreeable to all religious authorities.  I want to state in this connection that if the courts give consent to the marriage of persons under 16 years it will still be open to the religious authorities to agree or to refuse to marry them.  The process of the marriage ceremony is entirely left in their hands except where the persons concerned apply to the Registrar of Marriages.  The amended section has now in effect been agreed by everybody.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Donegan).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I dealt with some of the more general aspects of industry and commerce.  This morning I would like to deal with particular aspects.  The first aspect I would like to deal with is the question of the woollen industry.  The Atkins Report is in the hands of the trade unions and of the people in the woollen industry. It is probably available to 100 people in the country but the Minister has refused to give it to Deputies.  I understand that there are many occasions when it is better not to circulate material which might have a bad effect on an industry or on the employment therein.</P>
      <P>I suggested to the Minister at least four weeks ago that if he did not want to give the Atkins Report generally to people and to the whole House he could issue it to certain Deputies if they asked for it, and if they took it on the basis that it was for their own information and for their help, and if it would put them in a position of knowing exactly what the situation was.  Since then the Minister has not given me a copy.  Various people have got the report, but Members of this side of the House and members of the Labour Party who might wish to have the report have not got it unless we got it from certain trade unions or people involved in the industry on the basis that it was being given to us as private individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> Deputies should be treated in a responsible way.  Information should be available from Departments and from Ministers to help Deputies to do their job.  The Minister is quite wrong in not making the Atkins Report available to Members of this House.</P>
    <P>From 1962, when the NIEC indicated that there was trouble in the woollen industry, the Government and the Minister did nothing at all to help. Over a long period of years nothing was done to help this highly sensitive industry.  It is quite a while since it was decided that we were to enter the EEC.  It is quite a while since the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement was signed.  Things could have been done which would have helped to avoid the redundancies which are now taking place.  We must face up to the situation now.</P>
    <P>Last week in a discussion on the Imposition of Duties Bill the Minister informed us that extra tariffs were imposed.  They will give some help to the industry.  This has been done too late.  Rationalisation of the industry would have been much more important.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the main points of the Estimate last night but I just wanted to make that point in relation to the woollen industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was difficult to follow the drift of some of the remarks made last night.  The points which should have been dealt with, both by the Minister and the spokesman for Fine Gael, seemed to have been overlooked. I do not know if it is recognised by the Government or not but the main talking point in the country at present is the questions of prices. Deputy Donegan complimented the Minister on the introduction of the Prices Bill, 1972.  In fact, there were two successive Prices Bills, subsequent to which the Minister for Finance said it was impossible to control prices. Either the Minister for Industry and Commerce was codding the House or the Minister for Finance did not know what he was talking about.  I would say that the truth lies in what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, said because so far there does not appear to have been any attempt to <Col N="1578" /> control prices.  The prices spiral which had already begun gained impetus with the introduction of decimalisation.  We were assured that there would be no undue increase in prices as a result of decimalisation.  We know what happened. Prices went mad.</P>
      <P>An amusing comment was made during the week that the new halfpenny is being phased out.  The new halfpenny is as dead as the farthing was before the new halfpenny was introduced.  People will not accept a new halfptnny in change.  One finds new halfpennies on the floor in supermarkets and on the streets.  Even the children will not pick them up, they are of such little value.  The new penny is now being phased out.  It was suggested recently that the only useful purpose for which the new penny could be used was as a marker on a golf course green.  Not alone is the smallest coin of no value but the usefulness of the second smallest coin is disappearing.</P>
      <P>The Minister must seriously consider what is happening in regard to prices.  I asked a supplementary question yesterday about the list of commodities a shopkeeper must display. One finds in a shop a price list for about four or five items whereas there may be 100 items on sale.  In effect, there is no price control except on a very limited range of goods and even in respect of those items the price varies from shop to shop.</P>
      <P>Inspectors visit certain shops weekly and examine shelf prices.  I understand that it is sufficient to inform the inspector that the supplier has increased the cost of the retailer and the inspector says that is fair enough.  That is not price surveillance.  There should be very tight control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may not view this matter in the way I do.  He has experience of retail sales but he has no experience of shopping with a very limited amount of money for the necessaries of life for a family.  People who can afford to buy only the bare necessaries of life find themselves increasingly unable to do even that because of price increases.  Having regard to all the talk about our being an affluent society, is it not a reflection on every one of us that there are so many <Col N="1579" /> people who have to count their few shillings and find that they have not sufficient to buy what they need?  It is too bad that people have to fall back on charitable organisations for the necessaries of life.  For this I lay the blame fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Minister responsible for the Department.  The Minister being a decent man would not wish that this situation should continue.  Opposition Members have no power in this matter. The Minister has the power.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions agreed, for the second time in succession, to accept a series of wage increases, negotiated on the basis that they would cover the cost of living at the time of the negotiation, not taking into account what the State takes in income tax, increased cost of insurance stamps and so on.  It is not fair that workers should be asked to continue to accept restrictions if the cost of consumer goods is allowed to increase without control.  Those who have to do the shopping tell me that every time they go into the store a whole range of articles have been increased in price.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in particular in regard to which I would ask the Minister to give me a reply today or, if he does not get the opportunity to reply to the debate today, to write to me on the subject.  Does the Minister know what the situation is in regard to coal prices?  Polish and German coal is being imported.  It is almost impossible to buy English coal.  The price being charged is the price for English coal. Is the Minister aware that while he sanctioned two price increases for coal in the last 12 months, there was a third price increase imposed without reference to him and that this has been allowed to be charged and that the increases he sanctioned have been added?</P>
    <P>The price of coal affects the very poor who buy coal in small quantities. In rural areas people can buy turf or briquettes but in the towns they buy coal.  Not everybody has central heating or electrical heating.  I am reliably informed that a very inferior type of coal is being foisted on people at a highly inflated price.  I would ask the Minister to have the matter investigated <Col N="1580" /> and to let me know the result.  I am not an expert in this matter.  I can only repeat what I have been told but my informants are reliable and I would take their statements as being factual.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the prospect of redundancies reaching 11,000 by the end of next March.  I do not want to introduce sentiment into the debate but the fact cannot be ignored that people are now finding themselves out of employment, people who believed that their employment was guaranteed for their working life.  A few years ago there was a substantial floating population of casual workers.  These were people who did not have a constant job and who worked for a month, a year or a couple of years in one job and drifted on to another when that was finished.  Now a high proportion of our work force are being put in the position of casual workers.  I passed the Gardiner Street employment exchange this morning.  It would make one weep to see the line-up of able-bodied men who are going there not because they want to go but because if they do not go they do not get money to buy food for themselves and their families.  It seems to be accepted that it is all right to have lost 11,000 jobs, that things will be better later on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan was very hopeful last night.  He thought that in a couple of years' time the country would be great.  He did not seem to worry&mdash; perhaps I am being unfair to him&mdash; about what will happen to the people who will become redundant before this great day arrives.  I know that over the last few years particularly, the number of people who have lost their jobs have come mainly from agriculture.  I noted that when the Minister for Labour was introducing a pay-related social welfare scheme he deliberately excluded agricultural workers for that very reason.  It does not matter whether they come from agriculture or from a factory that has closed, it seems to be accepted by the Government that we are not able to catch up on a number of jobs that are being lost and for many years to come we will have a large number of people who will be unable to find regular employment.</P>
    <P>I know the absolute despair of a <Col N="1581" /> workman who finds that the job he thought was there for him for as long as he could work is gone and that he must go home to his wife and family with a few pounds which will last for that week.  If he has, as so many young people do at present, built a house and is paying an annuity on it or is paying a high rent or has bought a car to travel to work or has bought many items on HP the Minister must understand how he feels when he finds he can no longer pay for those things. The first thing that strikes him is that from then on somebody else owns everything he has been building up over the years.  He may find that the &ldquo;gripper&rdquo;, as we called him, will come along.  He may be sued for nonpayment on his car or on his house unless he can find alternative employment. The Minister in his brief offers no prospect of alternative employment. This is what I find fault with more than anything else.  Apparently the aim of full employment is no longer one which should be talked about because the Government do not believe it is attainable.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Donegan last night talking about the necessity to accept that this is a private enterprise society and that anybody who suggests that things should be dealt with in any other way is wrong.  I do not think he knows the facts. There is more State ownership in this country than in any other country I know of outside Russia.  That should go on record.  I still think there is not enough public ownership, which may be a slightly different thing, because industries are closing down which could be saved.  I mentioned here last year an industry which closed down in my constituency throwing 145 people out of work. The loss to the State was estimated in the first year, apart from the loss of production and the upset to the people concerned, to be somewhere in the region of £¼ million.  Yet nobody had done a cost benefit analysis to find out whether or not the £60,000 which the owner had suggested might be made available should be made available to keep those people in employment. Subsequently another factory <Col N="1582" /> with 43 people closed down.  The workers decided they would not take it.  They took over and they are now running the factory and making money on it.  If anybody wants to know how Irish industry can be saved they should take a look at the Crannac furniture factory in Navan where workers are working for themselves, turning out a first-class product, exporting most of what they produce and proving, in spite of all the statements of people who thought they knew, that that factory can survive and that factories such as that can be saved if the right action is taken.</P>
    <P>When this factory got into trouble I went to the Minister and he was very helpful.  He and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, arranged discussions with officials from the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce. Eventually Fóir Teoranta agreed to consider giving assistance by way of loan.  I took the owner of that factory to Fóir Teoranta who made an offer of a very substantial sum for the purpose of saving the industry. The offer was not taken up. When I took the workers there I was told that money was the biggest objection. Although discussions in regard to the availability of that money were held in June and subsequently early in July and a definite promise of a sum was made in July, it is now mid-December and that money is only now trickling through.  If Fóir Teoranta is Rescue Limited, Fóir Teoranta would not rescue very many if they were involved in a sea drama.  They will not rescue many industries if their attitude is to sit down and think it over.  The people involved cannot sit down and think it over.  They must take a decision. If people are put into well-paid jobs, and I believe they should be well paid, to make quick decisions they should take those decisions and they should not put them on the long finger.  It is not right for somebody in a good job to go home on Friday at 5 o'clock, not worry and pick up the threads on Monday morning.  The time to deal with those things is when the firm is in trouble.  Fóir Teoranta can do an excellent job and in this case did succeed in putting up this <Col N="1583" /> money, very belatedly, to prevent the factory from closing but they will have to move faster if they are to do the job for which they were set up by this House.  It will not do for months to pass by.  Do not forget that the men themselves put £200 each which was given to them as redundancy payment into that firm.  That is a lot of money to an unemployed man who has been earning about £20 a week.  They put that in without looking backward. They took a chance on saving the factory and saving their jobs.  It is not good enough for any State board to say: &ldquo;We must tie up this and tie up that.&rdquo;  There were legal men on both sides.  The facts were very clear and it should have been tied up immediately.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan was talking about conditions being laid down as to who should run the factory.  Possibly occasions may arise when somebody by mismanagement is allowing an industry to run down but if somebody in an office in Dublin city makes a decision according to what he merely thinks on the lines of &ldquo;Sack this fellow and everything will be all right,&rdquo; I think that is wrong.  I am not blaming the Minister for what happened in this case because he was more than helpful.  There was nothing he could do that he did not do but if there is an outfit set up to do this work, it should do it properly.</P>
    <P>As the time is very limited, it would be unfair to the Minister and the House if I were to take up time unduly but I want to refer to two other matters.  One of these has been referred to by Deputy Donegan, the mining lease in Navan.  I am particularly interested in this matter as the Minister knows because of the fact that in the main it will give very substantial employment in my constituency and in Ireland.  As the Minister well knows, the position is that originally one firm did an amount of prospecting with the Minister's blessing and discovered ore.  I honestly believe that the ideal thing would be if the State could invest money enough to discover the ore, of which there are I believe a tremendous amount of types in this country, but I am a very practical <Col N="1584" /> man and I believe it is a pipedream to suggest that the type of money required can be produced because in every case there is an element of risk, and if there is an element of risk, there is the element that if the Government invested very substantial sums they are likely to get their knuckles rapped if the project turns out to be a failure.  We had the example of St. Patrick's Copper Mines in Wicklow which is now under new management and apparently prepared to pay its way.  The price of ores goes up and down on the world markets and what is a paying proposition today may not be a paying proposition tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The original firm which prospected in Navan, found the mine and purchased most of the land around it.  They did, in fact, apply for a mining licence and then somebody else came in.  I described it here before as the nearest thing I could think of to the old claim-jumping acts carried out when mining started a century ago.  They got possession of a portion of land and the position is that the people who found the original mine and were anxious to get into mining production have applied to the Minister for a licence, and while the decision to give or not to give the licence is being considered, a tremendous amount of money is tied up and a tremendous amount of money is being spent which could otherwise be spent on developing the mine.  Every day that passes very substantial amounts of money are being lost by what I will call the parent company because of what is happening.</P>
    <P>If the State could do it, it would be the ideal thing but I do not believe the State can do it, and, therefore, what the State should do is to make every effort to get a reputable company working mines and get a fairly substantial royalty from them.  As has been proved by the mines already in operation, the State can get a substantial royalty and the Minister says he proposes to increase the amount of royalty.  That is a matter for the experts and I do not propose to comment on it, but I honestly believe that it is a stupid decision that because a case has been taken against the Minister in relation to a very small portion of the mine field many months ago and a judge decided that he would give a decision before <Col N="1585" /> the end of August, that decision not having been given yet, the Minister says he can do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>I believe that in this case the Minister has clean hands.  What he has done has been perfectly above board but what I cannot understand is why he should have to wait because I believe that the portion in dispute&mdash;and 95 per cent of the area is not in dispute&mdash; is, in fact, so small that it is not a viable mine anyway.  It could not possibly be worked on its own and no matter what way the decision is given, the people working the mine will ultimately be the company to whom the Minister has said he intends eventually when the arrangements are made to give the licence.  Would it be that the committee from which the Minister is awaiting a report on the type of royalties to be collected has not made a report?  Would that be part of the reason the licence has not been given rather than a matter of waiting for a court case?  It appears to me that this must be the position and if it is the Minister has his own way of dealing with it.  He should get the matter in. He will be dealing with businessmen who know their field and will fight their corner very hard, as I am sure will the Minister's officials, and a reasonable arrangement can be made.</P>
    <P>My main concern is that while this is happening there is a high incidence of unemployment in that area.  There is a prospect of up to 500 jobs being created and I do not want to see them created in ten years time.  I want to see them created now.  Deputy Donegan referred to what is happening with regard to Drogheda port and inferred that he knew a lot more about it than I do.  Maybe he does.  I do not propose to comment on what he knows or does not know, but I do know that Drogheda Harbour Board very nearly lost the export of the ore from the mine by the fact that they just did not do what they should have done.  If Deputy Donegan is a member of the Harbour Board, he should have taken his part as a business man.  He should have been leading in having the matter dealt with.  It was only when the company took over and bought the land that any progress was made.  Unless there is to <Col N="1586" /> be some arrangement made, and pretty quickly, it is ridiculous to suggest, as has been suggested, that a couple of million pounds should be spent in building a new harbour at Mornington. I welcome the idea of a new harbour at the mouth of the Boyne.  It will give a new lease of life to Drogheda and the surrounding area, including most of County Meath, but it is just not good enough that the matter should be brushed to one side to await the decision of a judge who for one reason or another has not found it possible from August to December to give a decision on what would appear to the normal person to be a very simple matter.  A judge gives a ruling on what he considers to be the law, on the facts of the case as the law governs them, and in this case the Minister knows as I do what the decision should be.  There is no doubt at all about it and for that reason I feel that delaying it any longer is very ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the erection of a smelter.  I know that an application has been made by an individual to erect some type of plant at the mouth of the Boyne.  He says he is going to import ores from Africa which he will refine and re-export, employing 40 men and, he says, going up to 400.  The Minister and I both know that the only reason that could be given for erecting that type of plant at the mouth of the Boyne is that it would be directly on the line of export of the product of the mine at Navan. If somebody wants to make a quick buck out of this he should not be allowed to make it, and while I, like Deputy Donegan, would very much like to see a smelter erected in this country which would take not alone the product of the Navan mine but of all the other mines so that we could get the real cream, it must be remembered that the cost of such a smelter would probably run somewhere between £50 million and £100 million.  Somebody suggested that the State should put that money up but I do not know where the State is going to find it.  I do not know of any company at the moment that could produce that kind of money.  There has been talk about redundancies running at the rate of 11,000 and I would appeal to the Minister to give the <Col N="1587" /> people concerned some hope of obtaining a job.  Ultimately there will be at least 500 jobs available in the mines at Navan.</P>
    <P>In the case of one mine, nothing has been sold because of some technical details.  The firm that is associated with the Navan firm have been paying the wages of a fairly substantial labour force for a long time.  If there are two leaks in a bucket from which water is pouring out and if no water is put in, very soon you will have an empty bucket.  I should hate to see a promising mine such as that in Navan being abandoned because someone cannot make up his mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about AnCO training.  The Minister could do a good job if, in conjunction with the mining company, he would arrange for a training school for people who would be engaged in mining in that area.  There is a very bright future for the young and the not so young who could be trained to work in the mines.  There will be good technical jobs available and I should like to see the local people employed.  The board of the Tara Mining Company are 100 per cent Irish and I am sure they would give their full co-operation to such a scheme.  I would ask the Minister to consider this and see if something could be done about this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department could be debated here for a long time.  In theory, many millions of pounds must be passed by this House before 5 p.m. today and I do not want to delay the House unduly.  However, it would be unfair if we did not refer to the fact that there are 75,000 people unemployed and that there will possibly be 11,000 more redundant before the end of March. There is not a hope in the world of achieving the extra 55,000 jobs between 1973 and 1977 to which the Minister referred.  In fact, he said we would have to step up the number of extra jobs but I do not know what he meant by that because we are losing ground as it is.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Donegan spoke about worker participation in industry and it appeared he was opposed to this.  He referred to what is happening <Col N="1588" /> in Denmark where a certain percentage is put by each year for the workers. According to the Deputy's reasoning last night in a very short time the workers would own the factory and he was not prepared to agree to this.  Deputy Donegan is a decent man, he is a good employer and has an interest in his constituents, including his own workers and other workers in the area. However, anyone who thinks in 1972 that worker participation in industry is not coming fast does not know what he is talking about.  It does not matter if it comes under the heading of profit sharing or if it is a share in the actual value and work of the factory.  The State could help in this; if they put workers from the shop floor on the management teams in the State industries it would set a headline that would be followed elsewhere.  Putting a senior trade union official on the board&mdash;I am not objecting to that because it seems to be the only thing we can get now&mdash;is not the same thing as putting a worker on the board.</P>
    <P>In connection with this matter, I should like to quote the example of Crannac.  Many people said that it was impossible for a group of workers to run a factory because they would know nothing about it.  What happened was the lorry driver became a salesman because he knew where orders could be found; the man who had been working under supervision was able to point out to his colleagues where losses were occuring.  The previous employer would not listen to a suggestion made by a worker about how to deal with any matter because it was not regarded as the worker's business.  In many industries there could be a substantial improvement in output and a considerable reduction in costs if the Government would set the headline by insisting on worker participation in State industries and if they would encourage private enterprise to introduce it. Worker participation has started and before long it will be the accepted thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that in the EEC we will face intensive competition, if not in 1973 most certainly in 1974.  As time goes on we will find that a large number of industries in <Col N="1589" /> Europe who need that little extra area to dispose of their products will find that Ireland&mdash;a little corner about which they had thought little&mdash;has a population of four million customers. We have evidence that people will buy what is the cheapest and the best and this is one of the reasons why the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign seems to have failed.  There are those who think that because an article comes from abroad automatically it is better.  Continental firms will send their goods here and there is nothing we can do about it; bit by bit they will take over the Irish market.  It would be a good idea for the Minister to set up another commission to investigate the areas where we are importing completely and not making any effort to supply the home market.  If private enterprise is not prepared to invest, it is the responsibility of the State to do so by supplying at a fair price what the people want.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign is only being whispered about now.  Even the State will not stipulate Irish materials for State-owned buildings and in the case of grants there is no stipulation about Irish materials.  In a short time the emphasis will be on European materials and the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign will no longer be a protection, if it ever was a protection.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister is doing his best but it is necessary for him to look at his Department and see if the stage has been reached at which he should be able to think of new ideas and things which should be done which are not being done.  That is the responsibility of the Minister.  It is not enough for him to produce a 30 or 35 page brief, an excellent brief as far as it goes, but a brief which did not deal with the things a Minister in his position should have attempted to cover in this debate.  No matter who produced the brief, I give the Minister credit for editing it.  I am quite sure it contains his ideas.</P>
    <P>If we were in a situation in which prices were not rising I would expect the Minister to say very little about prices but, in our present situation, at least one-third of his brief should have been devoted to prices and to <Col N="1590" /> telling us exactly what the Government think should be done about them.</P>
    <P>If redundancy was not such a headache the Minister might get over the problem with just a passing reference but, with the scale of redundancies what it is, it was not enough for the Minister to devote a couple of paragraphs to telling us that there would be another 11,000 people out of work at the end of next March.  That is not good enough.  There should be some master plan on how the problem should be dealt with.  There was a time when we talked about the First Programme for Economic Expansion, which, incidentally, was not a bad one, and the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, which was very quickly forgotten, and the Third Programme; someone asked recently in relation to the latter if, when it was finished, we would have a Fourth Programme.  We all of us realise now that this thing of attempting to write down the impossible and expect people to read and accept it is so much old hat.  The days when that kind of thing could be done are gone.</P>
    <P>The time has come now when the Minister and his officials&mdash;a fairly intelligent group of people&mdash;must sit down and decide in what way he and they can ensure that those things which are going wrong can be rectified. I have attempted to point out a few of the things that could be pretty easily rectified.  I do not expect the Minister to shovel money into enterprises which quite obviously will never be a success.  The Minister will have to carry out a cost/benefit analysis of every substantial industry which appears to be running into trouble to see whether or not it would be cheaper, and better for the country, to allow the industry to go to the wall. Unless the Minister does this, he is not doing his job properly.</P>
    <P>He should also be able to find out whether there is massive duplication of production and attempt to channel such production into other fields of activity.  The word &ldquo;rationalise&rdquo; has become an in word.  Rationalisation is ideal but it must always be remembered that, when one talks about rationalisation, right up in the No. 1 <Col N="1591" /> place for consideration must be the people depending for their livelihoods on the particular industry.  It is no comfort to anyone to see a very successful industry closing down and, at the same time, the State paying out by way of benefit of one kind or another large sums to people who would much prefer to be working.  If portion of that money were given by way of grant or loan to the industry it might put the industry in the position of being able to keep going.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am being hypercritical. Perhaps the hurler on the ditch can see things which are not apparent to the players on the field.  The Minister and his officials have always been very courteous to me.  Admittedly, I do not bother them very much, but I think I should put that on record because we get that kind of courtesy all too rarely.  My real criticism is that there will have to be a fresh approach to the job the Minister is doing and that fresh approach must come quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important Departments in this State.  We are shattered at the amount of redundancies, lay-offs and closures, and the numbers made idle in the last 12 months.  The figure is running over 70,000 now.  Because of increased mechanisation on the land there is, as there is elsewhere, a drift from the land.  About 11,000 or 12,000 people have left the land every year for some time past.  These move into the cities and towns and it is up to us to take steps to ensure that there are jobs available for them.  We have been so far unable to do this, despite our best efforts, and the efforts of the IDA have been extremely good.  There is a lot to be said for giving them freedom. I should like to see the regional offices having more autonomy to enable them to gear themselves to the local scene better than they are able to do at the moment.  It is up to us to forecast the numbers who will be leaving the land and looking for jobs in industry in the years ahead.  We have not been able to provide sufficient jobs to take up the slack.  There will have to be a bigger capital investment in and more money made available by <Col N="1592" /> way of grants and loans to industry to ensure the creation of more jobs.</P>
      <P>The IDA have been successful.  We must understand the position in which they found themselves in the last 18 months to two years before the decision was taken to go into Europe.  There was naturally a reluctance on the part of industrialists to sink their fortunes in the Irish economy.  All this has now changed and in the next few years many people outside the Nine will want to come in here, set up industry and thereby provide employment for our people.  Now the most important function of any Government is to see that work is available for people at proper rates of pay and to ensure that the work is not of such a nature or remunerated in such a way that the standard of living will be lower for our nationals than it is for the nationals where the parent industry is situated. For many years, there has been a feeling amongst Irish school leavers and others that far off hills are green and that life in England and wages are better.</P>
      <P>Now that we have caught up we will find that many of our workers will prefer to remain here.  Most people prefer to remain in their own country and this applies to Irish workers too. Emigration has been described as a safety valve.  Because of emigration the Government did not have to provide as many jobs as they would have had to provide otherwise.  This position has now changed and all the energies of the Government should be concentrated in the next few years on providing work and providing it, if possible, where the people are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tremendously heavy concentration of people and industries in Dublin.  I can understand manufacturers of consumer goods wanting to establish industries in Dublin, or as near to Dublin as possible.  I suppose one half of the population lives within 50 miles of where I am standing now. Naturally, a manufacturer of consumer goods is concerned about his distribution costs and he will want to establish his industry in Dublin.  I believe the availability of the market on his doorstep may be out weighed in the future by the environment in which people <Col N="1593" /> live, and by the quality of life, which I think are becoming increasingly important to workers.  In Germany I saw small successful factories established in lovely surroundings 50, 60 or 100 miles from big cities.  They are placed there deliberately because the workers do not want to live in big over-crowded cities.  For their children they want something more than life in a flat 15 storeys up and a day which begins at 6 a.m. and ends at 7 p.m.  They want a better quality of life.</P>
    <P>This may not develop here this year or next year but, in time, workers in Ireland will not want to live in places like Dublin, or Cork if the prophecies about its future growth are correct. Living some place where it takes you an hour to get to work, an hour to get home from work, will not be attractive particularly to people in the high-tension jobs.  We do many things extremely well in this country, and we should try to avoid the mass production industries, although they are welcome. Our resources should be concentrated on the small quality factories, the craft factories, which allow the skills of the workers to be availed of and to be seen to their best advantage. This is the surest market for the future.</P>
    <P>Waterford glass is a very good example of this.  The quality of the goods sells them.  There is a worldwide demand for Waterford glass.  We have many other products which should be helped.  People should be encouraged and given grants to expand businesses of this nature.</P>
    <P>I want to be parochial for a moment and refer to the Verolme Dockyard. At one time or another all the Cork Deputies have asked questions such as: &ldquo;When will the Minister for Transport and Power place an order with the Verolme Dockyard?&rdquo;  Ministers are not unwilling to give such orders but, possibly, the pressure from us comes too late, and it is too late when the Minister asks the State companies to place these orders.  Therefore, there is a gap between the placing of the order&mdash;which is, of course, very welcome to the dockyard&mdash;and the commencement of the building.  An effort should be made to see that orders for ships are given 18 months or two years in advance.  Otherwise redundancies <Col N="1594" /> become inevitable.  Once a ship is finished the company have no choice but to make people redundant unless they can start another ship immediately. They must have the order well in advance of the completion of the ship they are building.  I would ask the Minister to take this up with the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred yesterday to the insurance board.  His Department have been receiving a number of complaints about the vast increases in premiums in the past couple of years. There is a necessity for urgent action in this field.  I do not know what the board will recommend.  I heard it suggestted that it is taking them so long to make any recommendation that they must be qualified for a pension.  I do not know whether the Minister would consider giving them a pension.  Once a week, or once a day, people come to Deputies and say: &ldquo;My insurance has gone up from £16 to £118, or from £45 to £200.&rdquo;  Deputies are complaining constantly to the section of the Minister's Department which deals with this matter.  I can understand that the Minister does not want to act without making a deep study of the position and possibly listening to other views.  He should recognise that it is a matter of urgency now to see that car insurance is put on an equitable basis so that people will not feel they are being asked to pay excessive amounts.</P>
    <P>For some time I have been asking the Minister to investigate stamp trading in the distributive trades.  He is probably more familiar with the situation than I am, but I am against stamp trading.  It is an unnecessary burden on shopkeepers and housewives.  In our plan to fight inflation my party recommended recently that stamps should have a redeemable cash value: in other words, that people should be able to get cash instead of gifts.  I read somewhere that 60 per cent of the stamps are not used.  I do not know if that figure has been checked.  Many traders want to get out of stamps now but they will find it very difficult to do so.  In many of these cases the Minister could not act quickly enough.  There must be other reasons for the sanctioning of trading methods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> I have asked the Minister to look into the matter of trading stamps.  We know the 2½ per cent turnover tax is taken care of and we know that the trading stamp companies give good value, in goods, for the stamps they issue, but there is a large margin of profit in the stamps that they issue which are not surrendered.  I am afraid this situation has not been interpreted properly and I should like the Minister to make a decision on this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to Fóir Teoranta.  The Department recently investigated the amount of equity taken up by that State agency and I should like to suggest&mdash;I do not do this often in the House on occasions like this&mdash; that a small committee of the House be established to inquire into the public money being spent by Fóir Teoranta. We must appreciate that it is public money, contributed by every taxpayer in the country.  In this context I realise that there may be firms who would not like to be bandied in the House, who would not like to have their business talked about publicly, and I think that is the reason why many more concerns do not go to Fóir Teoranta.  The operations of that agency are not as simple as one would like to think.  I am not at the moment referring to the amount of money involved.  We can appreciate that an agency such as Fóir Teoranta could not have a 100 per cent successful history in the short time they have been in existence&mdash;they could not back winners all the time.  However, the occasional failure is a sign of the risk they take.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling, which I hope is not genuine, that IDA regional offices have not enough freedom of action to make money available locally.  We know they deal in millions of pounds but even in the matter of small sums applied for by local enterprises they have to apply to head office for sanction. When a local office of the IDA have a good man in charge he should be allowed a certain amount of autonomy, particularly when millions of pounds are not concerned.  As Deputy Donegan said last night, we must endeavour to invest in smaller industries, <Col N="1596" /> particularly those with their eyes on the export market.</P>
    <P>There is a point I should like to emphasise in this respect.  These smaller industries are sometimes very lacking in know-how, perhaps, not in the actual craft methods for which they may be traditionally famous, but in the matter of managerial expertise. It is in this context that the IDA should make themselves felt.  They should help as much as possible to give expert advice to small firms who would like to be export orientated. It is from exports that our greatest rewards will flow in the year to come. Therefore, the IDA should provide the managerial expertise, the grants and whatever training is available to ascertain whether a firm were ready for this form of streamlining and then in conjunction with Córas Tráchtála they should be able to move in and ensure greater efficiency in the firm and a higher standard of living in the region.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend speaking mainly from my own experience of industry with particular reference to my own town but if I should appear to bring in matters that are more relevant to other Departments, I hope the Chair will bear with me because I am concerned with the problems with which industrialists must contend in being referred from one Department to another.  If I am critical of any organisation, it is not my intention to be derogatory in any way but to make an effort to bring to light the problems facing industrialists today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The town from which I come, Killorglin, is one of the most progressive in the country.  It has three industries which provide employment for 250 people.  Each of these industries has plans for extension which will result in an increase in employment for 750 people within five years.  Male workers in the factories earn £25 per <Col N="1597" /> week to start, apprentices about £16 per week while female workers begin at that figure also.  These wages are good and are very important in that area.</P>
    <P>However, the industrialists are faced with many difficulties and one of these difficulties stems from the fact that there is no co-ordination between the various Departments in relation to industry. One of our drawbacks is that we have a telephone service that is antiquated and completely useless.  It cannot serve the private needs of the area let alone the industrial side.  This may not be the fault of the Post Office but it is an indication of how far behind we are in the provision of such necessary services, services that will be even more necessary if we are to take our place in Europe.  Membership of the EEC presents us with a great challenge. We have the ability, the energy and the technique to compete but there must be co-ordination among the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that the approach of many Departments is steeped in antiquity.  As the previous speaker said, nobody appears to be prepared to make any decision that would involve a risk.  This is the kernel of the problem.  Three or four years ago a building was erected in Killorglin for the installation of an automatic telephone exchange.  Although some machinery was installed, nothing has been done since and we are told that it may be another three or five years before we will have an automatic service there.</P>
    <P>Another problem with which we must contend is the inadequacy of the main roads from Farranfore to Killorglin and Cahirciveen which is not capable of taking the heavy traffic and particularly big lorries that use that highway.  It appears as if not enough is being done to help our industries particularly in the western area where each industry is of great importance. The people have the will and the ability to develop their own areas but we lack the services that are necessary to do so.  We are using a rail system which was designed at least a hundred years ago and which has not been improved since.  Industrialists must <Col N="1598" /> have modern means of transporting goods; otherwise advancement is seriously hampered.</P>
    <P>In my own firm in Killorglin we use cement&mdash;a basic material&mdash;but it is costing us £1.65 more per ton than it need cost.  This is because it must be brought from Limerick by rail. CIE have the monopoly in this field. When it arrives at Castleisland station it must be offloaded on to our trucks from covered wagons and we find that the workmen of today object to handling this type of heavy and rather dirty material.  If the cement gets into their clothes, they are of no further use.  CIE do not provide a forklift truck at that station or at any of their depots in Kerry.  Such equipment is absolutely necessary if we are to compete within Common Market conditions.  In our case we could bring cement from Limerick at £1.50 per ton but it costs us £1.80 per ton to bring it to Castleisland by rail and then a further 87½p to take it to Killorglin and there is a charge of 12½p per ton for damage.</P>
    <P>While this matter may be more appropriate to the Estimate for Transport and Power, I am raising it here to illustrate the heavy imposition it imposes on industry.  I suppose the blame cannot rest entirely with CIE because no effort has been made down through the years to bring them in line with modern systems.  The arrangements for our present day requirements should have been put in train ten or 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>We have advantages in this country over Europe as I was surprised to find when I was in Europe and also when industrialists from the Continent visited my town.  A pharmaceutical firm was established in Killorglin for the purpose of manufacturing two or three different products but because of the advantage of the pollution-free air on the western seaboard, they have decided to shift their entire German production to Kerry.  Nobody could foresee that we have advantages here over Europe, which can be exploited to the maximum. This firm have informed me that they hope in five years to have an export trade of £25 million.  They are about to purchase another big <Col N="1599" /> German firm which is about to close down because of pollution.  It is also intended to manufacture their product in Killorglin.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education decided to set up a community school in Killorglin but we really need a top higher technical school.  We have a total of 700 to 800 children going to the two schools in that area but we find that the technical knowledge and training for industry are not available to the degree necessary.  One of the factories in Killorglin has had to advertise in various centres in London, Liverpool and Birmingham to try to get some of the Irish technicians there to come back to Killorglin but we have not been successful.  We are now trying to get some people from Belfast. We need toolmakers, jig and tool-fitters and layturners.  The factory in Killorglin can take another 100 workmen. Our educational facilities should be directed towards providing those people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I know but I am trying to show the necessity for co-ordination. A previous speaker spoke about some type of overall body. Killorglin is a developing area but there are great hold-ups and frustrations for industrialists.  Some of our Departments are steeped in antiquity and are musty.  I am not speaking derogatorily of them as they have to follow certain lines.  I spend most of my time trying to get different things sorted out for those firms in Killorglin. We have customs difficulties and we have difficulties with all the Departments concerned with industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrialists who have set up factories in Spain and Portugal do not find the same difficulties which industrialists find here.  There seems to be more co-operation for those industrialists. If we are to develop, we must be alive to the necessity for small industries. Our young people work well. They will be able to solve the techniques of those industries if the facilities <Col N="1600" /> are made available to them.  The accent should be on specialised technical education which can be provided at a higher degree than the present system of vocational education throughout the country which was designed a number of years ago to give our young people a certain amount of education for export.  Our young people were leaving the country and we were trying to give them some training in everything.</P>
    <P>We should take a look at our county development organisations.  The time has come to have them streamlined and to have some new blood injected into this type of organisation.  They are county managers and county engineers with more than enough to do and they can only give very little time to industrial development.</P>
    <P>We have had the development of machine-cutting turf in Kerry during the past few years.  There are quite a number of private people who got machines and are turning out quantities of very good quality turf.  Development of this type will keep down imports of coal and oil but there is co-ordination necessary to expand this type of industry.  We have not found outside markets.  The turf is just sold within the Caherciveen area.  This can give very good employment.  I know of one man who has a machine and during the months of turf-cutting he employs up to 60 men.  They are all middle-aged small farmers and this type of work is very suitable for them. Our county development team and the Department of Industry and Commerce do not appreciate the value of this type of industry.  It should get help to expand. There should be co-operation from the county development teams and the Department of Industry and Commerce to help an industry like this.  There is great scope for development in the west.  If we get money from the EEC it can be devoted to drainage, to bog development and to the production of machine turf.  A body should be set up to find a market for this turf and to encourage our own people to utilise it.  It is an excellent product which could be used extensively throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In the EEC referendum campaign there was a great deal of talk about <Col N="1601" /> the damage to our industries resulting from our entry into the EEC.  Many of our industries will have to go because they are not geared and have made no effort to gear themselves to the type of competition they would have to face.  This point was brought home forcibly to me a week ago when I attended an auction in this city of a very old woodworking firm which gave good employment in other days.  This firm had gone out of business and was being sold out and the auctioneer informed us that no more than three people could go upstairs because of the danger that the place would fall down.  It is quite obvious that this firm was going to the end of the road for many years, and there will be many more firms like that.</P>
    <P>Any of the new European firms coming in here find the labour and other conditions exceptionally good and the prospects bright.  A much greater effort should be made to get more of these firms into this country. I attended a conference in Frankfurt about a fortnight ago at which 48 German industrialists congregate every year to discuss their problems among themselves and to give advice to one another.  Of those industrialists, six indicated that they were interested in coming to Ireland and at least ten more were thinking of expanding their business at some stage and would have a look at Ireland as well.  The departmental people here concerned with bringing industry into the country should have been at this conference. I got an invitation from one of the German Parliamentarians I met at Strasbourg.  I am not satisfied that an all-out effort is being made to encourage industrialists to come here, and we need those industries in the west.</P>
    <P>I would refer again to the Killorglin industry, the president of which went down there last October.  He told me they were astonished at the technical ability of the people available to them here.  I was rather worried when they came here first that they would not get the people they wanted.  The president of the company told me they had applications from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, England, Scotland, America and even Mexico for <Col N="1602" /> top positions in this firm.  He also said that not alone did they not have in Germany the abundance of the type of people available to them in Killorglin but that they do not have the people with the degrees these people had and this all augured very well for the future of the industry.  They intended to expand their industry in Killorglin and everything they had already intended to produce in Germany would be produced in Killorglin.</P>
    <P>These are advantages which nobody could anticipate when we were talking about getting into the Common Market. We have the advantage of a pollution-free area, the availability of technicians, the availability of personnel locally who have the leaving certificate and who are ready to take up the type of employment offered to them.  Those who have already been taken on in Killorglin are doing very well, and this can become true in the rest of the country as well.  We have only a short time in which to get industries in here because they are answering the big demands of the different markets.  Unless we can show them quickly how we can place them, we will lose many of them.</P>
    <P>We should try to get an extension of the period for the free taxation concession.  At the moment it is until 1990.  If it would be possible to get it extended to the year 2000, this should be done.  Firms starting from this on will take two or three years to get moving properly and, therefore, they will not have too many years left in which to enjoy this concession.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress the necessity for having some co-ordinated body which would help industrialists with the type of development needed in a particular area.  We must have roads and all the other services which would make us competitive.  A co-ordinating body must be set up to try to channel all the services necessary.</P>
    <P>By and large, the Department of Industry and Commerce are to be congratulated on what has been done.  They have been involved in the setting up of some industries.  Figures show that progress is being made and that our young <Col N="1603" /> people are doing a good job of work. They can be called industrialists in their own way.  The record set up in our exports prove that they are doing a good job.</P>
    <P>Great development is taking place in European and world markets.  There are a big number of industrialists in Europe who would be interested in coming here.  We are not meeting enough industrialists to whom we could show that it would be to their interest to set up industries here.  Many industrialists would come if we encouraged them.  I have met some myself and they have told me that they set up factories in parts of Germany where they had to compete for the labour available, but that if they had known of the advantages here they would have set up their factories here instead.</P>
    <P>Whatever success has been achieved it has been achieved by approaching the secretaries of chambers of commerce and getting them to circularise their members who might be interested in coming here.  Much more could be done.  The Departments concerned should circularise all the chambers of commerce.  I have spoken with a number of people who were interested in coming here.  The whole question should be carefully examined.  We have a great future industrially.  We need the work the industrialists can provide for us, in particular on the west coast.  We have an energetic and intelligent people who are looking for the right to stay in their own areas.  The new year of 1973 will be one of challenge.  It is for ourselves to decide whether we are capable of accepting that challenge and using it to our best advantage.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking in a derogatory sense but trying to show the importance of what I have seen on my trips to Europe.  Co-ordination is necessary.  If the Department do their job well this would help.  As soon as one problem disappears another one appears.  Co-operation is necessary.  All Departments should co-ordinate their efforts to make things easier for the people who are so important to us nationally and to the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>My remarks may be in the form of a valedictory address <Col N="1604" /> to the departing Minister who is on his way to another post.  There is no need to detain him here today.  I would not like anything I say now to be taken as criticism by the Minister because when a man is leaving a particular job that is not the time to indict him too heavily.  We all know the feeling of a man on transfer.  We know the emotions that well up in a person at such a time and the regrets he may feel about decisions not made and muddles which have been lived through.  These are the things which go through anyone's mind at a moment like this.  I hope the Minister will not take personally the remarks I have to make.  In any case, I feel sorry for the Minister because he is not more incompetent than many other members of the Cabinet.  He has much the same degree of competence as his colleagues in that Cabinet.  It is not exactly a star-studded cast surrounding the major constellation, the Taoiseach.  The members of the Cabinet all orbit around that central planet, warmed by that central sun, and they survive as a Cabinet together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I will re-enter your atmosphere in two seconds.  In that setting the Minister is of much the same competence, or incompetence, depending on one's viewpoint, as the other members of the Cabinet.  He should not be the subject of greater blame than anybody else in that Cabinet.  He had bad luck during the year.  He was blamed for the increase in prices while his colleague, the Minister for Finance, if the truth were told, was more responsible for the spiralling prices than the unfortunate Minister for Industry and Commerce who merely carried on in the way the Department had been carried on for a number of years past. The introduction of VAT was the greatest single ingredient in the rising prices.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was abroad at that time. He is a man who has visited a number of continents of the earth in search of industry over the past few years. <Col N="1605" /> He has been tireless in his travels. I would almost congratulate him in that connection for the energy he has displayed for seeing distant places and talking, through interpreters, to get people to come to the Emerald Isle to set up industries in different parts of the country.</P>
      <P>On the prices front, the position is that the Minister for Finance brought in VAT without much preparation and did not give sufficient forward signals to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who was unprepared, even though prices are the responsibility of his Department.  About a year ago I met the Minister for Industry and Commerce on a television programme. We discussed prices and spoke about what was then the very recent report of the Prices Commission.  It was the first or second report of the commission.  There was talk of setting up local vigilance structures to supervise price increases as they occurred. In the Prices Commission report mention had been made of the desirability of more consumer protection.  Legislation to provide consumer protection is promised.  There is a question on today's Order Paper in regard to it.  One wonders why during that period the Minister did not introduce adequate consumer protection.  The phenomenal increases in prices which have occurred especially in the last six months, give us a position at the top of the league in Europe in that respect.  The Minister over all that period did not introduce adequate consumer protection.  He ignored the pleas of those of us who advocated it.  I recall that on that television programme I made the point that the television station should be involved in broadcasting a weekly programme calculated to assist housewives in alerting them to price increases as they occurred.  The Minister supported that suggestion.  Nothing was done about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and more than <i>Home Truths.</i>  They went on to bigger and better things, which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs could tell you about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for <Col N="1606" /> Industry and Commerce.  He is of a competence with his colleagues.  He had not as many excuses as the others.  He could not, like the Minister for Justice, have pleaded that he required special laws as a reason why he could not do anything.  The unfortunate Minister for Industry and Commerce was just looking after his usual brief.  He did his best in the circumstances.  He did not display awareness of possible dangers on the prices front.  His colleagues are to blame for not warning him of the results of their actions.  The Minister for Finance is almost in the guise of Mac the Knife.  He stabbed and disappeared and went around the corner very rapidly leaving no evidence of his passing but the corpse represented by rising prices.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was on the scene of the crime and had to take the rap.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce adopted the usual position when we asked for greater control over rising prices.  We asked him to appoint people who would keep an eye on rising prices. One of our principal newspapers, the <i>Irish Independent</i> undertook the important public duty of attempting to give the public daily intelligence through their &ldquo;Prices Desk&rdquo; of rising prices.  All parties in the House and the public are indebted to the <i>Irish Independent</i> for this service.  It is mainly through the work of the <i>Irish Independent</i> that the public are alerted about rising prices and informed as to how they can combat them and get the best value for their money.  There was a public demand for action.  I do not know if the Minister was abroad at that time.  He was in Sweden when one of these demands came.  On his return there were very clear demands for action.  The largest growth in the employment sector occurred in the appointment of prices inspectors.  The number went from 40 to 80 in a fortnight.  Such is the value of properly directed public agitation.</P>
    <P>One would have thought the Minister would have appointed those inspectors before consumers had to suffer the terrible consequences of rising prices.  The Minister could not plead inexperience of the side effects of such developments.  The introduction of decimalisation caused an upward <Col N="1607" /> swing in prices.  Opposition spokesmen in the House warned of the inevitable consequences of VAT.  The situation worsened because of the refusal by the Minister for Finance to exempt foodstuffs from that tax.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate Minister for Industry and Commerce, for whom I feel sorry, was the person on the spot in this bad situation.  He had to take the rap.  In his new position he will be more alert to the possible consequences of decisions made by his colleagues on any Department in which he may find himself when the Taoiseach has made his decision about the re-allocation of Government Ministries.</P>
    <P>The Minister has never struck me as a man who had a clear concept as to how to tackle a national plan or regional development or the siting of industries.  During his period in the Department of Industry and Commerce he has not given evidence of a determination to decentralise industry. The Department and the IDA appear to be suspended between the Buchanan Report and the IDA Report.  The latter report appears to avoid some of the unpopular decisions the full implementation of the Buchanan plan would involve.  The IDA plan appears to make the best of all worlds and to take full account of the political susceptibilities of people in relation to the Buchanan Report.  The Buchanan Report would concentrate industry in particular centres.  The IDA plan appears to be undecided as to the virtues of that approach.  It appears to revert to the previous position in which there was a factory in every parish.  At any rate, it veers in that direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not appear to have had a clear idea as to what the national approach should be in regard to the siting of industries.  However excellent a job the IDA may do, a committee of civil servants are not an adequate substitute for a Minister who knows his job and who gives leadership.  Irish industry needs decisive leadership.  We are not winning the jobs war.  We are not creating sufficient jobs to absorb those coming on the labour market through redundancy. We are not taking into account <Col N="1608" /> those leaving agriculture and school leavers.  A semi-State organisation cannot substitute for elected leadership responsible to the community. In this connection the Minister has not been fulfilling his important role. Irish industry is in a state of uncertainty and there is a certain amount of gloom.  Workers in industry are uncertain about their future, uncertain about their jobs.  The situation in the woollen industry has been referred to in the euphemistic word &ldquo;overcapacity&rdquo;. This is a polite way of saying that in places like Ardfinnan mills are closing down.  There is no alternative employment available in the locality for those who are disemployed. Other Deputies from other parts of the country can think of localities in their constituencies where there is no adequate substitute for the loss of a local industry.  It is probably correct technically to refer to it as over-capacity.  I suppose in terms of national development there might not be much reason for the retention of such an industry but in the absence of any adequate alternative employment in the immediate neighbourhood, or not too far from it, it is calamitous for the people who have been working there.</P>
    <P>Our most important task is to get sufficient new jobs and jobs of the right kind.  We would need to be very careful about getting jobs that are suitable to our development, capable of future development and appropriate to the country.  We must be aware of a danger of getting foreign industry into the country which is here for no reason except to avail of the lack of adequate environmental legislation here.  We are, of all the members of the EEC, the country that asks least of the person who wishes to set up an industry in terms of what he must do to ensure that his industry does not pollute the landscape or the environment. The word has gone out to some of the dirtiest industries in Europe that so eager is Ireland for industry of any kind that we do not mind where they dispose of their waste material or how many rivers, lakes and seashores they pollute.  This is a big mistake on our part.  On the consumer front the Minister acted too late.  In the area <Col N="1609" /> of environmental legislation there is a great danger of the Minister acting too late also.</P>
    <P>We want industry but we want it of the right kind and we can get it.  To make the crude argument that it is employment versus scenery is not facing up to what is in the interests of this community.  Anybody looking at the matter responsibily must see that the community will finally pay for the industry which damages the surrounding environment.  Even if one is not too impressed by arguments about what happens to surrounding landscapes we are all aware of the importance, in cash terms, of our tourist industry.  Tourists have not been coming here in great numbers over the last two or three years but when they did come they did not come normally for the sun, which is an irregular visitor anyway, they came for what Bord Fáilte called the quality of our countryside, our people, and so on.  I think they used the phrase that we were a friendly people.  I do not know if they have got a new slogan since then.  The scenery we have taken for granted; the fresh air, our inland waterway system, are in grave danger if we persist in this policy of welcoming any industry however dire the effects of its waste material.</P>
    <P>We appear to ask less of intending industrialists than any other member of the EEC so the danger is that we may get more of this dirty industry, which will ultimately cost the community a great deal, than any other Member of the EEC in the years ahead unless we act quickly.  Of course, we need foreign industry.  Nobody on this side of the House will deny this.  We need foreign industrialists for their expertise, for the markets they have abroad and so on, but we do not simply want industry to provide the most menial kind of jobs.  We must follow a determined policy of insisting when we get a new industry in which foreign capital is involved that they follow a clear programme of giving jobs to the Irish over a particular period.  That policy should apply to the supervisory grade and past that, to the office category.  Too often we are satisfied if we get labourer jobs in <Col N="1610" /> a new industry.  We do not mind who controls the office staff or the scientific jobs.  This is the impression I have, looking at some of the key personnel in foreign enterprises a number of years after they have been set up.  I should like the IDA in their discussions with industrialists to ensure that a programme of giving jobs to as many nationals as possible, right up to board room level will be pursued over a number of years.  We may be joining a community in which there is a certain subordination of national differences, national independence and national control over assets, but I am not aware of any other European country which seems to be so unworried about the prospect of more business, assets and property passing into foreign hands.  I have repeatedly referred various Ministers to this problem but this Republican Government appear to be unmoved and unworried by the prospect of capital coming in from abroad and taking over larger and larger sectors of economic life. This is hard to comprehend on the part of any Government, especially a Government who are so prone to flag-waving in areas of less important national concern.  That situation has been ignored up to now.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister took in many east European countries, I seem to recollect that he visited that part of the world, in the last three years.  I think there is a Czechoslovak trade mission in town today, or was yesterday, signing a trade agreement.  It appears that we could do more to balance the unfavourable trade balance we have with communist countries.  All of them export more to us than we do to them.  It appears that a diplomatic exchange in at least one or two of these countries would help to right that adverse imbalance.  From these benches we have said that if setting up an embassy would help in that respect this should be done.  I do not know whether trade missions alone will succeed in remedying this state of affairs.  It has been suggested to me that an exchange of ambassadors with one or two of these countries would go a long way to improve the situation, much further than the establishment of trade missions. We have a very difficult period <Col N="1611" /> ahead of us&mdash;Deputy O'Connor called it a challenge&mdash;in the EEC.  A number of our industries, far more than we can feel happy about, will go to the wall in the next year or two.  There is a very serious job before us in creating sufficient new jobs to offset those lost by industries closing down, those needed by the young people coming on the labour market and those people who will be coming from the land in increasing numbers.  There is really a huge task before us in that area.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister gives little evidence of being aware of the gravity of that task and it is not an inadequate substitute to think that the IDA are looking after the problem.  The IDA however excellent their technical expertise, obviously cannot appreciate the national position in this matter and are in fact not finally responsible to the people in this matter.  The leadership in this area must be given by whoever is Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day.  He alone can give this leadership in the area of dispelling the uncertainty which presently afflicts Irish industry and the gloom which hangs over it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to the matter of the film industry.  I understand that the Minister is moving to another post and I will reserve my remarks for his successor but this is another matter which comes under the tattered umbrella of the Minister.  There has been considerable delay.  I recall reading in the newspapers of various groups visiting and the Taoiseach was called in for his advice on the setting up of a film industry.  John Heuston has been also very much involved in it and no sufficient reason has been given as to why there has not been greater progress in this area.  One would have thought that a film industry could do a great deal, I do not like using the term, to sell the idea of the country abroad, to improve our image abroad.  Probably there is more we could do at home to improve our image abroad than could be done by any films exported abroad. However, there seems to be a delay and I do not know if it is the same kind of delay we can expect from the <Col N="1612" /> Minister in any of the other areas of his concern in the past year or two. There does not seem to be any sufficient reason for this delay and for the lack of greater progress.</P>
    <P>The Minister is culpable for the way in which he permitted prices to increase without taking adequate precautions, in appointing a great number of inspectors when price increases had occurred around most of the country instead of appointing them long before and preparing the way.  It was only when the trade unions protested and the Irish Independent group as a national newspaper attempted to alert public opinion to these increases that the Minister acted.  It is an extraordinary comment on the Minister and on the priorities of this Government that it was only when a newspaper took on the leadership of this campaign that the Minister late in the day acted.  I am sorry for the Minister in that he is not really to blame.  It is his colleague, the Minister for Finance, who is to blame but I can only compliment the Minister for Finance on his political expertise in that, though he was responsible, all the egg is over the face of the Minister for Industry and Commerce whereas the Minister for Finance has slipped out, though his introduction of VAT was perhaps the greatest single element in the rise in prices.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, while he is left on the scene of the crime with no alibi, could, if he had considered his predicament and the situation which was bound to arise on the introduction of VAT, have taken these precautions.  He did not do so and is therefore, I think, culpable.</P>
    <P>He refused to give us consumer protection when we asked for it.  We asked for adequate consumer protection, which would have been to some extent some protection for the purchaser, the housewife who had little protection against these increases because the Minister for Finance had refused to exempt foodstuffs, despite Opposition requests that he should.  She had no adequate legislation which would describe the commodities she was to buy, would give her any idea of value, any idea of particular bargains and, even in a situation in which VAT had been <Col N="1613" /> imposed on foodstuffs, she did not have any legislative guide.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when asked to give adequate consumer protection, so that there would be correct labelling of products and that the contents would be listed so that the housewife would have some aid in getting the best bargain, for a long time saw no reason for this and then said he was preparing legislation.  Although the British had brought out such an Act in 1968, the Minister here was still involved in some dilemma of his own.  Although the Act was on the Statute Book in Britain, he would have us believe he was devising something new and wonderful and now we understand that it is not much different from what the British had in the first place.</P>
    <P>All in all, I have never been quite able to understand why the Minister would not give us some kind of consumer legislation long ago.  This would have been of some assistance.  We have had a prices explosion here over the past six months and we are top of the European league in this matter in the rate of increase in prices.  The Minister stood idly by, did not do anything about it, ignored it, said that it did not exist for a long time and then when the undoubted existence of this large price increase was brought to his attention by the trade unions and notably the <i>Irish Independent,</i> we have a flurry of activity on his part, with the appointment of a number of inspectors, the promise of consumer protection&mdash;all things to be given to us after the event.</P>
    <P>Whatever the political pundits may think about the law and order issue and so on, the matter which really grips the ordinary people is the matter of prices, and it is on the rock of prices that this Government in the coming year, whenever the Taoiseach decides to send his band to the country, can be defeated.  I am sorry that the Minister will be cast as a villain in this campaign but that will be his unfortunate role.  I am sorry for him because he is just as competent as any of the other members of his Cabinet &mdash;no worse.  I will say that for him. I will say also that he has been tireless &mdash;every man is entitled to exploit the <Col N="1614" /> talent he has and the Minister undoubtedly has a talent for travelling; he has travelled extensively around most of the continents of the globe in search of industry&mdash;in his travelling, as a world traveller.  My criticism is that he did not leave a competent deputy at home when he was abroad. Obviously he was a man who, like some of his predecessors, trusted his colleagues too much.  I believe the Minister trusted too much in the Minister for Finance, and because of the introduction of VAT, the manner which VAT contributed to price increases and the Minister's laggard response to the situation, the Minister will obviously be cast in the unhappy position of being one of the villains of this Cabinet in the election which is not long away, but perhaps the Taoiseach will have mercy on the Minister and will move him out of that position over the weekend.  Certainly the Minister is a decent man and, but for certain national difficulties we passed through in the past few years, possibly he would not have had the problem of being a member of the Cabinet.  I am sure the Minister would be happier if he were not a member of the Government because he has a heavy task but his services were required in the last few dangerous years and he had to join the Cabinet.  However, I hope he will get a post where he will be less vulnerable to the consequences of the actions of his colleagues and that he will have learned certain lessons from his experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In some respects the economic situation here is unique. Usually if there is not a high rate of inflation there is not a high rate of unemployment.  Conversely, when inflation is kept under control and prices are kept low there tends to be unemployment. In this country we have the unique achievement of not only having a high rate of unemployment but also a high rate of inflation.  This is a tribute to the economic expertise of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly we have the highest rate of inflation of all the countries in the enlarged <Col N="1615" /> EEC and that is something of which the Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot be proud.  Not only does it affect the housewife but it is gradually undermining the competitive position of our exports and this, in turn, places in jeopardy the jobs of people employed in export industries.</P>
    <P>Combined with this we have a unique position with regard to unemployment. I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach for our unemployment figures in comparison with other countries.  He told me he did not have them for this year but he gave me the figures for 1970-71. These are the latest figures the Government have so I hope I will be excused if I quote out-of-date figures. For 1970 the numbers out of work as a percentage of the civilian labour force were the following: Germany 0.7 per cent; France 2.2 per cent; Italy 3.2 per cent; The Netherlands 1.5 per cent; Belgium 2 per cent; Luxembourg .0 per cent; United Kingdom 3.2 per cent; Denmark 0.7 per cent; Ireland 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>We have twice the rate of unemployment of any of the other countries. That is the real situation with regard to industrial expansion.  Behind all the Press releases, all the receptions and the glossy books, the real index of the success of industrial expansion is the percentage of people who have to get unemployment assistance.  On the basis of that index the Government are a failure.</P>
    <P>We have instruments for dealing with the problem of inflation and, in themselves, they are good.  However, they are failing to get the backing of a co-ordinated government policy. On the prices front we have the National Prices Commission and on the industrial relations front we have the Employer/Labour Conference. Both bodies are doing good work but what is at fault is the Government's approach.</P>
    <P>This is clearly revealed in the fact that the Government do not take seriously their own programmes for economic expansion.  These programmes are trotted out not as a serious exercise in getting the economy going but as a political <Col N="1616" /> platform.  They are trotted out two or three months before a general election but after that they are forgotten. Without a serious effort by the Government the National Prices Commission and the Employer/Labour Conference can do very little.</P>
    <P>This lack of seriousness is illustrated by the fact that up to now it has been accepted that when one programme ends another starts.  If a programme ends on 31st December there should be a further programme to continue immediately afterwards. The Third Programme for Economic Expansion will expire on 31st December and there will be nothing to take its place because of the failure of the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Government to produce a new programme.  It can certainly be said of this Government that they have no policy because they have not an economic programme to succeed the Third Programme.</P>
    <P>I have my own suspicions why this has happened.  Possibly the Department of Finance produced a programme but it was found to be not optimistic enough for a good election programme and it was sent back.  Perhaps they were asked to produce another programme with more attractive targets to take to the country.  The Government want an attractive political programme as distinct from a serious attempt to plan the growth of the economy. The failure to produce a programme is a true index of the lack of seriousness of the Government to tackle our economic problems, to deal with inflation and unemployment which are the symptoms of the malaise that besets the economy.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have put forward a six-point plan to tackle the problem of inflation.  The main points were: the exemption of food from VAT, the setting up of a system of price surveillance; the strengthening of the Weights and Measures Office to undertake the task of price surveillance and we also suggested that a similar body be established to cover the rural areas.  We suggested that State aid be given to consumer associations willing to co-operate in price surveillance work and <Col N="1617" /> we recommended a temporary general limit on manufacturing price increases for a specified period in order to stabilise the economy so that meaningful negotiations could take place.  The problem in undertaking meaningful negotiations at the moment is that whenever people discuss industrial relations with regard to price increases by the time their meetings have concluded the material they have been discussing is out-of-date because of the very rapid development in price increases in the meantime and, consequently, their conclusions are out-of-date. We suggested that in order to provide a stable environment in which there could be a meaningful comprehensive policy to deal with the problems of prices, incomes and inflation, there should be a temporary general limit on manufacturing price increases. So that that could take place there should be a general limit on manufacturing prices.  I stress that our approach to this problem is not based simply on taking manufacturing prices and industrial wages as the areas in which control must be solely exercised from the point of view of price increases; quite clearly, it is not enough to come to an agreement about increasing industrial wages if you leave old age pensioners and others on lower incomes out of the agreement.  Any agreement to be meaningful must involve all incomes and bring into the net, as far as control is concerned, all incomes.  We cannot see industrial wages going up while those on fixed incomes fall behind and their differential is disimproved and, at the other end of the scale, you have people making vast speculative gains altogether out of proportion to the earnings of those in industrial employment.  Our approach is a comprehensive policy agreed by all interests in the economy, designed to involve all incomes and, consequently, all prices.  It is not the limited approach represented by Government policy at the moment in regard to manufacturing industry and wages.</P>
    <P>As part of this policy, we advocate a general capital gains tax for the purpose of dealing with the problem of speculative gains and capital gains, <Col N="1618" /> which are shooting ahead of ordinary incomes in manufacturing industry and providing an incentive for unrealistic increases and unrealistic demands because those in manufacturing industry, who actually work for what they get, naturally feel peeved when they see people making twice and three times as much as they earn in any given year.  There is a capital gains tax in other free market economies.  We propose, as part of a prices and incomes control policy, that a general capital gains tax should be introduced.</P>
    <P>To deal with the problem of the consumer, and create confidence on that front, a confidence which will contribute to an overall climate leading to a prices and incomes policy designed to curb inflation and, at the same time, improve employment prospects, there must be a proper trade descriptions Act so that people will know precisely what they are getting and will get full details with regard to user and content.  If these specific warranties are not complied with, the people must be provided with the means whereby they can take the manufacturer to court.  It is not practicable at the moment for an individual consumer to take a big corporation to court because of the legal cost involved and, from this point of view, consideration should be given to the establishment of a small claims court established specially to deal with the complaints of individual consumers and enable them to take action against those manufacturers who fail to live up to warranties.</P>
    <P>We should also establish a consumers' advisory service to advise consumers as to their rights, ensure that they get them and assist them in dealing with any problems that arise. An individual consumer faced with a massive corporation is clearly in a situation of inequity and it is the duty of the Government to step in and help the relatively weak individual consumer <i>vis-à-vis</i> the massive corporation. As Deputy O'Leary said, we need programmes on television to alert consumers to variations in prices, to advise them where good value can be had and warn them of any defects in commodities.  It is to be regretted that <Col N="1619" /> the programme <i>Home Truths</i> was taken off RTE.  It was taken off presumably because it was producing information embarrassing to certain industrial concerns which are, presumably, handsome contributors to the Government Party.</P>
    <P>We need to establish in the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards a research and testing unit for the purpose of finding out whether particular goods are really what they say they are and do what they allege they do.  In the interests of the public there should be a body responsible for testing such goods.  We need to improve the hygiene inspectorate to ensure that hygiene is maintained and people are not buying goods which may be a hazard to health.</P>
    <P>Coming back again to youth and unemployment, the worst unemployment of all is amongst those between the ages of 16 and 25.  This is the worst from of unemployment because these are the people who are starting out in life, whose ideas are being formed and whose personalities are being moulded. If, at that age, they experience substantial periods of unemployment they become demoralised; they lose their drive and verve and they become less effective contributors to the economy. We have, unfortunately, a substantial rate of unemployment in this age group.  We do not have the statistics we should have.  The EEC have published figures showing that 45 per cent of its unemployed are under 24.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach if he had any comparable figures for this country and he said he had not.  Surely this is the sort of figure we should have.  If we want to know how to tackle the unemployment problem we must establish who the unemployed are, why they are unemployed, what their ages are and the work they are capable of doing.  If we do not have that basic information, we do not have the information necessary to tackle the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>He is responsible for providing employment through the Industrial Development Authority and, if he does not know the kind of people who are unemployed because the relevant statistics are not available, he is at a disadvantage.  I am not blaming him for this but it is in his direct interest to do something about this.  We should have that information.  We should have a comprehensive survey carried out to determine why these people are unemployed.  Such a survey would provide us with the basis of a rational assessment of the situation. We do not have that.  Year in and year out we produce figures which do not give us the information we should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I am particularly concerned with the level of unemployment in my own constituency.  In October, 1972, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 329 unemployed registered in Navan employment exchange, 2.8 per cent more than at the same date last year; there were 124 people registered as unemployed in Kells exchange, which is a little less than the figure for the same period last year; there were 70 unemployed in Trim employment exchange, which is about the same figure as that for the same period last year.  In the Drogheda employment exchange area, which covers a substantial part of East Meath, there has been an increase of 34 per cent in the number of unemployed this year as compared with last year. In the Edenderry employment exchange area, which covers North Kildare&mdash;part of my constituency&mdash;and portion of South Meath, there has been a decline of 6.9 per cent in unemployment. In the Maynooth exchange, which covers south-east Meath, the area in which I myself live, there has been an increase&mdash;this is the most inexplicable figure of all&mdash;this year as compared with last year of 78 per cent in the number of people out of work. This situation is something to which the Minister should give attention. Clearly, there is a major problem in the east Meath area covered by the Drogheda exchange and in the south-east Meath area covered by the Maynooth exchange.  I would ask the Minister to direct the attention of the IDA <Col N="1621" /> to these figures with a view to that body taking appropriate action to direct industries to these two areas.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that a major contribution towards solving the unemployment problem in Meath may be the development of the mines at Navan.  I understand Deputy Donegan referred to this yesterday with greater expertise than I possess.  In the Navan and Kells labour exchanges at the moment there are 453 people registered as unemployed. There has been a fire in the Navan factory and this has contributed to the unemployment figures.  Therefore, there is a clear need to get employment into that area and clearly Navan mines could be the answer.  The Minister is aware that portion of the ore body there is in dispute but he should consider issuing a licence to Tara Mines to get operations going in the portion which is not in dispute.</P>
    <P>There are textile industries in my constituency.  There are textile industries in Drogheda also, and they affect my constituency.  We know there is money available in the EEC to help the textile industry, to help employment in the industry, and I should like to know from the Minister if he has submitted proposals which would benefit the Irish textile industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Throughout the years IDA have neglected Meath.  In the review of IDA operations from 1952 to 1970 only 0.9 per cent of the total grants were given to Meath as against 1.6 per cent for Wicklow, 6.4 per cent for Louth, 2.4 per cent for Monaghan, 2 per cent for Cavan, 1.3 per cent for Offaly and 1.6 per cent for Mayo.  I do not give the other counties.  I concede that in the last two years there has been an improvement as far as Meath is concerned but it does not balance the neglect of the years between January, 1952 and March, 1970.  Everybody knows about the textile and furniture industries in Meath and particularly about the furniture industry in Navan and the shoe industry in Kells.  I do not know whether these industries are in need of grants but I can point out to the Minister that the whole industrial pattern in Meath is of small firms.</P>
    <P>In the north of Meath particularly <Col N="1622" /> there is substantial unemployment, notably in districts such as Oldcastle, Castletown, Kilmainhamwood and other such areas.  They have exactly the same problems as neighbouring Cavan and Monaghan which are designated areas from the point of view of IDA grants and loans, yet Meath has been subjected to the proportion of grants I have mentioned between 1952 and 1970.  The pattern in the three counties is the same and I strongly urge on the Minister to treat Meath in the same way as the IDA have treated Cavan and Monaghan.  A case for this can be made very strongly.</P>
    <P>Particularly we need to strengthen the position of the furniture industry in Navan.  At the moment the provision of what is known as a common service depends on the industries themselves.  I do not suggest that the IDA should do everything for industry but they should do everything possible to get industries together and thereby strengthen the fabric of a number of similar small industries.  For instance, the IDA could provide a common pool of designers for the furniture industry. Navan has a distinct design.  Such designs must stick out and in this matter individual firms cannot afford to have full-time designing consultants to provide designs which will be internationally known and internationally competitive.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister, through the IDA, should establish an organisation which would group industries and help these groups with expert advice on design.  If such a body is to be established, the industries in question must make some contribution towards its cost.  If they are interested, I think it would provide that little impetus which would keep these industries going, and allow them to break into the export market, which is so necessary if they are to succeed.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the IDA plans as they affect my constituency. The IDA have the statutory responsibility for the promotion of manufacturing industries.  In their recently published regional and industrial plan for the five years 1973 to 1977, there is a target of 1,100 new jobs in County Meath and North Kildare. <Col N="1623" /> This job target, which relates only to manufacturing industries, includes a figure to compensate for jobs thought likely to be lost through redundancy during the five year period. It has been assigned to two town groupings: Athboy, Kells and Oldcastle, 400 new jobs; Enfield, Kilcock, Navan and Trim, 700 new jobs.</P>
    <P>If these new jobs are to be attracted to these towns, there will be a need to provide services: to provide water and sewerage services on an adequate scale, to provide improved telephone services, to provide a roads programme which will be commensurate with the increased traffic which will result from the new industries which will create the new jobs.  All of these services will have to be located in specific places.</P>
    <P>My criticism of these targets is that they do not spell out how many jobs will go to each town.  When the Department of Local Government, or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, or Meath County Council, are making their decision as to where they will provide these services in each area, it is not enough to say that there will be 400 new jobs in Athboy, Kells and Oldcastle.  That is a huge area.  If they are to provide a scheme in Oldcastle they will need to know exactly how big the scheme should be.  The only way they will know that is by knowing the precise number of new jobs which are intended for Oldcastle specifically, precisely the number of new jobs intended for Kells specifically, and precisely the number of new jobs intended for Athboy specifically.</P>
    <P>To tell them that a broad area, encompassing Oldcastle, Kells and Athboy, will get 400 new jobs is not giving them any help so far as the provision of services is concerned. The area is so broad that, if they tried to provide the same level of services over the whole area, they would not be able to do it until long after the target period was over.  These plans are supposed to be a guide for the provision of services.  The idea behind the plans is to provide all the authorities concerned with the provision <Col N="1624" /> of services to industry, with a guide which will enable them to decide where to locate their industries.</P>
    <P>To tell them that there will be 700 new jobs in Enfield, Kilcock, Navan and Trim, an area 20 or 30 miles long and about ten miles wide, does not really help them very much.  They need to know precisely how many new jobs are intended for Enfield. Enfield is much smaller than the other towns and, if it is to get half the new jobs, there will need to be a massive increase in services, housing, and so forth, in the Enfield area.  In deciding what services to provide in Enfield, Meath County Council have not got any real guide as to how many jobs are intended for Enfield.  They have a global figure for an area which includes Kilcock, Navan and Trim as well.  That is not much help to them in deciding what new services are needed in Enfield specifically.</P>
    <P>If these plans are to mean anything, they must be more specific.  I can understand why the Minister is not specific.  He does not want to lose votes in three towns by telling them: &ldquo;Really we intend to give all the industry to one town.&rdquo;  That may be what the Minister has in mind.  I do not think that would be a good thing.  It is important to spread the industries around.  Whatever the Minister and the IDA intend to do, it is important that they say so, so that the provision of services can be based on realistic information as distinct from global promises of numbers of jobs which sound great on an election platform. It is great to be able to tell people: &ldquo;There will be 400 new jobs here,&rdquo; but unless there is a back-up in the provision of services, those jobs will never arise.  The information given at the moment is not sufficient for that back-up to take place.</P>
    <P>I have quoted instances in relation to my own constituency, and the same goes for every part of the country.  The job targets are given on the same vague basis in relation to every region right across the country.  The local authorities, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and all the other bodies concerned with providing services for industry, are left in precisely the same <Col N="1625" /> dilemma as they are left in in County Meath and North Kildare.</P>
    <P>The attraction of industry to County Meath and North Kildare would be greatly assisted by the provision of adequate labour surveys on the number of people available to work in each area.  I know that the county development officers in County Meath and North Kildare are endeavouring to do this.  It is essential that they should be given every assistance by local bodies and by the IDA, so far as finance is concerned, in getting this information. If we are trying to attract industry to an area, it is essential to know how many people will be there to work when the industry is established.  You will have that information only if you have an adequate labour survey.  I am glad this is being done and I believe it should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>We need to take a very close look at the infrastructure.  The European Investment Bank have made available substantial sums of money for improvements in the telephone services, improvements in water and sewerage facilities, and improvements to roads, where these improvements can be seen as an added attraction to new industry in depressed areas.  In EEC terms, the whole of Ireland will be a depressed area.  The Government have been making much about their concern for regional policy, and their concern that the EEC should have a regional policy.</P>
    <P>These loans from the European Investment Bank will be available to us from next January.  The idea is that they should give money for an infrastructure which would attract industry, particularly in border areas.  They are particularly concerned to provide these services, and to provide money in the form of loans, to areas which are borders between two states.  In their reading of the situation, the border area between Monaghan and Armagh would be an area to which they would be particularly anxious to provide aid for the improvement of a common infrastructure.</P>
    <P>As I say, we will be a member of the EEC next January.  If we want to get this money, obviously our projects will have to be submitted well in advance. <Col N="1626" /> They have to be approved. They have to be discussed with all the interests concerned here.  This is 14th December and we will be a member on 1st January.  Has anybody here heard any plan coming from the Government to avail of this money from the European Investment Bank to improve the infrastructure in this country?  I have not.  I do not think they have any plan. One civil servant may be talking to another in a vague sort of way about it.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence whatever that the Government have put forward any proposals to the European Investment Bank in order to get this money.  We are entitled to it.  I am convinced that, because of Government inaction, we are liable not to get it.  I call on the Government to take action immediately, to get to work, to produce their plans to get this money from the European investment Bank, and to submit them immediately so that we can get this EEC money as soon as possible. The situation, as I see it, is that whether we get money in any given year depends on two factors&mdash;who is in first and has his proposal approved first and, secondly, how well worked out is the proposal.  The Government have given no indication so far of what are their proposals.  It is clear that not only are the proposals not worked out yet but they will be late so that we will lose out in 1973.  This is gross irresponsibility on the part of the Government who may be condemned more severely on their failure to avail of the opportunities of EEC membership than on any other issue on their record as a government.  They led this country into the EEC on the basis of these benefits but now they are not taking the action necessary to avail of them.  The blame goes across the board to Departments such as those of Agriculture and Fisheries and Labour.</P>
    <P>We need to take a look at the operation of the IDA.  Fine Gael in their &ldquo;Policy for People&rdquo;, published in November, 1971, advocated that regional development authorities be set up which would take over at regional level the general operational functions of the IDA.  The IDA are a highly centralised body.  They have offices lise the population there would be <Col N="1627" /> here and there but all of these are responsible to a body which meet in Dublin and whose policy is determined by people living in a Dublin environment. If the IDA are to become effective in the sphere of attracting industry to those parts of the country outside Dublin&mdash;and these are the areas where industry is needed most&mdash;decision making must be evolved in the west of Ireland, in the south and in the eastern region outside Dublin.  We have advocated the setting up of a development company similar to SFADCO for each region in the country which would have a reasonable degree of autonomy within the general guidelines laid down by the IDA.  This body could take action to attract industry to the respective areas and could send people abroad for the purpose of attracting industrialists to these areas.  These authorities would be made up of representatives of the trade unions, local authorities, chambers of commerce and employer representative bodies.  In this way local initiative would be harnessed into industrial expansion and that responsibility would devolve on the people affected most directly by industrial expansion.  At present all this work is done in Dublin by an unseen body meeting at IDA headquarters.</P>
    <P>It may be all right for a politician of the Government party to be able to arrive suddenly in a part of his constituency and announce to the people there that they are to have a new industry. Therefore, this matter is a bonus for the Government, whereas if we had a devolved structure, the local government politicians could not take the credit for the establishment of an industry. There is also the point that the harnessing of local initiative would be more effective in attracting industries to the various areas although it would deprive the Government of giving to their party members and supporters the distribution of suitable plums.</P>
    <P>The most serious failure of the industrial expansion programme in this country is illustrated in the number of people who are unemployed.  On the 8th November, 1972, Deputy O'Connell asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach what were the unemployment figures and he was told that <Col N="1628" /> the number of persons on the live register on the 27th October, 1972, was 67,887 and that on the corresponding date last year the number was only 60,667.  That was an increase of more than 7,000 in the number of people unemployed this year as against last year and that is the true index of the success of the industrial expansion programme. When it is combined with the highest rate of inflation in Europe, this is a clear indication that we have a Government whose economic policy is bankrupt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the most frightening part of the Minister's brief is the paragraph on page 24 which reads:</P>
      <P>During the year ended 31st March, 1972, 67 new industries with an estimated employment at full production of approximately 8,100 workers were approved for grant assistance.  The IDA investment in these projects is estimated at £12.3 million towards a total capital investment of £39.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the £39.5 million includes the £12 million contributed by the IDA. A simple calculation indicates that it costs £5,000 to provide employment for one worker.  I expect that the £39 million does not include the money used for development of the infrastructure necessary for the development of industry.  Therefore, we can take it that it could take another £1,000 or £2,000 to create employment for each person.  On the basis of an unemployment figure of 70,000, one reaches the colossal sum of £350 million that would be necessary to solve the unemployment problem.  Unfortunately, the unemployment figures have increased but one wonders how true an indication they are of the number of people who are genuinely out of work. Many times in the past other Deputies have suggested that those figures should be analysed more closely and that if this were done it would be established that there are some thousands included in that figure who should not be classed as unemployed.  However, I suppose that is not a question for the Department of Industry and Commerce but they are the Department on whom <Col N="1629" /> devolves the duty of trying to provide work for all those people.  They are doing this job adequately but are hampered by the financial and economic difficulties which the world at large is experiencing at present.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested from some quarters that the Government have no economic programme and have never had one but the more one hears about economic programmes not only in this country but in many others, the more one doubts the ability of anybody to forecast the future.  Indeed, it is obvious that nobody can forecast accurately what will happen tomorrow.  The idea of projecting figures may be a help especially now that we are going into the EEC in so far as the lending of money and grants are concerned but at local level I believe such projections are discrediting the IDA and the Department of Industry and Commerce. Indeed, they discredit all Members of the Oireachtas.  To me, the projection that a factory in a certain area will provide a certain number of jobs within a certain number of years is a very doubtful exercise.  I should like to see the background to such forecasts when, perhaps, I might find them more acceptable.</P>
    <P>From a practical point of view I would prefer if the public relations people of the IDA would indicate that they provided an industry in a particular area or that they provided jobs for five, ten or 20 people over a certain period.  This would be more worthwhile than indicating the number of jobs to be available in the 1980s.  This may sound an unfair criticism, but if over a period of years figures are announced that cannot be achieved, people will lose confidence in those endeavouring to solve our problems.  When that occurs nobody is prepared to go back and see what went wrong, whether it was loss of markets or lack of consumer potential.  These are all factors which could have arisen over a period of years.  The IDA, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Government are simply said to have failed to achieve their targets.</P>
    <P>The aspect of this Estimate which has always interested me most is regional policy.  Basically, I do not <Col N="1630" /> agree with the regional policy of the IDA.  The constituency I represent has very little in common with the rest of the region.  It is ridiculous that the administration of this country is still based on provinces as they were at the time of Conor MacNessa and Queen Maeve and counties established at the time of Queen Elizabeth, Queen Mary and King James.  When we think of regions we think of the endowment of areas by nature.  Some parts of the country are well endowed, but others are not.  I live in an area which is not naturally well endowed.</P>
    <P>When I consider economic problems I do not confine myself to my constituency, because that is not the way to solve our economic problems.  Most help should be given to the areas of greatest depopulation.  One of the greatest areas of depopulation is north-west Connaught, including Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo and parts of Galway.  This should be outlined as a region to get the same attention and the same opportunity of development as the SFADCO areas.  I agree with those who say that regional areas should have their own budgets for their own local developments.</P>
    <P>The particular area which I have delineated needs the utmost care and attention.  Within the last two years a big industry was established in Sligo town.  We have had an example there of what big industry can do.  I live 22 miles from that town and there are people from my area going to work in that factory.  If my area had to wait for an industry to employ those people we would have had to wait a very long time.  Work is now provided for those people and for many others in north Leitrim and in the town of Sligo.</P>
    <P>Development like this could also take place in other parts of the north-west region.  I understand that the IDA have acquired property between the towns of Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon. I would like to see this area developed.  Other towns throughout that north-west area, like Ballina, Castlebar, Westport and Tuam, can make their contribution and have made their contribution in the past.  If small industries could gradually stabilise the population there would be greater justification for the people <Col N="1631" /> interested to establish larger industries. We would like to see a build up of industrialisation in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands has stated once more that the solution of the depopulation of the land and of the depopulation of the West can never be brought about by the allocation and use of land alone, that it must be done in conjunction with industry. I think he said £100 million would be made available by the EEC for this purpose.  We have been told today that the European Investment Bank will make further moneys available.  It was stated that the Government had no plans to make use of those moneys but I do not think that is correct.  I believe I saw in some of the papers recently that Government plans were submitted.  My first reaction as a good politician was to ask where my constituency came into this, but I have not had the opportunity of following it up.  We have been assured that all the facts necessary for the submission of policies to the EEC were collected at regional level.  We got some very detailed documentation on the matter. I expect this will be used to earmark as much money as possible for our purposes.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made during this debate to the lack of water, sewerage, roads and telephones preventing industrial development in the West of Ireland.  I asked three industrialists about those problems and each of them informed me that his biggest problem was getting spare parts for machinery.  In one case a spare part had to be ordered from Great Britain.  It was to be brought by plane to Dublin but this was not done.  Eventually the particular part needed arrived at the airport.  A lorry was sent to collect it but, due to some union work demarcation policy, the man was not able to get this spare part from one section of the airport. Were it not for the help he received from other lorry drivers there, he would have had to go home without the spare part.  This may be only one incident but something like this, occurring on even a small scale, <Col N="1632" /> creates much difficulty for industrialists. Also, particular spare parts may not be available to the industrialist at the time they are required.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the spending of this £39 million to create 1,000 industries. A cost benefit analysis of this would show that many other people benefit from the spending of this money.  I read somewhere that if the industry does not produce jobs, it will not be absolutely succesful.  The production of spare parts, particularly the small parts necessary for machinery when it gives trouble, could help industrialists very much.</P>
    <P>It has been said many times that prices are increasing.  People find this distasteful when they go out shopping, but I believe the Department of Industry and Commerce are doing as much as they can without imposing on the community a large number of inspectors who in the long run would be more distasteful than the increases in prices.  Those of us who are old enough to remember the last war and the restrictions that were placed upon business people for one reason or another, the many inspectors that had to be used to enforce these restrictions and the frustration that was caused to retailers by the visits of these people and by the documentation, certainly will appreciate that the sending out of a horde of inspectors throughout the country is not the answer.</P>
    <P>In the long run it is the consumers who must answer this problem by pinpointing the places where they believe they are being overcharged.  They can thus focus whatever staff the Department of Industry and Commerce have available to deal with that problem. In this way the staff would be used in the areas where they are necessary and would not be going around causing difficulties to people who did not need their visits at all.</P>
    <P>Economically and otherwise things did not turn out as expected for this country in the past year.  This is stated in the Minister's brief and confirms my thinking on these problems.  While the forecasting of programmes is a nice thing and makes one feel people are <Col N="1633" /> doing a great deal of work, I would much prefer that people would tell me what has been done and that it has been done for me as near as possible to home.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce covers a very wide field and each Deputy has a particular interest in its effects on his own county, especially in regard to the creation of more job opportunities.  However, for the Deputies from the western counties who are concerned with the effects of policy on future development there, there is bound to be much criticism. In May, 1969, the Government announced a policy of creating as little dislocation of population as possible in providing job opportunities, but they have made no serious effort to attain that objective.</P>
      <P>In the western counties the population continues to decline.  The projections for the next five years seem entirely inadequate to correct that trend.  In rural districts in the west the rate of emigration has increased.  In Clare we have the second highest rate of depopulation in the country.  Leitrim experienced the highest rate of depopulation. It has therefore been found necessary for the western counties to come together in an attempt to improve the situation.  A huge conference of western counties representatives was called for Galway some months ago to try to correct this imbalance of job opportunities which exists for such a long period.  Deputies are entitled to ask the question: why have so many people turned a blind eye to this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my county we are fortunate to have an industrial estate which provides employment for many thousands of people.  Apart from the advantages to people living in proximity to this area of Shannon Airport, it creates for Limerick, Galway, Kerry, and Tipperary an opportunity for unemployed people to come in.  However, it must be remembered that my county is remote from this industrial estate. You can go practically 60 miles to the west, to Loop Head.  What has happened in this area?  What have the <Col N="1634" /> Shannon Free Airport Development Company, who are supposed to be the agents for creating job opportunities in the western region, done to provide work, and, as was the declared aim of the Government in 1969, to keep the population dislocation to the minimum?</P>
    <P>To date they have done precious little in the area to which I refer.  In my short few minutes here I would mention something which I think is unequalled in this country, the failure to correct this trend that is disturbing the people.  We, in Clare County Council, have elected representatives to the regional development organisations.  We, as representatives, have been asked by our county council to put forward the views of our members.  We are unanimous in suggesting that some remedy and change of heart would be brought about by the promoting agency, SFADCO.  Repeatedly we have put forward our point of view at organisation meetings.  We did so having in mind that mass emigration took place from west Clare.  When plans were published by SFADCO they ignored completely our point of view.  They ignored the views of all the chambers of commerce and all the members of Clare County Council.</P>
    <P>The IDA objective is the creation of 55,000 new jobs in the nine regions of the state.  We hope to be looked after by the SFADCO agency.  There are about 5,000 or 6,000 jobs in that region.  In their projections for the next five years they have offered 40 jobs for the people of the west and north coast of Clare who are 60 to 70 miles away from the Shannon industrial estate.  We have impressed on them that this kind of approach is wrong.  I have asked questions in this House on the subject.  I have alerted the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I am hoping that he will express his point of view to the promoting agency.  Nothing has been done.  The people are entitled to ask why nothing has been done to cater for the people with no job opportunities.</P>
    <P>In a few weeks' time we will become full members of the EEC.  As a result <Col N="1635" /> of that membership our industrial prospects should improve greatly.  We must consider the advantages to all our people in the five years to come.  I ask the Minister to contact the promoting agency and to correct the imbalance which exists.  This has been referred to previously as a disastrous mistake. There seems to be difficulty about establishing industries in the west, but I have seen a few industrialists coming in and establishing industries independently in that region.  People have gone abroad and have encouraged industrialists to come.  One of these industrialists is from Germany and another is from America.  These people on their own initiative encouraged the industrialists. No promotion agency had any part in encouraging them to come.  It is alarming that the Department of Industry and Commerce are prepared to allow a promoting agency to have this imbalance exist without correcting it.  Regional policy will not be effective if it does not give equal job opportunities to all people, particularly the unemployed. Some thought must be given in the years to come to people of limited means who come from small farms and who never had much opportunity. If they do not get equal opportunity when we enter the EEC some of us will regret that we did everything we could to encourage people to vote for our entry.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to refer again to the complaints made.  The promoting agencies have done some good things. The IDA and SFADCO have done a good job in many areas of the region to which I referred.  Had we been dealt with by the IDA in the same way as those areas in Leitrim, we would have at least 200 job opportunities over the next five years.  There had of course been large-scale emigration from Leitrim.  SFADCO considered my area to be worth only 40 jobs.  If the voices of those who are elected to speak are ignored it would appear that somebody is adopting a dictatorial approach.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by asking the Minister and his Government to give equal consideration to all the people and particularly to those in the areas in <Col N="1636" /> the west and north of my county to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that in my introductory remarks I anticipated the feelings of the House to quite a considerable extent when I said that I did not propose to go into as wide a field of detail as has been done traditionally. I said that instead I would confine myself to dealing with what I felt were a few key points of major concern.  With the exception of Deputy P. Barry's reference to stamp trading, all the comments made by Deputies referred to those key points.</P>
      <P>In my opening speech I dealt with industry, industrial development, mineral development, prices and the broad field of consumer protection.  I was a little upset last night when Deputy Donegan described my speech as &ldquo;stuffy&rdquo; and as a document that had been presented to me by my Department to read out.  On the other hand, Deputy Tully this morning suggested that my outline of the situation and the emphasis on the key points was the proper approach.  Certainly, industry and industrial development, redundancies, prices and consumer protection are the major items affecting the people, affecting potential workers and potential redundant workers. Therefore it was proper to have devoted myself to those matters.  I was rather surprised that Deputy Donegan should have found fault with the format.  He conceded, however, that the speech looked like one that had been prepared by the best brains in the Department&mdash; obviously not by the Minister.  I do not know how to assess that statement. It might be as well, in the circumstances in which it was made, to let it pass.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully said this morning that he was rather surprised that I had not given more attention in my speech to the question of prices and that I had dismissed that topic in a couple of paragraphs.  I regard prices as of major importance and the control of prices is a matter to which I have dedicated myself for quite a while.  A total of five pages was given to the problem of price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> There is no point in Deputy Tully or Deputy O'Leary talking about inflation and increasing prices and trying to create the impression that this is a problem peculiar to this country.  I mentioned the factors responsible for increases in prices.  Many of these increases are due to increases in the price of imported raw materials or increases in component parts of manufactured goods.  It is unrealistic to suggest that the Government or the Minister for Industry and Commerce can maintain the price of any given commodity when the cost of raw materials and the cost of manufacture increases.  It is ludicrous to suggest that there is a magic wand the Minister for Industry and Commerce can wave and thereby prevent price increases from taking place.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary was quite right when he suggested that price control and price increases would engage the attention of the electorate in the event of an election taking place.  On the other hand, one can expect a realistic approach from any logical man-in-the-street and an objective view of the causes of price increases.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary expressed sympathy with me in a very sarcastic way as being the victim of circumstances and he claimed that the real villain of the piece is the Minister for Finance, that he was the man mainly responsible for the increase in prices and the general increase in the cost of living, that he had introduced VAT and had not excluded foodstuffs and that this was mainly responsible for the huge increase that had taken place, he said, over the last 12 months.  VAT has been in operation for less than two months.  The Labour Party now find it convenient to blame all the increases in prices that have taken place in the last 12 months on VAT.</P>
    <P>Let us be frank about it, the increase that has taken place in the cost of living index has been mainly due to increases in the prices of agricultural goods such as potatoes and meat. These increases have brought great benefit to agriculture in the increased prices paid for basic raw materials. That is something that we visualised, anticipated and hoped for arising from <Col N="1638" /> entry into the EEC.  On the other hand, resolutions have been passed asking what can be done to prevent further increases in cattle prices and to prevent the export of cattle and to subsidise meat for home consumption. How unrealistic can one get in this regard?  A certain number of the contributions made to the debate were unrealistic.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very concerned with the increasing incidence of alcoholism and heavy drinking.  Treatment for alcoholics is already provided in all mental hospitals and in three special units.  In addition, I have had the leaflet &ldquo;What sort of a drinker are you?&rdquo; distributed as widely as possible. I have encouraged health boards to appoint psychiatric social workers who will specialise in the problem of alcoholism and a number of such workers have already been employed.</P>
      <P>A while ago, I requested the Irish National Council on Alcoholism to undertake a survey among interested organisations and individuals with a view to formulating recommendations on the further steps which might be taken to deal with this problem.  The council has completed its survey and is now in the process of finalising its recommendations which I hope to receive shortly.

    <P>The enforcement of the law in relation to the supply of alcoholic beverages <Col N="1642" /> to persons under 18 is a matter for the Minister for Justice.

Perhaps the Minister would have a word with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, with a view to introducing taxation which would discourage cigarette smoking and get people to change to pipe smoking and cigars?</P>

      <P>In replies I have given I have made it clear that most of the action must take place in relation to young people to prevent them from starting to smoke.  Action to stop adults from smoking has virtually failed in the US where the consumption of cigarettes, having fallen shortly after television advertising of cigarettes was prohibited, is now mounting and is above the figure it was before the television advertising stopped.  We are spending all the money we can afford and all the money that could be usefully spent in approaches to younger people asking them not to smoke on <Col N="1644" /> the grounds that they will enjoy better health.  That is the main nature of the campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards accept the responsibility of providing adequate services to cater for the victims of road traffic accidents.  Each of the boards has a sufficient number of accident ambulances operated under radio control.  These ambulances have all necessary equipment including resuscitation equipment and they are manned by personnel trained in first aid resuscitation techniques and patient handling.  Where a patient is seriously injured the priority is to convey him safely to the nearest surgical hospital. For this reason, it is not thought that it should be a formal feature of this service to arrange for routine attendance on victims by local general practitioners.</P>

The ambulance personnel have a very good training course which lasts for a week, including a week in an accident department of a busy Dublin hospital.  They have real experience of this.  The vast majority of all the experts in this field tell me that the first thing to do is to get the patient to a hospital where he or she can receive surgical treatment and that it is undesirable to emphasise that part of the procedure which involves the attendance on the victim by a practitioner on the site of the accident. The main and important thing is to get the victim to hospital.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the date he notified representatives of Civil Service widows <Col N="1659" /> of his intention of appointing an actuary to examine the Civil Service pension scheme with a view to seeing whether the claims of the pre-1968 widows could be satisfied within the financial resources of the present scheme; the date the actuary was appointed; and when the actuary's report is expected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In a letter of 14th August, 1972, replying to representations on behalf of the Association of Widows of Civil Servants I indicated my intention of arranging to have an actuarial survey carried out on the widows' and children's pension scheme. A number of inquiries were subsequently made in regard to a suitable appointment and interviews were held with two actuaries.  Following these inquiries preliminary actuarial work was commenced, in advance of the making by me of a formal appointment on 28th November, 1972.  As the survey will involve the compilation and processing of a great amount of data, a good deal of which is not readily available, it is not possible to specify a completion date at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is concern at the slow pace at which this matter has been handled, and would he agree that he agreed verbally to this in June and confirmed it in writing in August?  The fact that it took five months to appoint an actuary is a bit disturbing.  Will he assure us that there is no question of feet being dragged on this issue so that it will be left over until a general review takes place next July, and that it will be processed rapidly at this point in time in view of its urgency?  Is he aware that a number of these widows have died without having received any benefit from the Minister's promise?</P>

      <P>The only thing I promised was to have the actuarial review carried out and then to examine the position.  The position is that I have given instructions that this is to be treated as a matter of top priority and it is being so treated.  As I have said, a certain amount of preliminary work was carried out before the formal appointment was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be any requirements imposed. As it happens, most of the pigs produced in Ireland, Denmark and Great Britain are sold on the British market and the type of pig sold on that market is lighter and leaner than that commonly encountered in the other EEC countries.  I do not believe that the Council of Ministers will ask the three acceding states to accept standards that they find acceptable on their market because the standards that are known in the three acceding states are different from those in the other countries. A couple of days ago the Council of Ministers accepted the principle that the type of butter commonly in use in Britain and Ireland which contains 2 per cent salt, which is something unheard of in the existing EEC, will be accepted as a separate type of the same commodity.</P>

      <P>I had hoped to have the opportunity of dealing as comprehensively as possible with the points raised during the debate.  Unfortunately, due to the shenanigans of Deputy L'Estrange we have lost a half hour.  I shall endeavour, however, to try to cover what I stressed earlier are the most important contributions being made by my Department to the various matters that I look on as being extremely serious.

    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> Industrial development and industrial employment, and the effect of redundancy, to which I naturally referred in my introductory remarks, were also referred to by a number of Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully said that the Minister in his speech offered no prospects for the redundant workers.  He stressed the fact that the creation of new industry, irrespective of where created, was not any great consolation to people who were losing their employment due to redundancy.  The situation is, despite the best efforts of all the State agencies to keep industry going, despite the efforts of Fóir Teoranta, which have specific responsibility to aid viable industry and provide funds to help them be maintained, we still have the situation where there have been redundancies and there will be redundancies for some time.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my opening remarks, the firm plan of the Industrial Development Authority, who are responsible to me and who are working under my aegis, is to create 55,000 new industrial jobs in the coming five years.  The total redundancies over that period have been estimated as 17,000 so that there will be created in that period a net increase of 38,000 new jobs.  I indicated that while we expect the falling off which Deputy Donegan envisaged at the end of a given period the redundancies will exceed the amount projected by the IDA.  I will, as I indicated in my opening remarks, have to come back to the House before the end of the financial year with a Supplementary Estimate for the IDA in order to enable them to pay for the increased efforts they will be making in Europe, the US and all over the world to generate new industry here.  As I indicated, the manpower in each of the areas in which the IDA have offices at present is being increased in order to effect this increased generation of industry.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the situation in the north-east part of this country and the unfortunate events of two weeks ago in this city must be seen to have had an effect on the potential investment of industrialists here.  The conduct of subversives has militated against the industrial development of <Col N="1721" /> our State.  Sufficient note is not taken of the efforts by the Government, through the Industrial Development Authority, in trying to generate fresh industry here.  The IDA are at present intensifying their efforts to attract foreign investment to the country.  They are confident of achieving the target of 55,000 new jobs over the next five years.  It is believed that even achieving that target may not be sufficient.  This is why it is necessary to increase the generation of interest here.  Deputy Donegan had a lot to say about my decision some months ago in relation to the Prices (Amendment) Act, 1971, in withdrawing the section dealing with the control of new house prices.</P>

      <P>Yes, section 3.  Anybody looking at section 3 now will see that there is no reference to new house prices.  I want to quote what I said at that time on the Committee Stage of that Bill on the 11th July last, in volume 262, column 1179:</P>
      <P>May I say that the specific reason for my wishing to delete the section &mdash;I hinted at it a moment ago when dealing with the point raised by Deputy Donegan&mdash;is because of the impossibility of incorporating a sufficiently comprehensive control over the price of new houses in a measure like this.  The Minister for Local Government and I had discussions about this and we found that the task would be exceedingly difficult and very time-consuming.</P>
      <P>The position was that it would have delayed quite substantially, in order to cover the intricacies of controlling the price of new houses, my coming to the House with the Prices Bill which was so necessary.  I indicated that the position then was that the Minister for Local Government would formulate the arrangements necessary to enable an effective system of control to be prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is going on at present.  The implications of the withdrawal of section 3 were over-stressed by Deputy Donegan.  He cast aspersions on the credibility of my colleague, the Minister for Local Government, which were <Col N="1722" /> completely without foundation.  It was rather unfortunate that his remarks should have been put on the record.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully, Deputy Donegan and Deputy Bruton referred to my slowness in sitting down to negotiate a lease with Tara Mines Limited regarding the ore body in the Navan area.  All of them questioned the reasons why I should be so reluctant to make a final decision in this regard.  I have on more than one occasion outlined in the House that there are two different problems here.  The first is in regard to a court case to which each of the Deputies referred.  The second is the fact that at present I have an inter-departmental committee preparing a report of recommendations regarding the changing of the fiscal implications in this and making recommendations to me regarding the proper approach to royalties and the various other considerations which have to be taken into account when allocating a lease.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan conceded that it was understandable that I should endeavour to get more for this country out of the ore body that lies there than appears to have occurred up to now. We share the view, as far as policy is concerned, that the State should get its full share from the licences and that licences should be given to the people with the capacity to prospect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We all share that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donegan went on to say that my policy in relation to mining was a disaster.  Naturally.  I do not share this view with him.  Deputy Tully said the Minister's hands were clean but I heard a quotation similar to Deputy Donegan's quotation.  It was reported to me recently from a collection of speeches made at a function here in town in which the Minister and the Government were attacked very seriously for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case is now being made that it is possible for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to negotiate a lease with Tara Mines with whom I have promised I will negotiate.  When I originally introduced a compulsory order to take over the rights of the Nevinstown Mine, the matter which is the subject of court proceedings.  I did so fully believing <Col N="1723" /> that the whole ore body in that area would be required to make an economic processing of the ore body there possible.  This is still my view, despite what is being contended now and what I personally feel is being wrongly contended and should not be contended until such time as the judge's decision has been given.  My reason for using the powers that I had at that time was that I believed I needed to be in a position to negotiate a lease for that area together with the rest in order to achieve satisfactory royalties, on the basis that the lease would be for a viable mining operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that means that Nevinstown on its own could not be a viable operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that.  On the other hand, the people who now want to negotiate the separate lease with me were the people who told me originally that the area that did not include Nevinstown would not be viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be.  I am as mindful as I should be as Minister for Industry and Commerce that there should not be an unnecessary delay in this.  Nevertheless, I want to take no action which could put me out of court in regard to the legal proceedings in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if he hopes to have the report from the committee in the near future, because, according to what the Minister says now, even if the decision was given by the courts it would still be held up pending a recommendation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>For the last number of months I have been pressing to have this inter-departmental report to hand. It will be understood that here is one specific type of report that a Minister can justifiably press for, because the membership of that interdepartmental committee comes under the aegis of various Ministers.  I have certainly asked them to speed this up, and my latest information is that they hope to <Col N="1724" /> be in a position to present this to me very early in the New Year.  I even stressed that I want &ldquo;very early in the New Year&rdquo; to mean what anybody would expect it to mean.  Naturally I have been waiting for the court decision, as Deputy Tully says, since the end of August.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan, in talking about insurance, referred to the situation which arose in the early 1960s when an Irish insurance company became insolvent, and he warned against the danger of a possible recurrence.  It would be extremely wrong to suggest that any Irish insurance company is at present in danger of insolvency.  A strict watch is kept over the accounts of Irish insurance companies by the Department, and it is possible to say confidently that, without exception, they are completely solvent.  In view of the fact that mention was made of it I think it is as well for me to clear that point up so that no implication of danger of insolvency will be hurled about.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully referred to the operations of Fóir Teoranta and to Crannac Teoranta in his own town.  He said that when Fóir Teoranta were approached originally they were extremely forthcoming and were as helpful as he could possibly expect them to be.  Fóir, of course, come under the aegis of the Department of Finance, but it might be as well at this stage to say that I do not think that such a State-sponsored body should be seriously criticised for being careful in the allocation of State money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If Crannac had to close down because the money which they had been promised had not materialised we would all look very foolish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, if the money that had been promised had not materialised, but the Deputy mentioned that Fóir, which had been forthcoming as far as promises and assurances were concerned were very slow in regard to the money and that the money is only trickling in at present.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be leaving themselves open to attack&mdash;and we have had this <Col N="1725" /> type of attack on previous occasions &mdash;if any State-sponsored body were lax in properly tying up the allocation of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When the decision was made to give the money, surely there was no excuse for a four months' delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is necessary to ensure that in the allocation of public money everything is properly tied up legally. Neither the Deputy nor I are legal people but we do know&mdash;at least I know from my experience not only as a Minister but as a Deputy&mdash;that certain precautions must be built in. The Crannac people, to whom all credit is due for their efforts getting together to maintain this industry, were working at all stages in the full knowledge that they had the backing of Fóir Teoranta.  They knew the money was there; it was a question of ironing out the nitty gritty bits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Time is running out. Deputy Tully also referred to prices display orders.  As I said yesterday, these orders required display by retailers of prices charged for eggs, potatoes, certain cuts of beef, of mutton, of pork and of bacon, oranges, butter and certain types of flour.  The National Prices Commission have under consideration at present the addition of further commodities to this order.  Those display orders are there for the purpose of enabling the housewife from a reasonably short but representative list to get an idea of the range of prices being charged in a particular shop as against the range being charged in some other shop.  In any progressive retail business at present the prices being charged on marked articles are shown. The National Prices Commission are not likely to recommend a great number of additional prices to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of the price and quality of coal.  The impression I got was that Polish coal was being sold at the same price as English <Col N="1726" /> coal.  We have no evidence of any unauthorised increase in coal prices.  I have been checking this matter since the Deputy mentioned it this morning to find out whether we had received such complaints.  The average person buying two stone or four stone of coal does not know whether that coal is Polish or English.  I will have this matter examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is something wrong.  I would be glad if the Minister checked it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy P. Barry spoke about the high cost of motor insurance and about unequal taxation on policy holders.  It is accepted that motor insurance premiums should be put on an equitable basis.  There is a report from the insurance committee.  I have indicated that I hope to be able to analyse it immediately after Christmas and to have it published towards the end of January.  The object will be to get rid of the major inequalities.  There does not seem to be any prospect of keeping overall premium levels from rising in line with increasing costs generally. This is not what is being talked about. The loadings which are becoming so effective on the younger age groups are being discussed widely.  There might appear to be some justification for lowering premiums when a person or his car gets old.  Some people will say that a person who is getting older will travel more slowly.  There is no guarantee about that.  Insurance companies cannot be expected to consider that seriously.  The record of a man's driving life is something that should be taken into consideration.  That does not arise in relation to the under 20 or under-25 years of age group who are seeking insurance cover.</P>
      <P>Deputy P. Barry referred to Verolme Dockyard.  I am in constant touch with the Minister for Transport and Power with a view to securing orders for ships to be built at Verolme.  The Minister for Transport and Power is putting constant pressure on the State shipping companies.  It must be remembered that the needs of the shipping companies must be taken into account.  They may not always need new ships when Verolme need new orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" /> Deputy P. Barry also spoke about stamp trading.  Deputy P. Barry and other Deputies worry, as I do, about stamp trading.  I have studied the grocery report issued some time ago about restrictive practices and uncomplimentary references were made to stamp trading.  The Fair Trade Commission some years ago issued a report on petrol distribution.  They also referred to stamp trading.  I am of the view that stamps must, of necessity, have an effect on prices.  I have asked my Department to prepare legislation. They are in the course of preparing legislation to deal with stamp trading.</P>
    <P>Deputy M. O'Leary was generous in a sympathetic way to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Before Question Time I questioned the genuineness of his sympathy with me and his castigation of the Minister for Finance.  In relation to the allegations he made, he attributed almost all price increases to the effects of VAT.  This shows up the genuineness and the justification of his complaints. The Deputy said that the Minister had given no sign of the fact that he was aware of the necessity for regional industrial development and the generation of industry away from the east coast.  It would appear to me that the Deputy has not been studying the programmes and plans of the IDA which were issued over the past 12 months.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not quite say that.  He is being rather facetious. Deputy Bruton talked about our high unemployment figure.  There is no getting away from that fact.  We have never endeavoured to cover up that fact.  That is why I say our future depends on our being able to generate more industry, to improve prices in agriculture&mdash;one of the main reasons why we were most anxious to get into the EEC.  I am satisfied and I think most people on the other side of the House will agree that the fruits of membership will accrue to us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton wanted projected figures for areas under the IDA plan broken down into towns in order that they might be tied in with local county council developments.  The arrangement whereby a county development team headed by the county manager will work in each county in close liaison with regional managers should get this type of operation off the ground.  The board of the Industrial Development Authority did think initially in terms of earmarking particular developments for particular towns on the lines suggested by the Deputy but it was considered that this would work against the broad idea of generating industrial development in each region.  The final decision to have it in various regions was a far better one.</P>

My own constituency runs along the banks of the Shannon.  Deputies from Wexford make the same point.  There is no point in having a designation arrangement which takes from designated areas any little advantage they may have in attracting industries.  Deputy Bruton and Deputy O'Leary referred to what I was doing to take industrial development from the industrialised east over to the west.  The designation of areas in the east would not be the way to prevent that.</P>

      <P>I have endeavoured to cover as many points as possible.  Undoubtedly, the Estimate is a very important one.  The money required for health, education, local government, social welfare, and so on has to be generated through the activities of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Transport and Power.  The Estimate for Industry and Commerce is extremely important.  I am sorry that I had to deal so speedily with the points raised in the debate.  Deputy Tully did ask me to communicate with him. If there are other points that Deputies have raised and which I have not dealt with as adequately as possible, we will endeavour to communicate with the Deputies concerned.</P>

I understand there were discussions proceeding between the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of the bloodstock industry. There is some concern at the delay in reaching an arrangement, particularly as early in the new year bloodstock will be moving into the country and out of it at the beginning of the breeding season.  Perhaps the Minister would endeavour to get the discussions concluded?</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton gave notice that he would raise the subject matter of Question No. 49 of the 12th December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had three programmes for economic expansion in the office of the present Government. They have followed each other in immediate succession.  They have, despite their many faults, provided a framework upon which one could understand the working of Government policy.  They have provided a reference for bodies such as the Employer-Labour Conference or the National Prices Commission operating in a particular sector of the economy and wishing to see how their work could fit into the overall context of Government policy.  The concept of programming has been lauded by the Government as a useful discipline in economic policy. We on these benches would agree that this is the case.  We would think indeed that the programmes should contain much more specific and quantified targets and therefore be a more effective discipline and provide a more effective yardstick of the extent to which the Government are succeeding in reaching the targets they are setting for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1746" /> It is important that, coming into the year in which we will be a member of the EEC for the first time, we should have a programme of economic expansion against which to judge the performance of the Government during 1973, that most crucial year in our economic and social development. I asked the Minister for Finance the day before yesterday, in view of the fact that the Third Programme expires on the 31st of this month, when would the Fourth Programme be coming into effect and when it would be published.  I was told that it had been envisaged that it would be published at the end of the year, that it would follow directly upon the Third Programme which expires, but that due to some circumstances it was now foreseen that it would be some months before the document would be published and I was not told, though I asked, what date it would come into force.  I was told that it would be some months before it would be published but I was not told when it would come into force.  The obvious implication is that it will be six or eight months before this programme comes into effect; in other words, there will be six or eight of the most crucial months in the economic and social development of this country during which we are for the first time full members of the EEC which will be covered by no programme of Government policy.  There will be no programme for expansion, for social development during these months.</P>
    <P>The reasons the Minister gave are most difficult to understand.  He said it was due to the lack of availability of up-to-date information of a statistical kind upon which the programme could be based.  I asked what statistics but he gave me no answer.  He said something about a number of varying factors, including the situation in the North of Ireland.  There have been a number of varying factors operating at all times in the history of this State which have affected its economy but these have not prevented the production of statistical information.  I have not noticed that because we have trouble in the North of Ireland, the Central Statistics Office has been coming <Col N="1747" /> out any later with their publications in relation to other aspects of the economy.  I cannot understand why the peculiar statistics effective in relation to the framing of the Fourth Programme should for some unspecified reason in relation to the North of Ireland, not be coming out while other statistics are available and are being published daily and received by Deputies from the Central Statistics Office.  This reason does not stand up at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister should spell out quite clearly what precise statistics are not available, precisely why they are not available and precisely when he expects the Fourth Programme to come into effect.</P>
    <P>The reason suggested to me for this is that the civil servants in question did produce a programme to the Minister but that they were carpeted by him because the programme was not optimistic enough and did not provide a sufficiently attractive schedule of promises upon which the Government could hope to go to the people, and he told them to go back and produce something more optimistic, which would provide a better election platform for Fianna Fáil.  If this is the sort of operation that is taking place, it is a travesty of economic programming. Maybe that is not the case.  Naturally one does not know what is going on in the Civil Service but the fact that the Government have failed to produce a programme to follow on the Third Programme gives rise to very grave suspicions about their seriousness in regard to the economic management of the country and their seriousness in setting out at all on the idea of economic programming or planning.  I hope the Minister will give a serious answer to this problem and not try to laugh it off with vague generalities as he did in replying to the original question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Deputy Bruton on this matter and I deplore the total absence now of any consultative procedures in the framing of a Fourth Programme.  It is not unfair to say that while there may have <Col N="1748" /> been some element of politics in the First, Second, and Third Programmes in the context of the development of indicative planning in the country it is now a purely cynical political exercise. The Fourth Programme has deteriorated into that kind of political wonderland largely because the Minister has effectively destroyed the consultative process in the preparation of the drafts of such programmes and it certainly must be demoralising to the vast majority of civil servants in the various Departments making their contributions towards such a programme to know that their programme is being regarded now as a purely political general election platform by the Government for the next general election.  This is the only purpose it is now deemed to serve by the Minister and this is becoming quite obvious from what one can define from Dáil replies and statements made from time to time by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore I strongly support Deputy Bruton and I completely reject the alleged absence of factual information on which to base a report.  There is a wealth of data available from the CSO and the economic staff and the economic development division of the Department of Finance, run down though it has been over the past few years.  The economic staff of the Department of Finance, which would readily have available to them the economic expertise of the Central Bank and the ESRI, or any of the other institutions which would readily co-operate with the Department in making data available, are more than capable of producing very up-to-date data and projecting into the mid-seventies a great deal of sensible economic projections available to the State which should have been available in the mid-1972 period but which now, regrettably, will not be available except around February or March when the Government will launch them in conjunction with the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  This seems to be the kind of political coinciding which smacks of political opportunism.  It is not in the best interests of the management of the economy of the State and most certainly does not lead me to the belief which I did have that perhaps we had in the early 1960s and in the late 1960s a breakthrough in economic planning. <Col N="1749" /> even if it was in the indicative sense. It came, but the politicians have scuttled it and the Fianna Fáil Party now, for purely political purposes, look like burying it and I think we are right in raising it this year and protesting strongly to the Minister about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was absent when this matter was raised, though I came in when it was under discussion.  I would have perhaps contributed in supplementaries had I been here at that moment.  I, as the Minister knows, have always supported these economic programmes. I am aware that at the time they are published they have a certain propaganda value for the Government in power, regardless of whether there is any political content in them, even the most objective programme.  More than most of my party, I admit, that to a large degree most of the programmes have been objective, but the most objective programme necessarily favours the Government in power when it is published, but when the targets set are not achieved, and especially when this is visibly attributable to the mismanagement of the economy by the Government, to short-term cyclical slowing down of growth, the Government get a bit embarrassed.  This happened to a notable degree in the case of a Second Programme&mdash;not so much in the First. There was a dip in the economy in 1972 but it did not so much affect the result and the targets set at that time were so modest that they were easily exceeded.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to this point.  The Second Programme was terminated abruptly about one-third way through its life, on the obvious ground that the targets would not be met and another programme introduced, but let us consider the dates. The First Programme was published in November, 1958, for a period covering 1959 to 1963 and there was no difficulty in publishing it in good time. The Second was to cover the period from 1964 to 1969 inclusive but, in fact, that first section was published <Col N="1750" /> in August, 1963, and then details followed in July, 1964.  It was possible to publish an advance account of it but the main targets in it were in August, 1963.  It was possible to publish an advance account of it with the main targets in August, 1963. That programme was arbitrarily and prematurely terminated and a new programme was introduced which was published early in 1969 at the outset of the four-year period to which it was to apply.</P>
      <P>It is disturbing that we are going backwards and that now apparently there is no fixed date for publication of a fourth programme.  I am puzzled this should be attributed to statistical problems.  Every programme produced so far has suffered from the disability that hard firm data in respect of certain key indicators is not available possibly for two years, especially in relation to such matters as the census of industrial production.  However, this has not prevented programmes being produced and that we should have to abandon the process of producing programmes and publishing them in good time is barely credible.</P>
      <P>One must ask what new statistical problems have arisen.  If the Minister did, in fact, make a reference to Northern Ireland I am bemused.  I follow Irish statistics very carefully and I have arrangements made to get them as soon as they are produced. The statistics office are extremely efficient in publishing advance data in stencil form before they are printed, but I am not aware of any slowing down in the publishing of our statistics because of Northern Ireland.  I am aware of the slowing down in the economy which is in part attributable to that, but that is a different question. If the Minister is suggesting the situation in Northern Ireland is contributing to the slowing down of the preparation of statistics he will have to explain that to the House.  On this side of the House we are not aware of this phenomenon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Fourth Programme should get this bad start and I hope the Minister can give a rational and full explanation of the matter.  Deputy Desmond has pointed <Col N="1751" /> out that confidence in this programme will be somewhat weakened because there is no longer in existence a national economic council such as the NIEC and the fact that the programme is now being produced by administrative civil servants under the direction of a political Minister.  Civil servants are the agents of that Minister and they are required to do what he says.  They are not professional civil servants as in the Central Statistics Office.  We know that what comes from the Central Statistics Office is impartial and that any Minister or Taoiseach who would endeavour to dictate to them about statistics would get a short answer, culminating in the rapid resignation of the director as a professional civil servant.  The same is not true of the civil servants who prepare the programme: they are administrative civil servants in the Department of Finance and in other Departments and they work under the direct control of their Ministers. The Minister in each case is a political Minister and he may or may not seek to influence the programme in a political way.</P>
    <P>In the last two programmes we had the NIEC as the guardian of the public interest, a body comprising civil servants and representatives of management and industry and the trade unions who were able to give their view of the programme and who could tell the public that the programme was reasonable and impartial and was not politically orientated. That was the clear implication of what they said and this increased confidence in a programme that, in view of its necessary political origins, was liable to be suspect.</P>
    <P>It has not been easy for the Opposition to accept these programmes because of the obvious immediate bonus to the Government, but the Opposition have been very responsible in their attitude.  The three programmes have been accepted: we have not tried to make them political issues, although we have criticised parts of them.  It was much easier for us to do this in the case of the Second and Third Programme because <Col N="1752" /> we had the guarantee of the validity of the programmes and their largely apolitical character in the form of the NIEC reports.  We have not got that on this occasion and when the Minister gives excuses for the delay in producing the programme that arouses suspicion.</P>
    <P>I was not involved in this matter. It was Deputy Bruton's decision to raise the issue in the circumstances. The Minister has a duty to ensure confidence in the programmes.  It has been a great help to this country when we have had programmes produced which, having the stamp of approval of the NIEC on the last two occasions, have been able to command support of a consensus in this House.  It would be a tragedy if the Fourth Programme became a matter of political controversy in a way the other programmes did not, and the Minister has a duty to ensure this is not the case now.  He can do that by explaining to us fully and frankly what difficulties have arisen and why the programme has been postponed. He can tell us when it will be published and he can give us an assurance that the programme will be as apolitical as the previous programmes. I do not say there was not a political element in them but, by and large, a convention has been established that the targets set are not interfered with for political reasons.  We would like an assurance that what comes out of this programme will be the considered view of the experts regarding the kind of growth rate our economy can achieve and how it will be distributed between different sectors.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that there is some kind of regional basis for the programme, that the targets in respect of investment will be expressed in regional terms.  We have a firm basis for this because we have county income figures for three separate years, for 1960, 1965 and 1969.  We need a regional basis for these figures and the programme will command much more public support if each part of the country is able to see what is involved for it.  I proposed this during the Second Programme; I did not suggest it should be done in <Col N="1753" /> the Third Programme but I suggested it should be done in the Fourth Programme.</P>
    <P>The targets in this programme should be sufficiently detailed.  The most unfortunate step backwards in the Third Programme&mdash;dropping targets for agricultural products, for example&mdash;should be retrieved and we should have an adequately detailed programme that will command interest and support throughout the community.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is a great man to give us an example of arrogance when he speaks.  However, when he is about to get his answer he does not like it.  Now he has a choice&mdash;he can take it or leave it.  The First Programme and Part I of the Second Programme were published before the programmes came into force.  Part 2 of the Second Programme and the Third Programme were not published until July, 1964, and March, 1969, after the programmes had come into force in January, 1964, and January, 1969.  That relates to the first misstatement of fact we had in the debate.  The reasons for the delay in publishing the Third Programme were basically that consultations with organisations in the private sector had <Col N="1754" /> to continue but were delayed; and there were difficulties in finalisation of the base year statistics&mdash;I am referring to 1968.</P>
      <P>There were more misstatements with regard to consultation.  It was implied and specifically alleged that the absence of the National Economic Council means we cannot have the consultations that would be necessary.  This is quite untrue.  The fact is that in the past consultations took place with various sectors, with the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, with agricultural interests and so on.  It is true the Third Programme was shown to the NIEC in its final form but the consultations took place not with the NIEC or through the NIEC.  At the moment consultations are going on in connection with the Fourth Programme.  I do not know why Deputies try to pretend, in order to make a political point, that the absence of the NIEC means no consultation with the various sectors of the economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Consultations have taken place with the Confederation of Irish Industry.  In fact, consultation was delayed for some months as a result of the air crash at Heathrow.  A preliminary negotiation had taken place with the late Mr. Gray and some months elapsed before the confederation was in a position to engage again in consultation. Arrangements have been made for consultation with the Congress of Trade Unions.  These are going on at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the statistics I mentioned in my reply to the Parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Bruton, the fact is that firm <Col N="1755" /> statistical information on the base year, 1972, is not yet available; that is the base year for the programme.  Specifically, data on employment from the census of population of 1971, which is a vital factor in the 1972 employment estimate, will not be available until the end of February, 1973.</P>
      <P>We did make some attempts to avoid this delay by carrying out a sample survey but this did not prove to be successful.  Furthermore, the preliminary Central Statistics Office estimates of national accounts aggregates for 1972&mdash;for example, GNP, imports, exports <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;are not yet available. It is true that Department of Finance estimates would be available at the end of 1972 but significant revisions might well be required on the receipt of the Central Statistics Office estimates.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the other day that uncertainty in regard to likely developments in the situation in Northern Ireland is a major constraint in preparing economic projections for 1973-75, which must, of course, underline policy changes that are to be made in this programme.  Clearly, the two most obvious areas affected are tourism and investment in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton and Deputy FitzGerald are both mystified in this regard. I cannot understand this.  I think a child out in the street would understand what I said.  Let me spell it out. The explanation is that neither really understands that what we are talking about in the programme are projections and we are trying to get the projections as accurately as possible. Clearly, a situation which is affected by political and other developments in a part of our country, developments which are taking place at quite an accelerated rate, are factors one has to evaluate, or try to, in the light of the effect they are having on the basis of the latest statistics we can get.  The statistics, for instance, for last year as compared with the situation this year will give some guide to this, rough and ready, admittedly, but some guide.  The idea of taking the statistics for last year, which is what Deputy Bruton wants us to do, and project from them up <Col N="1756" /> to 1975 without any regard to what has been happening since is so ludicrous that I am mystified as to why he made this point.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton appears to think that one can project without any regard to the effect of the North of Ireland.  I regard this as the most arrant nonsense and I can only say that, whatever explanation there is for Deputy Bruton making this point&mdash; one can form one's own opinion; I suppose different people will have different opinions as to why he made the point but, nevertheless, he made it&mdash;there is no basis whatever for it. I will just have to leave it at that because I am at a loss for words to describe my mystification at Deputy Bruton's ignorance of the effect of what is going on in this country. While I am on the subject&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton's words are on the record and he did not at any stage refer to projections.  Not once.  He thought we were relating only to statistics for last year or, possibly, to whatever was available for this year.  The ignorance of the situation is such that it is a bit hard to find oneself lectured by people so far out of touch with what is going on in this country.  I want to tell Deputy Bruton and Deputy FitzGerald and their friend, Deputy Desmond, that when they get up here and talk about unemployment, and so on, it is noticeable that they go on as though we are <Col N="1757" /> in a cocoon and that what is happening in the North of Ireland is not affecting us.  I want to make it clear to everyone in this House, and outside it, that our economy is, in fact, under very great strain directly as a result of what is happening in the North of Ireland and the fact that we are managing as well as we are managing is a tribute to the manner in which this Government are handling the economy of this country.</P>

We could not have a Fourth Programme so how on earth could it be true, as Deputy Bruton alleges, that there was a Fourth Programme produced and that I rejected it? There is no foundation whatever for that statement. Neither is there any foundation for the allegations made by Deputy Desmond.  Maybe he will explain some time to the public why it is, if this programme is such a political platform&mdash; I think he said it was to be an election platform&mdash;he is so concerned at its nonappearance. Perhaps he will explain that.  It is, of course, in keeping with the rest of his addled thinking delivered in his usual arrogant fashion.  He has companions over there.  Form your Coalition, leave the rest of the Fine Gael Party to one side, and you will all be happy for Christmas.</P>

      <P>As far as I am aware there has been no increase in the number of such companies and only one company, which is engaged in distributing cosmetics, has introduced this method of salesmanship to Ireland.  As I have already indicated in a reply to a previous question on the 30th November, 1972, I am keeping the matter under review.  I would like to take this opportunity to repeat my exhortation to people who may feel tempted to become involved in pyramid selling, to consider the position and prospects very carefully beforehand.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The newspaper reports referred to are based on what is admitted to be an anonymous letter purporting to come from just one inspector.  Garda inspectors, as I pointed out in answer to somewhat similar questions on 22nd June last, benefited, in common with other ranks of the force, from the improved conditions recommended by the Conroy Commission.  Further improvements in pay and conditions are negotiated from time to time under the Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme which covers all ranks up to and including chief superintendent. Claims under this scheme have been made on behalf of inspectors but, as the proceedings of the conciliation council are confidential, it is not open to me to make a statement regarding them.  However, as the scheme provides full means by which claims disagreed at the conciliation stage may be <Col N="1673" /> taken to independent arbitration, I do not accept that inspectors have any grounds for dissatisfaction in this respect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army Pensions Act, 1971, provides for payment of allowances to widows of military service pensioners. Military service pensions are fixed amounts based on rank and service. Special allowances are not related to rank or service but are subject to a means test.  It would not be possible to extend the 1971 Act to provide for widows of special allowance holders in the same way as applies to widows of military service pensioners, that is half their husband's pensions with a minimum of £70.56 a year.  An estimated cost of providing the same minimum <Col N="1678" /> allowance for widows of former special allowance holders is £350,000 per annum.  An amendment of the Army Pensions Act, 1971, on the lines suggested is not contemplated.</P>

      <P>My decision on Dublin County Council's recommendations was conveyed to the council by letter dated 5th December, a copy of which, with your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the letter:</P>
      <P>Department of Local Government</P>
      <P>O'Connell Bridge House</P>
      <P>Dublin, 2.</P>
      <P>The Secretary</P>
      <P>Dublin County Council 11 Parnell Square DUBLIN 1.</P>
      <P>5th December 1972</P>
      <P>A Chara</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to refer to your letter of 17th October, 1972, regarding a scheme under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966, for the sale by Dublin County Council of houses to existing tenants and to state that he has considered the proposals put forward by the Council.</P>
      <P>As indicated in previous correspondence, a local authority making a sales scheme must base the selling prices on the market or replacement value of the houses, less the generous discounts of up to 30 per cent of these prices.  They cannot legally make, nor can the Minister approve, a scheme on any other basis.  A local authority disposing of any capital asset must have regard to the fiduciary duty they owe to the community which they represent and, in the absence of specific authority, cannot so dispose of public property as to benefit a limited section of the inhabitants to the financial detriment of the general body of ratepayers in their district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fresh housing needs are constantly arising.  In selling dwellings in their housing estates a local authority reduces the potential pool of accommodation <Col N="1682" /> available to them, as a result of vacancies, to cater for part of these needs.  Furthermore, the proceeds of sales of houses should, in large measure, be applied to the provision of new houses for letting to families in need of accommodation. In making a sale scheme, the Council cannot, therefore, ignore either the current costs of replacement dwellings or the interest rates at which they must borrow capital to provide the dwellings.  The proposal to sell houses at an effective interest rate much lower than that payable on current housing loans is analogous to a reduction in the market values assessed by the Council's valuers and could not be approved. For example, the purchase annuity proposed in the case of a semi-detached house at Glasmore Park, Swords, would, at current borrowing rates (plus 0.5 per cent for administrative costs), be sufficient to defray a 35 year loan of approximately £1,970, whereas the gross 1970 value of the house, as assessed by the Council is £3,600 and the actual all-in-cost, in December, 1967, was £2,520.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the houses in the sale scheme have been provided out of 50 year loans while the maximum lending period under sale schemes&mdash;as with all house-purchase loans&mdash;is 35 years, it is not clear how it was intended to operate the arrangement under which a tenant's purchase annuity would be adjusted over the sale period so that it would be equivalent to the Council's actual loan charges on the house, plus an additional 0.5 per cent to cover administrative and other costs.  However, even if such an arrangement were feasible it could not, for the reasons set out above, be approved in the context of a sale scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister notes that&mdash;apart from the considerably more generous discounts now available&mdash;the tenants of some of the houses comprised in the draft sale scheme could have qualified for more favourable purchase terms as regards market values and interest rates had the <Col N="1683" /> County Council made a scheme immediately after the coming into operation of the relevant regulations under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966.</P>
    <P>He could not, however, agree to a departure from basic principles which apply to all local authority sale schemes in order to compensate some tenants in County Dublin for the delay on the part of the council in making a scheme.  Were he to agree to the proposal to relate the tenant's purchase annuities in County Dublin to the interest rates payable by the County Council on the loans for the provision of the houses, he could not reasonably refuse to approve of a similar concession to all other local authorities, some of whose loans, still current, were issued at interest rates as low as 2½ per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also noted the opinion of the Council that tenants purchasing their houses under the sale scheme should receive financial benefits corresponding to those for which persons buying new private houses qualify.  An examination of the relative financial concessions available to the two categories will, however, make it clear that the balance of advantage under the existing arrangements lies substantially with the Council tenant who opts to purchase.  The following points are relevant in this regard.</P>
    <P>(1)  A private purchaser gets a maximum State grant of £325 and, in some cases, a supplementary grant of up to an equal amount&mdash;making a maximum total of £650.  His purchase price is also liable to be increased at any stage up to the closing of the contract because of rises in wages and other building costs.</P>
    <P>Under the sale scheme prepared by the Manager, a Council tenant could get a maximum discount of £575.  The purchase price of his house will, until 31st March, 1973, be on early 1970 values which, in effect now represents an additional concession of about <Col N="1684" /> £550 to £700 from public funds&mdash; making a maximum total of £1,275.</P>
    <P>(2)  A private purchaser gets a graduated remission of rates which over the nine-year period, can be worth an estimated average of £550.</P>
    <P>While the tenant purchasing his house cannot qualify for a rates remission, he has already as a rule, benefited from rent subsidies during his tenancy.  For example, in the case of the first three schemes listed in the schedule to your letter, the average rent subsidies contributed by the State and the Council up to 31st March next will have totalled approximately £370, £560 and £440 per house in the Balbriggan, Shankill and Swords schemes respectively.</P>
    <P>(3)  A private purchaser must pay legal and other fees which, in a normal case, will not be less than £150.  The tenant purchasing his house pays no legal fees or other preliminary charges&mdash; even his fire insurance is paid for him by the Council during the purchase period.</P>
    <P>(4) A private purchaser must, from his own resources, pay a deposit of about £1,200 to £2,000. A tenant need not pay any deposit.</P>
    <P>(5)  Having paid a deposit of £1,500, a person purchasing a private house corresponding to the semi-detached dwellings in in the draft sale scheme will face minimum loan repayments of £8 a week.  The tenant purchaser, despite being relieved of liability for any deposit, can obtain a good, modern, semi-detached dwelling for an annuity which ranges between £4.56 and £7.32 a week.</P>
    <P>The practical value of the financial concessions available to tenants under sales schemes has been clearly established by records of re-sales of houses bought under the schemes.  In Dublin City, for <Col N="1685" /> example, more than 100 former Corporation houses have been resold. Many of these houses have been in areas immediately adjoining the county boundry.  Disregarding all cases in which improvements had been carried out to the houses or where the contents had been sold with the houses, the following average figures result:&mdash;</P>

    <P>In the light of this experience the Minister could not agree that additional concession from public and local authority funds could be justified.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am to draw the attention of the Council to the fact that the valuations for the purpose of the sale scheme approved by this Department's letter of 23 Meán Fómhair, 1971, and adopted by the Council when preparing the revised scheme represent the estimated market values of the houses in the first half of 1970.  Having regard to the substantial increases in housing costs since then, the Minister will not be prepared to agree to the retention of these values after 31st March, 1973.  Arrangements should be made early in 1973 to re-assess the values of the houses in the light of housing costs and market conditions then prevailing so that a fresh sale scheme providing for up-to-date valuations, can be formulated.</P>

      <P>The figure of 25 per cent mentioned in the question relates to the situation as revealed by the census of population taken in 1961.  The corresponding figure at the present time is estimated to be about 14 per cent of the total housing stock and the percentage should continue to fall as the housing drive continues to expand. The fact that we have a sizeable proportion of old houses in our stock is not necessarily indicative of overall housing conditions, particularly as we have had reconstruction and improvement grant schemes in operation for about 40 years which have been used extensively to conserve and improve older houses.</P>

The Act also increased the maximum grants and changed the basis of calculating grants from the number of rooms in a house to the floor area of the house.  The purpose of the changes was to encourage the building of the moderately sized houses for which there was&mdash;and is&mdash;greatest need and demand to ensure that a greater number of dwellings are provided for the amount of capital spent on housing, and to promote greater flexibility of design according to modern tastes and requirements.</P>

      <P>In the case of lands acquired for housing the costs of acquisition are charged in due course to the loans raised for the schemes which attract subsidy.

      <P>Provisions for the licensing, control and supervision of places used for public dancing are contained in the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935.  The main statutory provisions with which I am concerned are contained in the Fire Brigades Act, 1940. That Act empowers sanitary authorities to inspect any buildings which are believed to be, or suspected to be, potentially dangerous from a fire point of view and, if necessary, to take steps to have specified changes made in the interests of fire safety.  I am satisfied that existing legislative provisions confer reasonable powers on local authorities to exercise control in relation to fire danger in the type of premises mentioned by the Deputy and I am satisfied that inspections are being carried out, and follow-up action taken, where appropriate.</P>
      <P>To guide and assist local authorities, and others, the Department has prepared, and made available, fire protection standards providing guidelines in structural fire protection, fire fighting equipment, means of escape and fire drills and evacuation procedures.</P>
      <P>I have appealed to all sanitary authorities to step up their fire prevention operations and have encouraged them to appoint special fire prevention officers.</P>

      <P>Planning permission for the development was refused by the Dublin County Council on 15th October, 1971, on the grounds that the plans did not provide for additional car parking facilities and that in consequence, the proposed development would create a traffic hazard.</P>
      <P>The decision of the planning authority was appealed to me on 9th November, 1971.

      <P>The recent terminations, at the instance of the contractor, of a mails conveyance contract serving Mountmellick necessitated a revision of postal arrangements in the area.  The most efficient and economic arrangement involved a slight disimprovement in standard of service.  Since 1st November, 1972, postal delivery in Mountmellick commences at 8.10 a.m.  and finishes at 10.10 a.m.  and the evening despatch is made at 6.50 p.m.  The delivery times are 25 minutes later than formerly and the despatch time is 30 minutes earlier.  A revision to the former time of despatch under the new arrangements would have undesirable features from the staffing point of view and is not considered warranted.

      <P>As Deputies may know, the periods of broadcasting fixed by the authority are subject to my approval.  The suggestion attributed to an RTE spokesman in recent Press reports that RTE's decision was necessary in order to comply with a Ministerial order is simply untrue.  In 1964, the authority sought and obtained approval for additional hours of television broadcasting on Sundays between October and May for the purpose of providing continuous television programmes on Sunday afternoons.  This is a continuing approval.  I took up with the authority the matter mentioned in the quessins and they have arranged to resume continuous television broadcasting on Sunday afternoons.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 147, 148 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>As a general rule I consider it undesirable that communications between myself or my Department and RTE should be published.  In view, however, of the statement issued by the former chairman of RTE, and as the texts of the authority's letters sent to me on 15th October, 1971, and 23rd November, 1972, were issued with that statement, I propose, with the permission, of the Ceann Comhairle, to have copies of my letters of 27th October, 1971 and 21st November, 1972, circulated with the Official Report.  I dealt very fully with the subject matter of these questions on 13th December, 1972, in my reply to the debate on the Estimate for my Department.</P>

      <P>I have received your letter of 15th October on the subject of my direction of 1st October under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  I do not consider it proper for me to enter into correspondence on the subject of the direction, which speaks for itself, and for this reason I am refraining from commenting on the contents of your letter.</P>

    <P>As you are aware, Radio Telefís Éireann broadcast a programme between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.  on Sunday, 19th November, 1972, which was in contravention of the direction issued to Radio Telefís Éireann on 1st October, 1971 under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  I must request you to summon a meeting of the authority as a matter of immediate urgency for the purpose of enabling the authority to consider the action it proposes to take in connection with this matter.</P>
    <P>It is essential that I should have before 6 p.m. on Thursday next, 23rd November, a firm indication in writing of what action the authority proposes to take.</P>

This amendment is necessary as the statutory authority for the payment of these grants expired on 31st March last.</P>
