      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>While the advice of the Attorney General is confidential, I can say that, as a result of the observations of the Attorney General on the effects of the Northern Ireland Act, 1972, it has been decided that a further application to the European Commission of Human Rights is called for as part of our original case to that body and such action has been taken.  In these circumstances, I am not in a position to make a detailed statement as the matter is <i>sub judice</i> before the commission.</P>

    <P>I do not consider that action in relation to the International Court of <Col N="1118" /> Justice is called for in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Trial borings were carried out before the acquisition of the site was approved. They indicated that in general the site was suitable for the purposes of building a hospital.  Further borings will be necessary to determine which sections of the site can be most economically developed and the Southern Health Board are being asked to make the necessary arrangements in that regard.</P>
      <P>Decisions were conveyed to the former health authority regarding the total number of beds to be provided in the new hospital.  Questions have since been raised regarding certain details and a meeting is to be held in the near future with officers of the Southern Health Board to discuss these matters.</P>
      <P>It will probably take about two and half years before the planning of the hospital is completed.  The question of inviting tenders will be considered at that stage in the light of the general level of funds likely to be available for hospital building projects in the following years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers </NameTxt>
      <P>The sale of the old St. Vincent's Hospital, which is the property of the Irish Sisters of Charity, is a private transaction.  I have no knowledge, therefore, of what financial conditions obtain in regard to the disposal of the moneys accruing from the sale of the hospital.</P>
      <P>Other extensive property which is owned by the Sisters in the area, including the private nursing homes fronting on Lower Leeson Street, is being transferred by them to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that an agreement was entered into either by Mr. MacEntee or Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly that in consideration for a 100 per cent grant for the building of a new hospital <Col N="1121" /> at Elm Park the existing hospital would revert to the State for disposal by the State?  Was not such an agreement entered into?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what was the initial agreement.  The present situation is that as the Sisters of Charity provided the site for the new hospital it was considered they would dispose of the property in their own way&mdash;that is the property at St. Stephen's Green&mdash;and that in respect of the property at 93-99 Lower Leeson Street, Nos. 1 to 9 at Leeson Lane, when sold the value would be transferred to the State.  I have no reason to suppose that the Sisters of Charity would make use of the funds which they may receive from the sale of property at St. Stephen's Green for any other purpose than the advancement of the objectives of the Order, namely, the care of the sick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne </NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that he does not know of any such agreement.  I would ask the Minister a specific question: was there any such agreement?  Secondly, is it not a fact that the Hospitals Sweep Fund gets a subvention of something in the region of £7 million from the Exchequer.  In those circumstances, if an agreement of the kind I have mentioned was entered into, would it not be appropriate that the funds accruing from the sale of this building should be paid over to the Sweep Fund and in that way save the taxpayer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the Deputy the present condition.  Having regard to the fact that the hospital cost £4½ million to build, it follows a wide precedent in making grants available to private persons, the value of which they retain to be used for the public interest.  There is no difference between that and the establishment of an industry where grants are given by the Industrial Development Authority.  The assets so received become the property of the industry concerned.  The same applies to hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a specific question to elicit certain information. During the time I was Minister I insisted on the implementation of <Col N="1122" /> such an agreement, that the hospital would revert to the health authority and that it would be used by the Dublin Corporation for old people&mdash; that was the purpose I had in mind&mdash; and that a full 100 per cent grant would be given for the Elm Park hospital.  Those were generous conditions. What happened to that agreement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers </NameTxt>
      <P>The hospitalisation rate in any area is influenced by a variety of factors.  Such factors are the attitude of the hospital staff, the availability of beds, the attitude of the public, <Col N="1123" /> the marriage rate and the rates of emigration and unemployment, the demographic structure, social and geographic isolations and, possibly, differences in the prevalence rates.  It would be impossible without careful research to say whether the hospitalisation rate in any area should be lower. The Medico-Social Research Board has undertaken a psychiatric morbidity study in three rural areas&mdash;Carlow and South Kildare, Roscommon and Westmeath, one of low, one of high and one of medium hospitalised morbidity.  This study should provide valuable data to help in the research for the reasons which have led to our present high hospitalisation rates in the psychiatric field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If the Deputies want to have further questions about the relationship between Britain and our Government they should put them to the Taoiseach.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 16, 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>The present position in regard to the three countries mentioned is that we are already represented by non-resident Ambassadors in Luxembourg and Norway and that we have no diplomatic representation in Japan.  I do not consider it appropriate to discuss publicly the question of deciding on any change in that position.  As I have already indicated it is open to any Deputy who has a view in a particular case to make this known to the Government.</P>
      <P>As capital costs of establishing a mission would arise only where premises are purchased instead of rented and would vary from country to country no meaningful general estimate can be given.</P>
      <P>Finally, financial considerations are only one of the factors involved in a decision to establish diplomatic relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell me if the fact that we have four times as much trade with Japan as we have with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics would be a factor in deciding the relative urgency of establishing embassies in those two countries and could he further tell me if the fact that we would need to lobby support in the Councils of the EEC would also be a factor weighing in favour of the early establishment of formal embassies in both Norway and Luxembourg?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Leinwall Collection.  This collection was not offered to the State but was the subject of a proposal for a James Joyce Centre at Sandycove, County Dublin, to be developed by the Eastern Regional Development Organisation in association with the James Joyce Foundation Ltd.</P>
      <P>The proposal was examined by Bord Fáilte in consultation with the other interests concerned and as a result the board recommended the giving of a guaranteed loan by me under the Tourist Traffic Acts in respect of 60 per cent of the moneys required to finance the project.  In addition, the board were willing to provide interest grants in respect of the loan.  In September, 1970, I agreed in principle to the giving of the guarantee but a definite proposal on these lines has not emerged.</P>
      <P>It now appears that this collection has been donated to a university in the United States.</P>

I understand that the unions are in negotiation with CIE about proposals for improvements in the superannuation scheme for serving wages grade staff but that agreement has not yet been reached. <Col N="1134" /> There are no proposals to review the pension levels of retired employees.  I would like to point out that the CIE wages grade pensions were designed to supplement the social welfare benefits and these benefits have been increased considerably in recent years.  The minimum income of a married pensioner who retired since April, 1963, is now £10.90 a week.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Council of Ministers of the EEC at its meeting on 3rd December, 1971, adopted a programme of action on the future development of a common transport policy.  Included in this programme, for consideration during 1972, are a number of proposals designed to give financial and managerial autonomy to railway companies.  I assume that these are the proposals to which the Deputy is referring.</P>
      <P>Details of the proposals are not yet available and it is not possible, therefore, to make any assessment at this stage of their likely effect on CIE operations.</P>

      <P>The administration of public assistance is subject to my general direction and control under the provisions of the Public Assistance Act, 1939.  The Public Assistance (General Regulations) Order, 1942, made in accordance with that Act is the present basis for the method of administering home assistance by the <Col N="1136" /> local public assistance authorities. Each such authority is obliged to give every person in its district who is unable by his own industry or other lawful means to provide for himself the necessaries of life such public assistance as it appears to it to be necessary or proper for that purpose. The Act precludes me from directing the giving of assistance to any individual person.</P>
      <P>I may perhaps take this opportunity to say that considerable work has been done on the preparation of proposals to reform the assistance services, including home assistance, and these have now reached an advanced stage. I expect to be in a position to submit my proposals to the Government for approval in the near future and I would hope to be able to introduce the necessary legislation later this year.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>(1)  Acquisition and division of land is a continuing process.  During the past 12 months 4 properties, aggregating 156 acres, have been allocated in this area while a further 4 properties, aggregating 147 acres, came on hands.</P>
    <P>(2)  It is not possible to indicate when the individual estates listed will be allotted but preliminary plans for division of some 400 acres are at present being prepared and it is hoped to allocate at least part of this area during the present season.</P>

      <P>The grants payable under the higher education grants scheme relate only to students who have obtained at least grade C in honours papers in four subjects at the leaving certificate examination.  These grants are related to the costs involved in attending courses in higher education and it would not be appropriate that the fees charged for matriculation or other university entrance examination should form part of the grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that an entrance fee of £7 <Col N="1144" /> for matriculation on entries up to 1st March and a further £4 in addition if the entry is received after 1st March, bringing the total to £11, is exorbitant? Does he realise the drain that is on the working man's pocket especially in view of the fact that we are told about all the free education there is at present.  The matter deserves reconsideration if the Minister is honest in what he says about free education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of what transpired at the meeting referred to by the Deputy.  My Department's plans for the whole of this area stretching eastwards from Artane and Coolock to the coast provide for over 12,500 post-primary school places being made available on a phased basis to meet demand as it arises.  A substantial number of these places have already been provided, sites have been reserved for further building and this building will take place as required. The criticisms of a few individual school principals were related to the timing of the expansion of their own particular schools.  My Department is satisfied that existing accommodation supplemented by some prefabricated classrooms will be adequate to meet the demand for places next September but that additional permanent building will be required by September, 1973.  Steps are being taken in accordance with the Department's plans to provide further permanent <Col N="1147" /> accommodation in this area by September, 1973.  The views expressed by the parents at the Kilbarrack meeting will be considered in relation to developments in that part of the area.</P>

Some minor changes relating to the administration of the Scheme were also made.</P>
      <P>As regards the export guarantee scheme for beef the support payments for exports of beef to Britain were fixed early in 1969 at 0.52p (1¼d) per lb. below the level on which UK deficiency payments were made on fat cattle.  As from the 31st January, 1972, this differential was reduced to 0.104p (1¼d) per lb.  Proposals for seasonal adjustments in subsidy rates announced in March, 1971, did not come into operation by reason of the low level of deficiency payments since last April.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there has been criticism regarding An Coimisiún's handling of some dumping complaints.

An Coimisiún must have regard to these provisions in carrying out their investigations and making their recommendations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will set up an inquiry into the differential rents system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The general principles of differential renting and the provisions of some individual renting schemes have been debated at length in this House on a number of occasions in recent years, especially in relation to the Votes for my Department. They have been discussed at meetings which I have had with public representatives and local officials and with members of tenants' organisations. They have also been examined at local meetings attended by representatives of local authorities and their tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In consequence of these examinations by the parties most directly concerned, <Col N="1157" /> I am satisfied that there is a general recognition of the equity of the system as it is at present operated and is accepted by the 95 per cent or so of the local authority tenants who are paying rents assessed on that basis.  In the circumstances I do not consider that an inquiry on the lines suggested is necessary, or would be opportune, at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says this system is accepted by the tenants. If it were accepted there would not have been the strikes we have had during the last 12 months.  Would the Minister reconsider this matter?  It is important the tenants should have a say in an inquiry.  It is not possible to say that this is an equitable system because it is not uniform throughout the country.  There are different standards in Dundalk and Cork and Galway and Dublin.  The Minister will have the tenants in Dublin out on strike in the next six months unless he holds this inquiry and there will be no possibility of bringing an end to the strikes already in existence unless the tenants have an assurance that an inquiry will be held and their views will be heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the time is opportune for such an inquiry. Under the 1966 Act the management and control of all local authority dwellings are primarily matters for the local authority.  It is with the local authority that the tenants must reach agreement in cases where they are dissatisfied or in dispute and in regard to any concessions the local authority give the moneys to meet these concessions will have to be found by that local authority.  I do not think it would be proper for me to intervene in individual disputes.  I assure the Deputy that at this particular point of time I do not think it is opportune to hold such an inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The tenants do not believe, and I am not sure myself, that the final word rests with the local authorities because agreements have to be sanctioned by the Minister and there is no point in a tenant organisation coming to an agreement with <Col N="1158" /> the local authority if the local authority has not the final word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Managers in negotiating matters like this must work within the framework of the existing law. There is plenty of scope within the existing law to negotiate with tenants. The Minister comes in when agreement has been reached.  It is only right and proper that the manager should submit the agreement or scheme to the Department to ensure that it is, in fact, within the existing law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Managers of local authorities have expressed views to the effect that this system is inequitable. Why does the Minister not consider the present time opportune?  Strikes are taking place and the situation is likely to escalate in the near future.  If the Minister is so sure the system is equitable why is he afraid of an inquiry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree there are wide divergences between the different local authorities? Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation scheme is very different from that of Dublin County Council and the latter is quite different from that of Dublin Corporation.  Would the Minister not agree there should be a departmental committee, or a committee of this House, or some form of committee to bring about a model differential renting scheme with uniformity of application so that tenants all over the country would be fairly treated and wide variations would be eliminated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Each differential renting scheme operated by the various local authorities is not, as the Deputy says, identical.  There are differences.  I should like to see the ideal situation in which there would be complete uniformity. At the same time, there is a certain element of local democracy operating here and that may be a good thing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

The fact that there is a difference between some differential rent schemes need not necessarily be a fault in the system.  In fact, it may allow for a better tailoring of the schemes to suit the individual needs of different areas.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I stated that the only fault I had to find with this Bill is that I believe it does not go far enough.  Instead of £70 million over the next three or four years the ACC should get power to spend at least £70 million per year.  A huge injection of money is necessary.  We are entering a huge market in the EEC.  There are millions of acres of arable land.  We have men who can produce the goods if they get the tools which are needed.  They need money at present. As Ireland is an agricultural country, if the people on the land are wealthy the whole nation will be wealthy.  If they are in poverty, the rest of the nation will be in poverty.  It is necessary that farmers should get capital. They will not get the money for nothing but will have to pay interest on it.  They should get this money as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Last night Deputy Creed appealed to those who had emigrated and had money to send their money home here for investment purposes.  I claimed last night that we should repatriate some of our external assets which now stand at about £500 million.  Those in our community who have money in banks, and who have been very conservative, should take out that money and invest it in the ACC.  Their deposits will give them a good return.  Such investment would be gilt-edged, backed by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACC should be in a position to give the farmers the necessary £70 million per year.  The agricultural industry is the very foundation of the country's economy.  The coming years may be hard but in the EEC we are entering a market of 250 million people.  We have a guarantee that if <Col N="1172" /> the farmers can produce goods from the land they will have a ready market for them.  Farmers will have stability, knowing that if they can increase their production they will have a ready market for it.  In the past if they increased production they often found that the bottom had fallen out of the market for the goods produced.  There was no encouragement for them to increase production.  That will not happen in the future.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should have a proper programme and a grand design for agriculture in the future.  No such programme exists at the present time.  If the Department show more initiative and co-operate with farmers' organisations and the ACC we could have a proper programme.  The ACC could finance it and there would be a very bright future ahead for the farmers and people of this country.  There is great disparity at present between investment in agriculture and investment in industry.  Investment in agriculture this year will be between £15 million and £18 million.  At the same time, we know the Government are investing £95 million in industry.  I have always believed that industry and agriculture should be treated equally.  Neither should be neglected.  They are interdependent. Industry cannot prosper without a good home market.  If the people on the land who purchase their goods are not prosperous, industry cannot prosper.  The programme which I mentioned could be financed by an injection of capital.  With a proper injection of capital the farmers of Ireland could treble their output and instead of produce worth £470 million at the present time they could produce goods worth £1,490 million.  This would be an increase of £1,020 million.</P>
    <P>Experts have stated that such an increase is well within the biological limits of livestock population growth. Our farmers are capable of producing much more.  They need more money. Indirectly they could help in an industry which is going through hard times at present and which is of the utmost importance, namely, the dead meat industry.  Many farmers have to <Col N="1173" /> sell cattle in the autumn because they have not money to buy feedingstuffs or artificial manure to put on their land to ensure early grass.  They have to sell in September or October.  If fewer cattle were sold in the autumn and more remained to be sold in the spring, this would help the dead meat industry which is of vital importance to the country.</P>
    <P>People will say that the farmers are being mollycoddled again.  The money they get will have to be paid for.  Farmers paid back money in the past.  The ACC have been repaid by the farmers although some of them may be slow with their payments.  The money has been well spent in increasing production. The increase in farmers' incomes has helped the nation.  It is imperative that it should be understood that agriculture needs a huge injection of money in order to make it more efficient.  We all want to see agriculture more efficient and competitive before we enter the EEC.  The prospects are now much better for farmers than they have been. The majority of our people reside in cities and towns and they may feel that they will not benefit from this money.  If agriculture expands over the years, having got money, 80,000 people who are unemployed might be employed. More employment could be provided. More jobs would be created in non-farming occupations.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that additional credit was required for agricultural processing industries, milk, pigmeat and pig processing industries. Money invested with the ACC could be used to advantage if the Government had a proper plan.  Farmers will have to purchase new equipment of many kinds such as bulk milk carriers, tankers, trucks, jeeps, tractors, silage harvesters, silos, milking parlours and other farm buildings.  Extra drainage will have to be carried out on the land. The ACC will provide money for this work.  Extra drainage equipment must be purchased.  Extra fertilisers to manure the land will be necessary.  The ACC can provide money also for that.</P>
    <P>Extra creamery equipment will be necessary if the farmers wish to become more efficient.  If they got extra money they could build additional cow houses, <Col N="1174" /> out-offices, silage pits, and they could spend more on fertilisers, medicines, paints and so on.  Frequently farmers cannot afford to pay the veterinary surgeon's fees even though they realise their animals need attention.  If the farmers had extra money more would be spent on feeding stuffs, on compounds, and medicines; they would be able to build new houses for themselves and to install electrical appliances.  By ensuring that the farmers got additional money the benefits will be felt throughout the rest of the community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that additional credit would be required for the agricultural processing industry. I am pointing out that if the farmers get this money it will be well spent. The Agricultural Credit Corporation give money for the drainage of land, for the improvement of land and for fertilisers.  If the farmer wants to become more efficient he is entitled to get these things and his wife, who works very hard, is entitled to have the most up-to-date equipment in her house and to have a comfortable home.  In speaking of these matters I do not know if I am drifting far from the Bill we are discussing.</P>
      <P>Any expansion or development in agriculture automatically results in the expansion of employment in factories and in the sectors about which the Minister has spoken.  These are the processing of agricultural produce, creameries, powdered milk, chocolate crumb, sugar, vegetables, cheese, animal foods, meats, pork, bacon; in the processing of these goods many thousands of workers are employed. It is important in the national interest to point out that the nation will prosper when our agricultural industry prospers.</P>

      <P>I did not.  The Deputy should read what I said.  I have no hesitation in repeating what I said.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I always thought the ACC could give money to farmers only for the purpose of buying land.  I am 20 years in politics but I have never known of anyone getting money from the ACC if he did not have land or was not a farmer's son.  It annoys me sometimes when we make representation on behalf of an individual to get <Col N="1176" /> a letter from the corporation stating that the person concerned was not deemed eligible for a loan but they do not give any reason.  In such an event I often tell the person that it might be no harm to go to a Fianna Fáil Deputy or someone who has influence. In a fortnight the applicant will come back to me with a letter from a director of the ACC stating that the applicant will get the loan.</P>
    <P>This is wrong.  Those who are entitled to loans should get them irrespective of whoever makes representations on their behalf.  The officials know their work and they will give money to applicants they believe are entitled to the money.  If I recommend a person and if the ACC claim that, from the knowledge they have, he is not entitled to the money I do not object, but I am annoyed when it transpires that someone else can bring some pressure to bear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Recently a farm of 94 statute acres at Leney, Ballinalack, or Ballinafid, Mullingar, was sold to joint buyers, both nurses in Mullingar Mental Hospital.  Their income is £1,700 per year each and the price was £13,500 for the land.  The position is that they bought it at an excessive price and against genuine local farmers and on the assumption that they could borrow the money from the ACC.  This application was duly processed by us and was refused as they were not entitled to such a loan.  Despite this refusal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to check this matter and to let me know if nurses are entitled to get a loan of £13,500 in order to buy land.  People who can only be regarded as speculators are bidding against deserving farmers in order to get land.</P>
      <P>I want to say that I welcome the Bill but I hope that those matters will be looked into and that the Parliamentary Secretary now or at any time within the next week can give me a satisfactory answer as to why those two persons got loans for this farm and say whether he is prepared at any time in the future to give loans to nurses and persons with £1,700 a year to buy land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the other speakers, welcome what is contained in this Bill.  We are all agreed that farmers need a great injection of capital into their business in order to be able to compete in the EEC, which we hope to join in the next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards what Deputy L'Estrange said, I do not like castigating people. We should congratulate everybody connected with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  They are doing a good job.  I find them, from the chairman and board of directors down to the area officers, very fair.  They will listen to anyone who puts up a fair case. They are not involved in politics.  They are of all shades of opinion.  I have met the area officers and have found them <Col N="1178" /> to be very fair.  Sometimes they refuse applications.  I have been involved in applications which were refused, and rightly so.  Deputies have said that when they reply to letters from them the reply is merely a matter of courtesy and that the application is refused.  In many cases the corporation have private information which they are not likely to divulge and it is their business to ensure, when they give loans, that the money will be well spent and will be given to a person who has a viable proposition.</P>
    <P>I notice that the corporation will be empowered under the Bill to go to the World Bank and to foreign markets for money.  That is only right and proper.  It could happen that they would not be able to get sufficient money on the home market.  The demand on the corporation from the farming community will increase because farmers cannot borrow from the bank a loan repayable over 15 to 20 years.  They may get credit from a bank repayable in three or four years.</P>
    <P>In the case of a dwellinghouse, the corporation are willing to grant a loan repayable over 30 years.  That is a long term.  One does not expect a bank to give such extended credit.  That is not their normal function.  The rate of interest charged by the Agricultural Credit Corporation is more than competitive, which makes it very popular with the farming community in general.</P>
    <P>There is a category of persons with whom the corporation should be more lenient in granting loans for dwelling-houses. A young farmer inheriting land, the poor law valuation of which may be £64, would not be entitled to get a county council loan.  He would have to go to a building society.  Building societies have a very strict rule that they will not lend money for the erection of dwellinghouses outside the urban areas. Therefore, the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be lenient with such applicants.</P>
    <P>A farmer applying to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan for the erection of a dwellinghouse may give the information that he intends to cater for farm holidays.  In that case the loan will not be sanctioned.  A broader view should be taken of this <Col N="1179" /> matter.  If the farmer builds the house and then adds a section which can be used for farm holidays, the loan will be sanctioned for the original part of the house, regardless of the size of the house.  The fact that the farmer intends to cater for farm holidays should not influence the decision.  It may be suggested that this has nothing to do with agriculture.  It has something to do with agriculture because the farmer concerned is anxious to make his holding more profitable by inviting people to stay with him.  That should be encouraged.  The rule should be changed so that his stated intention to cater for farm holidays would not disqualify him for a loan.</P>
    <P>A young farmer who inherits land or buys land or who has a small farm can get a loan of approximately £6,000. Many people claim that more money should be available for the purchase of land but you could run into trouble there because if money were freely available for land it might inflate the price.</P>
    <P>The corporation should work in closer liaison with the Land Commission in regard to the purchase of land. If the Land Commission were to select two or three small farmers for the purchase of a farm, those farmers should get the chance of going as a group to the corporation for a loan for that purpose. The Land Commission could recommend them to the corporation and then the loan should be sanctioned. A sum of £6,000 is not a great deal when it comes to purchasing land. Undoubtedly, it is a great help to a farmer who wants to make an addition to his holding.  The Land Commission could select those farmers who, in their opinion, were the most suitable for the purpose of purchasing a local large holding and, on their recommendation, the money should be made available by the corporation.  Last week we discussed the question of land bonds.  This would be one way of getting over the problem.  The vendor would be paid in cash which, in the main, would be supplied by the corporation.  I would ask the Minister to consider the question of closer liaison between the Land Commission and the corporation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> The corporation is the bank that the farmers of Ireland will apply to for money.  In the years ahead money will have to be poured into agriculture.  Our young farmers are not afraid to borrow and they should be encouraged to use credit.  In many countries a person over a certain age must have a credit card if he wants to borrow money.  No matter what amount of security he might have a man of 45 years of age will not get credit unless he has proved his ability to repay.  Young farmers should be encouraged to borrow from the corporation and, once having proved their ability to repay, they would be in a position to borrow larger amounts in later years on the production of a credit card.</P>
    <P>Once again I should like to congratulate all those concerned with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  They are doing a fine job.  When people apply to them for loans they have to decide on their creditworthiness.  In the main, their decisions are very fair.  I completely agree with the Bill and, if it is necessary, I hope we will be coming back seeking more money for the corporation, for the benefit of the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The usual reaction to a Bill of this kind is to say that it is very welcome and will be a benefit to a particular section, the agricultural community in this instance, and that its sponsors, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, a State-sponsored body, are doing an excellent job.  It has been said that they do a good job, that they have a tough job and that their position is a very difficult one, and so on. I do not know whether it is or not.  I have no information at my disposal to make a factual appraisal of their work.  Neither has Deputy Meaney unless he has some inside information of which I am not aware.  Neither has Deputy L'Estrange.  I am sure they have only the same information that I have, an abbreviated report which gives no details of their administrative dealings with loan applications.  It does not give any idea of how many applications were received and how many rejected.  It tells you how many were approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> At one time I would have said that a body like the ACC were very good and, indeed, essential, as they are in a country like ours where so many people are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.  But I am not satisfied that there is sufficient information at my disposal or at the disposal of any Members of the House to enable us to say, and stand over it, that the corporation are doing a good job.  Over many years I have advocated that there should be a committee of this House to delve into the affairs of State-sponsored bodies.  I make that appeal again today.  We should have more firsthand information from all State-sponsored bodies as to how they carry on their business. We, as the people's representatives, should be in a position to assess their work from much closer scrutiny of it than we can get from these annual reports which give little or no information.</P>
    <P>That is a big defect; the autonomy of State-sponsored bodies is almost absolute.  What business can this Parliament do?  How can we assess their work?  We have no knowledge of the yardstick by which they measure a loan application.  I say this because when I came in here I thought the ACC were being set up by the State to help farmers in financial difficulties, particularly small farmers, and that those were the main type of people they were obliged to help, farmers who might not be able to get credit from other sources such as banks.  The State-sponsored body, I understood, would act as a sort of fairy godmother and give them loans at a reasonable rate of interest and help them by providing capital to develop their holdings and improve their living standards.  To my mind, and from my knowledge, the ACC are not doing that job.  Why do I say that when I said a while ago that I was not very conversant with the functioning of the ACC?  My information in that regard is based on the fact that I have consistently advised people to go to the ACC for loans, that it was the best and most likely organisation to give them the money, only to find numbers of them coming back to me and saying: &ldquo;That was sound advice; <Col N="1182" /> there is nothing coming from them.&rdquo; Many of these people were then forced to go to hire purchase concerns and pay three or four times the rate of interest when they needed agricultural machinery and so on.</P>
    <P>My line and my party's line is that the primary obligation of State-sponsored bodies such as the ACC is to help the small man.  I have heard of people with large holdings in public companies and in gilt-edged securities who do not interfere with these holdings but avail of the ACC to borrow money for current needs as it is easier and cheaper for them to do that rather than interfere with their existing investments. Surely that is not the type of person who is supposed to benefit by the Agricultural Credit Corporation but apparently that is the type of person who has no difficulty in getting a loan approved without much delay.  I fear the main yardstick applied to applications in Harcourt Street is whether the applicant is in a position to repay the loan, whether he is credit-worthy. If the ACC never existed such people would not be short of capital but when it comes to the small farmer with seven, eight, nine, ten, 12 or 14 cows, if he applies there is a rigid investigation and more often than not &mdash;I cannot give figures since the report does not supply the figures&mdash;his application is rejected.  Then we are told that we know all and that we should congratulate the 176 people employed in the ACC doling loans to needy farmers.</P>
    <P>According to the report the number of loans approved in 1971 was exceptionally small, something over 6,000. How many were refused?  Is the greater part of the £8 million and the greater part of the increase in transactions reflected only in the money end of it? There is no upward trend except in money: in regard to applications it does not exist.  In 1966-67 the number of applications was 7,521; in 1970-71 it was 6,617.  The money has increased from £3,851,000 in 1966-67 to £8,646,000 in the last year.  Who is getting that money?  Are the combines getting it?  How many of them are getting it?  What ceiling is set for them? Are this corporation devoting too much of their time and too much of their work to financing people who can <Col N="1183" /> prove to them in effect that they do not really want the money, that if they are refused, they can get it elsewhere. Naturally, because of interest rates generally, even the wealthiest farmers and big combines will try to get their money at the low rate which it is offered by the corporation.</P>
    <P>Following advertising on television by the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the production by them of a very colourful brochure, many small farmers applied for loans in the belief that the money would be forthcoming within a few weeks.  However, they found that that was not the position because anyone who had a bank overdraft of, say, £300 or £400, or who was in the red to his creamery to the extent of £200 or £300, would not be considered as being creditworthy.  I agree with the system of having independent officers for the purpose of investigating a person's creditworthiness.  I was one of the people who advocated officers as we know them, employed by the corporation for this purpose.  In the past investigations were carried out in a rather backhanded and shady manner. A letter was sent to the sergeant at the local Garda station asking if such a person might be regarded as being creditworthy.  Before that system was changed I discussed the matter with the late Mr. Kiely and pointed out to him the desirability of appointing independent officers.  My information regarding those who are turned down for loans is very limited but not any more limited than that of any other Deputy.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the not too distant future there will be set up representative committees of this House, not necessarily big committees, for the purpose of examining and reporting back to this House as to the administration of public bodies so that we can have a break down of expenditure and so on.  Of course there will be no question of any deviation from the confidential nature of applications. In respect of the body we are discussing now, we should know how many people were turned down for loans, what were the general reasons for turning them down and would a farmer <Col N="1184" /> whose valuation was about £20 be turned down because he owed money to his bank or to his creamery?  At the moment all any of us can have is limited information such as we get from individual cases we encounter. However, we are aware that the number of applications approved is not increasing. That is surprising when one realises the need there is for agricultural credit and having regard to the favourable rates of interest charged by the corporation.</P>
    <P>It upsets me when I hear of a man being turned down by the corporation for money which he needs to buy some piece of farm equipment because that man will then have no alternative but to put himself in the hands of moneylenders&mdash;hire purchase companies which, at least in some cases, are charging as much as 30 per cent interest on loans.  On previous occasions here I raised the question of the lending rates of such bodies with Deputy Haughey when he was Minister for Finance.  Some of these people are no better than usurers.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy representing an area where there are many small farmers, and medium farmers, too, requiring capital, and whose integrity is not in any doubt, I say that the corporation should come to the aid of these people. They need the money because of various difficulties confronting them&mdash; difficulties arising from the decline in the value of money and from lower income returns from their holdings. Also, there are farmers, big and small, who are educating their children and this imposes quite a financial burden on them.</P>
    <P>Urban dwellers, seeing the corporation's advertisements on television, could hardly be blamed for thinking that all these people had to do was to make application for a loan and the money would be given without delay.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us more information than was supplied in his brief.  I want him to tell us the number of applications received by the corporation in the recent financial years up to 1971.  Also, I want him to classify these applications&mdash;how many were received from farmers with valuations of less than £10, how many were received from farmers with <Col N="1185" /> valuation of less than £20 or £30 and how many were approved or rejected. This is the sort of information that we cannot get by way of tabling questions but it is information that we need in order to be able to assess the work of the corporation.</P>
    <P>I am not being critical of the corporation. It would be more appropriate to be critical of the type of legislation we enact here, legislation that precludes the elected representatives of the people from getting in detail information regarding State-sponsored bodies.  That kind of legislation should be implemented to enable us to make an assessment as to whether or not this board is doing a good job.  This document does not give us much information about the board's activities.  It tells us a little about the board's borrowing powers.  The kind of business they want now is, I think, lending facilities for the big combines.  The emphasis is on loans for the big people, the combines and the big farmers.</P>
    <P>It is seldom we get an opportunity of discussing the operations of this board here.  If an applicant applies for a loan and that applicant is well-to-do, with possibly a great many investments of his own, is his application approved or rejected?  Is this money being made available, in other words, to people who are not in needy circumstances?  I am fearful that it is.  I am not sure what the position is and neither is any other Deputy as far as I know.  It is all very well to send out these colourful brochures.  I am not aware personally of the position outlined by Deputy L'Estrange this afternoon but, if the Deputy's statement is correct, then this body is working on a rather crooked line.  Is it true that applicants who do not measure up to the qualifications of the board get loans through political influence?  It is all right to make representations on behalf of an applicant legally entitled to a loan who may be in some difficulty but, if what Deputy L'Estrange alleges is happening, that is all the more reason for establishing a body to inquire into the activities of the board.</P>
    <P>I am here a fairly long time now but I am not yet sufficiently long to be in a position to make a factual <Col N="1186" /> appraisal of this State-sponsored body because I just have not got all the requisite knowledge.  I stress this in the hope that my suggestion will bear fruit.  It is not so long since I stressed the idea of making known to the public, the people who contributed the money, the grants paid to hoteliers. That was laughed at.  It was stated that such information would be a breach of confidence; this, that and the other would happen.  However, after pressure, the Government had to concede the point.  Now I am trying to get the same kind of result so far as the Agricultural Credit Corporation is concerned.  Possibly it would benefit the corporation if that information were made public.  Possibly the corporation is doing a great job.  The trouble is this kind of brochure does not give us the information we really need and we have to rely on what we get from outside sources and those outside sources are the borrowers, particularly the rejected borrowers. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us how many are rejected.</P>
    <P>This report contains a very interesting item.  It is headed &ldquo;The Smallholder&rdquo;. They are in tears over him in Harcourt Street:</P>
    <P>I am not prepared, however, to write off the Irish smallholder as an historical anachronism.  Much of this country's strength, moral and material, has come from the smallholder and he still has a vital and influential role to play in our society.  I do not believe, and my experience confirms me in this, that the smallholders, for long the backbone of our country, will allow the advantages which were gained by the sacrifices of succeeding generations to be lost through failing to adapt to modern economic requirements.</P>
    <P>What exactly is that calling for?  It is calling out for what I am calling for here.  It is calling for better conditions for smallholders and, by better conditions, I mean treating the smallholder's application more sympathetically. If he is down in the creamery and in the bank, do not write him off.  That has happened time and again.  If he was not down <Col N="1187" /> he would not be applying for credit to the corporation.  I maintain the corporation is not standing fairly and squarely by the smallholder and I hope we will get a breakdown of the applicants who were rejected.  I believe that, when we get that breakdown, we will find that it is mainly the smallholder who is denied a loan while the big fellow, who does not need it, gets it.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of reading in the chairman's address but there is very little information that would be helpful to Deputies in making an assessment of this particular body.  I have been critical but I believe my criticism is justified.  I would much prefer to follow the line of previous speakers and say these are a grand bunch of fellows doing a great job. But I just cannot say that.  In my experience it is a waste of time to make representations to this Harcourt Street group.  I want from the Minister the number of applications from small farmers which were rejected and how many applications altogether came from that source.  We have not got that information.  I believe it would be a good day's work if we had the kind of committee I mentioned earlier to examine in detail the affairs of this corporation so that we would get the kind of information we really need as against the kind of information the Parliamentary Secretary gave us when introducing the Bill yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome this Bill which is designed to increase the borrowing capacity of the Agricultural Credit Corporation to £70 million.  There is a growing demand for credit among farmers to purchase livestock, fertilisers and machinery and also for land drainage and improvement and the improvement of farm buildings.  I come from a rural constituency and it is made up mainly of dairy farmers.  The ACC have done a very good job in my county.  Being a dairy county, the farmers there needed a lot of capital to increase their cow numbers.  My constituency is one of the most intensive dairying <Col N="1188" /> areas in Europe.  There are more dairy cows per acre in North Kerry than in any other part of Europe.  We in North Kerry can thank the ACC for lending money to the dairy farmers to build up their herds.  If and when we enter the EEC the forecast for our county is that the income from agriculture will double by the end of the 1970s.  The farmers there will need a lot of capital to increase their dairy herds and their cattle numbers.  The price of dairy cows at present in County Kerry is about £200 each, whereas 12 months ago a dairy cow could be purchased for about £100 or £120.  The ACC will have to be much more lenient in giving credit to dairy farmers to increase their cow numbers and to stock their land with cattle. There will be a very great demand on the ACC by small farmers for money to purchase land.  If and when we go into Europe our farmers, small and large, will become much better off. The small farmers will be anxious to purchase any adjoining small holdings and they will need to borrow money in addition to what they have saved. This is where the ACC will come in very useful.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the area officers by the ACC was a great step forward because when you are examining an application for a loan there is no better way of assessing whether a farmer is loanworthy or not than to have an officer call to the farm and have a chat with the farmer and look around the farm.  He can then see how the man is farming his land.</P>
      <P>The ACC lend up to £400 at 6½ per cent interest and this is very good but £400 today is not much use for purchasing cattle, dairy cows or even fertilisers. I suggest that the limit should be increased to £800 in view of the fact that prices have increased so much in the past couple of years.  I think the ACC will play a very big part, too, in the rationalisation of our creamery business.  In my constituency we have many small co-operative creameries. When we go into the Common Market we will have to have rationalisation. The ACC can be very helpful here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACC do a big advertising campaign <Col N="1189" /> in this country and they have got many Irish people to invest with them.  I think they should conduct a big advertising campaign in England because there are many Irish people working there who would be anxious to invest at home especially to help the farmers.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the ACC for the good they have done for the Irish farmers and I hope that in the future they will do work as good as they have been doing for a number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrigidHoganOHiggins" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this increased amount of money for the ACC.  I think, like Deputy Murphy, that we do not really know what goes on in the ACC except by way of the nice pamphlets they issue and their annual report.  The annual reports of many State-sponsored bodies are beautifully got out but give very little information.  They are like good replies to Parliamentary questions. They tell you as little as possible in as many words as possible.  I fear that the ACC are not making money available to the people who most need it&mdash;the small farmers.  From experience in my constituency I know it is quite easy for the medium-sized and larger farmer to get a loan from the ACC but the small farmer finds himself in trouble.</P>
      <P>It was suggested to me last Friday night at a meeting in County Clare that large combines are getting an enormous amount of money from the ACC and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us whether there is any truth in this or whether there is a ceiling on the amount of money one can borrow from the ACC.  Are these large combines which are now going into intensive beef rearing eligible for large grants from the ACC?  I think a limit of £400 is quite unrealistic in this day and age.  A farmer said to me recently £100 would not buy a good dog.  Certainly one could not buy a good two-year-old beast for £140.  A sum of £400 is not much use to a farmer who is buying cattle.  Such a sum might be useful to a small farmer buying fertilisers but £400 would not buy enough fertiliser for a large farm.  The ACC should increase the ceiling to £1,000 for farmers buying cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> The employment of area officers is welcome.  In the past when I was approached with an inquiry as to the credit-worthiness of a person I felt that I was not in a position to give such advice.  Area officers should be in touch with the farmers.  They should inspect their farms and inquire about their plans.  They should ascertain how the money will be used and judge for themselves whether or not the applicants are credit-worthy.  On one occasion I was asked about the credit-worthiness of a person who was looking for a substantial loan.  I did not feel that the person concerned should get a loan but he got one and I understand that there has been great difficulty in collecting repayments.  I was, of course, not really in a position to advise on his credit-worthiness.  I was judging the man from my knowledge of his farming, not knowing what his bank account was like.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange mentioned something disquieting which has been rumoured recently.  This point was mentioned at branch meetings recently. It was said that people other than farmers are being given loans by the ACC for land purchase.  This is wrong. The ACC should only lend money to farmers or to farmers' sons who have been working on farms all their lives. Deputy L'Estrange mentioned a specific instance where psychiatric nurses were given a loan to buy land.  There is land hunger in this country.  There are a large number of small farmers who would like more land.  Surely they should receive first consideration. They should get land instead of business people, professional people or anyone else.  I have not been able to confirm or deny the rumours, but one Deputy has now said quite openly that land is being given to people other than farmers.  When replying, the Parliamentary Secretary should deal with this point.</P>
    <P>While the ACC are doing a very good job they are not flexible enough in dealing with small farmers.  Small farmers are afraid to approach them for loans.  They would not approach the ACC.  A small farmer will not approach the ACC unless he feels he can repay the loan.  The ACC take <Col N="1191" /> chances with bigger farmers but not with small farmers who are the ones who already need the loans.  A bank manager will advance money to a substantial farmer to buy cattle but he will not do the same for a small farmer. The ACC should help the small farmers. They should also increase the ceiling.  Cattle and sheep prices are rising.  The loans which can be obtained are unrealistic in view of the prevailing prices.  It remains to be seen whether sheep prices will stay at such a high level but cattle prices will rise unless we do something disastrous like staying out of the EEC.  By mid-summer cattle prices will have increased substantially.  Then a price of £160 or £170 for a two-year-old animal will obtain.  What good is £100 to a man going to the cattle mart?  He should be given at least £1,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House very long.  I receive many inquiries from the farming community in my constituency.  I live in a rural area and am bound to receive such inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the approach that has been made by the Department. Never at any time in the history of our country has it been so necessary to lend money to people who are prepared to borrow.  With the rise in prices farmers are looking forward to a brighter future and are becoming deeply interested in agriculture.  It is very encouraging to see the Minister being prepared to move with the times. The Agricultural Credit Act, 1969, fixed a limit on borrowing by the ACC to £25 million.  Borrowing by the corporation at that time amounted to £11 million and it was thought that the new limit would survive for four or five years ahead.  The growth in the corporation's activities has been greater than expected and a borrowing limit of £25 million has already been reached. That shows the great interest being taken in farming.  With wages and the cost of materials connected with any scheme today it takes quite a considerable sum of money to get anything done.  When a small farmer decides to carry out some scheme of improvement no matter how small he <Col N="1192" /> has to consider the cost of machinery. The day is gone when people will carry on as they did 20 years ago when machinery was not used.  There was a large population then and people concentrated on their own way of working. A change has come within the past 20 years.  Whether we like it or not we have now reached the age of mechanisation. We must all avail of machinery. That is why so many people are prepared to apply to the ACC for money.</P>
    <P>The country is in need of a general tidy-up.  Any of us who travel by car or train through the country will notice the dumps, the untidy hedges and the neglect.</P>
    <P>Cattle prices are good today and farmers realise that they must make greater use of their land.  It is sad to see so much land closed in with hedges and no drainage work done on it.  I have often pointed out to the Minister for Finance and his Parliamentary Secretary that some of the drainage schemes, and the other schemes we have in operation today, do not really get to the kernel of the problem.</P>
    <P>We have the local improvements scheme which helps to improve the lot of a group of farmers by the installation of a new road or the drainage of a small river.  We have the land project scheme, a scheme carried out by individuals. If extra money were made available for those schemes I have no doubt that many more of them would be carried out.  The manpower is not there, the machinery is costly and many people just drift on rather than go into debt.  We also have the farm improvements scheme which is a scheme undertaken by individual farmers but it takes money.</P>
    <P>I have gone to the ACC on a number of occasions on behalf of small farmers and I have very often been able to go back to them with the good news that they would get a grant for a hayshed, a piggery or a cow byre.  I can assure the ACC that the small farmers who are prepared to borrow this money are determined to do a good job.  Our farming community are rather conservative.  They shy away from borrowing money unless they have good reason to think that the borrowed money will pay dividends. <Col N="1193" /> Many small farmers have jobs in nearby towns and have borrowed money from the ACC to improve their holdings. I hope many more will avail of this opportunity to borrow money.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is preparing to increase the grant to the ACC.  With the price of livestock so good the ACC can rest assured that there will be a greater demand for money in the future.  The small farmer will be able to make his farm pay if he utilises the money he borrows to the best advantage.  The rate of interest at 8½ per cent is reasonable.  As a concession to small farmers a rate of 6½ per cent is charged to those whose total indebtedness to the ACC is not more than £400.  A small farmer who has a son helping him can get quite an amount of work done with £400.</P>
    <P>Manuring of land is very important today.  All small farmers should avail of the grants given for this work.  A lot of the land in the west of Ireland is really starved for manure.  This is what the small farmer should concentrate on first.  We had schemes in the past where farmers were obliged to drain part of their land before they qualified for a grant.  It would have been much better if those people had been encouraged to manure their land as most of it is very dry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am very pleased to see that the Minister is prepared to advance a greater sum of money to the ACC.  I have no doubt that he will be asked to advance more money in the near future because costs are getting very high.  Loans which did a great deal of work a few years ago will only do very minor work today. Small farmers in my area have a very keen interest in the land.  I am sure this applies to other areas as well, although I believe it applies more in Sligo/Leitrim where we have a greater proportion of small farmers, than in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>Out of ten queries which I received today six of them were in connection with land.  In the past it did not cost very much to run a home but now costs have soared.  The farmers are anxious to ensure that their land becomes more productive and that they can carry a large amount of stock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill because it is designed to give the ACC a borrowing capacity of £70 million.  The fact that most of the contributors to this debate come from rural Ireland is an indication of the importance of the ACC to the people of rural areas.</P>
      <P>In the short time I have been here I have heard many speakers refer to the activities of the ACC in recent years.  Since they were reconstituted in the early part of the last decade a revolution has taken place in relation to agricultural credit and borrowing. The people in Harcourt Street, whether officials or members of the board, are to be congratulated on their efforts to get the money and distribute it to the farming community.</P>
      <P>The fact that they are seeking the approval of the Dáil to borrow up to £70 million is an indication of the demands being made on their resources. It gives us an opportunity to look at the activities of the corporation in the last few years.  In the early sixties they were active in land purchase.  It was understood that if a purchaser for land had any security at all he could get a loan from the ACC.  This kind of wholesale credit was stopped, and rightly so, because it was inclined to give a false value to the land.  Too many people were prepared to purchase land because they thought they could get loans without any difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that in recent years the ACC have tried to help the small farmers to solve their farming problems by allowing them credit in order to increase their holdings.  This is desirable and we should encourage this practice. I have tried to encourage people, who normally would be regarded as suitable clients for the Land Commission, to go to the ACC.  I should prefer to see them make an effort to buy land, even if it is necessary to do this on a co-operative basis.  Perhaps the Land Commission might not be in full agreement with this practice because the people they might consider most suitable might not get the land. However, if young farmers are anxious to enlarge their holdings and make themselves more competitive the money should be made available <Col N="1195" /> to them through the only agency, namely, the ACC.</P>
    <P>I understand that £6,000 is the maximum the ACC will give a small farmer. I do not know if this is a realistic figure having regard to the substantial increases in land costs in recent years. In my part of the country&mdash;I would regard the land there as good as in any other county&mdash;a sum of £200 or £250 per acre was considered a good price two or three years ago.  A few days ago I heard of a smallholding which fetched up to £400 per acre.  If the small farmer must pay this kind of price he will be limited in the acreage he can purchase.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make representations to the ACC to revise this figure.  It is completly out-of-date, as other Deputies have suggested.  It is not possible to buy half a dozen calves for that amount of money at the moment.  We must think in terms of £800 or £1,000.</P>
    <P>I know that there are other long-term facilities for farmers with security who can get loans.  The period involved is five years and I would ask that it be extended.  Although the farmer is not required to repay capital for the first year, nevertheless it can create a problem and I would ask that more substantial loans be given over a period of ten years, for instance.  This applies to the purchase of machinery and other items.</P>
    <P>At one time the ACC operated a family settlement scheme whereby money could be made available to help resolve a problem which is common among the farming community.  Deputies who come from rural Ireland know that a family settlement can bankrupt the unfortunate farmer who is left with the farm.  The parents may be very generous when they are making a will or a settlement but frequently the person who gets the place is in a worse position financially than when the parents were alive.  If a person in this position could get a loan from the ACC it would help enormously.  We know that when a farm is left to one member of a family heavy demands may be made on him.  For instance, a <Col N="1196" /> sister may wish to get married and she may require money that was provided for her in the settlement; a younger brother may wish to buy a farm for himself and seek financial assistance from the family farm.  This applies to the small and medium-sized farmer to a greater degree than to the larger farmer, although the latter may be caught also.  It is a terrible thing that a farm should have to be sold in order to resolve this problem.  I do know that the Agricultural Credit Corporation were active in regard to such problems. They are not now giving credit for this purpose.  They should reconsider that matter and, taking every case on its merits, should try to help farmers who find themselves in that position.</P>
    <P>I have considered for many years the question of money being made available through the Agricultural Credit Corporation for grain merchants and co-operative buyers of grain.  I do not think that this should be a matter for the Agricultural Credit Corporation. It should be a matter for the commercial banks through which the grain buyers do their normal business. There should be no question of the banks telling the merchants in August or September, when grain is coming in, that they cannot provide credit.  The only other source of credit for them is the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I raise this matter now because this Bill is presented by the Minister for Finance.  The commercial banks should be responsible for the provision of credit to grain merchants for the purchase of corn.  The stage has now been reached where there are drying facilities installed in the premises of most merchants.  The farmer demands the money for his grain on the day it is unloaded into the hopper.  Merchants have been faced with the problem that the banks have informed them that they cannot provide the money.  The Government should take action and tell the commercial banks that they must provide the credit requirements of grain merchants for the purchase of grain.  The merchant can estimate what he will require in any season.  The money allocated to the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be devoted to helping those whom it was intended <Col N="1197" /> to help when the corporation was established.</P>
    <P>I would hope that there would be improved facilities for helping farmers, young farmers in particular, to solve their land problems by allowing them to buy land.  Something should be done in regard to family settlements which can impose a colossal burden on that member of the family who inherits the land and finds himself with very heavy commitments.</P>
    <P>When we do increase the figure of £400&mdash;I hope it will be increased to £800 or £1,000&mdash;I hope it will continue to be made available to the small farmer on the same terms, that is, a rate of 6½ per cent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I wish the Agricultural Credit Corporation every success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. H. Gibbons Dr. H. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. H. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to contribute.  I should like to endorse all that has been said by previous speakers.  Deputy Brennan has dealt so adequately and in such a practical manner with all the aspects of the Agricultural Credit Corporation that there is very little left for others to say. I am aware that the officials of the corporation are endeavouring to make the policy of the corporation work to the best advantage of the people.  This is as it should be.  Without such an organisation it is obvious that agriculture cannot develop because the corporation is the great source of credit for the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few nights ago I happened to be involved in a discussion of one aspect of the corporation's work and I was asked to draw the attention of somebody to it whenever I got the opportunity. I avail of the opportunity now. It was alleged to me that the corporation seek too much security for the loans they give to the smaller farmers and that, as a result, many of them are prohibited from seeking loans.  This was news to me because I understood that there was such a variety of loans available that a farmer was in a position to make a choice and could select one that would suit his own purpose.  Those with whom I was discussing the matter did not agree with me.  I now place the <Col N="1198" /> matter before the Parliamentary Secretary to have it brought back to the proper quarters and considered.</P>
    <P>Reading the Bill, one thing that strikes me is that it seems to deal largely with the intention of getting money in from outside.  I suppose this is a forerunner of proposals to join the Common Market.  Money obtained to develop agriculture will reflect on the whole country and will be to the benefit of all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass) Noel T. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree first with the remarks of Deputy Tom O'Higgins when he spoke at length for the Opposition on this Bill.  I am very glad that all the parties have accepted the Bill and are going to support it.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that the Agricultural Credit Corporation was established under the Agricultural Credit Act, 1927 but, unfortunately, during the first 30 years the ACC's operations were on a very modest scale and total loans of only £8 million were issued during this period.  It is only fair to say that the slow growth was due to such factors as the economic turmoil in the 1930s, the second world war and its aftermath, conservative lending policy coupled with a reluctance of farmers to invest, and the centralising of the ACC's activities in Dublin, with little contact with the farmers at field level.</P>
      <P>However, since 1960-61, the ACC have adopted a more progressive and diversive lending policy.  The Agricultural Credit Act of that year allowed greater flexibility and enabled the corporation to simplify security requirements. In addition to that, of course, they appointed 18 area officers.  In the meantime, the amount of credit issued each year increased from £0.8 million in 1960-61 to £8.5 million in 1970-71. In the current year the credit is expected to rise to £13.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been mentioned by many Deputies, loans are issued by the ACC for a wide variety of productive purposes, such as the purchase of livestock, machinery, fertilisers, land improvement, the erection of farm buildings and dwellinghouses.  The <Col N="1199" /> periods of repayment range from five years for livestock, 15 years for land improvement, 20 years for farm buildings, 35 years for erection of dwellinghouses. Budgeted loans are available to enable farmers to meet their seasonal needs in accordance with the budget submitted to the corporation. Loans are given to farmers with uneconomic holdings who wish to buy additional land.  The maximum loan is £6,000 and Deputies Brennan, Smith, Creed, McEllistrim and others were concerned about this figure.  These Deputies complained that the maximum is too low.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that many of the matters which were raised here are matters which would be the subject of day-to-day reviews by the board of the ACC at any time and, needless to remark, this maximum is reviewed by the board from time to time.  However, the corporation have to be careful that they do not inflate land prices and, indeed, Deputy Brennan pointed out that that situation did exist at one time.  If higher loans are available farmers may be tempted to pay inflated prices for land. I should like to make it quite clear that there is not a great demand for loans for land purchases from people other than those with small holdings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy, in particular, and Deputy Barrett and Deputy Tully, I think, also, were concerned about the breakdown in regard to how many people applied for and how many succeeded in getting loans.  Broadly, 80 per cent of applications are approved and two-thirds of the loans granted are for under £1,000.  The fears some Deputies expressed that this money was being given to large combines are not justified.  To break it down further for the benefit of Deputies, the total of £8.6 million was made up of £2.56 million for livestock, £2.05 million for buildings, £0.51 million for land purchase, £0.25 million for funding debt and £3.23 million for other loans including £1.29 million for machinery, £1.2 million for block finance.  The total number of loans issued in 1970-71 was 6,600 made up of 3,300 loans of under £500 each: <Col N="1200" /> 1,600 loans of between £500 and £1,000 each, and 1,700 loans of over £1,000 each.</P>
    <P>The main rate of interest chargeable is 8½ per cent.  A rate of 9½ per cent is chargeable on short-term loans to merchants.  A special rate of 6½ per cent is chargeable on loans to small farmers whose total indebtedness to the ACC is not above £400.  Deputy McEllistrim and Deputy Hogan O'Higgins and some other Deputies suggested that this figure of £400 should be increased.  That is a matter which I am sure the board will review realistically from time to time.</P>
    <P>In regard to questions about credit under the EEC, I think this will be of interest to Deputies: the EEC are at present considering a directive on aid for development farms, namely, farms which have a capacity to become viable.  One of the aids proposed is a subsidised interest rate and the EEC are thinking in terms of a subsidy which would bring down the interest payable by the farmers to between 3 and 4 per cent.  That will interest people when they are considering the terms of entry to the EEC because, although this directive has not yet been issued, it is under consideration.  The EEC do not intend to provide subsidised interest rates for agriculture generally.  In any case, the rate of interest is not the critical factor in farming; it is more important that credit as such should be available in sufficient quantities and that the farmer himself is able and willing to utilise the credit efficiently.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are in progress with the National Bank for Reconstruction and Development, commonly known as the World Bank, to finance a livestock project costing £45 million&mdash;cattle, £37 million and pigs, £8 million.  A loan of £15 million is being sought and if obtained it will be channelled through the ACC.</P>
    <P>There was also a question about the Government taking credit or guaranteeing losses in the event of a change in international rates.  The indemnity proposed is justified on the grounds that large changes in exchange rates can take place over the period of <Col N="1201" /> a loan resulting in considerable losses or windfall gains to borrowers.  There have been wide-ranging changes in recent years and the State, with its wider range of foreign borrowing, is in a better position than a body such as the ACC to balance the risk of exchange rate losses on some currencies against possible gains on others.</P>
    <P>I think this will deal with some of the problems Deputy Gibbons raised: the time taken to finalise a loan varies depending upon the security offered. There may be an unavoidable delay in checking a land title.  The corporation are at present reviewing their security system so as to minimise delay.  Also, they recently increased the maximum amount of loan available under the budgeted loan scheme to £5,000.  Such loans can be cleared in a matter of days and require no security beyond a written promise to pay.  Some Deputies suggested the corporation had a cautious lending policy but the corporation stress that no case of any merit is refused.  The fact that they have area officers means that each application gets individual and personal attention and once the farmer shows any promise of making good use of a loan, he gets one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This has not been the policy.  If it were, one farmer would be comparing with another and comparing what they think is like with like but which is not.  It is only during the past year, in fact, that the ACC have begun to finance the agricultural processing industry, such as creameries and bacon factories.  Plans have been drawn up by the Pigs and Bacon <Col N="1202" /> Commission for the rationalisation of the bacon industry.  These plans involve compensating some factories for closing and extending and modernising others.  The ACC are likely to play a big part in financing the rationalisation programme.</P>
      <P>One Deputy referred to the total investment of only £18 million in agriculture for the coming year.  The £18 million refers only to the amount provided by the ACC.  Total investment in agriculture will be £60 million to £70 million.  The remainder is made up of direct agricultural grants from the Exchequer, investment from farmers' own resources and investment by way of bank credit.</P>
      <P>A few Deputies suggested that once money is deposited with the ACC it cannot be withdrawn except at the end of a period of notice.  This is not correct: normally the corporation will repay on request and without notice up to 10 per cent of the amount deposited or £250, whichever is lower. Beyond this, any borrower who has good reason for withdrawing, will be allowed to withdraw at any time.  I am quite sure the ACC will take note of all internal matters which came up here but which I think are not matters for direction by the Minister for Finance.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>While speaking on this Bill yesterday evening the Minister asked me if I had any proof of pollution being caused by the discharge of sewage into the sea.  He quoted two or three eminent people who were qualified to give an opinion as to the possibility of disease being caused by untreated sewage entering the sea.  I must confess that there is no definite proof of this but, on the other hand, neither is there any definite proof that untreated sewage flowing into the sea does not cause any disease.  Different people at different times have claimed that they got a rash or suffered some other inconvenience from swimming in waters that were polluted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 10th June, 1970, I asked the Minister for Health if he had any evidence to indicate that infectious hepatitis was more prevalent in areas adjacent to rivers and waters that were polluted.  In his reply the Minister told me that it was generally agreed that occasional outbreaks of hepatitis might be caused by food or water.  Apparently the Minister for Health had no doubt as to it being agreed generally that this disease could be contracted from water.  People who dive into the sea at, say, the Forty Foot, sometimes, come up to find themselves covered in <Col N="1204" /> human excreta.  Can anyone blame these people if they regard themselves as being subject to a health hazard in such waters?</P>
    <P>I have no wish to create any unnecessary scare in this matter but can the waters in this part of the world be regarded as being any different in this respect from those elsewhere?  In this connection I might refer to an item that appeared in the <i>Australian International News Review</i> in which there appeared these words: &ldquo;Name your disease and with very little effort you can catch it merely from going swimming anywhere inside the harbour itself or almost anywhere along the coast for 20 miles above and below the city.&rdquo;  If it is possible to contract any disease in that part of the world, surely it is logical to assume that it could be contracted in any other part of the world.  I am not for one moment endeavouring to cross swords with the eminent people to whom the Minister referred, but I merely make this point.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House unduly this evening, but I would refer the Minister to the health hazards that exist in so far as polluted waters are concerned.  I would remind him of an article that appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of the 6th November last.  This article.  Which was headed &ldquo;Paddling Pool is Health Danger&rdquo;, said that parents of hundreds of children who use a paddling pool at Drumcondra are warning their children to stay clear of the pool because they fear it is a health hazard.  The report said that, according to a report of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the pool at Griffith Park on the Tolka River is acting as a settling tank for sludge making conditions, that it was suspect and indicative of sewage contamination.  These warnings should be heeded and should be the means of alerting the Minister to the dangers of children exposing themselves to paddling or swimming in an area which can be regarded as being almost in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>Innumerable children have free access to this park and the Minister should take immediate action because of the danger lurking there.  In the <Col N="1205" /><i>Evening Herald</i> of 5th November there is a report to the effect that this popular paddling pool in Griffith Park is a mass of sludge and possibly sewerage.  The <i>Evening Herald</i> of 16th November says no comfort can be drawn from the views expressed on behalf of the Government in the course of the Dáil Debate on the Fine Gael Private Notice Motion calling for legislation to deal with air and water pollution; the report also says that the views expressed by Deputy Cunningham, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, confirms the view that the present Government will not approach the question of pollution with any realism. It is also stated that we are so far behind in this matter that nothing short of a full-time ministry to deal with the whole question of environment is urgently required.</P>
    <P>While there may not be any positive evidence to show that disease has resulted from swimming in either the sea or the rivers which are polluted, the Minister must agree that there is no evidence to disprove the case.  The Minister for Health in June, 1970 said it is generally agreed that outbreaks of infective hepatitis might be either food or water borne.  Mark you, generally agreed! This is an admission that disease can be caused by water pollution.</P>
    <P>The question of our entry into the EEC looms large at the moment.  We are anxious to have foreign industrialists coming in here to set up industries. We will have to ensure that these industries enjoy every amenity possible and one of the amenities must be a satisfactory method of dealing with effluents from factories.  We must ensure that we are not lacking in all the facilities required for the establishment of successful industries.  Would it not be calamitous if, having encouraged foreign industrialists to come in here, we then failed to measure up because of non-conformance with regulations governing environment.</P>
    <P>There are no regulations worth talking about at the moment.  Most of our factories are, of course, sited along the coast.  It is our hope that more factories will be established in rural Ireland, in <Col N="1206" /> the west and in the midlands, and we should not hesitate for one moment now in establishing perfect conditions in these areas so that industrialists will be assured that we conform to all the rules and regulations governing the discharge of effluents from factories.</P>
    <P>The Government have in the past held out hope that they would deal with pollution.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> in November, 1969, there is a heading: &ldquo;The Government to attack Pollution.&rdquo; Dealing with pollution and its cause, the article says that there is an indication that the Government have acknowledged this calamity and this outrage and were taking effective steps to deal with it.  In December, 1965, in the <i>Irish Press,</i> there was a heading: &ldquo;A welcome step against water pollution&rdquo; and the article went on to state that anglers in general would welcome the Government's decision to establish a commission to carry out research into the pollution of lakes and rivers.  This was to be headed by a former chief inspector of the British Fishery Association.  What happened?  The intentions never reached fulfilment.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister said I mentioned only 20 rivers, or fewer; I thought that by mentioning 20 rivers I was giving a good indication of how widespread this problem is and showing that it was not confined to any particular area.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to think I did not mention enough rivers.  I will now mention the Camac in Dublin which everybody knows is very heavily polluted.  I also omitted the River Swan in Dublin which is polluted.  I did not mention the Oranmore in Sligo which is very slightly polluted and the Garravogue which is polluted to a somewhat greater extent.  I understand Lough Gill in Sligo has been subject to pollution.  The River Inny, which is a tributary of the Shannon, has been slightly polluted and so has the River Brosna.  There are countless smaller rivers which I did not mention.  I thought it was sufficient to mention the larger rivers and thus give an indication of the areas in which pollution exists.</P>
    <P>For Deputy Cunningham's information, I cannot mention any Donegal <Col N="1207" /> river which is polluted but if they lack pollution in rivers they have an abundance of political pollution in his constituency.</P>

I would ask the Minister to accept this bill as a serious effort to deal with pollution.  In recent years this problem has spread right over the country.  I would ask him to bear in mind the representations of the different people concerned who are genuinely interested.  I would ask him to pay special attention to any representations he may receive from the salmon anglers, the trout anglers or anybody connected with the fishing industry because any river which is not capable of producing normal, healthy fish life cannot be regarded as a healthy river.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the points I have put to him and not to regard this as a political motion but as a motion which has due regard to a menace within our society which is spreading rapidly.  If we do not take action now in a year or less it may be too late and we may not have the resources to deal effectively with this calamity which is thrust upon us.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Belton on his publicspiritedness and the amount of hard work he has put into the preparation of this Bill.  It deals with a very serious problem.  I do not believe that more legislation is necessary but that does not take away from the intentions and the ideals of Deputy Belton.  Like myself he is a city Deputy and he knows the amount of pollution there is in any urban society.  The only thing on which we differ is how to tackle this problem and though I may differ with him I want my admiration of the man for his efforts in a good cause to be recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pollution must be dealt with in the most serious way possible.  I do not <Col N="1208" /> mean by new laws or bye-laws but by our whole attitude to this matter.  To exaggerate the problem is as bad, if not worse, than to underrate it.  In the last ten years or so there has been a tendency to exaggerate it.  It has been suggested that this is a new problem. There is nothing new about it.  It is at least five thousand years old.  Since man started to upset the balance of nature he has created a pollution problem. The only difference is that in earlier times the only kind of pollution was organic pollution.  Since the industrial revolution we have had an inorganic pollution which is much more deadly than pollution by decaying flesh, decaying foliage, trees or anything else.</P>
    <P>We must also remember that pollution is a rich man's problem.  That is how the native of an underdeveloped country in Africa would look at it.  He knows nothing about it.  His problem is starvation maybe.  In the continent of Europe and in the United States we have the affluent society and there is this frightful pollution problem.  Thor Heyerdahl who went across the ocean on the <i>Kon Tiki</i> reported that practically all oceans were dying.  It might sound like heresy for me to disagree with him with his vast experience.  He asked: &ldquo;Do you want a metropolis or an necropolis?&rdquo;  I think there is a touch of exaggeration in that because for at least two centuries man has lived in this industrialised atmosphere and has survived.  No doubt the human race will survive for at least some time and if it does fall eventually it probably will not be because of pollution.</P>
    <P>We are inclined to think that nothing has been done about it.  If I speak of Dublin more than elsewhere it is because I represent a part of Dublin. The Minister for Local Government is a swimmer and an outdoor man.  He is as interested in this as we are and he has taken steps whenever a Member of this House has gone to him or when a local authority has pressed him to do something.  Deputy Belton mentioned the Tolka River.  A new pumphouse has been installed there at a cost of £22,000 which will ensure that the pollution problem in that river will be substantially remedied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> The River Dodder, which flows through part of my constituency, was frightfully polluted but at a cost of over £1 million the Dodder Valley drainage scheme is being implemented. Already part of that river, which is a very beautiful little river, has been cleared of pollution and I hope that when the scheme is finished within the next two years the Dodder will be a clean river.  There will not be any untreated sewage going into the river and the fish life is already showing evidence of returning.</P>

      <P>The greatest credit goes to the people of the Dodder Valley Association who organised the clean-up last year and who will do the same this year.  The work they did focused attention on the violation of this river by pollution by careless citizens.  We have mentioned the Dodder Valley <Col N="1210" /> Association.  I should also mention the Tennessee Valley Association.  In that valley man destroyed the trees. They made a dustbowl of the valley. Farmers had no arable land there.  Men came along and replanted trees and ploughed in concentric circles and restored the land so that it produced food again.  If we learn from the mistakes of the Americans we can save ourselves money and heartbreak.  We must watch developments in other countries to ensure that we do not make similar mistakes.  We must benefit from the anti-pollution measures taken abroad.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that an American firm, prosecuted some years ago for causing pollution, have decided to make their own anti-pollution equipment.</P>

      <P>They did a lot of good work.  The American firm manufactured their own apparatus.  They were so successful that they started making anti-pollution devices and are supplying them to industry.  Industrialists should follow their example.  Deputy L. Belton has spoken of Dublin Bay and the rivers around Dublin.  In Dublin there are 28 rivers and streams. Some of them run underground.  One can still swim in some of these rivers and walk in the streams.  That gives an idea of the lack of pollution here.</P>

      <P>These rivers are polluted not only by raw sewage but also by chemicals.  On one occasion cyanide was discharged into a river.  It killed all the fish for miles around.  The factory concerned admitted their mistake. It was impossible to prove that the fish actually died from the poison released from that particular factory. One could not swim in a river into which such a poison was released.  If a river or bay is polluted by sewage it is uninviting but still not a health hazard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We must get down to the cause of pollution and deal with it in an unemotional way.  We must find the cause of the pollution and tackle the problem.  We must ask people whether they still want the comforts of society, one of which is the internal combustion engine.  Nobody would ask us to scrap that.  We will not do away with the things which give us a nice soft living.  Even in the Antarctic penguins and other birds and animals are affected by pesticides from northern Europe.  Ecologists assure us that this is true and they also assure us that the oceans will die unless we do something about them.</P>
      <P>The disposal of sewage is a very important matter.  The real problem is that our rivers are becoming full of oil and cyanide.  We are lucky in this country that we are not as industrialised as Great Britain or Germany.  Any Member of the House who has been to the Council of Europe will know the River Rhine well.  It is now referred to as the sewer of Europe.  Deputy Belton mentioned that some Deputies cleaned the Dodder.  I remember some months ago when I was in Strasbourg the people were cleaning the River Rhine.  They were taking all types of old rubbish, motor cars and bicycles out of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave the Rhine to the Germans and to the people of the other countries through which it flows.  We have got to tackle this problem in a very realistic way.  The steps which are being taken in the city, while they will not clear the air completely, will go a long way to improve the problem.  If we allow this situation to develop we will face what many European countries are now facing.  We may think pollution in the Liffey is bad but we find that a great amount of sewage of all types has poured into the Seine and the Rhine.  The volume of <Col N="1213" /> liquid waste in the Federal Republic of Germany is estimated at over 9,000 million cubic metres per day.  Into the Rhine alone, 50,000 tons of waste are discharged daily and this includes 30,000 of sodium chloride from industrial plants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On an ebb tide.  The ebb tide may take it to Liverpool or Preston.  It is not cricket to take our sludge and put it into the Ribble or the Mersey.  The ocean is not endless and the less of this sort of action by all countries the better.  I think it was an Englishman, John Donne, who said 300 years ago that no man is an island.  No country is an island today as regards pollution because even the trade winds blow from west to east and take most of our smoke and smog towards Liverpool.  The wind can change occasionally and we can very often get back the smoke from Liverpool, Lancashire or Cheshire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We have regulations. No ship in port is permitted to open its furnace and allow too much smoke and fumes to escape.  There was a foreign ship which used to do that and action was taken against it.  Black smoke used to pour over the city.  You must remember that nobody has yet built a chimney high enough to pierce the whole atmosphere.  We have got to try to stop smoke being created rather than dispose of it.  Nobody has yet built a sewerage pipe long enough to go over the side of the world.  We cannot get rid of things that way.</P>
      <P>There is really only one type of pollution, that is pollution of the sea, because all pollution ends up there.  If an oil tanker turned over in Ballyfermot the oil or petrol from it would flow through the sewers and be down in Ringsend within an hour and into the sea.  No matter what any citizen or any country does it will affect other people.  Some time ago the Minister requested An Foras Forbartha to set up a water resources division to examine all aspects of the water resources of the State, including water pollution.  An Foras Forbartha have the trained personnel and the expertise to go into these matters.  It will not be left to amateurs like Deputy Belton and myself and other Deputies who are conscious of this great problem but who are not trained to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can influence the public by good example.  We should exhort the public not to litter the streets, not emit injurious smoke from their houses but to act as good citizens and not spoil our rivers.  I would ask the Minister to initiate classes to educate all our citizens in regard to pollution.  This should naturally start in the home and in the school but classes are also required to educate the adults.  Any law passed in this House is only effective if it has the consent of the people it will affect. We have seen too many laws, bye-laws and regulations being made which did not achieve the results we hoped for. The streets in this city are getting dirtier instead of cleaner.  I know the population has grown in recent years and perhaps the amount of litter is less than it was some years ago but at the same time we find utter carelessness <Col N="1215" /> all over the place by people who litter our streets and rivers.  Anybody who lives on either side of Dublin Bay will see that even though Dublin Corporation have provided dumps for rubbish people do not avail of them.  Instead they dump their rubbish any place, even over their neighbour's back gate. This is because we have not educated ourselves into being good citizens.  If we spend millions on the Dodder and the Tolka it will all be in vain unless the people show a determination to create an atmosphere in which citizens will not litter the streets or pollute the rivers&mdash;ensure that the physical atmosphere will not be impaired by their careless actions.</P>
    <P>It is a comfort at times to think of other countries and say: &ldquo;Look how bad they are&rdquo;, but that is no excuse for us.  Any country today which could offer unpolluted beaches and rivers and an unpolluted atmosphere would have the greatest tourist attraction ever, and despite the bad picture which has been painted of us this year as regards tourism, I feel that people would still come here if they knew of the standard of cleanliness of our rivers and of the air.  If you go through Lancashire where the canals are heavily polluted, you will see hundreds of anglers standing there almost shoulder to shoulder trying to catch fish which are not there or very few of which are there.  Now these men would enjoy fishing in a river in Donegal, Galway or in the south.  Britain is so heavily industrialised that I do not think you would find one river which is not heavily polluted.</P>
    <P>We must pay tribute to the Port of London Authority and to the Greater London Council for the treatment of the River Thames.  Here was a river which suffered the worst of the Industrial Revolution.  Industries were built along its banks and it was polluted unmercifully until at one time for a human being to fall into some stretch of it meant instant death if he swallowed the water, it was so poisonous.  The Port of London Authority and the Greater London Council spent millions of pounds in cleaning that river, and fish life is again appearing in many parts of it. <Col N="1216" /> If the London County Council and the Port of London Authority could do it&mdash;I know at enormous cost&mdash;we certainly could do it, because the cost would only be a fraction of what Britain would have to spend.  What they have shown is that a river can be saved from pollution.  There is the same situation here, on a much smaller scale, in regard to the River Dodder, and it would not take all that much to clean the Liffey.  Dublin is unique in being the only capital city in Europe with a salmon-bearing river going through its centre.</P>

      <P>I have not got the figures, but the Deputy can get them from the fishery conservators very easily.  It was James Joyce who referred to &ldquo;Anna Livia Plurabelle&rdquo;.  She may not be so &ldquo;plurabelle&rdquo; now, but she is far from being a really polluted river.  There is a degree of pollution certainly, but if salmon are still swimming through it the pollution cannot be all that bad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The salmon swim from the sea up the Liffey from January to August.  They are able to brave the anglers, the net men and the pollutants, <Col N="1217" /> and they get there.  I agree with Deputy Belton that we have a pollution problem, but we must keep a sense of proportion when dealing with it.  We should not make statements which will alarm people.  You hear people asking if children should bathe in the bay.  One of the most tragic things I heard was from an English child who was over here: before she went into the water she asked: &ldquo;Is this water polluted?&rdquo; When we were youngsters we had our own bogeymen with which people used to frighten us. Today the bogeymen is pollution.  It is bad for children that they should have this horrible fear.  They should be taught a sense of care but not of fear, because fear will not overcome anything.  Tremendous advances have been made by scientists and surely man, who can destroy a city in a few minutes, can also use his genius to prevent a city being destroyed over a number of years.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a point made by Thor Heyerdahl, who spoke at the Council of Europe.  I might remind Deputy Belton that Deputy Ryan read an excellent paper on this subject at the Council of Europe which was well worth reading.  There is no doubt that we are very much aware of the problem. The Minister, as well as his predecessors, have taken action in regard to it.  Deputy Belton will also remember&mdash;he was a member of the corporation with me at the time&mdash;the North Dublin Drainage Scheme.  We are not a rich city but we spent about £3 million on that scheme.  The Dodder Scheme and various other schemes for the city have cost a tremendous amount of money.  At the moment the corporation are at the planning stage of a new sewage disposal works at the Pigeon House which will cost £3 million or £4 million and which will treat the sewage before it enters the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that you can treat pollution but to dispose of it is a different thing.  We just cannot go on putting everything into the sea.  When Christopher Columbus discovered America he also discovered that the oceans were not endless, as many people had thought at that time they were.  Were it not for action such as <Col N="1218" /> has been taken in the last two years we would kill the rivers, first of all, and then the seas.  Man is the most resilient being and can overcome many persecutions, whether inflicted by human beings or by nature.  Nature will, of course, go on doing its part in the fight against pollution because it will always hold its own balance.  It is only when man interferes with this balance that things get out of hand.  In some countries they have got out of hand.  Lake Erie in America has been killed by pollution.  Some of the lakes in Switzerland have also been killed by pollution. However, these countries are very highly industrialised.  While we will become more industrialised, the ball is at our feet now to ensure that any factory commencing here will not be given planning permission unless it conforms with the bye-laws and the laws against pollution.  The Minister said here last night that at the moment planning permission would not be given unless the plans contain provision in regard to pollution.</P>

All that is needed is enforcement of present legislation.

      <P>The start must be made in the home and in the school.  Then we can go on to the adults.  In Europe they have sufficient laws but look where they wound up in regard to the Rhine and the Seine.  We had all the lyrics about the Seine, all the lyricism about the bridges of Paris, but you would want to be a brave man to go under some of them.  Of course, the French with their genius for revival will not let this drift on.  They discharge 18,000 million cubic metres of effluent into the sea.  We are bound to get some of that from the west coast of France.  We cannot pass laws to stop the tides coming across from France but we can join in a combined effort to ensure that we do not commit national suicide by further additions to our problems of pollution. If we do we will pay a frightful penalty.</P>
      <P>To my mind there is only one form of pollution, that of the sea, because all pollution winds up in the sea.  We have got to study that aspect.  There may be pollution by noise and there may be air pollution by car fumes and so on, but you will find that all pollution ends up in the sea.  Therefore, we can see that the sea is the major problem.  When Thor Heyerdahl first sailed the <i>Kon Tiki</i> across the oceans he saw certain pollution and some flotsam over a certain area but on the last occasion the pollution had spread over the whole area.  He saw pollution right across the whole ocean and he reminded us that even plankton, which are able to produce more oxygen than any other such species, were being destroyed by oil pollution.  He did not mention untreated sewage.  With our sources of power becoming more and more dependent on oil, we run the risk of a disaster like that of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i>.  It could be worse because the tankers are getting bigger and bigger and there could be a break-up of one of them off Donegal or Cork or Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realise that pollution by sewage is not nice, and doctors assure us it is <Col N="1220" /> not a health hazard, but we must do everything possible to keep our rivers clean by filtering.  We must ensure they will not be polluted by inorganic matter. We must try to ensure against pollution of the air and of the seas so that we will hand over to the next generation the knowledge that we recognised the problem and tackled it in the best way possible.</P>

      <P>If this Bill does nothing but bring to the notice of the Minister for Local Government and the powers that be that a serious problem has arisen, it will have done a good day's work.  I congratulate Deputy Luke Belton on the excellent case he made for the Bill.  He went into great detail and backed it up by producing newspaper cuttings.  I do not go very much of the way with Deputy Moore who has an approach to this with which I do not agree.  Like me and everybody else in the House and most people in the country, he is against pollution but his idea that the only real pollution is that which occurs in the sea is hard to support.</P>
      <P>I honestly believe that the pollution causing the greatest harm in this country is that caused by sheer carelessness on the part of people who should know better, by people who do not bother to try to prevent certain things happening.  Deputies Moore and Belton referred to untreated sewage and though it may have been all right when people did not know better to have untreated sewage pumped into rivers later used as bathing spots by children and adults, it is inexcusable in the seventies to have still a situation in which no effort is made by some local authorities to prevent untreated sewage being pumped from old and new housing schemes into rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The siting of dumps for towns, villages and large rural areas along the sides of rivers can only be described as a scandal.  I do not understand why local authorities decide that the proper place to put a dump is along a river but in almost every town throughout the country the dump is close to the river.  We hear talk about reclaiming the land but if the dumping of refuse results in polluting the river <Col N="1221" /> the loss is greater than the gain.  Recently there have been cases of unsorupulous persons emptying sewage containers, effluent from septic tanks and crude oil into the dumps.  Sometimes they take crude oil from depots in this city and in larger towns and bring it into the rural areas for disposal in the dumps.  The result is that the effluent flows through the dump and into the river; there was one case where the effluent went into the sea and was washed back on to the beach. Everyone wondered where the tar came from.</P>
    <P>The uncontrolled use of various types of insecticides by the farming community can be harmful.  There is a tendency to wash out the containers in the local streams when the insecticide has been used.  This practice must be condemned and should be stopped. Some silage pits are sited so that the effluent flows into a small stream and then into a bigger stream.  There is no doubt that the effluent will kill every living thing that comes in contact with it.</P>
    <P>I do not know why a better effort is not made to try to educate the people about the abuse of waters in our country. Long ago all the songs about Ireland mentioned the lakes and streams and generally gave the impression that even though we were not a rich country we had plenty of water. It is difficult to make some people understand that there is a grave shortage of water and that this shortage is likely to increase.  I understand that the cause of this shortage is that most of the country is on a limestone base. Those of us who live in the country know that because we have had three reasonably good summers it is difficult to get water supplies.</P>
    <P>We know that a stream may be reasonably safe even though it carries a certain type of effluent while there is a large supply of water but it becomes a death-trap when the level of water goes down and when the stream becomes a trickle.  I can never understand why so-called responsible people who know they are polluting a stream continue to do so when the level of the water has dropped considerably.  We know that some creameries discharge <Col N="1222" /> effluent into streams and even though a few hundred yards downstream there may be dead fish nobody seems to worry about it.  This is a clear sign that something has gone wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore stated that certain of the organisms in the sea create oxygen. It is well known that various types of fish life are necessary and that if it is destroyed it can result in disaster.  I listened to a television programme recently and I heard a scientist explain that if he thought that because of pollution the world was likely to come to a sticky end by the end of this century he would be slow to mention this fact publicly because it would create terror among the public and it would do more harm than good.  However, he calmly proceeded to say that unless something was done quickly the end of the seventies would see a serious situation arising in Europe&mdash;by Europe I presume he was talking about Britain and this country.  If the situation is so serious that those people who are trained to examine what is happening make such a prediction, surely public representatives should take the necessary steps to ensure that this calamity is prevented.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the comment made by Deputy Moore that domestic sewage does not cause much harm.  The Deputy quoted a doctor who is supposed to have said that while it might be unsightly it did not do much harm.  I know of one river into which raw sewage is pumped; it is estimated that the mussels that are picked from the river&mdash;even though they may be the largest mussels one could get&mdash;are very dangerous to eat because a high proportion contain a typhus bug.  In the circumstances, surely it is ridiculous to suggest that raw sewage does not cause any damage.</P>
    <P>One may think of pollution only in terms of tin cans and paint cans floating down a river.  They look unsightly but they are not dangerous if their contents have not been toxic.  What causes the trouble is the pumping of effluent and various kinds of poisonous substances into rivers.  To suggest that the only danger that exists here is the pollution of the sea by sewage is ridiculous. Last year there were complaints <Col N="1223" /> that it was dangerous to swim at the seaside resorts around the city.  I remember making a comment here that we were lucky because in my constituency we have seven miles of beach which is judged to be free of any kind of pollution.  At the time I thought this was a good plug for anyone who wanted a holiday where he could swim. If it is true that Dublin Bay is so polluted that people can no longer swim near it action should be taken by people in authority&mdash;I nearly said by Dublin Corporation, but there is no Dublin Corporation.  Deputy Moore wondered if our legislation is sufficient to deal with this problem.  If it is sufficient we are not making good use of it.</P>
    <P>The greatest argument in favour of this Bill is that so far we have not been successful in remedying the problem. The Minister for Local Government, who has responsibility in this matter, must admit that either he is not doing his job or he has not got the legal power to do it.  He will be in a cleft stick when he comes to reply to this debate.  Either way he will appear to be wrong because if he opposes the Bill we must assume he considers he has adequate legislation to deal with the problem.  If he does not oppose the Bill, then we must assume that there is adequate legislation but he is not using it.  Therefore, I would be very interested, next Tuesday, evening, to hear his comments as to what exactly is the position.</P>
    <P>There is one thing missing.  Millions of pounds are being spent under various headings by countries all over the world.  The most expensive experiment of all is, I suppose, space probes.  Is it not extraordinary that, with all that type of money being spent, nobody has yet come up with a reasonable alternative to the sewage disposal system which has been in operation for so long?  Is it not really remarkable that nobody seems to have got any way of dealing with crude sewage except to pipe it into a sewage farm and subsequently out to sea or to some place where it is considered it will be safe. Some of the money which is being wasted in other ways could usefully <Col N="1224" /> be spent in developing a sewage disposal system.</P>
    <P>I should like to pose a question to the Minister.  Does he feel that some of the smaller sewage disposal methods which have been introduced&mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; because I understand that they are able to deal only with very limited quantities&mdash;are, in fact, doing all that is claimed for them by the manufacturers or could he or his Department provide a list of sewage disposal systems which they consider are able to deal adequately with sewage disposal?  This is a very important matter.</P>
    <P>All of us who are on local authorities are involved in planning.  Deputy Belton seems to think that we only make recommendations.  I would agree with Deputy Moore that, in fact, they are no such thing.  A person who applies for planning permission for the building of a house gets an instruction and as far as he is concerned that is the law and he must carry it out. Otherwise he cannot build his house. Therefore, they are not merely recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is rather odd to find cases where a number of persons have applied for permission to build houses and eventually it is discovered that, even though they have no sewage disposal system except the old-fashioned septic tank, the effluent from that septic tank finds its way into a river and in some cases further down the river there is a village being supplied with water from that river.  Surely there is something wrong in that case and there must be some way of dealing with it?</P>
    <P>Another type of pollution is caused by household refuse.  There should be regulations making it compulsory to destroy this material.  In some countries such material is collected and processed and resold under various headings.  In this country we see people emptying bins on to an open truck.  Some of them have solved the problems of the dumps by putting the refuse on a flat truck and by the time they go from house to house the material is scattered all over the road for miles.  One can see newspapers and all sorts of unmentionables scattered <Col N="1225" /> along the hedgerows.  There should be a regulation governing the type of vehicle to be used for refuse collection and an effort should be made to dispose of refuse in a manner that will ensure that it will not reappear in public.</P>
    <P>I happen to live pretty close to where there is a dump.  While the person in charge of it has been making an effort to keep it in order, people who have not got that public spirit come along at night with lorry loads of papers, cardboard and so on from a local town and dump it anywhere at all close to the dump.  Ultimately the material is blown into the local river and pollutes it.  This practice should be dealt with very severely.  Again, the Minister may consider that he has the necessary legislation and, if he has, I would ask him to issue directions to local authorities that the strongest possible action should be taken to prevent this practice.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to ask local authorities to insist that under no circumstances would anybody be allowed to put into public dumps effluent from septic tanks or oil which is picked up in depots many miles away and which will get into the local stream or river.  This cannot be the ideal way of dealing with waste disposal. Unless we are prepared to face the fact that carelessness more than culpability is responsible for a great deal of the trouble, then we will continue to have pollution of waters and it will become worse as years go by.</P>
    <P>Possibly, an appeal to the good sense or public spirit of the general public might have the effect of getting people to be more careful but, unfortunately, many people feel that they are getting away with something. In some cases they are too careless to bother.  The law must be strengthened, if the authority does not already exist, to ensure that people are prevented from polluting the environment by the fact that it will cost them too much. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main objective of this Bill is to reduce to a minimum the evasion of payment of licence fees on television sets.  The need for new legislation to deal with this problem has been apparent for some years and has been referred to in this House from time to time.  For example, my predecessor said on 19th March, 1970&mdash;column 928 of the Official Report&mdash;that a scheme for legislation to reduce the number of unlicensed sets had reached an advanced stage.  I also referred to the matter on 25th February, 1971&mdash; column 2133&mdash;and on 18th November, 1971&mdash;column 2451&mdash;when introducing the Estimate for my Department, and I indicated broadly the main provisions which would be included in the new Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to minimise evasion of payment of licence fees has become more pressing within the last few years because of the increasing financial difficulties which have been facing Radio Telefís Éireann.  Costs have risen steeply and television receiver growth and advertising revenue are both levelling off.  Indeed, during 1970-71 television advertising revenue dropped for the first time.  The voluntary decision by RTE to eliminate cigarette <Col N="1227" /> advertising meant a serious loss of advertising revenue.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to remind Deputies that although broadcasting licence fees were increased with effect from 1st July, 1970, the authority's annual report for the year ended 31st March, 1971, showed an overall surplus of only £3,647.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also remember that it was decided to increase the combined licence fee from £6 to £7.50 as from 1st September, 1971, but to abolish the radio licence fee of £1.50 as from 1st September, 1972.  Because of the spread of television the number of radio licences now represents only a small fraction of the total number of licences in force.  It is estimated that these licence fee adjustments will provide RTE with net additional revenue of £550,000 in a full year.  The authority's latest annual report comments on these adjustments but goes on to call for a systematic review of licence fees at two-yearly intervals.</P>
    <P>In this situation, it is important that evasion of payment of licence fees should be reduced to a minimum. Otherwise the licence fee may have to be increased again sooner, or to a higher level, than would otherwise be necessary.  This apart, it is, of course, quite unfair that viewers who pay licence fees should be subsidising those who do not.</P>
    <P>No reliable estimate is available of the number of unlicensed television sets in use.  RTE's latest annual report states that an Irish TAM survey carried out in March, 1971, indicated a television set count of 529,000 private households.  At the end of January, 1972, the number of current combined licences was slightly over 471,000 and about 19,000 were overdue for renewal. Even if no allowance is made for television sets hired or bought since March last by households which previously did not have a set, these figures would suggest that there may be 40,000 unlicensed sets in use at present.  This number of sets would represent gross licence receipts of about £300,000 or the equivalent of about 60p per existing combined licence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> Apart from pursuing people who do not renew their licences promptly, my Department mount special campaigns from time to time.  These campaigns include house-to-house visits supported by publicity in the various media, including television.  The special drives have met with a good measure of success.  Moreover, during the past two years the use of a new television detector van has had considerable effect in persuading defaulters to take out licences.  Nevertheless, it will be evident from what I have said earlier that special measures are needed to deal effectively with the problem.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 of this Bill require television dealers to register with the Minister, to maintain records of transactions in the sale and hire of television sets and to supply the Minister with particulars of transactions which take place after the Act comes into operation.  Section 4 requires television dealers to notify the Minister of hire, hire-purchase and credit-sale agreements for television sets which are current when the Act comes into operation.  The information to be supplied by dealers is specified in the Schedule to the Bill.  The information obtained from dealers will be compared with the Department's records and this will make it possible to give special attention to households where there is good reason to beleive they an unlicensed set is held.</P>
    <P>Cases have arisen where difficulty was experienced in proving to the satisfaction of the courts that a defendant was in possession of a TV set detected in his home when the defendant himself was not interviewed by the Post Office inspector.  Section 10 of the Bill provides that until the contrary is shown by the defendant it shall be presumed in such cases (1) that the set was in possession of the occupier of the premises and (2) that he did not hold a licence for it at the time to which the prosecution relates. Section 10 also provides for a presumption of a similar nature in a prosecution for an offence under section 7 (3) of the 1926 Act, that is where a person fails to complete and return a special notice sent to him by registered post.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> These special notices are used frequently in following up suspected licence fee evaders.  The person concerned is required to state on the notice whether he has wireless telegraphy apparatus in his possession, the kind of apparatus, whether it is licensed and so on.  The alternative to using the special notice is to have a personal visit of inspection made, at much greater cost. Unfortunately, some people simply ignore the notice.  The new provision will make the procedure more effective.</P>
    <P>Each year my Department find it necessary to prosecute about 6,000 evaders.  The penalties imposed by the courts are obviously not a sufficient deterrent against evasion.  At present the maximum fine for a first offence is £10 and fines generally fall within the range of £1-£5.  These penalties are quite out of scale with the present fee of £7.50 for a television set and represent a mere fraction of the annual cost of hiring a set.  When the present maximum fine of £10 was fixed in 1926 the licence fee for a radio was 10s and there was no television service.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill proposes to increase the maximum fine for a first offence to £50.  The same section provides for a maximum fine of £100 for a second or subsequent offence.  This replaces the fine of £1 per day which at present applies to a continuing offence and which is not in practice enforceable because of the impossibility of proving that a person had a set continuously in his possession over a particular period.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also provides for an amendment to section 3 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, which will enable the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to exempt, by order, certain classes of wireless telegraphy apparatus from the requirement that they must be licensed under the Act.  It is under this provision that I propose to implement the decision to abolish the ordinary radio licence fee as from 1st September, 1972.  With the abolition of the radio fee the present combined licence will of course become a television licence but part of the receipts from fees will continue to be allocated to the sound broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> This opportunity is being availed of to make provision for the better control of interference with wireless telegraphy, including interference caused by wireless telegraphy apparatus&mdash;sections 5, 8 and 14.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is aimed at certain types of apparatus which are in use in some countries but which my Department are not prepared to license, generally because of the interference they can cause to legitimate wireless telegraphy apparatus.  For example &ldquo;walkie-talkie&rdquo; equipment operating on the 27 megacycle band is not licensed in this country because that band is reserved for industrial, scientific and medical purposes and because this type of equipment can cause serious interference with television and radio reception.</P>
    <P>Licences are not issued either for &ldquo;bugging&rdquo; devices for different but obvious reasons.  The section will enable the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make an order prohibiting the sale, hiring, manufacture or importation of any class of apparatus which my Department are not prepared to license.  Provision may be made, however, in the order to grant licences permitting the manufacture of such apparatus solely for export.</P>
    <P>Some of the remaining provisions of the Bill are of a routine character.  The others are of minor importance and none of them appears to be of a controversial nature.  Accordingly, and as any discussion considered desirable can appropriately take place on the Committee Stage, I do not propose to comment on them now.  If, however, some Deputy wishes to raise a general question in relation to any of them I shall do my best to deal with the matter in my reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that I believe that the main provisions of this Bill are essential to eliminate licence fee evasion which is unfair to RTE and to the vast majority of viewers who pay their licence fees when they become due.  I confidently recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, <Col N="1231" /> like much of the legislation enacted here, will not be popular with the public generally.  The Bill is not contentious. In many ways, it is a very fair piece of legislation because those who pay their television licence fees regularly should not have to subsidise those who consistently evade paying their fees.  Of course, there will be people in the constituency I represent, for instance, who will say that they should have a reduced fee because they cannot receive BBC programmes. There is no substance whatsoever for that argument because the programmes paid for are those put out by our own station.</P>
      <P>The Bill is likely to be unpopular with television dealers, but in this respect it might be pointed out that this is not a new type of legislation.  Gunsmiths, for instance, must register the sale of guns and garage proprietors are obliged to notify their local authorities on the sale or resale of cars.  It can be argued, perhaps, that the supplying of information to the Minister as to whether a television set is sold on the hire purchase system or otherwise is an intrusion by the State on the rights of individuals, but when one considers that one's bank account can be inspected, the inquiry regarding a television licence would seem a very minor detail.  After all, licences regarding motor cars can be investigated. Therefore, there is nothing novel about this Bill in that respect.</P>
      <P>Perhaps this is not the place to refer to the expenses that must be borne by RTE, but I would merely say in this regard that we will have to reconsider the way in which the authority are financed.  We must realise that it is necessary that they be given sufficient money to run the station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advertisement on television relating to TV spongers is a disgrace to the nation.  The actor who participates in this advertisement has a very fine voice.  I have heard him on many other programmes, but for this particular programme he adopts a pseudo Dublin accent.  We must remember that all television viewers are not in Dublin and also any Dubliner I know, <Col N="1232" /> regardless of which part of the city he comes from, has not an accent like the one used by the actor concerned.  The advertisement is an offence not only to Dubliners but to everybody else.</P>

      <P>I should imagine that the keeping of registers will eliminate the necessity for detector vans.  It would seem a waste of money to use both systems simultaneously.  I notice that in section 10 the onus is to be on the owner to prove his innocence instead of it being the other way round.  This idea seems to be slipping into other legislation also.  I sympathise with the Department and I do not see how they could detect defaulters without pinning them down in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that prosecutions for non-payment of licence fees last year amounted to £6,000.  I see here that for a first offence the fine will now be £50 <Col N="1233" /> while for a second offence, it will be £100.  That seems rather steep.  However, it might result in defaulters paying up.</P>

      <P>It is more sensible to do that than to have a fine of £1 per day in respect of each day of default.  The onus of proof is difficult under that system.  We are all glad to see the abolition of radio licences. The situation in this respect has become ludicrous because many people had several transistors for which they did not buy licences.  I understand that it was costing the Department more to collect the licence fees than was actually being gathered in this way.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with radio frequency. I hope this will not result in any interference with existing ham radio operators. During the week I received a couple of letters from people who derived much pleasure from this pastime and they expressed fears that this legislation might in some way cut across them.  In any case, we have never had these walkie-talkies here so there is nothing revolutionary in that.</P>
      <P>It was inevitable that this legislation would be introduced because when there is a law in existence provision should be made for ensuring that everybody adheres to it.  As I see it, the only objection that people could have to the Bill is that it is another intrusion into their private affairs; but, as I have said, when one's bank account can be inspected, one can hardly call his soul his own.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome this Bill.  We accept the view that it is anti-social and undemocratic that a very small minority of viewers do not pay their share of the cost of our radio and television services.  Therefore, it is only proper that current legislation, not having been reviewed and updated for at least three or four decades, should be amended as is being done here.  Accordingly, we support the Bill.  We do not regard it as being contentious or controversial although defaulters who might be fined £50 would a get severe shock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> As the Minister has pointed out it is estimated that there are about 40,000 people in the country who are getting away with about £300,000 per annum. As one who pays his television licence fee but who defaulted on one occasion through oversight, I appreciate that everybody should pay up.  I am a little worried about the method of notification of overdue licences.  There may be cases where people will be away on lengthy holidays or may be away from home because of illness or some other reason for a lengthy period but who may come home to find, as one finds nowadays in one's letterbox, a proliferation of notices and other material.</P>
    <P>I must confess I have found it difficult to extract the scruffy little card I receive from the Department reminding me that my television licence is due.  I would ask the Minister and his Department to design a proper notification and, if necessary, to send a second and a third notification.  There are other bodies which send subsequent and final notices.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs might adopt the same practice.  Once the Bill receives the President's signature we will, of course, all be very careful.  I have no sympathy for those who are caught in evasion. They should be hammered.  However, a very small fraction may unwittingly overlook payment and they should receive some sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>I appreciate there will be extra clerical work imposed on television dealers making returns to the Department, but this is unavoidable.  It is another piece of bureaucracy and, while we commiserate with the dealers, it is essential that we should have their co-operation.  Indeed, I think their co-operation is overdue.</P>
    <P>Section 4 requires television dealers to notify the Minister of hire purchase and credit sale agreements current on the passing of the Act.  I hire my set but, if I had bought my set last year, the dealer would not have to notify the Department.  I gather that is the interpretation of this particular provision. Might I suggest that there should be 12 months retrospection?  I am sure most dealers would have the names and addresses of those who <Col N="1235" /> bought sets in the last year.  Someone could have bought a set and installed it in his week-end country cottage and he could get away with not paying the licence fee.  If records of HP and credit sales have to be notified then previous transactions by way of sale should also be notified.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister enlighten us about paying one's licence fee by way of credit transfer and banker's order? There has been a tremendous growth in the use of cheque books and people might find it useful if they could get from the Department a credit transfer slip and then a banker's order slip and that should be an end of it.</P>
    <P>A special case must be made for those who do not have the benefit of multi-channel facilities.  We along the east coast have those but there are areas which do not have this facility. I do not think they should be subject to a £50 fine for a very poor service or no service at all.  This is a point that must be made.  It may be outside the scope of this measure.  I have been in parts of the country in which there is low ESB voltage or in which the use of machines without suppressors constitutes a very serious interference with television reception.  I know families who for months on end have either very poor reception or no reception at all.  When this Bill comes into operation every effort should be made to ensure that reception all over the country is the very best possible.</P>
    <P>Hammering the 40,000 who fail to pay licences is a rather odd way of getting money for RTE.  I know RTE need the £300,000 very badly.  There should be a full-scale review of the method of financing Radio Telefís Éireann.  Radio na Gaeltachta will mean increased expenditure.  I think all of us here would willingly vote any money required for the service.  We support this Bill and we do not propose to table any amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill.  It is, as the Minister says, very unfair that those who pay their licence fee should subsidise those who do not. That is something with which we all <Col N="1236" /> agree.  An extra £300,000 for RTE will represent an increase of about one-eighth in revenue.  Deputy Hogan O'Higgins was rather derisory about the TV spongers.  It is in rather poor taste but, like the curate's egg, it cannot be all bad since it has met with a good deal of success.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister propose to get after secondhand sets?  If I sell my set privately to the Minister who will ensure that the Minister has a licence for that set?  This is a possible loophole.</P>
      <P>Section 10 provides that until the contrary is shown by the defendent, it shall be presumed that on that day the apparatus was in the possession of the person who was then the occupier of the premises and that he did not hold a licence for it at the time to which the prosecution relates.  I am told this sort of provision is in quite a lot of legislation but I think it is wrong that a person is presumed guilty until he can prove himself innocent.  We always presume in this country and the best television courtroom dramas always told us that a man was innocent until the law of the State proved him guilty. This may not be sustainable in law but in justice there is something to be said for it.  This now takes the opposite point of view, that a man is guilty until he can prove himself innocent.  If the Department are to spend a considerable amount of money chasing defaulters they should go the whole hog and even if they must go back again and again to certain houses they will gradually, as the records from the dealers become available to the Department, be eliminating the people who have unlicensed sets.  I do not think it is too much to ask them to keep on chasing those people rather than bringing them to court as guilty people and making them prove their innocence.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister's assurance that under this Bill an order cannot be made by some future Minister for Posts and Telegraphs which would require licensed television dealers to build into the price of a set the cost of a licence, that the dealers are not to be made collectors of the licence fee for the Department.</P>

      <P>We must all agree that people who have been using television sets for years without licensing them can have no complaint if they now get a hefty crack of the whip.  It is remarkable that it is not the really poor who do not have a licence.  It seems to be the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing with certain people to brag that they have never taken out a licence and do not intend to do so.  Many of them have devised ways of avoiding detection, such as indoor aerials.  I should not like to see the full rigour of the law being applied to somebody who had a licence when he first had a set, but because of family commitments was unable to meet it later.  Those are the people who get caught.  I have no sympathy with those who have quite a good income but do not want to pay the licence fee.  These are usually the people who complain about the programmes. They say it is not worthwhile paying for the type of service we get from RTE.  We can get four or five stations very clearly in certain areas and the case is made that four of the five are free and they do not see why they should pay for what they consider to be an inferior service.  This is a peculiar argument but it is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy with those who live in areas where Telefís Éireann is the only station that can be got and, indeed, a very poor reception of Telefís Éireann.  It might be an idea if the Minister would consider having a different licence fee in areas where reception is very good.  This may sound a little awkward to administer but, coming from where he does come from, he will admit that reception is not as good there as it is north of Dublin city.  If he succeeds in getting the additional money mentioned here. I hope an effort will be made to strengthen both Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann so that people on the other side of the Border can receive them.  We get the British services. Radio Éireann disappears beyound <Col N="1238" /> Dundalk.  When you pass the Cooley mountains you get very poor reception. Telefís Éireann does not go beyond that at all.  If the Minister gets additional money I hope he will be able to beam them across so that we can put our point of view on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned notification of RTE by the people who sell or hire sets.  Does the Minister think this will have any effect on the staff of the Post Office who at present do something in this line?  There is a detection unit.  Is it proposed to continue its use or to interfere in any way with the Post Office staff or is it proposed to ensure that they do not suffer a loss?  When changes like this are affect people in a way finds that they affect people in a way which was not at first considered possible.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister have discussions with the Minister for Social Welfare about an extension of the free television licence?  There are people who are as much, if not more, entitled to this than some of the people who have got it.  I assume the reason why they have not got it is that RTE feel that the loss of revenue would be too great. I would ask that this should be considered.</P>
    <P>Have RTE made any effort to recover in other ways the amount of money which has been lost by the discontinuance of cigarette advertising? I read recently that the loss amounted to £400,000.  Surely it should be possible to collect extra revenue from advertising. The air space seems to be there and I have not noticed any longer periods between the advertisements. When cigarette advertising went off I expected that we could view for a few minutes without a break but it is still a case of somebody spoiling a good advertisement with a programme.  The Minister should look into this and see if other advertisements can be got because otherwise it looks as if the people who do pay for their licences will have to provide more.  Those who pay do not complain too much and those who do not and who can pay should not be allowed to get away with it any longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill the main objective of which is to reduce to a minimum the evasion of payment of licence fees.  This is admirable. It is very important that we should not allow people to get away without paying radio or television licences.  These people expect the service at the expense of those who pay for their licences.  Radio and television are running into increasing financial difficulties due mainly to a levelling off in advertising revenue. RTE decided voluntarily to eliminate cigarette advertising.  That decision caused a reduction in revenue.  If we could get everyone with a radio or television set to pay for his licence the Government might not be forced to increase the licence fee.</P>
      <P>I note from the Minister's speech that it is estimated that there are about 40,000 unlicensed sets in use at present.  I believe this is a conservative figure and that a figure of 60,000/ 70,000 would be more correct.  If everyone with a TV set paid for a licence the additional revenue accruing could be used to provide good television reception in remote areas where reception is poor or non-existent.  In an area near Glengarriff and in many parts of west Cork and south-west Kerry reception is very poor.  Any additional money which the Minister can get for RTE should be used to improve the existing service and to ensure good reception in all areas.</P>
      <P>I should prefer to see this happening rather than to see multi-channel television being provided in certain areas. Before we consider multi-channel television we should ensure that all our people can get good reception from our own network.</P>

      <P>The maximum fine of £50 is very steep.  This represents a five-fold increase.  This is very harsh.  I do not agree with the speakers who recommend that the Minister should impose such a fine.  There are people who evade paying licence fees. Those of us who looked at the &ldquo;Late, Late Show&rdquo; last week saw young married couples, the breadwinner being unemployed.  These young couples said that they would have to get rid of their cars and television sets in order to make ends meet.  If they do not pay for their television licences they will be faced with a fine of £50.  The husband, or whoever was the licence holder, will have to go to jail if he does not pay the fine.  Cases like this will be taken to court.  I hope that they will be considered sympathetically.  A fine of £50 is very steep.  The biggest deterrent for most people who evade paying for their licence is to see their names in the local paper.  This worries most people more than the fines do.</P>

      <P>The disgrace of seeing one's name in the local paper for evading tax or for the non-payment of radio, dog or car licence fees acts as a deterrent.  People worry about such things and are prepared to go to great lengths to avoid this happening.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers I do not agree with the type of advertisement which appears on television in connection with non-payment of licence fees.  A plain statement about the possibility of a fine should be sufficient.  The category I have mentioned is the only one with which I have sympathy.  I am sure that district justices will have sympathy with such people if they appear before them charged with non-payment.  The Minister does not wish to sanction another increase in television licence fees this year.  He is doing everything possible to avoid an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Minister mentioned that colour television would not be a <Col N="1241" /> feature of our services for some years to come.  Each night approximately two hours colour television is transmitted from RTE.  The number of colour television sets must be increasing weekly and monthly.  It is estimated that there are about 30,000 colour television sets in the country&mdash;perhaps that should be 3,000.  Anybody who can afford £300 for a colour television set can certainly afford to pay double the licence fee, as is the case in England. The Minister could introduce a special licence fee for colour TV because if two hours colour television is to be given to the well-off section of the community who can afford to pay £300 for a colour television set they can afford to pay double the licence fee.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the £1.50 licence fee suggests to me that revenue is being lost here.  This could be continued if RTE are in straitened circumstances at the moment.  Perhaps it is the difficulty of collecting the money that is cancelling out the fee itself.  At present I believe 8 per cent are evading collection. If that figure can be got down to about 4 per cent it is as low as it is likely to be.  It will become increasingly difficult and more expensive to catch this remaining 4 per cent.  Perhaps what the Minister is doing in this Bill will catch those people.</P>
    <P>There is very poor radio reception in many areas of the country.  I travelled from Galway to Dublin today, which is perhaps the area of best reception because we pass the Athlone transmitter. In my constituency in Wicklow it is almost impossible to receive Athlone but the reception from distant stations is overpowering.  The Dublin medium wave transmitter cannot be received beyond Bray.  There is very little point in having Radio Éireann on the medium wave if one cannot receive it.  When I was in Wexford recently I found the same difficulty.  The answer is VHF but not everybody can change his set when he wants to change his reception frequency.  Reception is not very good on car radios either.  Perhaps the power could be boosted, particularly on the Dublin transmitter.  Many people like to listen to the radio especially those who cannot afford a television set.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> The popularity of tape recorders and cassette recorders is growing at a fantastic rate.  I do not think this particular type of apparatus can be licensed.  I wonder how many people know that there is copyright infringement by recording perhaps music or radio broadcasts on these.  I do not think these come under this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know if people who use tape recorders to record radio programmes are breaking the law.  I would like the Minister to look at certain categories of people who may be fined up to £50 for the first offence.</P>

The Government are found of telling us that they have regard for the people in the country yet they are responsible for this official advertisement.  No matter what the Minister says this is an advertisement for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and they can determine what the advertisements contain.  I agree with Deputy Kavanagh that a straightforward statement should be made.  I suppose the expression &ldquo;TV Spongers&rdquo; is regarded as &ldquo;trendy&rdquo; and supposed to be &ldquo;with it&rdquo;.  In fact, a sponger is a different kind of human animal altogether.  If the RTE administration have drafted this advertisement for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs they should be ashamed of themselves. If they have not the common decency to stop it they should get a good kick in the posterior from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The Minister and the Government are interested in getting into the news on television.  In the middle of the news on two occasions we got biased reporting about redundancies from the chairman of the Industrial Development Authority when redundancies were soaring.  These lies were put across on television.  I could not speak too strongly about this matter of the television advertisement.

      <P>I shall be very brief on this.  I understand that Telefís Éireann comes within the scope of the Bill before the House.  In my opinion the programmes televised are, generally <Col N="1244" /> speaking, reasonably good.  However, I was listening very attentively to Deputy Dr. O'Donovan, who referred to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs advertisement describing people who have not paid their licence as TV spongers and issuing a warning to them.  I want to agree most emphatically with what Deputy Dr. O'Donovan said in that regard.  That advertisement is most unbecoming and it must be possible to devise a more dignified way of warning TV licence defaulters. Wireless broadcasting and television are very important.  They are great media of education and steps should be taken to ensure that these media are not used disrespectfully.</P>
      <P>I do not devote very much of my time to either listening or watching but occasionally I enjoy programmes, particularly those on television.  I want to make one complaint.  Perhaps I should have addressed it to the Director of Broadcasting, but I did not.  In any case, I had the privilege of appearing on one of the &ldquo;Late Late Shows&rdquo;.  A number of other people were guests of Telefís Éireann on that occasion, but whether it was deliberate or whether it was lack of organisation, I was ushered out to the view ing seats without any introduction whatever to those other people on the panel.  It was only when the programme had almost concluded that I realised who some of those similarly invited were.  One was a writer of note whom I never had the pleasure of meeting previously, and I was completely unaware of his identity until the programme was just finishing.  In the course of the programme this literary gentleman produced a ream of cuttings from an inside pocket and commenced to quote some of those cuttings in relation to myself.  Naturally he was entitled to his cuttings and to his views, but anyone participating in those programmes, whether he is a Member of this House or anyone else, is at least entitled to know who the other people are who are participating in the programme.</P>

      <P>I am inclined <Col N="1245" /> to agree that it is outside the scope of the Bill, and perhaps I should not occupy the time of the House making personal complaints, but I would like the Minister to use his good offices in this regard.  While he could not compel the authority, at least he should advise them to show some respect to those who are good enough to accept the invitation to be their guests on a particular occasion.  Perhaps the reason for the discourtesy of which I complain was that one of the participants on the same occasion admitted during the show that he was the retired proprietor of a strip-tease show in the West End of London.  Such an introduction might have been rather embarrassing. However, incidents of this kind should not take place.</P>
      <P>I feel I may be doing a service to some other Member of this House who may find himself in the future in the embarrassing position in which one must be placed when one is ushered in among strangers without the courtesy of an introduction.  Although I am equipped with the knowledge that it has nothing to do with the Bill, I am taking this opportunity of saying what I have said not in the form of protest but by way of advice.  While criticisms may be hurled at RTE from time to time, they are doing a very fine job. It is not possible to please everyone. Providing a television service is extremely expensive and no matter what kind of programme is put out it will meet with both acceptance and criticism.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude I wish to refer to one matter in regard to which the Minister should have taken action.  I shall just mention it now and raise it with the Minister later when I am having some personal or social contact with him.  I refer to the extremely ill-mannered and unbecoming attack made on the Most Reverend Dr. McQuaid.  This was resented throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the signs of good government is that there should be a minimum amount of administration. I am of the opinion that a large part of this Bill is superfluous.  I am certain there is a sufficiency of apparatus available to the television service to detect set owners who have not got licences and I suggest that this is a typical method of creating more jobs for the boys.  I am against the Bill on that ground.</P>
      <P>I agree it is necessary to legislate in regard to interference with radio and television reception and that the Minister should have sufficient powers in this respect.  On the question of piped television, the television authority have seen fit to provide it in Dublin city and county but not to extend it to other urban areas such as Waterford and Cork.  They have been most unhelpful in the matter of allowing outside private firms to install such a service. The rule of 500 has no real basis as far as I am concerned and if the Minister saw fit to relax that rule it would be possible for outside interests to provide piped television in urban areas throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies for their contributions and for their acceptance of the proposals in the Bill. I was glad to note in particular a recognition of the need for more effective measures than are at present open to the Department to deal with the problem of evasion of licence fee payments. Some Deputies referred to the burden which the operation of the provisions of this Bill will place on dealers.</P>
      <P>I appreciate straight off that a certain amount of trouble will be created for dealers but I am sure they readily appreciate that they, too, will benefit from the effective reduction of the number of people who do not pay their licence fees.  As well as that, the additional revenue which will result will mean that the national television service can be strengthened and will be in a better position to improve on the attractiveness of their programmes.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I confidently look forward to the co-operation of dealers with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the measures which the implementation of the Bill will necessitate.  It is the intention of my Department to seek consultation with representatives of the dealers on the detailed implementation of the necessary measures as they affect them. There is nothing new in the principle of having information about sales or lettings of television sets made known to the Department.  For many years garages have been performing a somewhat similar function in regard to motor car transactions.  The vast majority of viewers pay their licence fees and their names and addresses are on record in the Department anyway. The additional information that will be forthcoming as a result of this legislation will merely mean that gaps in departmental records will be filled more quickly and efficiently than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> I wish to assure Deputies that the information so received will be used solely for the purpose of enabling the Department properly to collect revenue.  I might add that the type of legislation we are discussing is already in force in nine other west European countries, with a tenth on the point of bringing in similar legislation.  As far as we know, the legislation has worked satisfactorily in those countries and none of those administrations wishes to divest itself of power in this respect.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies, including Deputy Hogan O'Higgins, referred to the advertisement on RTE which is popularly known as the &ldquo;television spongers&rdquo; advertisement.  Deputy O'Donovan took great exception to this advertisement.  It can be argued that the fact that people took exception to this advertisement could be an indication that it is quite effective.  I should add that this advertisement is the responsibility of RTE.  They were asked to co-operate with my Department in this drive against people who were evading payment of licence fees. I am satisfied it was never intended to suggest that people with Dublin accents are the only defaulters&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

Personally, I do not like the advertisement; I think it is too slick and too gimmicky but we must admit that it is effective and that it works&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that many people do not like the advertisement and I have heard many objections. However, it can be argued that the advertisement is effective.  Deputy Hogan O'Higgins asked if section 7 would interfere with what are known as &ldquo;ham&rdquo; operators.  The section will not interfere with them in any way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond inquired if the method of notification about over-due licences could be improved.  Perhaps it could, but I do not agree with the Deputy that the little brown card which is sent out as a reminder is a scruffy card.  I admit it could be better but the Deputy must appreciate that we must do our utmost to keep the cost involved in the collection of fees to a minimum.  Deputy Desmond expressed some fears regarding the procedure for the collection of fees but I do not think it is necessary for me to go into detail on this matter unless the Deputy specifically wants me to do so.  I am satisfied, and I think the majority of the people are satisfied, that the method used is reasonable.  If a person is away on holiday for two or four weeks he will not be taken to court and hit with the maximum fine set out in this legislation. A reminder form is sent to each licence holder three days before the renewal date; a second reminder is sent 14 days after the renewal date and if a licence has not been taken out within 21 days of the renewal date a statutory declaration form is issued by registered post to the person concerned requiring him to state within 14 days if he has a licence.  As the Deputy can see there is ample time given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a different case.  I am sure if such a person were brought to court the district justice would look on the case with leniency.  Deputy Desmond also asked if records of sales last year would be made available to us.  I am advised that the Bill would not cover sales last year for the simple reason that there were no such records last year, at least not in the way that we would require them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, anyone who bought a television set for cash gets away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been the case up to now but from now on we will be able to check on these people. Deputy Hogan O'Higgins, Deputy Desmond and others referred to the general financing of RTE.  I do not think this matter comes under this Bill. I imagine that the general financing of RTE is being considered at the moment by the Broadcasting Review Committee and I should imagine when they are making their recommendations to me they will deal with this subject.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond suggested that in areas where there is bad reception people should not pay their licence fees.  The law requires anyone with a television set to have a licence, irrespective of the quality of reception, and whether his television set is working.  Therefore, in case people living in areas where the reception is poor might think, as a result of any publicity which may be given to what the Deputy has said, that they can have television sets without paying licence fees I should like to state the law in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Peter Barry raised a query about secondhand sets.  There is nothing in this Bill that will cover private <Col N="1251" /> transactions in secondhand sets.  If the Deputy wishes to give anyone his television set it would be impossible for my Department to register such a transaction.  Therefore, it is better to be practical and realistic and to admit that we can do nothing about private sales of secondhand sets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather serious. If I have a television set already, I can buy another one from Deputy O'Donovan and give it to Deputy Collins and it appears nothing can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Barry buys a secondhand set from Deputy O'Donovan and if the latter is a dealer in television sets he will have to register the sale and he will make the records available to my Department.  My officers will go to Deputy Barry and query him in connection with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine, but suppose I had one set and I buy another from a registered dealer which I pass on to Deputy Collins, how will the Department deal with Deputy Collins?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume Deputy Barry will be honest and say that the set was given to Deputy Collins&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I might not say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are many people who are dishonest I am afraid all the legislation books could not be effective.  However, I am advised that we have ordinary means of detection which might be quite effective.  If Deputy Collins is willing to run the gamble of having to pay a £50 fine he is entitled to take this gamble if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry mentioned that our inspectors should be more persistent or effective, that they should keep calling back and chasing the defaulters.  That would certainly be very effective but the cost would be exceptionally high.  At the moment our cost collection runs to about 11 per cent and if we had to keep calling back, as the Deputy suggests, and keep chasing after people who had not taken out <Col N="1252" /> their licences the cost of collection would be far greater than it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised some very interesting points.  He mentioned various attitudes of people, people talking about the licence.  Like Deputy Desmond, he suggested that if they have bad reception, people believe that they have not got to get a licence. It must be clearly understood that any person who owns an apparatus must have a licence for it whether it is working or not irrespective of the quality of the signal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose you give a set to your dealer and he holds on to it for seven or eight months and you are trying to get it back, must you still have a licence for it?  A man may have taken it away for repairs.  I have known it to happen in country areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If you license your set this week and if next week you hand your set to a dealer for repairs, I do not think there would be any point in your coming back to me, say, in two months time and asking for a refund for two months on the basis that the set was in for repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  You may not have your set when the inspector calls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to be in the position where that would be my only excuse to a district justice if I were brought before him in a case like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully expressed the hope that more television licences would be given under the social welfare umbrella.  I have no objection to this, if the Minister for Social Welfare can provide the moneys for television licences which I in turn will pass on to RTE.  He also suggested that there was no noticeable fall off in the advertising time on RTE.  It may not be noticeable to Deputy Tully or, indeed, to any of us, but it is a fact that there has been a fall off, as I said in my opening statement.  I shall read the full sentence again:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Costs have risen steeply and television <Col N="1253" /> receiver growth and advertising revenue are both levelling off.</P>
    <P>I understand that there has been a fall off in advertising.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully, Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins, Deputy Kavanagh and many other Deputies expressed the view that television and radio reception should be improved so as to give signal into areas in the Six Counties. I can say that RTE have been requested to proceed without delay with the replacement of the existing 100 kilowatt Athlone transmitter by a more powerful one with special anti-fade aerial.  This, I understand, will give excellent radio coverage over the whole of Ireland during the hours of daylight and reception during the hours of darkness will also be improved.  The cost of this is estimated to be in the region of £500,000.  It is hoped that the installation of the new transmitter will be completed within two years.</P>
    <P>Deputy John O'Leary thought that the number of unlicensed television sets in the country would be higher than 40,000 and suggested that the figure might be as high as 60,000 or 70,000. I stated how the figure of 40,000 mentioned in my opening speech was calculated.  It may very well be, as the Deputy suggests, a conservative figure and, if it is, it shows the great financial loss that RTE is suffering, even greater than I imagined it was.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary took pains to talk about the provision of a signal for areas such as Glengarriff, Bonane and similar areas which do not have television signal available to them.  For the record, I should like to say that about 98 per cent of the country has reasonably good television coverage and the other 2 per cent which has not got the best television coverage is being attended to by RTE.  I fully understand that people are impatient that greater progress is not being made.  The Deputy will probably be aware that as late as yesterday I met people from Glengarriff who are quite annoyed that they still have not got single channel television, that they still have not got the RTE signal.  They are very loud in their demands that at this stage of 1972 something should be done for them.  I agree with them and should <Col N="1254" /> sincerely hope that RTE will be in a position to provide the necessary transposers, not alone in Bonane and Glengarriff but also in Roscarbery and other areas that need it.  That is a very expensive business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh considers that the fines in the Bill are too high.  I should like to point out that these are maximum fines and I would expect that the maximum fine would be imposed only in rare and blatant cases.  I am sure a district justice would take the circumstances of the defendant into account when deciding on the amount of the fine in any particular case. Deputy Kavanagh seems to think that, instead of a maximum fine, people might be embarrassed in having their names in local papers.  I find it very hard to believe this.  I do not think that could be true.  The Deputy also expressed the fear that we are getting far too much colour television.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps my note is wrong.  The Deputy should know we have about ten hours colour television a week and this is necessary, according to RTE, for purposes of experiment and of training their staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's figure of 30,000 colour televisions is not correct.  To the best of my knowledge&mdash; I am open to correction on this&mdash;the figure is in the region of 5,000 to 10,000.  The Deputy made a suggestion which I have heard before, that is, that we should have a special licence for colour television.  Perhaps we should. Perhaps we should not.  Personally, I do not think we should because if I am charged £25 or £50 licence fee&mdash;and these are the figures that I might be thinking of&mdash;for colour television, I will look for £25 or £50 worth of colour from the station broadcasting the signal.</P>

      <P>That may be so but the Deputy must realise that there are <Col N="1255" /> areas outside the Pale where colour television sets are in use.  I am primarily concerned with RTE.  I believe that if we did have a special colour television licence fee it could create a demand for more colour and I have said publicly time and again that I will do everything I possibly can to slow down the introduction of full colour here, for obvious reasons.  I might say also that there is another thing we should consider and are considering in dealing with colour television sets, that is, the possibility of having a very heavy import duty on them.  Whether this is possible or not I will know in the near future.</P>

I know that Deputy Kavanagh said that people who record radio programmes are breaking the law.  Possibly they are but they are not breaking the laws which affect my Department.

      <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan asked me to advise the authority for him on a few things.  I shall not advise the authority on anything for Deputy Flanagan or anybody else but I shall make the authority aware of what Deputy Flanagan said. I should not like to think that any Member of this House was treated in a discourteous or ungentlemanly way by anybody in RTE.  If this were so I believe it should be brought to the <Col N="1256" /> attention of the authority.  I fail to get his second point about stripteases. Perhaps by repeating what he said I might share the headlines he hopes to get by saying it.  That and also what he said about Dr. McQuaid, as was pointed out by the Chair, are not matters for discussion on this Bill.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Collins is off the beam with all due respect to him.  I think he misunderstands the Bill, either intentionally or accidentally, or perhaps he is just trying to get in his plug about communal aerial licences for Waterford; I do not know.  The fact that he says this means &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo; and that therefore he is against it does not make sense to me.  I can assure the Deputy it does not mean &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo;.  If the Deputy were here earlier he would have heard Deputy Tully express the hope that nobody would be laid off as a result of this legislation. We certainly hope nobody will be laid off and I should like to assure Deputy Collins that nothing could be further from the truth than his remark that there would be &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo; here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is opening up a completely new field. I do not object to that and I would have no hesitation in discussing with him at any time what is involved in and necessary for piped television, licences for communal aerials and extension to multi-channel of single channel aerials if he wants that, but it does not come under this Bill.  I understand from some of the Deputy's remarks that he believes there is a good deal of money in piped television. I do not think many in RTE would share that view at this stage.  It was a popular belief some time ago but I think they have learned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy understood the Bill he would not make that statement.  I can explain this clearly to the Deputy if he so wishes. This is actually the nub of the Bill.  It provides for the notification to the Minister of individual television set transactions by registered television dealers.  Briefly, subsection (1) provides for the notification to the Minister of individual set transactions carried out by registered television dealers.  It requires that when a registered dealer sells or hires a set directly to a customer, he shall send to the Minister the information required before the last day of the month following.  This information is set out in Part I of the Schedule.  It is: (a) the date of the transaction, (b) the name and address of the buyer or hirer, (c) the make and type of set, if it is designed for reception in colour and whether it is portable, (d) the nature of the transaction, e.g. sale, hire purchase, etc., (e) the name and address of the seller or owner and of the person or persons collecting payments, (f) the address of the premises at which the set is to be installed, (g) any change in the address of the buyer or hirer within 30 days of the change coming to the knowledge of the dealer, (h) if there is a transfer from the dealer of the work of collecting payments, that is, to a finance company or a debt collecting agency, the name and address of the transferee within 30 days of the information coming to the knowledge of the dealer. I cannot see how the Deputy can maintain that the information we are seeking here is superfluous.</P>

      <P>This is really what I was referring to: where the dealer is required to notify the Minister of the actual details of a hire purchase or credit sales transaction.  I consider this information to be superfluous.  Surely the only information the Minister should require is the name and address of the person purchasing a television set.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() the deletion of `embossed or' from Rule 3 (2) of the Fourth Schedule, as amended by section 29 of the Electoral Act, 1963;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is tabled to ensure that in future the marking of ballot papers will be done by some type of perforation rather than by the present system of embossing.  In the original <Col N="1267" /> Acts the choice was left open as to whether ballot papers would be embossed or perforated.  What has happened in practice is that ballot papers are usually embossed.  We have all seen the machines in polling stations by means of which the presiding officer stamps the ballot paper and hands it out.  Subsequently we have all had experience of the confrontations and arguments that take place at the count as to whether or not a ballot paper is valid.  I have seen assessors with glasses trying to decipher the marking and decide whether it is an accidental marking or a proper stamp.  It would be better to decide on some uniform system of marking to ensure beyond yea or nay the validity of every ballot paper.</P>
    <P>I have here a ballot paper which was rejected.  Up here at the top there is an attempt at embossing.  The assessor decided that this ballot paper was invalid.  It was cast in County Monaghan and it was cast for Fine Gael&mdash;1, 2 and 3&mdash;but it was rejected on the basis that the mark was not adequate.  Hundreds of ballot papers up and down the country with that type of mark have been rejected.  It is to avoid that in future that I suggest in this amendment that we should cease having an optional arrangement, perforation or embossing, and have a uniform system less open to question because, towards the end of the day, the presiding officer gets tired, there is a rush of voters and he sticks these ballot papers into the machine and gives the machine a gentle tap and passes them out.  The embossing is hardly marked at all.  This is how the difficulty arises.  It should be possible to devise a perforating marker which would establish beyond yea or nay that the paper was properly stamped and, therefore, valid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Hogan in this.  We have all seen people looking at these ballot papers, holding them up against the light and feeling them with the tips of their fingers to find out whether or not the stamp has been applied.  It is bad enough at the counts, with the confrontations and the show of force, but all this is done in a <Col N="1268" /> special section and the act is put on for hours on end at times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the thinking of Deputies in this matter.  There have been a few cases in which it was difficult to determine whether or not the official stamp was on the ballot paper and whether or not it was a valid vote. However, in dealing with the amendment we must put it clearly on the record that as the law stands the official mark may be either by embossing or by perforation and the practice has been to emboss.  The hand-operated machines for carrying out this embossing are available and have been in use.  Indeed, after some complaints that were made at the last election I issued instructions to returning officers to check on those stamping instruments and to replace those that were deemed to have been worn and were not making the marks clearly.  It might be a good idea to use the perforating system but if I were to accept the amendment as the Deputy has put it down perforating the ballot paper would be the only lawful system.  If we were to pass it in this Bill we would be obliged to have perforation instruments available at the next poll which one may reasonably expect to be on the occasion of the referendum, possibly some time in April or May.  I want to tell the Deputy in the best faith that it would not be possible to acquire these instruments in time to have them available for a poll at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best estimate I have got has led me to believe that it would take about 12 months if we were to decide to do this.  We would be placing ourselves in a rather dangerous position if I were to accept the amendment now. However, I will make this suggestion to the Deputy.  As the law stands embossing or perforation may be used. We have operated the embossing and it has been fairly successful.  We have not operated the perforating system so we do not even know whether this system would be successful or not.  In other words, it has not been tried out and we might be groping in the dark with it and taking a chance.  If we were to accept the amendment I think we <Col N="1269" /> would be taking a very grave risk and subsequently it might be found by all that the perforating system was not desirable or successful, or as good as the embossing system.  I would suggest to the Deputy that maybe at some future election I could try out, as an experiment, in one constituency, the use of the perforating method of marking the ballot paper.  As the law stands, we can use either but it would take some time.  There is only one of these machines available to me for election purposes at the moment and I have some idea of the type of instrument we require but to acquire sufficient to cover the country would take 12 months and perhaps longer.  I think it might be a good idea to experiment in one constituency at some future election and then let a decision be made as to whether or not all elections should be done under this system afterwards and if so acquire a sufficient amount of instruments to operate that system.</P>
    <P>I could not accept the amendment.  It would place us in an impossible position. However, perhaps the Deputy would consider withdrawing the amendment and accept in good faith that I will consider carrying out an experiment at some future election in one constituency on the perforation system and see how it works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said, that it would take him 12 months to get a system of perforators to carry out this and as we are facing a referendum, he has certainly made a case.  I could not, therefore, push this amendment and I withdraw it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Before it is withdrawn would the Minister not agree that since the object of the amendment is to ensure that ballot papers are correctly marked and can be seen to be marked, surely the obvious thing to have done was to have issued instructions that a presiding officer who did not properly mark all ballot papers in election boxes at one election should not be employed again?  We would then have no mistakes.  The reason for mistakes was that people were so careless that in the evening they got <Col N="1270" /> five, six or a dozen of ballot papers, pushed them in together and then had not got the energy to push the lever down hard enough to make a mark. It would have been a simple solution. I do not accept the Minister's suggestion that it would be 12 months before the replacements could be got but I fear the cost would probably add another £10,000 or £12,000 to the £130,000 which the local elections will cost.</P>

Where reports have come to me that some presiding officers did not stamp I have given instructions that these people should not be re-employed at future elections.  There is a booklet of instructions for presiding officers and great emphasis is placed on their responsibility to ensure that each ballot paper is stamped properly and clearly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (j), page 3, to delete &ldquo;Counterfoil No..........&rdquo; and &ldquo;No..........&rdquo; from form of ballot paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments deal with the numbering on the back of the voting paper and the numbering on the counterfoil. <Col N="1271" /> The same numbers go on both.  I suggest that both should be removed.  In my view no number is required on the back of the voting paper particularly if validity is clearly established by proper stamping.  Neither do I see the necessity for having a number on the counterfoil, although I concede that it might be helpful to the presiding officer to see how many votes he has issued.  I do not know how many voting papers are in each book but if there was a standard number he could easily count the number of books at the end of the day and he would only have to count at most 50 or 100 of the incompleted book.  I do not think there is a great necessity to have the number on the counterfoil, although I have not got a terrible objection to that.</P>
    <P>This question arose out of a High Court action in which it was decided that the secrecy of the ballot was interfered with by entering into the ballot paper the number and the lettering on the register of electors of a particular voter and thereafter it was possible to trace how that voter voted. If we still retain the number on the back of the voting paper and on the counterfoil it will still be possible to trace how a person voted simply by observing the sequence in which the voting papers are given out.  It is questionable, if these amendments are not accepted and if the number is still on the back of the ballot paper and on the counterfoil, whether we may not be open to a second High Court procedure and find that we are still conducting our elections in an unconstitutional manner.  The Minister, with the advice of the Attorney General, cannot tell us that it is constitutional or it is not.  It is only unconstitutional when the High Court says it is unconstitutional. All we can do here, whether we are lawyers or lay people, is express an opinion.  The Minister is taking a risk in leaving it as open as that.  Admittedly, the question of the numbering on the back of the ballot paper and numbering on the counterfoil were not put as issues to the High Court judge when the matter was on appeal.</P>

      <P>Apart from the constitutionality aspect, there is still another side to it.  In all the electoral legislation ever passed in this House, there was always the little piece stuck in, and it is here in this Bill also, in reference to presidential elections, to a constitutional referendum and all referenda, and I presume it will still be considered necessary in respect of all ballot papers.  It is to the effect that the back of each ballot paper shall be numbered consecutively and the front and the counterfoil attached to it shall bear the same number.  It indicates that the number on the back of the ballot paper shall be printed in the smallest characters compatible with legibility. There is something slick in that.  I do not quite understand it.  Apparently, no legislation ever arose from this particular matter.  The writing must be as small as possible, presumably so that nobody could read it from the opposite side of a table.  If any legal problem had to be resolved the writing could be read with a microscope.  I show here the number on the back of a ballot paper and it is supposed to be so small as to be barely legible.  One could nearly read this paper from the far side of the House.</P>

      <P>I should imagine there has not been an exhibit like this before. That is all I have to say about this. There is no necessity for a long dissertation on a matter of this nature. The amendment is quite clear.  I am not particularly worried about the number being retained on the counterfoil. Deputy O'Donovan has other amendments in which he deals with taking the number off the back of the ballot paper only.  The removal of the name from the back of the voting paper is the crucial point.  If that is done we will have established absolutely and preserved the secrecy of the ballot.  Until we do that, we have not established as absolutely as is desirable the complete secrecy of the ballot.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment. Deputy O'Donovan will speak after me and he will ask the Minister to consider some other amendments also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be appreciated by the House that Deputy Hogan and myself have worked independently on this problem.  The reason why I suggest that the number might be retained on the back of the counterfoil was referred to by Deputy Hogan. My recollection of elections is that a certificate has to be issued by the presiding officer as to the number of ballots in the box.  My whole purpose was to ensure that at the end of the day, when they had the counterfoils, the presiding officer would not have any great difficulty in making out his certificate.  Unless there was a number on the back of the counterfoil, there <Col N="1274" /> could be difficulty.  Often not just one block is used, but sometimes one sees two or three different blocks being used at the one table.  The whole purpose of my amendments is to retain the number on the back of the counterfoil.  This is to ensure that life would be made easy for the presiding officer at the end of a 12-hour day.  Like Deputy Hogan I am not wedded to this, provided it is taken off the back of the ballot paper.  I want to refer to a matter to which Deputy Hogan referred and that is the very fact that in the action these words were put in:</P>
      <P>The number on the back of the ballot paper shall be printed in the smallest characters compatible with legibility.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the reason why that was put in was because there were grave doubts in the Minister's mind, and in the minds of his advisers, as to how to deal with the matter properly. They thought up this method.  It would be far better not to have this kind of thing at all.  The last day the Parliamentary Secretary talked about stuffing the ballot boxes with paper.  If the presiding officer is a responsible person &mdash;and the Minister has assured us that if a presiding officer is found irresponsible he is let leave&mdash;this difficulty would not arise.  Suppose that some ballots did get into the ballot box without being properly dealt with, if they had not been stamped they would not count.  I do not see how they could get in, but if the number of papers in the ballot box did not correspond with the certificate of the presiding officer there would be a variety of ways of doing it. If it is a minor discrepancy, say four, five or ten, they could be chosen by lot.  If, in fact, there were twice as many ballot papers in the box as there should be, the whole box should be scrapped.  If that happened at the moment I take it the whole box would be thrown out. I do not think there is any other method of dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explained why I put down this amendment and why I have no objection to having the number on the counterfoil.  It is true, as the Minister said, that the High Court did not hold this to be unconstitutional.  The <Col N="1275" /> High Court had a more important matter to decide.  The primary thing put to it by the plaintiff in the action was that your registration number was written on the counterfoil.  This was the basis on which the case was decided. The judge made an <i>obiter dictum.</i> He said: &ldquo;We find that all right.&rdquo; It was not the case that was put to him.  The case that was put to him was that the voter's registration number was written on the counterfoil and that you could track it quite easily by comparing the two.  Deputy Hogan and myself are really in agreement on this and, perhaps, we could hear from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hogan made an interesting comment when he said that neither the Minister nor the Attorney General would decide whether a matter was constitutional or not.  I accept that this is a matter which we allow our courts to decide.  In the case I mentioned numbering the back of ballot papers and the counterfoils came before the courts.</P>
      <P>The courts were asked to declare unconstitutional Direction No. 5 in Part II of the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act, 1963, which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The back of each ballot paper shall be numbered consecutively and the front of the counterfoil attached to it shall bear the same number. The number on the back of the ballot paper shall be printed in the smallest characters compatible with legibility.</P>
      <P>The court did not decide to do so and it can be taken from that that the provision has been given a clear bill of health from the constitutional viewpoint.  We are now being asked to remove the serial number on the ground that it endangers the secrecy of the ballot despite the judgment of the Supreme Court, which Deputy Hogan accepts is the final arbiter in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That decision is good enough for me and I stand over it.  That disposes of the main point Deputy Hogan made, that we may be faced at some future date with a court case in relation to <Col N="1276" /> whether or not this matter is constitutional. It has already been decided by the court.  I do not want to talk too long on this because I cannot accept this at all.</P>
    <P>During the course of the Second Reading a number of Deputies said it was possible by reference to the serial numbers on the ballot papers to discover how particular electors voted.  I want to refute this completely. It was suggested by Deputies who spoke on it that it could be done by personation agents managing to ascertain and to note the number of an elector's ballot paper on the polling day and then at the count looking out for the marked ballot paper bearing the serial number concerned.  In fact, it is not possible to do this.</P>
    <P>Rule 32 of the Fifth Schedule to the Electoral Act, 1923, as amended by the Electoral Act, 1963, specifically provides that a returning officer must, while counting and recording the number of ballot papers, keep the ballot papers with their faces upwards and must take all proper precautions for preventing any person from seeing the numbers printed on the back of such papers.  Any person who communicates any of this information is committing an offence for which there are certain fines laid down.</P>

There are a number of important functions that this number fulfils and I will list some of them.  It is essential, first of all, to distinguish with some certainty one ballot paper from another.  The necessity to do this could arise where the returning officer's ruling on the validity of a particular paper is being questioned.  For example, if somebody brought an election petition to the <Col N="1277" /> courts on the basis that certain ballot papers ought to have been rejected at the count it would be necessary in a case like that to be able to identify with certainty the particular ballot paper concerned.  This could only be done by way of numbering the back of the ballot paper.</P>
      <P>It is also a very great safeguard against fraudulent ballot papers being used.  Of course, it facilitates the returning officer in recording the number of ballot papers issued to a presiding officer.  I do not think the House has objected to it being recorded on the counterfoil.  I do not know whether Deputy Hogan wants to press that.</P>
      <P>The House can appreciate from what I have said in view of the fact that the courts were asked to pronounce it to be unconstitutional and did not do so that it is necessary in my view to retain numbering on the ballot papers in order to distinguish one from the other.  This question of the smallest characters compatible with legibility is a reasonable requirement.  Obviously, if the lettering on the back of the ballot paper which no person is entitled to know under the law&mdash;the law provides for that&mdash;is printed in very heavy black type on the ballot paper there would be a very good possibility that it could be read through the paper if one came down very heavily on it.  This provision that it be printed in small lettering is reasonable.  Deputy Hogan says that the numbers on the ballot paper he has with him are not as small as to be compatible with legibility.  Of course, this is a relative thing but there is a technical difficulty here in that the availability of a numbering machine to print those numbers and the size of the machines available in the country are factors which determined the actual size.  It is small, although not tiny, and it complies with the spirit of that section of the regulations.  I do not think anybody would quibble with it. I would ask the Deputies not to press the two amendments.</P>

      <P>It is obvious from what has been said that the possibility of preventing how a man voted being known depends on the returning officer carrying out the instructions which the <Col N="1278" /> Minister has just given.  As every Deputy knows, this, in fact, is not done in the polling booth.  The bundles are turned upside down so that, in fact, whereas the regulation may provide some safeguard, the practice does not. Therefore, I contend that in practice at the moment a ballot paper can be traced.  This amendment will go the whole way towards marrying the practice and the rule in this case and it is absolutely essential that it be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I should like to ask the Minister a couple of questions.  How is the system of voting carried out in Britain? Do they, too, have a number on the back of the ballot paper with a corresponding number on the front of the counterfoil?  How does the Minister find it necessary to retain these numbers and how can he reconcile this with the system of voting which obtains, for example, in the United States, which I understand nobody objects to and which is regarded as secret voting?  There is no provision for this tremendous crosscheck because the voting is not recorded, as far as I know, by any system with numbers on the back of the voting paper and numbers on the counterfoil.  You pull a lever on a voting machine, and apparently it is regarded as satisfactory.</P>
      <P>As regards the question whether it is necessary to retain the numbers on the back of the voting paper and on the front of the counterfoil in order to prevent the production of fraudulent papers, the presence of the numbers on the back will not prevent an ingenious group of local politicians who have contact with the printing house and who can get the necessary co-operation from having a few duplicates printed in the morning and passing them in to the polling booth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the difficulty of having these numbers as small as is consistent with legibility on the back of the voting paper was that they did not have the machines to do the small printing.  That may be so, because the printing on this is the same size as the candidates names and the political parties to which they are attached, big black print out in front <Col N="1279" /> and the same on the back.  That can be read 20 feet away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that the more you hear this problem discussed the more you feel you are depending on the people who are conducting the election, the presiding officer and his assistant.  To my mind, the presiding officer who would deliberately turn up the numbers on the ballot papers so that they would be available to someone or other is the same type of person as Deputy Hogan has mentioned who would be capable of going into the printers or indicating in one way or another to an election agent that a particular person was using a particular ballot paper.  This human factor will exist while we have this system of voting, and I do not think there is any answer to it except the honesty and the integrity of the people who are appointed to conduct the elections.  We hear some frightening and funny stories of happenings in the past.  Those events are becoming less frequent and as time goes on the abuse of the ballot box will diminish even further.  Everyone is more conscious of it and is exercising more care.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, if something goes wrong there is no real check unless you have the absolute identity of the ballot papers and this can only be achieved by numbers. Therefore the Opposition Deputies, in trying to eradicate one abuse, may be creating another.</P>

      <P>It may have been a slip on the part of Deputy Dr. Gibbons, but we were referring to two different things.  I understand it was the counting the Minister was referring to when he spoke about the ballots being counted face upwards.  You may take it that when they are first sorted they are always counted face downwards and put into packets of 100. They are always counted face downwards.</P>

      <P>What I am saying destroys the case the Minister has made.  Of course, he has a legal point. It is quite true it is illegal, but do not forget that it is not the returning officer who does the counting; it is the individual counters and there are about 50 of them in a room; there is not a snowball's chance in hell of the returning officer going around and talking to them, with people leaning over the forms and all the rest of it.  You would imagine this counting of votes after an election was a legal business instead of being a decided confrontation, as everybody knows it is.</P>
      <P>I admit straight away that I did not look up the Electoral Act of 1933, but as regards this provision: &ldquo;The number on the back of the ballot paper shall be printed in the smallest characters compatible with legibility,&rdquo; of course Deputy Hogan is dead right: the numbers are enormous; they could nearly be read across the House.

It surprises me that the Government, having come so badly out of these constitutional cases continually, should still try to stick to what was only a side issue in the case that was brought to court. The case which was in the court was not referred to by the Minister.  He deliberately referred to a different matter.  He deliberately referred to the question of the numbers.

      <P>If I had not heard the remark it would have been better. The fact is that the Government, having lost those constitutional cases, time and again are most anxious to prove that the administration is right. Administrators never make mistakes. A great thing in the Civil Service, it is said, is that whatever you do do not make a mistake because it will never be forgotten.  Also it is said that the man who never made a mistake never made anything.  That is quite correct and that is why the administration ticks over so slowly.  It is why the Government could not get the stamps made for 12 months&mdash;rolling the old barrel along, slowly and systematically. Let us be straight about it.  I was shocked when I heard the Minister talk the way he did about this matter. When he was talking at first on the earlier amendments, I thought he would see reason in these amendments in relation to the matter at issue.  Mind you, he will have to listen to an awful lot of talk in the House on this matter if he does not see reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to what the Minister said about the sentence which goes back to the original 1923 Act stating that the number shall be printed in the smallest characters <Col N="1284" /> compatible with legibility.  The Minister gave the game away when he said a little later: &ldquo;Of course this is a relative thing&rdquo;.  That sentence may conceivably mean something to lawyers, but to all sorts of people it is a sentence without meaning.  It has been echoing down through 50 years and it has no meaning.  The Minister said it is a relative thing depending on the light and depending on the chap who is trying to read it.  It is not meant to have any meaning and the reason it is not meant to have a meaning is that you can then have figures on the back of the ballot paper of the size Deputy Hogan showed us and nobody can for a moment pretend that those figures are the smallest that are compatible with legibility.</P>
      <P>Then one can come along and ask how small is &ldquo;compatible with legibility&rdquo;? Nobody can answer that.  It is not meant to be answerable.  It is meant to be a nice fiction, it looks polite and indicates a good intention, but it is not definable.  Of course the protestations of innocence from the Fianna Fáil benches are deeply impressive. The reason for this is that a loophole is left so that whether the vote can be traced or not, electors can be led to believe it can be traced.  Even if it is not traceable, even if the Minister's argument is true, even if the rules are carried out, it would be possible to make the voters believe the vote was traceable, even if it were never done.</P>
      <P>This belief is very useful intimidation of voters.  It is conceivable that laws can be made and can remain on the Statute Book which are without meaning in the sense that the smallest characters compatible with legibility is a phrase without meaning.  However, this does not make for good legislation. Indeed, it is a degradation of legislative purpose and it lends itself to the abuse Deputy Hogan spoke about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some cogency in the counter arguments the Minister presented but to satisfy me he will have to get over this central objection, because not alone must the vote be untraceable but the voter must be satisfied that it is untraceable.  As long as you have on the back of the voting paper a number of indefinable size this will <Col N="1285" /> not be so.  We can be offered the fatuous excuse that one cannot get a printing machine to print small enough, but once you get into that situation you are in cloud cuckoo land.  The objection is not just that the vote is traceable or may be traceable but that you can browbeat people into conforming to your wishes because it can be said to them, not of course by <Col N="1286" /> the Minister or by any Member of this House, but by less reputable people: &ldquo;Well, now, we deliver for you and you deliver for us and if you do not deliver your vote for us we will know.&rdquo;</P>
