    <Title>Finance Bill, 1972: From the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>A message was received from the Seanad that it had accepted the Finance Bill, 1972, in respect of which it had made the following recommendations:</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 26.</P>
    <P>1.  In page 17, line 22, that &ldquo;after the passing of this Act&rdquo; be deleted and &ldquo;on or after the 19th day of April, 1972&rdquo; substituted and in line 25 that &ldquo;, and appropriate repayments shall be made accordingly&rdquo; be inserted after &ldquo;1971&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 27.</P>
    <P>2.  In page 17, line 40, that &ldquo;after the passing of this Act&rdquo; be deleted and &ldquo;on or after 19th day of April, 1972, and appropriate repayments shall be made accordingly&rdquo; substituted.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 28.</P>
    <P>3.  In page 17, line 41, that &ldquo;after the passing of this Act&rdquo; be deleted and &ldquo;on or after the 19th day of April, 1972&rdquo; substituted and in page 18, lines 5 and 6 that paragraph (b) be deleted and the following substituted:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  by the substitution of &lsquo;£7,500&rsquo; for &lsquo;£5,000&rsquo; in both places where it occurs in paragraph (d) (ii).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> and appropriate repayments shall be made accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 29.</P>
    <P>4.  In page 18, lines 13 and 14, that &ldquo;after the passing of this Act&rdquo; be deleted and &ldquo;after the 19th day of April, 1972, and appropriate repayments shall be made accordingly&rdquo; substituted.</P>
    <P>Ordered: That the recommendations be now considered.</P>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee, accordingly, to consider the Seanad recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee accept recommendation No. 1.</P>
      <P>These recommendations refer to four sections of the Finance Bill, namely sections 26, 27, 28 and 29. The purpose of the recommendations is to secure that the sections in question, which accord increased estate duty reliefs with effect from the date of the passing of the Bill, will instead be operative as and from the 19th April, 1972, which was, of course, Budget Day.</P>
      <P>During the passage of the Finance Bill through the Seanad a case was made to me that it would be more equitable that the general estate duty provisions in sections 26 to 29 of the Bill should apply to estates of persons dying since the date of announcement of the release.  Death duty provisions generally, whether of a relieving or a charging nature, are traditionally effective from the date of the passing of the Finance Act.  I was, however, impressed by the particular case made in the other House that the general duty reliefs in sections 26 to 29 should be operative from Budget Day.  Among others, the estates of those who died in the recent air crash in London would be affected by this amendment.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, commend to the House these recommendations which are designed to give effect to this aim. The additional cost involved is about £40,000 in the current year.</P>

      <P>We heartily support <Col N="1881" /> this proposed change.  It indicates that, when it is possible for the Seanad to express views on the Finance Bill in time for it to come back to the Dáil, something good can come of it.  I hope our arrangements in future will continue to make it possible for the Seanad to look seriously at this legislation and for us to consider their recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last night, I believe much of the trouble in the North-East is due to economic factors rather than any clash of religious beliefs and that, if there was full employment there, there would be a lot less trouble.  The Catholics and Protestants see themselves as enemies when, in fact, they are merely competitors for the too few jobs that are available. Because of the fact that one side had the power to allocate whatever jobs that were going they became synonomous with those professing a certain faith.  The Catholic feared and sometimes hated the Establishment because they had the power to decide whether he should have a job or not.  People talk about removing the barriers that divide the communities.  I think one <Col N="1883" /> of the great barriers is the fact that there is not full employment North or South.</P>
      <P>Last night I quoted a Mr. Gusty Spence, late of Crumlin Road Jail and now believed to be a guest, willingly or unwillingly, of the UDA.  Mr. Spence, who comes from the Shankill Road area, said the people of that area had suffered just as much as the Catholics had from unemployment and bad housing.  I agree wholeheartedly with him.  If we are to have a united Ireland we must first build up the economy so that we can offer to Gusty Spence and his people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy consider Gusty Spence a suitable person to mention in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;full employment and the security that has so far been denied them.  People in this House and outside it when talking about the North are apt to stress those factors which divide us instead of those which would unite us.  They serve the cause of unity badly by these tactics. We should go out and discover what common ground we have, what we can offer to those who differ from us, what their rights would be in a united country and we should suggest that unity would be worth sacrifices on both sides and should emphasise that the sacrifices the majority in the North would be asked to make would be very small compared with the tremendous sacrifices they are making at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deep in the hearts of the vast majority of the people in the North, Nationalist or Unionist, is a great desire for peace.  There cannot be peace unless the causes of conflict are removed. One cause of the conflict was the exploitation of the less well-off sections of the community, irrespective of religion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to select a single factor as the cause of the trouble in the North.  It is suggested by some people that we would merely have to amend the Constitution and that this would act like a magic wand in sweeping away all the objections of <Col N="1884" /> Orangemen and Protestants in the North to our Constitution.  I admit that, as the Constitution is now 35 years old, some examination is necessary with a view to improving it.  Those who call for the scrapping of the Constitution should tell us what they would put in its place. They must spell out not only their objection to the Constitution but also what they would put in its place.  We will not impress Northern Unionists by tampering with the Constitution. They are hardheaded people.  They would like to see evidence of our desire to ensure that they would have a proper living in a united Ireland, with full employment, proper housing, proper social services, with freedom to march when they want to march, providing they do not become so provocative as to march through certain areas and act in an ungentlemanly manner.</P>
    <P>One must regret the happenings in this part of the country from Donegal to the Curragh Camp, where there were demonstrations and some hooliganism by people who profess to be <i>avant garde</i> Republicans.  We must examine our own position as regards such things as housing, with a view to a united Ireland.  While in some respect magnificent progress has been made in the North, many areas remain in which housing is bad.  We should accelerate our housing drive even more.  We can point with pride to the fact that last year a record number of almost 17,000 houses were built.  While this is encouraging, we need another 2,000 houses annually to reduce the backlog and the waiting list.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the North would not join us because our social welfare benefits lag behind theirs.  I wonder if that is the case.  In respect of widows pension, there is no age limit here whereas there is an age limit in the United Kingdom.  There are other categories of social welfare in which we are ahead of the United Kingdom.  This has been achieved without massive subsidies from any other country.  This should give hope to the people in the North that if they join this part of the country we could <Col N="1885" /> increase our social welfare services so that they would be in some cases better than those available in Britain, without massive subsidies from Britain.  If we had the genius of the people in the North, their craftmanship and expertise, we could be a great country.</P>
    <P>Their place is here, not alone because of what they can contribute to us but of what we can contribute to them.  An improvement in the standard of living, better housing, better social services, increased employment opportunities are matters which appeal to the Northerner.  If, outside that, he wants to commemorate a battle that took place 300 years ago, let him do that.  I can visualise 12th July processions becoming a great tourist attraction and not a cause of strife, murder, and an attempt to suppress a minority.</P>
    <P>I suppose no one is capable of making proposals which would be acceptable to all of the people in the North and to all of the people here. It is only by discussion, by becoming totally involved, that we can hope to create a society in which guarantees are given to the people in the North and to the people in the South that our ambition is to build a State in which there would be freedom for all its citizens and which will afford a full life.  These are the links which we have with the North.  There is no use in saying, as some Members said, that this is a theocratic State, that the Constitution must be scrapped, and so on. Such talk would not impress Unionists in the North nor the man in the Belfast shipyards who, in all probability, is a Protestant.  In order to have a country catering for all the dissimilar elements, the first essential is for us to show our good faith to the people in the North, and to assure them that we can offer these things to them, that their place is here, where Catholic and Protestant will have a fair system of government.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in trying to placate the higher echelons of the Unionist Party, who will hang on to power for as long as possible.  We must speak to the people as a whole and convince Protestant and Catholic that they have been exploited for 50 years by wealthy Unionist elements, who would have <Col N="1886" /> continued to exploit them were it not that the mass media, in this latter part of the 20th century, can spotlight grievances and events such as those of Bloody Sunday in Derry, which were flashed to all parts of the world in a few hours, helping to focus attention on the North.  No longer is it possible to cover up the system which obtains in the North.  There is a great awakening of the people of all sects, religions and faiths in the North.  There is a realisation that there can be a brotherhood of man in a united Ireland where everyone will be assured a full life and decent conditions.</P>
    <P>We are willing at all times to discuss the position with the majority in the North and to put our cards on the table and say honestly, &ldquo;This is what we believe&rdquo;, and to let them tell us what they believe.  When the conference on the North comes, as it must come shortly, I hope that the spokesmen for the majority in the North will be some of those who have been expoited over the last 50 years and that it will not be left to the Unionist Party bosses to speak for these people.  In my opinion, that party have forfeited the right to speak for the people of the Shankill and other areas because of their 50 years of bad government, and of no government at all.</P>
    <P>What do we offer the people in a united Ireland?  We offer them the basic rights which are theirs, not because we want to entice them in here but because they have basic rights as human beings and these rights cannot be taken from them.  These rights have been denied to them to a great extent in the last 50 years.  In this part of the country these men would have full rights.  It may seem unnecessary to stress this, but we must try to overcome the vicious propaganda which has been directed against the minority in the North.  We must state over and over again that we welcome them as fellow-Irishmen, once they believe that the term &ldquo;Irishman&rdquo; embraces all those who live in any part of the country.</P>
    <P>We may have a solution in the North sooner than we think.  This must be our firm and fervent hope.  We hope that the killings will soon cease and <Col N="1887" /> that we can get down to building a new society which will offer a full life without fear of threats or violence.  We must realise that at the moment any settlement which would not give full justice to all the people in the North would be a bad settlement and would only result in another outbreak of violence in four or five years' time. This is what has happened all the time. If we believe that peace is indivisible and that we cannot have peace for one section in the North only, we must make sure that the final settlement is a just settlement which will remove the hardships and also help to create a society without ghettos in either Ballymurphy or Shankill.  In the new Ireland we must get rid of the ghetto mentality, whether it be on a religious or a class basis.  If that could be achieved there is a great future for our society.  In conclusion, I should like to suggest to the people in the North&mdash;it might be impertinent of me to suggest to the Members of this House what we should do in the North&mdash;that we should all try to avoid doing anything which would escalate frightful violence.  We can only do our best and hope that no words of ours will add one solitary incident to the sorry string of incidents which have caused the deaths of over 300 people.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on housing in this House on a previous occasion.  We must step up our building programme to 19,000 dwellings per year.  Last year 17,000 dwellings were provided.  That figure did not include the temporary dwellings provided by some of the local authorities.  It may seem repetitious of me to speak again about rates.  I spoke on this subject last week.  Rates are a burden in the North and in this part of the country.  The rating system is badly in need of drastic amendment which would relieve the newly-married couples of their imposition.  These young couples are striving to buy their houses.  There are old people who have reared families who now find themselves with a large rates bill each year. These people had hoped to have comfortable little homes in their old age.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have instituted a system of waiver for rates for certain categories, such as old-age pensioners.  This system must be expanded. <Col N="1888" /> There must be a large subsidy from central funds to provide for greater rates relief for newly-married couples and old people.  The local authorities operate their waiver of rates scheme in favour of pensioners, but the other ratepayers have to pay for that concession.  I am sure they do not grudge the money to assist these categories.  It is unfair to give relief to deserving ratepayers while at the same time most ratepayers find the rates a heavy burden, unless they themselves are wealthy. The Minister will state that the rates problem is tied up with reform of local government.  That is true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, it is with some reluctance that I propose to say some few words in this debate.  My reluctance stems from my having listened to the contributions made by the main speakers so far here from all three parties.  I have been stunned by what I heard and I am ashamed of being a Member of this Irish Parliament.  I am angered by the fact that we have obviously abandoned completely any concept that we may have ever had, or any ideas we may have ever cherished, in regard to the reunification and restoration of our national territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been all sorts of pleas not to say anything that might escalate violence.  This is the method, I presume, of warning anyone who does not agree with the Establishment and, when I say the Establishment, I mean the parties in this House, that if you do not agree, if you say anything in disagreement, then undoubtedly, having been forewarned, you will take the blame if any further difficult situations arise, if any further violence occurs, if there are any more deaths or any more blood spilt.  I suppose this is to be expected but, so far as I am concerned, <Col N="1889" /> I want to address myself now to the real problem that confronts this country.  Proposing to adjourn at this moment is to my mind sheer lunacy.  To take ourselves off for the next two or three months while we are now in the most critical situation we have encountered at any time during the past three years is, I think, madness.  Perhaps it could even be described as worse than madness.</P>
    <P>Why do we seem to run away when there is anything unpleasant about to happen, when it is our business and our responsibility to stay put?  Above all others we have the responsibility for what happens in this country.  Even the puppet Government in Belfast has now gone and this is the only forum there is.  This is the only body of elected representatives meeting to deliberate, and entitled to deliberate, on what should happen, on what is happening and what may happen in the future. But we throw all that away by adjourning, taking ourselves off out of here, lest we might be concerned and lest we might be expected to do something about happenings, happenings that may possibly put in the shade all the cruel actions of the past three years.</P>
    <P>We listened to the Taoiseach and, out of all that he said yesterday morning, all that we get is a bad copy of what others have been saying and, for their saying of it, they have been castigated: regional Government.  Now, without any qualifications or any attempted definition, we are given as a headline to the Taoiseach's speech yesterday morning, at this very critical point of time, &ldquo;A woolly sort of proposal of some sort of regional administration.&rdquo; In the name of Heaven, what does it mean?  How is it intended to be provided?  What will it do?  How can it work?  Who will be in it?  What territory will it cover?  Surely we are entitled to know.  Surely we are not expected to wait until Santa Claus comes next Christmas to tell us what it is all about.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach goes on talking.  He is talking only for the many people who agree with that particular line. Peace by agreement! Talking about <Col N="1890" /> peace by agreement at this stage is whistling in the dark passing the graveyard. What point is there in talking about agreement when the people we wish to have living in agreement cannot and will not sit down together to discuss their future in the North-East of this country.  They cannot and they will not have meaningful talks, no matter what we may say here.  God knows, we do not say much.  But they cannot and they will not sit down unless and until the circumstances are provided wherein the future of all our people in the North is seen to be tied up with living together in our own land, without let or hindrance on the part of any outside influence.  It is only by insisting that Britain gives a clear indication that she is taking her dirty paws out of the Irish scene we can expect the Orangeman or the Unionist, call him what you will, to talk.  He will not sit down to talk about the future of this island&mdash;he cannot be expected to do so, and this cannot be said often enough or loud enough by enough people enough times&mdash;in the present situation.  It will have to be brought home to Britain that she is the key and that that key must be turned before there will be any cessation of hostilities, any cessation of the violence, the difficulties and the deaths which are now part of the everyday scene in this island of ours. Can we not, since we are not prepared to do anything else, loudly and clearly keep reminding Britain that she must decide and declare that she is getting out?  Surely that is the least we can do, instead of going around wringing our hands, trying to find scapegoats within the island when the real goat is a goat from without the island.</P>
    <P>Let us have from Britain a cessation of her continued support of a fragment of this country, dominated by a contrived majority.  Unless we get that we will not get peace.  We will not get agreement and we will not have talks between those who must live together in the future.  Surely that is now evident even to the most blind, to the most ostrich-like of our people.  Surely it is evident to our representatives in this House as it must be evident to those outside it.  Get Britain to stop guaranteeing <Col N="1891" /> that she will prop up this regime, this artificial entity that she created 50 years ago.  Let her declare that she intends to leave.  Let her set a date to her leaving.  Let her say to the Northern people and to the Southern people: &ldquo;You have a year, or two years, to put your heads together, find your own solution for living together but, whether you find it or whether you do not, we will go.  We want no more of it&rdquo;.  If Britain wants peace and wants a settlement of the age-old Irish problem, this is the only way she can come to it.  This is the only way that will bring about unity in time, unity with the least possible violence.</P>
    <P>We could be seeking this.  We could be elaborating this to the people in Britain by propaganda and publicity. This is what we should be doing.  Instead of that we have silence.  We are not allowed to discuss the situation. We have not been allowed to discuss the situation since the so-called initiatives of the British Government some three months ago.  It is said it would be imprudent to discuss the situation. It is said it would be dangerous for the elected representatives in this part of the country to be given an opportunity of discussing what was proposed by Mr. Heath.</P>
    <P>Apart from ridding us, once and for all, of the Stormont Parliament, what did Mr. Heath propose?  What has he done since towards a solution?  Where is all the Ballyhoo today that followed his statement three months ago? Where is all the talk we heard about the great promise in these initiatives? I could not see what was in them then and I have not been able to see since what was in them and there is nobody now who can find out what was in them.  It was a phony effort which was made more phony by the phony people both here and in the Six Counties telling us of what a great achievement it was.</P>
    <P>Let us reflect for a moment on what was said here by other speakers. Deputy Cosgrave, for instance, sees the minority in the Six Counties as being at war with the Protestant people there. How can he ignore that it was Mr. Maudling who declared war?  Why not castigate Mr. Maudling, the Conservative <Col N="1892" /> who sent the British Army to this country to declare they were at war? There was not a word of condemnation from Deputy Cosgrave for the brutal excesses and killings of which the British Army have been guilty. These atrocities do not seem to concern those who speak during this debate.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Corish talk of a plebiscite for peace.  Does he not realise that the people of Ballymurphy, the Creggan, the Bogside and the Falls and, indeed, the oppressed people throughout the Six Counties desire peace?  Does he not know that the people on the run desire peace?  Does he not know that those who are interned desire peace and that they desire it much more than any of us desire it? All those who suffer in the North desire peace.  They have not chosen suffering as a way of life.  They are suffering because of the circumstances into which they were sold 50 years ago. They have languished there since but three years ago they decided that they could take no more and because of that they are now to be condemned out of hand as violent people.  Surley this is not the way it could have been envisaged that the Government here who arose from the sell-out of 50 years ago would react?  Surely this is not what the people who lived before that period fought and worked for?  They did not fight so that we here might enjoy the freedom that belongs to all the people of this island.  Are we to ensure now by every means at our disposal that nothing will disturb our sweet way of life on this side of the Border?  Anything that we have here belongs as much to the people of the North as it belongs to us.  The fact that we have been enjoying all of this for 50 years while they have been denied it must indicate that there is a balance in their favour and that this balance should be made available to them. Should not we be prepared to make sacrifices materially in order that the people of the Six Counties might enjoy ultimately full freedom in all of this island?  Because we have attained that freedom for ourselves as a result of the struggles and sacrifices of others we have no reason to claim it is ours alone while the people of the North are <Col N="1893" /> still denied such freedom.  We have a grave and a compelling responsibility to do all we can to bring these people to full freedom in their own land but no, we wish to steer clear of the trouble.  We wish to forget what is taking place.  This stems from the human frailty known as selfishness.  We are selfish to the point of not wishing to share our freedom with those to whom that freedom belongs also, lest we might have less for ourselves.  Is not this what is wrong with this Parliament and with the leadership it is giving? That leadership is blind to the point that nothing is seen except what is desired to be seen, so that if anybody raises his head to point out what is not being seen, that head is knocked.  We have the sorry situation where the Leaders of the three main parties are at one in this blind ostrich approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>We had a speech, too, from the Tánaiste and we find that he would rewrite history to suit his own story. We hear from him a commendation for the efforts of the Civil Rights Association and for what they were achieving up to the time, as he says, the first shots were fired by the IRA in 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been speaking of the Tánaiste and of how he told us that a new era had dawned in the North and that all the wrongs could have been righted by way of peaceful protest but for the fact that the IRA fired the first shots in 1970.  Did the Tánaiste have a black-out during the months before then?  Has he no recollection of the rape of the Falls, the Battle of the Bogside or of the indiscriminate shooting of the people in the Falls by the RUC and the B Specials backed up by the Orange mob?  Does he have any recollection of the shooting down, even in their <Col N="1895" /> own homes, of little children, one in particular named Rooney, who was one of the first victims of the sorry situation that has since developed into full-scale and bloody war?  Does he forget the shots that were fired by the B Specials killing Gallagher in Armagh and that this murder was committed, the perpetrator known but never brought to account?  Does he not remember that?  Or the killing by sheer brutality by kicking to death of Devanney in Derry?  These are only a few cases, but where was the Tánaiste then?  How can it be said that the beginning of all this would seem to have been the shattering by the IRA of the great peace move made in 1970?</P>
      <P>Does he not recall the days of the first efforts in 1969 and does he not know what took place in Belfast and in Derry?  Or does he not want to know?  Does he want conveniently to forget these things ever happened? Surely this is something that cannot, despite Deputy Burke's protestation, be allowed to go on the records of this House without being challenged as to fact?  The Tánaiste tells all of this in his most solemn, compelling and fluent way but despite the compulsion of his telling and his fluency it is not true and he should know that.</P>
      <P>Then we had Deputy FitzGerald.  I suppose it can be said for him that he is being consistent.  His advice to us&mdash; if I quote him incorrectly I took it down as I heard him say it&mdash;was that we must abandon our claim to the Six Counties and that unity by consent is the only way.  Does this really represent the views of the Party on whose front bench he has the honour to sit?  Are we, on the advice of the Fine Gael Party as a whole, to agree to abandon our claim to the Six Counties?  Is this what we are being advised to do without question? Is this what must be put out to our people as representative of the views of the second largest Party in the House?  I hope it is not, but that is how I heard it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all want unity by consent but does the alternative mean that we are <Col N="1896" /> to condemn the minority, who had no say in the matter 50 years ago, to a continued existence under repression and discrimination in their own land? Is that what we mean by unity by consent?  Are we to take up, as has been said on other occasions, the catch-cry invented by Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien of bombing one million protestants into the Republic&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of fact, it was Cardinal Conway, not I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was Cardinal Conway and not the Deputy, that probably improves it slightly but it does not make it any more palatable to me.  Does not bombing the one million into the Republic mean that we should blind ourselves to the plight of the half-million who have been kept in subjection against their wishes and against the wishes of the majority of the 4.5 million population of the entire island?  Is that what we mean and does Deputy Dr. O'Brien agree with it? Does he agree with me that this catchcry is not valid, not a good line to go on, not one we should stand for in this House and that he disagrees with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>You do?  Then the catch-cry is one which the Deputy would use and fully agrees with: we will suppress and discriminate against, hammer out of existence and exterminate, and condone the extermination of a half-million inside the Border and a half-million outside and along the Border because there are one-million inside who, because they are sustained and maintained financially and militarily by an outside power, are not willing to come in lest they lose some of their ill-gotten gains.  Is this the basis on which we are to approach the matter in future?  As I now understand it, that is the line that would be commended to us by Deputy Dr. O'Brien, a Deputy of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Later, we had Deputy Desmond who, when he began, said <Col N="1897" /> many things I should like said.  One of them was that we in this House are alarmingly unaware of the whole situation in the Six Counties.  I could not agree more with him.  But he does not continue in that strain: he will be right on both sides.  He criticises all who talk either inside or outside the House as being alarmingly unaware of the true situation in the Six Counties and gives us to understand that he, and only he, is aware of the situation there.  He then proceeds to demolish that claim by the silly, stupid, vicious, uninformed statements with which he followed it.</P>
      <P>He talks about the Provisional IRA as if they were such that if driven to hell by us here peace would be restored all over the land: drive them to hell and everything would be right. They have no rights; they are not entitled to talk to anybody; they are self appointed representatives.  Mr. Whitelaw, with all the slipperiness that we have become accustomed to in our dealings with the British over the years, despite that he has no love for the Provisionals, found he had to talk to them, that it was the only sensible thing to do despite being on record to the effect that he never would do so. Does Deputy Desmond want to go one better than Mr. Whitelaw?  Does he want Mr. Whitelaw to retract now and never again talk to anybody even if by talking he could come near some solution which would de-escalate the tragic situation that is now the lot of the Six Counties?  We hear a good deal from the likes of Deputy Desmond about atrocities, about brutalities, about what goes on in the Six Counties and how all this can be laid at the door of one organisation, the Provisional IRA or, perhaps, also the Official IRA, but there must be a scapegoat in the IRA, one way or another, whatever you call it.  Do we realise here that the IRA, Official or Provisional, are the power in the Six Counties by the wish of the people of the minority group in the Six Counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August, 1969, the notable thing about the then IRA as one group was their apparent lack of reality, but are we forgetting the fact that the people <Col N="1898" /> were in the streets shouting for them to come and protect them and that out of that situation was born the Provisional IRA?  For the protection and defence of the people of the Six Counties they were brought into existence, and we also wished them into existence.  Most of our people and most of our Deputies had in their minds and their hearts, if they did not express it, the wish that there should be some form of protection and defence for the minority in the Six Counties in those sad days of August and September, 1969.  There was nobody standing up in this House screaming about them then.  Far from it, the screams were much in the other direction: Where were they?  Who was going to do something?  Of course, we had stood together in giving encouragement to the rising that was then taking place by the speech &ldquo;not standing idly by&rdquo;, and we all applauded it, and I think we were right.</P>

      <P>To get on to Deputy Desmond and others of a like nature, I believe that what is really wrong today with many of our politicians here and in the Six Counties is that they are not merely concerned that the Provisional IRA should be the people to whom the British authorities should talk.  That is not really their problem.  They are jealous because they feel there may now be translated from the military scene to the political scene people who might displace them from their somewhat insecure seats down here.  Is this not really what is bothering some of these small-minded people?  Although they rant and rave about peace and having discussions, ceasefires and the rest of it, when the very people who are called on to ceasefire do so and are then talked with by the British authorities, they are attacked in this House by minute little men who really have no place in an assembly such as this if we were a normal people at all.</P>

      <P>I was talking about Deputy Desmond ignoring the true situation while deploring the attitude of others for their apparent ignoring of the same situation.  What I should like to ask Deputy Desmond is: does he condone the situation that developed during the two weeks that followed the ceasefire?  Does he condone the actions of those who are not of the IRA or the minority but who had the bodies of people strewn all over Belfast during the ceasefire?  Will he who condemns violence and attributes it all to the IRA and the minority please wake up and ask himself about a couple of cases?  What happened to John O'Hanlon, the father of a family of six, unattached to any organisation, who left his home to get chips for his wife and family and never returned and whose body was found on waste ground in the Crumlin Road during that ceasefire?  He was not just killed or shot but his body was split from head to foot, mutilated beyond recognition. Does he know about the little lad of 14 or 15 years of age, David McClenahan, somewhat retarded, into whose house in Southport Street four armed men, two masked and two without masks, came, having shot the lock off the door?  This child hops out of bed, comes down the stairs in a panic, turns when he sees the masked men and is riddled with bullets in the back; his widowed mother who tries to protect the dying body of her son is beaten senseless by these four brave men and then shot in both arms and both legs.  Does he know anything about this?  Where are we and what are we talking about and where are our news media?  Why did they not publish these things?  You have to buy a Belfast paper to find out these details today.  That happened during the ceasefire.  Then we had the resumption of hostilities and the blame immediately being thrown over by the same people on the minority and the IRA.</P>

      <P>Do the people of this House not realise that the British Army on that Sunday evening, that fateful Sunday evening as it may well become, were partisan in the extreme in their attitude towards the people who, for three days, were denied access to the houses that were duly given to them by the Housing Trust in Belfast and that when they insisted on getting into them, claiming the rights they were granted by the Housing Trust, what happens?  They get &ldquo;brutalised&rdquo; as they have been in the past and of course we blame those who come in to assert their rights.  Surely this is the very antithesis of what one would regard as fair comment and fair play in a matter such as this and far removed from what we should be thinking in this House and saying on behalf of the people in the Six Counties, the minority who have not got any forum through which they may now talk.  Surely we should not forget the torture that preceded the internment in Long Kesh, on the <i>Maidstone</i> and Magilligan and wash our hands of it by shoving it across to the Court of Human Rights.  This is not the answer.  This is cowardice in the extreme.  No doubt, before we could discuss it at any length, even if there was time, we would be told it is <i>sub judice</i>.  This is the manner of things here that sadly requires some clarity.

      <P>I want to speak first about some of the activities of the Government and the Taoiseach on the Vote for Local Government. The Fianna Fáil Party over the last ten years, faced as they were by criticism from all sides, kept in their hands the right to decide appeals on planning permission.  It is fundamentally improper that any politician should have the right to decide the appeal of a citizen on whether he should get planning permission.  There is considerable political kudos to be gained by giving away that right to a committee, to a judge, to any judicial body, to a commission, so that no party, no politician, no Minister, could be charged with doing something that stank of preference and that was of perhaps even financial value to his party.  In face of all this criticism the Fianna Fáil Party decided to keep that right of decision on planning appeals.  Then when the cost of living had mounted over the last three years by an average of 9 per cent per annum we had the Prices Bill which is soon to become law, an amending Bill to the Prices Act, 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that Bill, as circulated, section 3 produced a house as a commodity and for the first time the price of a house could be controlled.  The price being charged to young married couples by builders could be examined and controlled. There was a Labour amendment that the cost of the site should be included and that there should be control on all land scheduled for building by local authority.  There was a more simple Fine Gael amendment in my name that the cost of the site of any individual house should be included as a commodity.  When we reached Committee Stage of that Bill those two amendments stood to be discussed.  The third amendment was from the Minister, to delete section 3. I insist that there is a corollary between the two facts, that this Fianna Fáil Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce decided that houses would be controlled as to price, <Col N="1903" /> that they included it in the Prices (Amendment) Bill, 1972, and having done so that those rich speculative builders, principally in and around this city who are the mainstay of Taca&mdash; and Taca still exists&mdash;that these people were powerful enough to sway the Government and to create a situation in which a house is still not a commodity to be subject to price control whereas almost anything else, including professional services, is to be included.</P>
    <P>I charge the Taoiseach more than any of his Ministers, I charge the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and all those in the Fianna Fáil Party who brought the messages or introduced the powerful men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw it unconditionally but I would be obliged if the Deputy from Kildare would tell me whether he agrees that any politician should not have the decision on a planning appeal.  I consider it quite incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thing that happened in this session was that the deletion of section 3 of that Bill proved quite conclusively that the Government were determined that those monied men behind them would still get service and that the sum of £100,000 we have heard about, which is in Government coffers and which I understand cannot be removed from wherever it is stored away until they get a signature from Deputy Blaney or perhaps it was until Deputy Blaney was expelled, would be supplemented by another £100,000 from these gentlemen <Col N="1904" /> to try to ensure&mdash;it will not occur &mdash;that Fianna Fáil will be returned at the next general election.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael must accept contributions from citizens just as any other political party must.  We would prefer 100 contributions of 25p or 50p to one contribution of £5,000 from some of the gentlemen to whom I have referred.  Are these people really serious anyway about housing the unfortunate young people who seek somewhere to lay their heads when they get married?  It is old hat now but the credit squeeze of 1957 was solved by reducing the number of houses built to about 4,500 a year. We now have reached what the Government have decided is their target of about 15,000 a year.  In Inter-Party days, though they only had three years to get the accelerator on, we went from 8,000 to 14,000 houses in 1957.  In 1958/59, 1960/61 and 1962, the Government reduced that figure to 4,500 houses.  It is obvious that the fact that 40,000 houses were not built during that period is one of the principal reasons why people are living in deplorable conditions.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the situation that a Minister for State still decides planning appeals, I want the House to consider the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce two days ago deleted from a Bill a section that would have controlled the price of houses.  That is a coincidence that stinks to high heaven.  It is a principal reason why this Government should not be returned to office.</P>
    <P>One of the principal things that happened in the sphere of industry and commerce over the last number of years was the advent of the miner to this country.  Fianna Fáil have no policy on mining.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce fixes royalties, issues prospecting licences, and mining licences on the basis of the royalties.  We do not accept these arrangements as being right and proper. In the first instance, the State must acquire private mining rights and pay proper compensation.  There are huge incomes being derived by individuals, many of them not in this <Col N="1905" /> country, by virtue of the fact that they have certain private mining rights.  They should be compensated, in a private enterprise economy, properly and fairly.  They should not be at any material loss.  The mining wealth of the country should be the property of the State to be used for the benefit of the people.</P>
    <P>The 20-year tax holiday now granted to miners who come here is, even in the view of some of them, over-generous.  It is Fine Gael policy to institute a system whereby a 20-year tax concession will not be given but whereby we will allow the withdrawal of profits without tax up to the total of the capital invested.  This will suit the miners sufficiently and they will be quite happy with that arrangement.</P>
    <P>The third feature of Fine Gael's mining policy is that the State should be in a position to engage in mining as partners, to take shares and thereby have a voice in the development of mining.  One matter that the Government have not bothered about is the fact that off the shore of Ireland, within our sovereign boundaries, on which we have full rights, no private rights being against us, there is oil and gas at a depth of up to 200 meters.  One find has been recorded.  Over the next 10 or 15 years there will be the greatest development in the world in this sphere, on our continental shelf. Those of us who try to maintain contact with these developments know this.  The Government have done nothing about it.  In this Adjournment debate, I want to record on behalf of Fine Gael that we have a policy in this regard and that we will ensure that such developments are encouraged and that the people will get their fair share of the benefits.</P>
    <P>I want now to go to agriculture and to say that one of the things one must do annually&mdash;it may be a dull job&mdash;is to make a detailed study of the Book of Estimates.  In the current year, 1972-73, the funds devoted to the improvement of livestock have been reduced by £10,000; the amount to be expended on bovine tuberculosis eradication has been reduced by £401,000; the amount spent on brucellosis eradication <Col N="1906" /> has been reduced by £200,000, this, in a year when, because of a fortuitous increase in the world price of skim milk products, there has been £19,540,000 available which should have been used, as we go into the Common Market, for the development of our greatest asset.</P>
    <P>The vote for the land project has been decreased by £537,000.  For farm buildings and water supplies there is a reduction of £575,000.  One of the ways in which we can keep the balance of payments right is by keeping up our output from agriculture.  We do not want to go into the Common Market as poor relations.  We want to go in as worthwhile economic trading partners.</P>
    <P>I must record also the disgraceful treatment which farmers involved in the eradication of brucellosis have had to put up with.  The maximum compensation, up to one month ago, was £140 per cow or heifer.  At the same time the replacement of that animal in the marts was costing £170 to £250. Farmers had to face this increase.  I know of a County Louth farmer who lost 61 female animals.  His compensation was paid at the old rate, but he had to replace the animals at a cost of £220 to £250 each.  He has not got the necessary money.  He can borrow £140 at a low rate of interest but in respect of the remainder of the money he must pay the full rate of 8½ per cent, and he must repay his principal. He received £140 in compensation, but he has had to pay £240 for a new animal. If he was not involved in the brucellosis eradication scheme, there would be no question of his paying £100 per animal over the next few years.  He could have used his money for the advancement of his family and the maintenance of himself and his wife.</P>
    <P>We turn now to the question of arterial drainage.  There has been a reduction of £95,000 in the figure for arterial drainage this year.  The late Deputy Donough O'Malley &ldquo;drained the Shannon&rdquo; the night before a by-election, but is there any understanding on the part of the Government that such major capital work is really necessary?</P>

      <P>It would be a miracle, indeed.  The Broadmeadows was drained some years ago.  It is a shame to fool the people of Ireland, and then smile about it.  Deputy P.J. Burke is probably one of my good friends in the House, but he has no right to smile and to say that the late Deputy O'Malley drained the Shannon before a by-election when there has never been a spade put in it since.  In the year 1972-73 if money were spent on arterial drainage on lands which are normally flooded, these lands could produce goods for export to Europe. The Government should spend money on arterial drainage.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to our fishing fleet is not satisfactory.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara are supposed to have a crash policy in order to improve the position before we enter Europe.  Skerries Pier has been extended.  Port Oriel, Clogherhead, has not had the benefit of a similar scheme under which the Office of Public Works would come in and develop the fishing harbour. Skerries is only 17 miles away from Clogherhead and a 100 per cent grant has been given for the improvement of the fishing harbour there.</P>

      <P>You had to pay 50 per cent of the loan charges.  I know all about local government finance. They are paying 50 per cent of the loan charges and not the capital sum.  We should be spending money on our fishing fleet in order to overcome difficulties in this regard before we enter Europe.  The figure has been increased from £350,000 to £355,000.  The actual increase is not much more than £5,000. Our seaside resorts need development in order to cater for the tourist trade. What happened about them in the 1972 Budget?  We reduced the grants <Col N="1908" /> for resort development from £500,000 to £250,000&mdash;a decrease of 100 per cent if looked at in a particular way.  There is a decrease of £250,000 on £500,000.  Is this the sort of Government the country needs?  Is proper preparation being made to meet competition from Europe?  I say that it is not.</P>
      <P>This country faces a difficult position today.  Because of the arms trial two or three years ago, because the Government were in trouble and because they are still only in the process of cleaning their skillet nothing was done at all about day-to-day Government and the adjustment of the economy.  I refer particularly to prices. Any modern economy must have constant adjustment.  Some times the adjustment is pleasant and helps to accelerate the release of money to create employment.  At other times the pressure on the money available means that there must be a cutback.  These changes are a feature of any modern economy.  This Government was topsy-turvy. We have seen a clear example of this today in the contribution of Deputy Blaney.  I am sorry for him.</P>
      <P>In each of the last three years there has been an increase of 9 per cent in the cost of living.  It may have been lower in one year than in another, but over the three years it averaged 9 per cent.  The National Prices Commission were established and they are doing a good job.  This morning the employers and the trade unions are trying to finalise a wages agreement which may carry us on.  Negotiations collapsed a while ago and they are trying to arrange a haphazard substitute.  This would not have happened if the Government were doing their job over the last three years and formulating a prices and income policy.  There is no point in saying to a man that his income will be controlled, if one is not prepared to control prices at the same time.  The man will go on strike, and he would be perfectly right.  This Government were so involved in internal squabbles that, in fact, they were not looking after the country properly.  I cannot over-emphasise their dereliction of duty, or what this 9 per cent means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that most of our people <Col N="1909" /> must be employed in industry if they are not to emigrate.  I agree with Dr. Mansholt when he said that people must be prepared to drive in a car for three-quarters of an hour from their home farms to industrial employment, and that then they would continue to reside in the country.  There is a great opportunity for factories to come and avail of our grants and of our excellent work force, if we join the Common Market.  There is the advantage that 250 million people will have to be fed and clothed.  They will buy all the foods needed inside the Common Market, and we will be in it.  The American, Japanese and other factories will desire to come here.  We must look after the position carefully.  Dereliction of duty could hold us back and this 9 per cent increase in the cost of living for three years with its consequent disagreements between the employers and the unions could prove disadvantageous. No man is prepared to accept a lower standard of living until he has negotiated and fought for his rights to the full.</P>
    <P>That is the only really inhibiting factor&mdash;that, with the trouble in the North&mdash;but I believe that in Waterford, Cork and Kerry and the South of Ireland generally the trouble in the North would not be an inhibiting factor at all and we could direct this industry there, but for the difficulties to which I have referred and which can be laid at the feet of the Government. I have, I think, about 15 minutes left.</P>

      <P>It is very fashionable to talk about the North of Ireland.  To those of us who live beside it, and that includes Deputy Blaney, it is all too often clear that some of those who talk about it are of necessity generalising.  They may address themselves more to it than do those who live beside it but, when one lives in close proximity to something, one automatically absorbs a fair bit of knowledge.  From the time the &ldquo;Letterkenny Parliament&rdquo; started the Government were on the wrong foot and I do not at all accept that the Taoiseach acted properly over that <Col N="1910" /> period of two-and-a-half years.  We heard again this morning about the &ldquo;not standing idly by&rdquo; speech.  We know about the hospital centres set up along our side of the Border in 1969.  We know that the Army went up to various points there.  We know we moved 500 rifles from Naas to Dundalk. These are all incidents which occurred under the leadership of the present Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch. What I find so wrong with him is the fact that, as the Northern situation develops, he is prepared to change his play, move his pieces around the chessboard and appear at all times popular, honest and proper.  That is a good way to try to get back into Government but it is not a good way in which to face up to the Northern problems.</P>
      <P>We have now got back to the special courts and people are going to jail for periods up to two years.  There may have been some longer periods, but I do not recollect seeing them.  In 1957, criticism was made of this party because people were being put in jail for similar activities.  That criticism resounded from the rafters here.  Now this is where I disagree with the Taoiseach's attitude because I see in various moves, not a desire to help, and I include the Taoiseach in this, not a desire to go straight and keep clean and, perhaps, be unpopular, but rather the desire on the part of Fianna Fáil to keep themselves in government.  I remember in 1957 when two young boys, Mr. South and Mr. O'Hanlon, mistakenly went up North and got shot at Roslea Barracks, there was a funeral in Limerick and two ex-Ministers of State and 11 other Fianna Fáil Deputies were at that funeral, that at a time when the Government of the country, duly elected, were doing their best to calm things down. On that, on the Suez Crisis and on the Korean War, Fianna Fáil got themselves back into office.  But those who sow the storm reap the whirlwind. Deputy O'Donovan will remember that particular incident.</P>

      <P>When we find a situation such as the &ldquo;Letterkenny Parliament&rdquo;, the not standing idly by speech and all the different moves as we go along, I am not satisfied with the attitude of this Government towards the North of Ireland.  While Deputy Cosgrave's attitude and Deputy Corish's attitude may not endear them to one section or another of the electorate during the next three years, it is at least straight.  One of the things citizens might, indeed, think about when considering the North of Ireland is the fact that they should not think about the speeches made by the popular politicians without analysing in depth what they say.</P>
      <P>I can talk about the North of Ireland with ease because my family had nothing whatsoever to do with the struggle for freedom.  They were supporters of the Irish Parliamentary Party and there are, therefore, no medals in our house.  In the North there is a population of 1,000,000 people on one side and 500,000 people on the other.  I want now to find out precisely what we are fighting.  We are fighting jobbery and discrimination in housing.  If these were removed that would be the end of the present situation. I should like here to impress on the House the fact that I have more friends among the Protestant population on the far side of the Border than I have among the Catholic population. They are great friends of mine and one friend would be under severe criticism here on this side of the Border from a great many people and, on the other side of the Border, from the minority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the time of the Heath initiatives it was the majority on the local councils who decided who got the houses.  That is one of the main reasons why in the North they are shooting one another today.  The minority in Dungannon comprise 52.1 per cent of the population; the majority comprises 44.5 per cent.  There may be one or two percentages of others.  On the percentage of all houses allocated for the last 30 years the figures are 44.5 per <Col N="1912" /> cent to the minority and to the majority 55.5 per cent.  In the case of &ldquo;old families&rdquo; and &ldquo;new families&rdquo; the minority got 35.4 per cent and the majority 64.6 per cent.  These are the figures as a result of decisions made by the Dungannon Urban Council. Now that is what we are fighting, not the shouting of Deputy Neil Blaney or the shouting&mdash;it has decreased a bit now&mdash;of the Reverend Ian Paisley.</P>
    <P>Where only houses are concerned, the people are living in ghettoes, with no playing fields and no amenities of any kind.  The Unionists in Dungannon got 14 seats and the minority got seven.  In Derry, in 1964, 145 Unionists earned annual salaries worth £124,424; 32 Nationalists earned salaries with the local authority amounting to £28,420; in Derry city there are 30,000 Nationalists and 28,000 Unionists.  How can we have peace unless and until the Heath initiatives are brought to fruition.  The Belgian League for the Defence of Human Rights reported that in a particular category of employment in Derry there were 78 Catholics earning £56,000 and 165 Unionists earning £158,000; 33 per cent of the Nationalists staff earned 26 per cent of the salaries and 67 per cent of the Unionists staff earned 74 per cent of the salaries.</P>
    <P>That is what we are fighting.  This is what civil rights are all about.  Perhaps it would be better if members of this House spoke less on the North. I have endeavoured to say as little as possible on the issue but the best thing to do at this point is to remain silent. All that can be done is to take a line and not deviate from it although on one occasion that light might be very popular while within six months it might be very unpopular but the Taoiseach is not taking a definite line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>No more than Deputy Donegan, I shall not speak at lenght on what has been the main subject of this debate, the North of Ireland, but I intend following the line which Deputy Keating adopted yesterday. However, perhaps I should say a few words on the Northern issue. For many years I have been a television addict and I do not agree with <Col N="1913" /> the attacks that have been made here on Telefís Éireann for exposing on the screen members of illicit armies in this country.  I have watched the BBC coverage of Northern Ireland affairs and for two years they portrayed these men on television before they were ever portrayed on our screens down here.  Neither do I agree with the criticism levelled at the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for having invoked section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.  If the Minister considered that action to be right, I would not criticise him for it.  I do not consider Telefís Éireann to have been remiss in any way.  The BBC have exposed continuously to the public members of the Official and Provisional IRA.  Provided this is done seriously, it is desirable.</P>
      <P>Mr. Whitelaw, whom I do not think deserves the epitaphs thrown at him this morning by Deputy Blaney, is doing as good a job of work as could be expected in such an awkward and difficult situation and I will not criticise any man whom I observe on the television screen in the quietness of my own home to be doing the best he can to bring about agreement between the various groups in Northern Ireland.  I do not go along with those who talk of eventual unity.  If unity is to be achieved I am sure that it will not be in my time.  The only suggestion I can offer in that regard is not new, and that is that there should be a united states of Ireland and that, if necessary, there should be two different standards for the time being, unless, of course, the British Government are prepared to provide the necessary finance to equate the standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been common in the US. They had the old south and the poor whites.  They also had their colour problem.  The plight of the poor whites in Tennessee was well known and eventually the problem was solved by the setting up of the Tennessee Valley Authority.  That was one of the few serious efforts made by the US Governments of up to 40 years ago when the society there was inclined very much to be purely capitalist.  That is all I wish to say on the North.  I am <Col N="1914" /> sorry for offering such a poor contribution but I shall not pretend to be able to make a serious contribution when I have nothing to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy.  I wish to turn now to our own problems which I shall approach in a somewhat different way from the line taken by Deputy Keating.  Deputy Keating carried out researches recently into the inflationary situation.  I agree with him that it was appalling to hear the Taoiseach yesterday pretend that the rate of inflation had decreased substantially.  Fundamentally, what is this problem?  It is not often that I bore the House with figures but I shall put this problem in figures.  I do not pay undue attention to what is issued by the Central Statistics Office or by the Central Bank or anywhere else regarding inflation.  Rather, I endeavour to understand the problem which I shall try to explain as simply as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In trying to explain what is the result of our present rate of inflation, let us take a base year, say, 1970, and give it a rate of 100.  A 10 per cent inflationary rate in that year means that prices are at 110 in 1971 and at 121 in 1972.  In 1973 they will be 133 because this is not a question of simple interest but of compound interest. A 10 per cent increase in one year means an 11 per cent increase in the following year.  I cannot understand why the political economists employed by the Taoiseach&mdash;I emphasise the word &ldquo;political&rdquo;&mdash;who are competent to do their work should continue to write this political stuff. The Minister for Finance has thrown his hat at the problem of inflation. Last year he ended his budget statement by saying that the main purpose of the budget for 1971 was to retard the rate of inflation which had depressed the economy in recent years. He said he did not think that the general public, the man in the street or even the business man appreciated fully the horror of unchecked inflation. I do not know why any business <Col N="1915" /> man should have any appreciation of the horror of unchecked inflation considering they are gaining all the time. They buy at one price and by the time they are selling the articles concerned the price has escalated so that they are much better off in relation to their bank.</P>
    <P>Some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies have told us that the Government have cut back on expenditure.  Even if they did that, the results were so appalling in terms of unemployment in the early winter, that they changed their tune.  I am not to be taken as criticising this because at least it showed that they had a humane approach to the problem but they have not succeeded in solving it because we are still experiencing massive increases in prices and high unemployment.  I was interested to hear how much talk there has been of the 40,000 who are unemployed in the North while there has been so little emphasis placed on the 80,000 who are unemployed down here.</P>
    <P>In respect of this year's budget there is a table at column 581 of Volume 260 of the Dáil Debates explaining that budget and this tells us that the current budget is to be financed by borrowing £28 million as at the beginning of the year.  If present trends continue that figure will be much higher.  My criticism of the Government in this regard is that inflation in my opinion is about 10 per cent every year but Government expenditure has been going up at the rate of about 20 per cent a year.  With the Budget now at £900 million&mdash;almost half that egregious concept, GNP&mdash;you have Government action as a main cause of this appalling situation.  As a result you have a situation of increasing prices and at the same time rising unemployment. When Government policy creates that sort of situation this is the end of the road.</P>
    <P>The significance of one part of this is that when we consider the manner in which our GNP is calculated, the man who had £4,000 a year five years ago in the Civil Service and now has £5,000 a year&mdash;I am speaking in gross terms&mdash;it is less than sufficient by a large margin to compensate him for <Col N="1916" /> the increase in prices not to mention the situation when he has paid income tax.  If we take that we must remember that they are taking in at unity into these calculations.  Therefore, we are supposed to believe, and we have the Central Statistics Office approaching the subject as if every £1 of the £5,000 was as valuable as every £1 of the £4,000 with the result that the man who is now doing the same work as he did five years ago is now down in the figures which we are told reveal to the world how our economy is doing, at £5,000 where five years ago he was down at £4,000.  This is a complete distortion. If the Government were making any attempt to control Government expenditure it might not matter so much but year by year we have this extraordinary increase of 20 per cent in Government expenditure.  We are having it this year also although the Taoiseach tells us that the increase in prices this year is only 6 per cent, that the rate at which prices are increasing has been reduced.  We shall wait and see.  Deputy Keating was certainly right in saying that, in fact, we shall be lucky if in this financial year from 1st April, 1972 to 31st March, 1973, prices do not go up more than 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>One result of all this is that you have all the talk blaming the ordinary worker and suggesting that the wage increases are responsible for inflation. A study done by a conservative group in England two years ago showed that there was no increase whatever in the part of the national income of Britain that the workers were getting at that time compared with what they were getting in the middle thirties.  We all know how the miners were treated in Britain then when there were one million of them.  They were so savagely treated that the industry had to be nationalised and no matter what Government was in office the industry would have been nationalised.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy Keating in regard to the EEC.  He dealt adequately with it but I want to say that there is no genuine regional policy in the EEC.  Occasionally, lip service is paid to it in the pretence that if there has not been such a <Col N="1917" /> policy, there will be.  It is always in the future.  When the Labour Party went to Brussels to meet the EEC, the Commissioner for Regional Policy, a gentleman from western France, was quite honest and openly admitted then &mdash;about 18 months ago&mdash;that there was then no regional policy.  I have seen no trace since of any regional policy in operation.  It is rather like the way this Government pay lip service to the idea of wanting to keep down prices.</P>
    <P>I want to mention a few other matters before finishing.  I hope I shall be able to release 10 minutes of my time for the benefit of other Deputies.  I realise that, despite the fact that two days were given to this debate, so much time was taken out of it for Questions yesterday that it was not adequate.  Deputies who want to speak should get a chance to speak as far as possible.</P>
    <P>There were three questions on the Order Paper yesterday about the prices at which local authority houses are being sold to city tenants.  No man must give so much consideration to so many problems as the present Minister for Local Government but, in spite of that, he did not tell us in any case what the price of any house was.  I want to make a general complaint. I think it is completely wrong for a Government now to look for £3,000 each for houses which were built in the thirties for £600 each. This is getting the poor to pay for the poor, an old trick frequently commented on by socialists in other countries. This is being done to finance the housebuilding of local authorities.  It is not reasonable although, as usual, the Government have reacted and are now giving a credit of 3 per cent for each year of tenancy subject to a maximum of 30 per cent.  That is worth something to recent tenants but to old-established tenants it is not worth anything.  At 3 per cent you have only to occupy for ten years to get the maximum credit of 30 per cent.  If you get that on a £3,000 house it still leaves the price of the house at three times what it cost to build.  This is not a reasonable approach to the problem especially in the case of tenants in, <Col N="1918" /> say, the Crumlin area who have been living there for 40 years.</P>
    <P>Another matter causing great concern to everybody, and to which Deputy Donegan rightly referred, is the impossibility for young people, including young professional people, of saving the necessary money required for a deposit on a house with the astronomically high prices of houses being built at present.  I know, of my own knowledge, of a professional man and his wife whose joint income is £5,000 a year but 30 per cent of it goes in income tax with the result&mdash;they have a few young children and the usual family expenses&mdash;that they have the greatest difficulty and it will take them some years to save up the necessary money for a deposit on a house.</P>
    <P>In this House I have always spoken in favour of freeing such savings from income tax, and there does not seem to be any reason why this should not be done.  This money could be set aside for house purchase and would provide an incentive to saving.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with a matter that I am concerned about most of all, that is, the opinion of this House held by the general public.  Since the institutions of State were set up 50 years ago I do not think that at any time has there been such a low opinion of the Oireachtas as there is today.  I may be wrong in this, but I try to keep my ear to the ground as well as most politicians and this is the opinion I get.  I do not think that when a Government is 15 years in office, even if some of them, like the Parliamentary Secretary, have come in relatively recently, it gets the message. I believe in my heart that democracy is under grave pressure in this country today and the main reason for that is that there is a Government in office for 15 years.  I will admit this for the Fianna Fáil Party, that they certainly carry out the good old American instruction: talk softly but carry a big stick.  The Fianna Fáil Party are very good at this.  They cannot conceal the inevitable arrogance&mdash;I am not accusing the members of the Government party of being any different from any other party that would be 15 years in office <Col N="1919" />&mdash;that arises from such a situation. As was said to me many years ago when Fianna Fáil were 16 years in office by an ordinary resident in Sandymount: &ldquo;If you do not get rid of the Government after 16 years democracy is dead.&rdquo;  If this Government is not put out of office at the next general election democracy will be dead in Ireland.  That will be my message in mid-Cork in the coming weeks and it will be my message, in so far as I can get in touch with people, in the next general election. It is all right for the young Parliamentary Secretary to smile; he has not been there for 15 years, but it is a fact.</P>
    <P>I mentioned yesterday that I was perturbed at the fact that years ago it was the custom during the budget debate for the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the secretary of the Department of Finance, two top civil servants as they then were, to attend the debate.  They were paid different salaries from anybody else, but now they are paid the same as in other Departments, and they attend for the day the Minister makes his speech.  After that they do not give tuppence for democracy.  They behave in the way commissars do in Russia, I presume.  This is the worst example of the way in which this Government have allowed this institution to be undermined.  We are constantly being told in this House, on the basis of items that are written for the Taoiseach in particular, that there was such-and-such a growth rate and only such-and-such a rise in prices.  I have said in this House, and I am convinced of the truth of it, that there was no growth whatever in this country in 1970.  The growth was entirely in the minds of the arithmeticians.</P>
    <P>There is one other small matter before I finish, and I hope I am delivering a little of my time to somebody else.  It has been brought to my attention that the Intercontinental Hotel has been sold.  The amount of employment in such an institution is extremely large, and I understand that the employees in that institution <Col N="1920" /> will lose their employment.  Since it is such a recently erected hotel the redundancy payments will be relatively small.  Suppose it is turned into offices.</P>

      <P>I am not too qualified to speak on the Intercontinental Hotel situation but possibly I can release some of my time to Deputy Coughlan so that he can fill us in on that.  I was taken by what Deputy Donegan said&mdash;and I think Deputy Donegan was following the same line to some extent&mdash;that it was a time when one could do a great service by keeping one's mouth shut about the matter on which most of us are inclined to address ourselves. namely, the Northern Ireland situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I should at the same time, qualify that by saying that I trust that whatever words I may use will not be by way of recrimination, will not be by way of establishing our position or our right or by <Col N="1921" /> way of attacking the position held by others, who do not share our view at this time.  I think the Irish people have an unfortunate capacity for over-indulging in words and we certainly have seen this capacity exhibited to a very significant extent in the last number of years.  We have had charge and counter-charge, and each of us has, with a limited view from our side of the tunnel, made accusations against our fellow-Irishmen and all too often assumed that the views that we express are the views that they should express. This is a presumption that should not operate in Ireland at any time but more particularly at this time.  It is rather appropriate that the Scottish poet Burns has probably said for us, particularly when one thinks in terms of our Northern Ireland situation what we never apparently can apply to ourselves, that is:</P>
      <P>Would that God the gift would g'e us To see ourselves as others see us.</P>
      <P>We see others as we think they should be.  We have had too many examples of public figures here and in the North particularly showing, apart from disagreement on systems and on structures, little or no respect and little or no hope that at any time they could work together under any system towards a common end.</P>
      <P>It is important to state at this time that there is no need to repeat the arguments which we have often made against Partition.  Those arguments have been well stated and are well founded.  There is no need to repeat, as Deputy Donegan did very briefly, the evidence of discrimination we have seen and which has been the cause of so much argument, charge and counter-charge for some considerable time.  The important thing to recognise and to state now is that it is the system under which we all live and particularly that which has been current in the North, and not the individuals which have caused this terrible condition of blood and disruption we have witnessed in the last few years and particularly in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have been made prisoners of their own prejudices.  We may all have been made prisoners of our own <Col N="1922" /> prejudices.  Those of us who are not caught up to the same extent should now acknowledge that we are ready to take into account the views of people who may not be ready to take our views into account.  If we have in fact such a low opinion of each other as is sometimes expressed&mdash;I am glad to say not so often expressed from this side of the country&mdash;how can we even want to live in harmony much less pretend that we can work together in unity.  If we really think of each other in the way we express our views of each other then, if we were to be consistent and honest, we would say that we want no part of an association in a society with people whose attitudes we so utterly reject.  All of us, North and South still talk in terms of peace and harmony.  The first thing I would say, therefore, to the many figures who have fairly constantly been engaged&mdash; I do not want to name names&mdash;in vindicating their own positions and accusing the positions of the others is that they should give up this pretence that virtue resides only with them and wickedness resides only with their political opponents.</P>
    <P>I have been struck on many occasions by the fact that many of the individuals who live within the system in Northern Ireland and many of those who might be accused by people from the other side of the so-called fence of prejudice and discrimination honestly were not conscious of any discrimination or prejudice on their part.  I am not saying this by way of excuse for some of the things that have been done but I am saying that it is about time that we recognised that people of essential goodwill are not even conscious sometimes of an element of private or personal discrimination in their daily lives.  What sometimes was looked on as discrimination by one group was regarded as nothing more or less by people who practiced that discrimination as what you might call administrative convenience.</P>
    <P>I have seen examples of this and have discussed this with people who acknowledge that what they could now regard possibly as prejudice on <Col N="1923" /> their part in hindsight they never did recognise at the particular time as being anything of that nature.  We are the people who talk in terms of integration. I accept that one does not just insist at all times on unity and say that this must be now or at a certain time the only solution.  At least we are the people who argue consistently for integration, more understanding and we argue particularly in terms of the common stream of Irishmen which we all want to share while some of the others in this country argue rather in terms of their Britishness.</P>
    <P>We must, if we are the people who make the case for our common Irishness, be prepared to acknowledge that we have a responsibility in our utterances particularly to be generous and tolerant.  We should always acknowledge that no words of ours by way of recrimination or charge, even though we may be tempted by some very unreasonable and bitter things that may be said, still fix our assurance that nothing we will say, particularly in a political manner as political representatives, will in any way give rise to further concern or allow the bitter weed of prejudice to grow and spread even more widely.</P>
    <P>We should think in terms of what we have in common.  The first and most obvious of these, which has been very evident in recent times, is the wish of individuals in the community to live in peace, to live normal lives.  In this part of the country we have come to accept that the headlines from the North we read everyday are a normal condition of that part of our country and that the people who suffer behind those headlines accept as normal this terrible condition. We do not even question what it must be like for people who would otherwise be working and enjoying themselves as we do, engaging in healthy activity of one sort or another and we come to assume that this is no part and should be no part of the scene in the North of Ireland at this time. The fact that people have not been allowed and cannot live at least in the more troubled spots particularly in a normal environment does not mean we <Col N="1924" /> should not realise how much they could achieve if they were allowed to live in a normal environment.</P>
    <P>We all want people to live in peace. We also have something else in common, anyone from any side or from any party either North or South do not recognise the right of any self-appointed demagogues to tell us the type of society in which they think we must live.  We do not recognise the right of people to say that it must be this type of republic or that type of republic, that only this type of republic or that type of republic will be accepted by them and that if anything else emerges by the will of the people that we will be guaranteed further turbulence and further revolution.  It has been made very clear by those who have no conceptions of democracy, by those who have no wish to allow democracy to prevail, that they have the same intention to change society in this part of the country as in the North of Ireland. They have taken unto themselves if they can the right to impose their prejudiced views on people who only want to live in peace.</P>
    <P>That is something else we have in common with anyone in the North of Ireland who simply wants to rid himself at this time of terrorism, guns and bombs.  That is something we must establish and remove any fears they may have.  These rights that these self-proclaimed leaders claim cannot be established by proclamations, no matter how constant or how strident.  They can only serve to create further division, hatred, fear and intolerance. I wonder how those who feed on fear and prejudice &mdash;and there has been, in recent speeches, from the North, particularly, too much of that&mdash;can ever think that the attitudes they express entitle them to pose as leaders of any community when everything seems to be based on charges of conspiracy against the other side, when their whole position seems to be based on the maintenance of fear and distrust in the community.  How can these people set themselves up as leaders in any community and how can we, if we are courageous and honest enough, even contemplate the possibility of people of <Col N="1925" /> that type being leaders.  Why should we, in any way, consult or consider the prejudiced attitudes that they have forced on the community in the North of Ireland and, indeed, which many people will endeavour to force on the community here as well.  If they released their victims from the tentacles of their prejudice all of us would be greatly surprised to see what these victims could achieve in the real development of their full human potential.</P>
    <P>The House may think that this is all a series of general platitudes and maybe justifiably so.  It has to be, to the extent that I do not wish to name names.  I said clearly at the beginning that we have had too much charge and counter-charge in any event. There have been so many examples of the type of feeding on prejudice I am referring to that it is hardly necessary to name names.  No man here or in the North has a right to set himself up as a leader on any side because he lives on, depends on and can survive only as long as those fears and prejudices exist in a community. A leader must be a man who understands the real spirit of the community and who works for that spirit, not necessarily in the full glory of publicity or television cameras, but in the full understanding of what the human capacity really is.</P>
    <P>Apart from what these victims, whose throats are throttled by the tentacles of the so-called leaders, apart from what they could achieve if they were released&mdash;there are clear signs of what many of them can achieve, the Women for Peace particularly&mdash;contemplate for a moment what these so-called leaders themselves could achieve in a normal situation. If they could break out of the straitjacket of their own positions they could, in a normal condition, contribute something meaningful and positive.</P>
    <P>It occurs to me that people who want to claim above all else the consistency of the constant view from the cradle to the grave sometimes are not courageous enough to look at their view at a particular time and <Col N="1926" /> say: &ldquo;I was wrong.  Yes, I said this publicly.  I proclaimed this so often. This was my notion of patriotism but I was wrong.  I am now prepared to re-assess it and even in the face of the charges which will inevitably be made against me of being a traitor, a coward, a lundy, I am now going to take a different view and see what I really can contribute.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to bring one hopeful thing to the attention of the House. I remember the fifties.  I was a student in Dublin at the time.  I remember the sense of enthusiasm and patriotism of so many fellow students of mine, the sense of urgency and commitment they had, in their view, to solve the condition of the North. I remember their blind compulsions to go and do something about it.  We know how wasted their efforts were, how sad they were and, indeed, how bloody the consequences sometimes for themselves and others.  That is not long ago.  I am glad to state that many of those lads have been able to turn towards a more positive contribution and you will find them in the strangest places now in this country, by comparison with their previous positions really making positive contributions to the condition of this society and, indeed, to the condition of society elsewhere.  They sometimes look back now more in sorrow than in anger on the experiences they had then.  There are still so many people who feel they have only one contribution to make and that is either in the narrow field of republicanism or loyal unionism.  There are so many people caught up in these narrow concepts who, if they released themselves from these narrow concepts could make effective contributions to the well-being of our society, North and South.</P>
    <P>It occurred to me when I was attending the Cosac Exhibtion last week that it was ironic that we were out there promoting recreation, sport and enjoyment when not too far away there were other people suffering fear, bloodshed and terror.  I almost had to say to myself that it was appropriate that we should continue with this promotion because one had some doubts of our <Col N="1927" /> right to talk in terms of enjoyment and recreation when others in the same country did not even remember what that was all about.  I did not have to worry too long.  There was no need to justify any such promotion.  I had the opportunity last week of seeing the manner in which young Derry lads can express themselves when allowed to play with other children.  I saw how happy and how normal these young boys and girls could be and the potential they had to grow up as fully integrated human beings.  This potential can only be developed if the human personality, at each stage along the way does the thing appropriate to its age at that time.  The young people of the North have been deprived of so much by the restriction of their normal inclination to play.  We have no way of knowing the effect this will have on the personality of the generation now growing up in the North.  We hear of the manner in which a post-war generation is disorientated and the confusion that inevitably spreads after a period of war.  That has been fairly well established. A war is not fought as constantly and as bitterly on the streets in which boys and girls live as has been the experience of so many little boys and girls in the North.  What can they be like in a few years time if their notion of play now is to engage in open confrontation with soldiers or whatever?</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter that the patriots would do well to consider: even if they do get to their table, if we all get to our table, to make proposals for the direction of society, for the structures we hope will protect everyone in various ways, they will still have not protected the individuals who will develop in that society.  They will not be able to compensate the young children who have been deprived and who will need to be given very special care and special consideration if they are to be allowed&mdash;no matter what peace may come and how soon it may come&mdash;to pick up the pieces and to develop as normal young people should.</P>
    <P>That is what I say to those who think they are fighting only military opponents, political opponents or any other type of opponents; that they are <Col N="1928" /> fighting against the normal development of young children and that they will be responsible, if they do not stop soon, for the terrible social conditions which may emerge in that part of the country and possibly throughout the country as a result of their terrible deeds.</P>
    <P>I want to say on this basis that one of the things that frighten me sometimes is the fact that those who can engage in such terror and barbarism as the IRA have been perpetrating for the last three years and more could blind themselves to the fact that this is inhuman, unchristian and in many ways&mdash;and this is the awful irony&mdash; totally contrary to the standards which they in their own households, in their own homes, for their own children, assume to be the appropriate standard of life.  Let it not be doubted that there are people who have proclaimed the right of the republican movement, as they call it, to determine the condition of Ireland and to fight against prejudice, people who have justified and exonerated those who have engaged in bloodshed, murder, against individuals and families and who&mdash;and this is what frightens me&mdash;can go back into their own homes and honestly set down really high standards of behaviour for their own children, honestly believing that this is a discharge by them of their parental responsibility. Surely, there is an essential blindness here that no political discussion can cure at any level.</P>
    <P>This is something that has to be said to the IRA and the UDA and to any other groups who take to themselves the right to defend.  They always seem to be defending&mdash;the IRA, the minority on the one side, the UDA, the majority on the other side.  Nobody is engaged in anything but defence.  That defence becomes bloodshed for those who are supposed to be defended.  This is the kind of situation, apparently, that allows people to justify the actions they take.</P>
    <P>I say to them, as individuals and human beings, what right have they to justify and create murder, from whatever side, and to come back to their own homes and proclaim themselves there and to their neighbours as people <Col N="1929" /> who are activated by the highest principles, as people concerned for the development of their own children and the children in their community?  They have no such right.  I believe many of them are men who sincerely and seriously, whatever side they may be on, are activated by good, as they see it.  If they want to be consistent let them transfer the goodness they try to proclaim to their own children to their activities on the other side and see how far short they fall of the standards they proclaim for themselves.  Then perhaps we could have the beginning of understanding.</P>
    <P>Some of these people must now be beginning to ask themselves how terrible is the contradiction in their positions, and terrible it is.  I am appealing to their humanity as well as condemning their deeds, to at least, even now, consider the things they are doing and the justifications they claim for doing them.</P>
    <P>Could I ask the UDA also and those who sometimes feed on the fears that seem to be expressed in the UDA: against whom are they arming?  Against whom are they organising?  To protect against what forces are these big mass demonstrations necessary, that appears to be the fundamental purpose of this particular organisation?  Are they organising against the IRA?  Because, if so, they hardly need the strength of numbers they are at present gathering all over the North of Ireland because most people, including the IRA and anyone who knows anything about them, will acknowledge that they are a fairly tightly knit organisation, whether one speaks of the Officials or the Provisionals, and it is not by force of numbers one would deal with them even on a military basis&mdash;and I have no wish that they should be dealt with on a military basis but would wish that they could be dealt with on the basis of reconciliation.  In any event, why is it necessary to mass such numbers to oppose or to defend against what is basically a tightly knit organisation?</P>
    <P>Or, is it the people who happen to be Roman Catholics, who happen to live in the areas which have <Col N="1930" /> been dominated by the IRA, who happen to live in areas that have suffered from the activities of the IRA?  Is it these people they are arming against because, if it is, surely these people have suffered enough. Is that the justification for the thousands we see parading from time to time, that they need, for some reason or another, to frighten a section of the community which has already been sufficiently frightened?  That is hardly a justification for the mass parades and proclamations we have heard.</P>
    <P>If it is the British Army, let them look at the contradiction of their position.  Or, is it possible it is us here in the South.  If it is, let them know and understand that no Irishman here&mdash;and this House never&mdash; would allow a situation to arise that we would ever face armed confrontation with fellow Irishmen, no matter from what section they came, with a view to imposing our will on them. This has been fully and clearly stated by all parties in the House.  Therefore, I just ask the UDA, and their leaders particularly, who would fit into the category I referred to earlier of people who feed on fear and prejudice, what is the justification for their demonstrations at this time? What is the justification for their proclamations? What is the need for their mass organisation?  If they could answer that and if the IRA could state the justification for their positions, maybe then we would have the beginning of some understanding, because the irony is that we hear stories of personal admiration and respect between combatants on both sides or on all sides; we hear stories that fit into the pattern of the Irish legend, of the soldier who almost blessed the gun that shot him and the revolutionary who understood the soldier who shot him.  We heard stories of this personal admiration. Maybe such does exist.  I do not know.  I have never experienced an understanding or communication through military confrontation, but maybe it does exist.  If these people are capable of that type of admiration even for their opponent in battle at this time, how much more should <Col N="1931" /> they be capable of some type of communication and understanding if they dropped the gun and took up the spade which would allow them to dig the foundations of at least a future of harmony and peace.</P>
    <P>The frightening thing of all of this is that basically good men who have come from an environment where good principles have been instilled into them have been driven into this blindness, on all sides, and this blindness is what is impelling them to continue in the same mad course.  I have avoided talking about political structures or about what we must do, or what this Parliament and the Committee of which I happen to be chairman are endeavouring to do, because I think that many of us have from time to time proposed solutions and have seen the solutions as being this or that procedure or structure. The solution is not one of structure or procedure; it is one of people. This is what we must establish to all concerned.  If the individual children and the communities of adults are allowed to live in normal conditions, the changes that have taken place in the North of Ireland will enable new conditions to develop.  If that happens, there surely exists the dynamism which will develop the confidence of our people in each other and their capacity to contribute and co-operate, and then they will not be determined to stay apart and be subject to fear.</P>
    <P>So much fear and doubt seems to come from a lack of confidence in our own capacity.  This applies to all our people, whether in the north or in the south.  Much argument seems to be based on an almost hopeless acceptance of the conditions that we have inherited and a hopeless attitude towards our ability to solve them.  I recall as a young man seeing in my own home town after the war people emigrating to England and America. I recall the sense of hopelessness which seemed to prevail in that town at that time and the feeling that the inevitable loss would continue to drain that community. That position has changed considerably.  There is no such sense of hopelessness there now.  I want to say to the people who are chronically unemployed, <Col N="1932" /> and particularly to the men unemployed in the North of Ireland, that there is no reason why this position should continue.  This island of ours is capable of supporting not just four million people but eight million people.  If we have any confidence in our capacity and in the resources of our land, we should recognise this fact. If the people put down the guns and pick up the instruments of peace and development, not only will we not need after a short time some of the guarantees which have been talked about but we could together build a society which would, in fact, integrate all the people, under whatever governmental structures or institutions, on one happy island.</P>
    <P>I would like that to be the attitude which most of our fellow-Irishmen in the North would acknowledge.  Our wish for them is peace and understanding. If we can develop them, possibly we can talk in terms of how we propose to build the structures by which we can all live in prosperity and harmony.</P>

      <P>A debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate is not usually an occasion on which Members of the Opposition express agreement with the sentiments of Members on the Government benches.  The unusual nature of this debate is identified by my expressing my agreement with what the Parliamentary Secretary has just said.  If this Parliament is to work efficiently on behalf of the people of Ireland we must, during the next session, set aside some days from time to time for debates on Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is running away from our responsibilities to fear having debates because of the foolish remarks which may be made by a small minority in this House who do not represent the overwhelming desire of our people.  What is the overwhelming desire of the people of the Republic of Ireland?  It is that throughout all Ireland, and in particular at this time in the North of Ireland, people should be free from violence of all kinds, political, social, economic and military, that they <Col N="1933" /> should be free from the shadow and fear of violence, and from any form of vicious suspicion or injurious pressure of any kind.</P>
      <P>On many occasions we have expressed here the fear that Northern Ireland, and perhaps some time all Ireland, was slipping into a civil war position.  It is a fair indication of the degree to which we have become tolerant of violence that many still seem to think that we are not yet in a civil war situation.  I cannot regard this country as not already being in a state of civil war.  It is unreal to accept that any part of this island can endure the political deaths of five, six or ten persons per day without being in a state of grievous civil war.  There is imposed on us an immediate and vital obligation to get the people of the North out of this civil war situation before it engulfs us all.</P>
      <P>The situation today is more uncertain and menacing than at any time since the foundation of our State.  It has been made more so because of the actions of the Provisional IRA in bringing the ceasefire to an end last Sunday.  The extent of depression and despondency throughout all communities in Ireland is now impossible to measure.  It is therefore important that we should not merely generalise in this debate, but that we should try to analyse the causes of the peace breakdown.  If I identify some of the causes, I do not presume to know them all, neither do I blame or exonerate.  There may be a lesson in identifying them because they reflect the principal causes of the terrible tragedies which are occurring in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have publicly acknowledged, and I do so again today, the wisdom and goodwill of Mr. Whitelaw and of those associated with him in the British Government in endeavouring to placate the angry people on all sides in the North of Ireland.  When I was in the North last week, it was clear that a great deal of the confidence which the minority felt in the new administration in the North was beginning to wane.  I do not say they were right in coming to that conclusion, but it is important we should identify <Col N="1934" /> the reasons for it.  Because they saw the British Army fraternising with the Ulster Defence Association, they felt that the conciliatory attitude of the British Army towards the armed majority meant nothing, in reality, had changed.  It proved the unscrupulous domination by the majority of the minority was still in existence, and that the form it used to take of governmental directions from Stormont offices had been replaced merely by the presence of intimidating gangs in the streets.  The minority complained that the British Army and the police force were providing insufficient protection for Catholic families which were being intimidated out of their homes.  As so often happens in Northern Ireland when people complain about the wrongs done against them, they seemed to be unaware that intimidation had also taken place against the people of the other faith.</P>
    <P>The minority saw also in Portadown what appeared to them to be a deliberate desire on the part of the British Army to assist an Orange procession through the Nationalist area. When the parade took place those who felt they had been deliberately insulted had injury added to insult when they saw their military opponents permitted to drill in the very streets in which the Nationalists lived. There was complaint also that internment was not being scaled down at a rate commensurate with the considerable contribution towards peace made by the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; declaration.  Of course, he was in a difficulty in the situation, in that the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; came about at the most difficult time in the year for making concessions and there were, therefore, considerable seasonable problems for Mr. Whitelaw to face.  A little patience would have worked wonders.  The unforgiveable action of the Provisional IRA last Sunday meant that it was the Provisional IRA and not Mr. Whitelaw who effectively turned the key against further releases, at least for some time.</P>
    <P>Finally, what contributed a great deal to the resentment of the minority community was the failure of the British Army to secure the safe possession <Col N="1935" /> of houses allocated to 16 Catholic families.  There were certainly difficulties but these were difficulties which could not be overcome and should not be overcome by the use of force.  They were obstacles which could only be overcome through negotiation and through what has been described as the &ldquo;low profile approach&rdquo;.  That being the case, the precipitate action of the Provisionals in bringing the cease fire to an end last Sunday is something which no person concerned with the establishment of justice in the North of Ireland can condone and it is something which must be condemned without qualification in this House.</P>
    <P>It has unwisely been said by many people that talks cannot take place in the North until violence is brought to an end.  But the violence which exists is a reflection of the feelings of the people about conditions in Northern Ireland.  The violence on the side of the minority is an expression of their resentment against rights being denied to them; the violence on the part of the majority is an expression of their fear that rights which they now enjoy may be taken from them.  That violence will continue so long as the fears exist and these fears cannot be overcome except through talks.  I would, therefore, urge most earnestly upon Mr. Whitelaw that, without further qualification, reservation or hesitation, he should release all the internees, all the people imprisoned without trial, because, by doing that, he will open the way immediately for the only kind of action which can bring peace, lasting peace, to Northern Ireland, namely, talk between the elected representatives of the people.  No matter what passing difficulties there may be in releasing the interness&mdash;I am not confident there will not be certain unpleasant consequences in certain sectors&mdash;I believe the overall good which would come out of the release of the last of the internees and the commencement of talks would be such as to provide that this is the proper course to take at this stage.  If this course is not soon taken there will be a further breakdown in distrust; there will be a worsening in communication.  The great tragedy in <Col N="1936" /> Northern Ireland at the moment is the fact that no one really knows what anyone else wants.</P>
    <P>People have the fears of their own heritage; they have the hatreds and the loyalties of their own environment.  But they do not know what the other side want and they cannot find out so long as they do not talk to one another, and violence begets violence and so long as threats are met with threats from the other side.  It is a very sad state of affairs that so many people should be killed and maimed for nothing other than living the kind of life into which they were born.  Protestants are being marked down for extermination and are being exterminated because, by accident of birth, they were born Protestant. Catholics are marked down for extermination and are being exterminated because, by an accident of birth, they were born Catholics and lived according to that tradition.  These are the kind of fundamental thoughts we should have in our minds, the kind of thoughts we should be bringing to the notice of more and more people.  I cannot see that anything good can come out of reciting a litany of atrocities committed by one side or the other, the kind of one-sided litany presented to us here this morning by Deputy Blaney.</P>

      <P>Every atrocity he so graphically illustrated could, I am sorry to say, be equalled in ferocity and viciousness by an atrocity committed by people on the other side. Those who take the trouble to talk to both communities in the North find again and again people saying that, had they been born on the other side, they would be doing exactly what the other side are now doing.  What we need to do now is to convince people that this is a blind and savage way of behaving and only brings greater and greater misery on everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that many well-intentioned people have suggested that Northern Ireland's trouble arises because of the preoccupation of people in times of election with the Border, with whether or not the Six Counties <Col N="1937" /> should remain within the United Kingdom or be attached to the Republic of Ireland.  The suggestion has been made that the way to solve this problem is to hold a plebiscite now and plebiscites hereafter at regular intervals. Although I have spoken recently about this, I feel compelled now to say a few more words about it.  I believe it would be an obscenity to have a plebiscite in Northern Ireland in the foreseeable future on the issue of the Border because, having it, would infer that the violence in Northern Ireland is caused by the Border.  That is just not so.  There are very, very few people in Northern Ireland on either side of the political divide who are preoccupied with the existence of the Border.  I have spoken to active members of the IRA who have said they are often taunted with wanting British standards in welfare payments and nothing else, and they have replied that they wanted British standards in everything and that means equality before the law, an end to discrimination and equal opportunity in housing and jobs.  To suggest that a plebiscite on the Border will in some way make a contribution towards a real understanding of how people in Northern Ireland think is suggesting something that is totally false.  I would, therefore, hope that wisdom will yet prevail to avoid any plebiscite which would be at once irrelevant, valueless, divisive, inflamatory and illogical. Perhaps it is that out of the shocking agony of the last week the possibility of a referendum has become impossible of attainment, but I would not regard that as a justification for the cessation of the cease fire.</P>
    <P>A plebiscite on the Border will contribute nothing constructive but, unfortunately, will contribute a great deal of what might be negative.  The reason why I say a plebiscite would be harmful is because its inevitable result of a massive vote in favour of the six north-eastern counties remaining within the UK would be misused by Unionist politicians to justify discrimination.  I know the taunt is flung at Irish nationalists that the reason why they oppose the plebiscite is that the result <Col N="1938" /> would embarrass, but that is not the reason why we oppose it.  We accept the reality.  The traditional desire of Irish nationalists is that Ireland should be united by the consent of the people of Ireland.  The realities of today require that the people of Ireland express their wish for unity not as a whole but that the people of the two parts of Ireland should express their consent whenever they are so inclined.</P>
    <P>To try to obtain a verdict at this stage of either of those parts on this issue would be a divisive gesture and something that would only help to aggravate the situation.  The suggestion has been made also that if a plebiscite is held, it should be on the basis of county-by-county rather than on the basis of Northern Ireland as a whole, although I have noted with some interest that Mr. Paisley has suggested it would be wrong to have the vote on a county-by-county basis but that all votes should be brought to Belfast and mixed before being counted so that loyalties of particular regions would never be known.  It is my belief that a county-by-county vote would be unsatisfactory because a situation would then arise in which people who believed in the unity of Ireland, who believed that Irish people should come together, might have their desire to vote that way confused by an expectation that to vote in favour of unity would mean that their areas would be severed immediately from the six north-eastern counties and that by voting for the principle of unification of Irish actions, institutions and intentions, they might lose immediately financial benefit that they enjoy now.  A person who favoured unity would not want further fragmentation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a divisive referendum would be multiplied in its divisory nature were it to be conducted on an area-by-area basis.  The best thing that could be done regarding a plebiscite would be to forget about it altogether. There are other ways of ascertaining people's wishes.  It has been interesting to note that the British Government have denied to their own people a referendum on such a fundamental issue as entry to the Common Market on the grounds that the British system <Col N="1939" /> of Government does not require plebiscites in order to ascertain the will of the people.  It seems rather odd that a government which believes that proposes to have a plebiscite on a matter in Northern Ireland, the result of which is a foregone conclusion.</P>
    <P>The primary problem in the North is not violence in itself.  It is the cause of that violence which is the problem.  Both the Irish nationalist tradition and the Ulster Unionist tradition have what they believe to be very fundamental and legitimate reasons for clinging to their separate way of life and for imposing their way of life on others.  It is this potential for disagreement which creates the violence.  Until this is accepted there will not be any prevention of or lasting remedy for the violence.  Acceptance of this situation requires a settlement which will recognise the legitimate loyalties of both the Unionist and the Nationalist communities. That is why on previous occasions I have suggested that a solution might be found in some form of condominium. This is one which would allow both communities to declare their attachment to individual sovereignties and it would not require either community to surrender to a sovereignty which it could not accept.  It would enable both to preserve their loyalties without requiring others to abandon theirs.  Even though a condominium is something which presents vast administrative difficulties the fact that it presents such difficulties or that it is unusual is not a reason for abandoning it.  The Northern Ireland situation is unique in the history of the second half of the 20th century in western Europe.  Therefore, it is likely that some form of unique solution is required to solve it.</P>
    <P>The most constructive talks which could take place would be along lines such as these.  Of course this will not be acceptable to people who believe that they have a God-given right to dominate their neighbours.  One of the difficulties which British politicians experience is that their standards are not necessarily the rules of all politicians in Northern Ireland <Col N="1940" /> who profess allegiance to the British way of life.  For instance, for a Unionist to say today that he insists on &ldquo;the restoration of parliamentary democracy in Northern Ireland&rdquo; ought not to be taken as a declaration for fair play or of intention not to abuse the democratic machine.  Some men who make an ostensibly reasonable declaration desire to return to a situation in which Unionists would be in an absolute permanent governing majority which they could use to cause annoyance and injustice to the minority. Therefore we must be very careful to examine these nomenclatures in Northern Ireland.  On the minority side there is the same confusion in using phrases to conceal their real intention.  For instance, members of the IRA talk of &ldquo;peace with justice&rdquo; when what they mean is that they should be able to so bomb and mutilate and terrify the community that they will be present at the conference table to dictate terms.</P>
    <P>It is for wise politicians and statesmen to look carefully at the situation and not to allow themselves be led astray by the catchcries or the war-cries of the conflicting communities. The administrative difficulties that would be involved in a condominium are best emphasised, perhaps, by financial considerations.  If sovereignty in Northern Ireland was to be shared by both Britain and Ireland, the obligations that go with sovereignty would have to be shared also. These would include obligations of financial support.  It has been apparent for some time past that many British politicians are of a mind to contribute financially to Northern Ireland even after British sovereignty might be lessened in that area, because to have a commitment no greater than current financial obligations would be a great deal better than to have to accept the present open-ended obligation of giving economic and social welfare support as well as limitless military expenditure.</P>
    <P>Therefore, our Government ought to be urging on the British Government that they think on these lines of a condominium and of maintaining <Col N="1941" /> financial aid to the North of Ireland for many years to come.  I was very much in agreement with what Deputy O'Donovan said this morning in relation to having a united states of Ireland.  This would enable the people in both parts of the country to live in peace with one another and to have their own forms of government and behaviour which would be in accordance with their own traditions.  That is a legitimate objective and one which should commend itself to all people who believe that they are of the Irish nationalist tradition.</P>
    <P>It is very proper that we should be anxious to avoid causing offence to our fellow Irishmen who are of a Unionist way of thinking.  We should ensure that, both in our laws and practices, we tolerate conduct which is legitimate according to the conscience and views of some people, particularly when such conduct does not cause any social harm.  We should endeavour to ensure that we are not intolerant of views which do not conform with the full Irish nationalist textbook.  We should also ensure that people who are not entirely of the republican outlook are, never-the-less, regarded in all respects as full Irish people.  But as we do this, we must also be careful to remember that there is a nationalist element in Northern Ireland and that if overtures are being made towards Unionists, if steps are being taken to accommodate the Unionist point of view, we must at the same time remember our obligations to the 38 per cent of the people of Northern Ireland who are not of that way of thinking and who want to see their particular national outlook respected.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that one can provide accommodation to the Unionist outlook without abandoning the nationalist prospect.  Listening to Deputy Blaney here this morning one would believe that to make any effort to accommodate the Unionist point of view was to agree that Ireland should never be united and to support the argument that it was wrong for anybody to have doubts about Ireland being a unified State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney taunted us in the Fine <Col N="1942" /> Gael Party with the accusation that we had abandoned the &ldquo;claim&rdquo; of the Twenty-Six Counties to Northern Ireland.  Fine Gael has never in its history said that the Twenty-Six Counties have a right, or would be justified in making a &ldquo;claim&rdquo; to annex the Six Counties.  What we as a party say now, and what we have always believed, is that the majority of the people of Ireland desire that Ireland should be united.  We say that desire is best expressed and may best be obtained today by getting the consent of the people of both parts of Ireland. We might be a great deal further on the road to unity if people like Deputy Blaney down through the years had not been insisting on doubtful claims and asserting questionable rights and if they had relied more upon constructive work than on provocative coat-trailing.</P>
    <P>Does anybody think that Europe would be as united as she is today if people had asserted as an obligation or as a right in the forties that Europe should be united?  Would Europe be united today if plebiscites had been forced upon unwilling communities throughout Europe over the last 25 years?  Everybody realises that a coming together of people is not something that can be forced upon them and if efforts are made to force people to do what they are unwilling to do the result will be counter-productive. You could, perhaps, obtain a unity on paper; you could perhaps impose territorial unity but you could not get the people working constructively and helpfully together in a way that would mean a lasting unity.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while Deputy Blaney may want to taunt the three parties in this House, who according to him are all out of step except himself he should realise that we reflect, whether he likes it or not, or whether the pathological, destructive group that he wants to represent like it or not, the overwhelming desire of the Irish people to work and live together rather than destroying one another.  Perhaps he is right when he criticises the tendency of the South of Ireland to be selfish but it might be no harm were this selfishness better known in the North.  By such selfishness I mean a desire on the part of the <Col N="1943" /> people of the South not to introduce into their society, the tension, the violence, the hatred, bigotry and fear existing in Northern Ireland.  Mark you, unless we activate ourselves in a more constructive manner to bring peace to Northern Ireland this dreadful thing which people here wisely, if selfishly, want to avoid, may spill over upon them.</P>
    <P>We saw some of it at St. Johnston in Donegal the other night.  The Government are legitimately being criticised for playing softly-softly on many matters in relation to the North over the last few years and although it is not perhaps the most popular thing for a public representative to call for the prosecution of people, without any quibbling or qualification I say that the Government have a clear obligation to prosecute the people in St. Johnston who interfered with the Orange parade and who used violence and intimidation against Protestants in that community.  These prosecutions must not be delayed because of any political embarrassment there might be to the Fianna Fáil Party because of the fact that there may be reason to believe that some of those who engaged in this despicable incident might be friends of Deputy Blaney.  We must root out any demonstrations of a sectarian or violent nature in our society and if we play softly on this now this rot will spread from St. Johnston in Donegal throughout the length and breadth of this land.  We must show, to ourselves in the first instance, and to the people of Northern Ireland and to the world that we will not tolerate sectarianism in our society no matter by whom it is committed.  If we do not do this, we will immediately tend to underline the fears which permeate the Protestant people of the North of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Finally, I want to talk briefly about the need for us to improve the tone of our own society.  This need arises for the best of all possible reasons, because it would be good for us to do it.  We should do it irrespective of whether or not it will have a beneficial effect on the people of Northern Ireland, although if it does relieve fears and anxieties it is a bonus mark for doing it.  But our own society is not as tolerant as it often believes itself to be.  We have many prejudices; we have many practices which a really open society should not accept.  We need to renovate our laws and institutions. I think we are suffering from having in office a government that is too long in power.  It is in effective power since 1932, though it was for two very brief periods out of office.  Because of this our society has not been renovated as often as any progressive and modern society should be, and it is unlikely to be renovated until there is a change of government.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has on many occasions publicly acknowledged the need to make changes in our Constitution and laws and practices, but he has done nothing about it.  It is like somebody knowing that the house looks shabby, that the house is in need of repair, failing to do anything about it because he is not sure what colour the neighbours would like the front door to be.  We need to renovate our own institutions, and our Constitution forthwith.  We can do that and, at the same time, make a public declaration that in the event of there being a movement towards re-unification of the peoples of Ireland, in a federal system, a condominium or any other form, we would be willing to get down to talks to agree on ways to redevelop or reconstruct our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must forthwith, therefore, remove all vexatious religious or divisive statements from our Constitution and laws, be they either direct or implied.  We must delete all constitutional and statutory restrictions on conduct which is compatible with the religious beliefs of some and not injurious to the welfare <Col N="1945" /> of others.  This is something which we can now do.  All too often we feel frustrated because we can do so little.  We feel utterly helpless in the terrible situation that exists in the North of Ireland.  Oftentimes, we can do no more than make our representations with no guarantee that they will ever be heard; and all too often we have found that they have not been listened to until it was too late.  But one thing we can do, we can act ourselves to amend our Constitution, laws and practices; and little as that may be, it is very important that we do it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Neil Blaney, in the speech he made here this morning, gave bloody details of a certain number of atrocities.  The atrocities he listed all fell into one particular category: they were atrocities committed or alleged to have been committed&mdash;and I am sure some of them were really committed&mdash;either by Protestants or by British soldiers against Catholics.  They were all committed against Catholics.  I have heard that kind of speech made elsewhere.  I have heard it made in various parts of Africa by people who were out to sell inter-tribal hatred, hatred of &ldquo;them&rdquo;, what &ldquo;they&rdquo; did to us.  That kind of speech has only one meaning.  It is not really about past atrocities; it is the justification of retaliation with future atrocities.  It was the most sinister type of speech that anyone could make.</P>
      <P>I accuse Deputy Blaney, with all responsibility, of fanning the flames of sectarian bigotry in this country, and I accuse him of putting in danger the security of the Protestant minority in the Republic and most especially in his own stronghold in Donegal.  I hope he is not doing that deliberately.  I hope he regrets what happened to the returning Orangemen in Donegal.  He did not say a word of regret about it but I hope he will find time to regret it.  I would tremble for this country if I thought his voice was in any way representative but I do not believe it is any longer representative.  I think it would be repudiated by the great majority of the people of this country.</P>

      <P>It was only found out there was something wrong with governments in Dublin when he ceased, to our good fortune, to be a member of such governments.  At the same time&mdash;and I am afraid my friend Deputy Burke will not say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to this&mdash;we must remember that the gentleman who bared his sectarian soul before us this morning was not only nominated by the Taoiseach to his first government here, from which the Taoiseach later removed him for certain reasons, but was appointed as one of the two more powerful members&mdash;the other being Deputy Haughey&mdash;of a four-member committee on the North in those grave, formative months after August, 1969.  In those hands, in the hands of the gentleman who made that speech, in the hands of the gentleman who refrained from denouncing the outrageous behaviour of some of his supporters in Donegal, in those hands was policy towards the North placed in those formative times. When we were at the equivalent stage of our debate last year, in the Adjournment debate, the Taoiseach's words closing the debate&mdash;and I am quoting from cols. 3877-8, vol. 255, of the Official Report of 6th August, 1971&mdash;were:</P>
      <P>In the meantime they&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Deputies</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;can be perfectly assured, as I said this time last year, that the country is in the very best of hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a few days before the North exploded on the internment crisis, and many of us were then predicting in that debate that it was in fact about to explode.  He said that, and I think it was rather typical of the complacent style with which the Taoiseach for a long time has handled <Col N="1947" /> those questions.  I will admit that I do agree that there is less complacency now after the year of murder and mayhem that followed the Taoiseach's assurance that we could go on our holidays safely, that the country would be in the very best of hands.  His speech now has more realism in it.</P>
    <P>I would, however, invite the attention of the House to two significant words in that statement in our adjournment debate last year when the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;The country is in the very best of hands.&rdquo;  What do Deputies think he could have meant when he said &ldquo;the country&rdquo;?  Usually when we are watching our words, when we say &ldquo;the country&rdquo; we mean the whole island of Ireland, its islands and its territorial seas.  Certainly that is what Fianna Fáil mean when they are watching their words.  If the Taoiseach meant that when he said the country was in the very best of hands, he was saying that the very best of hands included the then Stormont Government, Mr. Faulkner and the British Army.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to accept it that the Taoiseach did not mean that, but if he did not mean that it is inescapable that what he meant by &ldquo;the country&rdquo; was the Twenty-six Counties.  That is a revelation.  It is not peculiar to the Taoiseach.  I am not making a big deal on this about the Taoiseach.  I am inclined to make a big deal about it as regards our own attitudes, our real daily attitudes and our professed attitudes on such public occasions.  On the one hand, in the world of daily reality that we think about here in this Dáil, &ldquo;the country&rdquo; is, as the Taoiseach implied, the Twenty-six Counties.  On <Col N="1948" /> the other hand, in the world of ritual pronouncements, as in this debate it is of course the Thirty-two Counties. We ought to think about that.  The Taoiseach said that we care passionately about Northern Ireland.  Do we?</P>

      <P>I would like to think it is true.  I believe it is true of a certain number of Deputies and of a certain number of people.  I think those Deputies and the people they represent are distributed among the three parties.  I am not saying that only we have the right and holy views on this.  It is not so.  I think if we cared as passionately as the Taoiseach said, and as Deputy Burke agrees, there would be rather more Deputies in the House for the only debate during the year in which we discuss Northern Ireland.  The spectators looking down from the gallery who have been watching this debate are more numerous at times than the Deputies in the House.  That is one index of how passionately we seem to care.</P>
      <P>Certainly the other day you had an electric atmosphere in the House.  It was the morning of the 12th July, that morning of a day which many people felt might end in disaster.  It ended in seven dead and the commentary here the following day was how peacefully everything had passed off.  Seven people shot dead was not too bad.  Therefore, we feared that things would be much worse.  That morning we had a crowded chamber not like now and not with this feeling. It was electric when the writ was moved in the mid-Cork by-election. That was real.  That was where the action was.</P>

      <P>Whatever it was the Dáil was alive on that occasion. The Dáil has not been alive during this debate.  There have been very sincere contributions made but they have been made for the most part to empty benches.  I have as good <Col N="1949" /> a House now as any speaker had.  It it not unnatural that this House should be more concerned, as it undoubtedly is, with the mid-Cork by-election than it is with the North, for the very simple reason that we are in fact a Twenty-six County Parliament representing a 26-County electorate. That is what is real about us. When we stand on that ground we are as the Americans say: &ldquo;For real.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are a Twenty-six County parliament claiming to be a Thirty-two county one, claiming the right of jurisdiction over the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.  It is where that claim supervenes, when we are talking as if that claim was a reality, that we lose reality and lose credibility. We know that Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution assert a right of jurisdiction over the Six Counties of Northern Ireland but of course it is not just Articles 2 and 3.  They are important only because they represent, recognise and legitimatise a certain attitude. They are certainly important for that. For a parliament to claim a right of jurisdiction over people who are not represented in it, and the majority of whom are known not to want to be represented in it, is to assume a fearful responsibility.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan said just now that he was opposed to a plebiscite in Northern Ireland.  If we are opposed to a plebiscite in Northern Ireland it is because we know what the result of a plebiscite would be.  It would be heavily against that right of jursidiction which our parliament has assumed. That is a fearful responsibility.  It would be a fearful responsibility even if we were thoroughly committed to it in our lives, dedicated to it and really working for it.  In fact it is a responsibility which has been borne with a fearful levity.  When things were quiet in the North and Deputies know well what I say is true, our governments and parliaments did not bother their heads about the place except for perfunctory platitudes at commemorative ceremonies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now all speak with indignation of those 50 terrible years when the <Col N="1950" /> minority was crushed but most of us bore those 50 years with considerable equanimity for most of the time. Even now, with the North thrashing about in agony the Dáil is going into recess and into a by-election, which will be concerned almost entirely with Twenty-six County bread and butter issues.  That is inevitable.  When we go to mid-Cork we must talk about what the people there are interested in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I most certainly am and I hope our paths may cross down there so that we may have a chance of relaxed and courteous discourse. The gravity of our claim to a Thirty-two County jurisdiction and the levity of the actual commitment to that claim has had, I suggest to the House, dire consequences.  The existence of that claim to jurisdiction over people who were not consulted about it has encouraged the polarisation of the two communities in Northern Ireland which now takes the sinister form of incipient sectarian civil war.  I think that is an accurate diagnosis of what we have now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claim for one thing is at the very root of the siege mentality demonstrated by the Protestants of Northern Ireland and demonstrated by some of them now in such very terrible ways. They fear the claim of a Catholic majority in this island through its largely Catholic parliament to rule over them.  They see&mdash;this is worse still&mdash;the Catholics of Northern Ireland as the instruments of that claim so that those Catholics become on the one hand a kind of trojan horse, a fifth column and on the other side they are handed over as hostages in this system. Unionists spokesmen use this claim of ours expressed in our Constitution and in other ways, in our general attitudes and the speeches of our public men down the years to justify those discriminatory measures against Catholics which are indeed among the root causes of the present troubles.  We watered those roots.  We rightly condemn the Unionist leaders for setting up that iniquitous system but we <Col N="1951" /> usually forget, as people forget their responsibilities most easily, that we provided them with their best pretext for maintaining it.</P>
    <P>That is the effect of that claim so solemnly professed and in fact so lightly held on the Ulster Protestants but it also had an effect on the Ulster Catholics.  It encouraged them but it was an unreal and dangerous kind of encouragement.  They were encouraged to say: &ldquo;We are supposed to be a minority here but we are not really a minority.  We are really a majority.  The South is at our back.&rdquo;  The South was at their back in a kind of tricky, distant, unreliable way.  They were encouraged to think that the South would somehow come to the rescue.  I was in Derry during that terrible week of August, 1969, and I met the Citizens Defence Committee there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that he is on a higher level.  At that time I met, as the Deputy did, the Citizens Defence Committee and I am sure he heard what I did.  They had heard our Taoiseach on television say: &ldquo;We will not stand idly by&rdquo; and they believed him.  They believed he was going to intervene, that they were going to be rescued.  I had to explain to them that these words of our dear Taoiseach did not mean precisely what they took them to mean and indeed what they meant was not very clear but that reinforcements were not immediately about to arrive.  I am sure Deputy Burke gave them that message, too, but probably in a more emollient way than I did.  Then they heard the claim that the Taoiseach was their second guarantor.  He guaranteed their rights and liberties.  This encouraged the Catholics to take risks they might otherwise not have taken.  They felt they had friends at hand who were about to come to their rescue.  What <Col N="1952" /> he did was to stir up the Catholics and then let them down.  I am afraid we are still engaged in various forms of that exercise.</P>
      <P>I have spoken of the effect of this claim on Ulster Catholics and Ulster Protestants.  There is another subcategory more powerfully affected by the claim and affecting others.  I am speaking of young people, young men in particular, who are brought up on this claim, who take it seriously.  They are earnest, often dedicated young men.  They take it seriously and are offended to see their Government and their Parliament paying lip service to a claim which they quite palpably do not take seriously, as any of these young men could see if they came in here during this debate.  In this way these young people lose faith in parliamentary democracy since we do not take seriously a law which we tell them is solemn, fundamental and enshrined in our Constitution.  When they see us not taking that seriously, the most active, the most ardent of them turn from us.  There are mixtures of motives in these things.  I am taking a particular type of person. They turn from us and take the law into their own hands.  Our precepts and our practice contrasted with our precepts have helped to create the IRA which we then condemn.  This is only one aspect of it I know.  Probably most people are brought into the IRA as much by family tradition as anything else.  You go into the movement because your uncle or your daddy was in it.  This would not so easily have continued, would not have seeded itself again after the independence of the Twenty-six County Republic, the IRA tradition might have begun to fade away, if it had not been legitimised, sanctified and sustained in existence by this State, by its Constitution, by many of its schools, by its glorification of past violence and by its cult for the dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to consider the Taoiseach's role in regard to all this. The Taoiseach has condemned violence, but.  There is always a &ldquo;but&rdquo;. Every sentence of the Taoiseach's, which has to be related to other sentences in the past and perhaps in the future, has a back door, an escape <Col N="1953" /> hatch.  His opening speech in this debate was a relatively good one.  His speeches oscillate.  There is the one with the stress on unity, what we must get, what they must do, what we will not accept; and there is the one with emphasis on peace and reconciliation. They come at appropriate moments, cyclically.  This one I would regard as one of the good ones, the emphasis was back more on peace.  It was more conciliatory than his foreign affairs essay which was rather minatory and distinctly low on condemnations of violence.  He does concede that unity is not exactly around the corner.  That is something.  There is a beginning of reality there.  I hope it sinks home to certain editorial writers in this city who are making things worse than they need be by encouraging this will-o'-the-wisp of unity round the corner provided some negotiating table is set up and some papers are exchanged.</P>
    <P>There are basic contradictions in the Taoiseach's position as set out in various statements.  He tells us that violence is bad but he also tells us that it will go on until Partition is abolished.  Violence, he has told us, is a by-product of the division of our country.  That statement is completely unhistoric as the violence preceded the division and the threat of violence and violence were among the causes of that division, not just among the results.  It is unhistoric but that is not the worst thing about it.  A statement could be unhistoric and relatively harmless.  I am thinking in terms of what effect a statement like that has on the majority in Northern Ireland, who are opposed not merely to unity with this country but even to have anything to do with us, opposed to dialogue.  These are the people we should be trying to reach.</P>
    <P>We are not reaching them.  The thing has been moving backwards.  A group of whom too much was made here a little time ago&mdash;the New Ireland Group in the North formed around Mr. Dick Ferguson and others &mdash;has broken up.  That group of moderate Protestants have broken up in disgust and discouragement, and among the reasons for that is the implication <Col N="1954" /> which they take from the words: &ldquo;Violence is a by-product of the division of our country.&rdquo;  To them what we seem to be saying in remarks like that is: &ldquo;If you do not come to terms with me now the Provos will keep it up until you do come to terms with me.&rdquo;  I am speaking now of moderate Protestants.  The Taoiseach will say he does not intend that that implication should be taken, but who believes him?  Certainly not the people whom it is most important for him to convince, the Ulster Protestants.  They remember, as the rest of us do, that it was the Taoiseach's first Government in this Dáil that hatched out the Provisional IRA.  That was the Government that sowed these dragon's teeth in those fatal months of late 1969 and early 1970.  It is true that the Taoiseach dropped certain Ministers, but only when their activities surfaced inconveniently when they came to the attention of Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's own role in the activities of the Government during that period remains murky and casts a dark shadow over his credibility on this entire question.  That is an unfortunate thing.  I would not wish&mdash;I would ask Deputies opposite to believe me if they can&mdash;to make this a party issue.  I do not like attacking our Taoiseach on a matter such as this and I have on the whole, with occasional exceptions, rather held back on it.  I have tried to believe what he was saying but I am afraid I cannot maintain that.</P>
    <P>The shadow deepens whenever we consider the statements and the silences of certain members of his party.  There are members of his party who have spoken out very well on this issue.  We have heard some of them in this debate, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy just now. There are others who have talked in quite a different way, just occasionally publicly.  One Deputy, a colleague of Deputy Burke's, has said that maybe, as Cardinal Conway said in a statement attributed to me by Deputy Blaney, we should not try to bomb a million Protestants into a united Ireland.  That was said by a Deputy of this House in Sligo and never disavowed.  The Deputy is here.  He votes for the Taoiseach and his peace-loving statements.  That is <Col N="1955" /> what he said.  I am not particularly faulting that Deputy but I think he said out loud what a lot of other members of that party&mdash;not all of them and probably not any of those who are listening to me now&mdash;what a lot of them say in private or semi-private, in the corridors and bars of this House where they express their open admiration for the Provisional IRA.  The implication of the relaxed discourse of this not negligible group of Deputies is that while the Taoiseach has, of course, to condemn violence, in fact the Provos supply the necessary levers for the Taoiseach's diplomacy whereby he will, in their system of fantasy, unite Ireland.</P>
    <P>While that impression is known to be there, and it is known, the Taoiseach's more peace-loving utterances&mdash;and he has made some of them and they have been extremely felicitously expressed&mdash; can, unfortunately, carry little conviction and that is unfortunate for more than the Taoiseach; it is unfortunate for all of us, of whatever persuasion, tradition, allegiance, living in this island.  The Taoiseach says the unity we want is a unity by consent but he also says the majority in Northern Ireland, being a minority in the whole island, has no right to a veto on unity. Now, that, if you put the two bits together, boils down to saying we must have unity with their consent which they have no right to withhold.  And if they do, nonetheless, continue to withhold it, what happens then?  The Taoiseach has to remind them, sadly, that violence is a by-product of the division of our country, as he says.  And what message does that convey?  The unfortunate fact is that it no longer much matters what the Taoiseach says about the North because hardly anybody in the North any longer believes a word he says.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to say that.  I wish it was not what I had to say but I think it is true and that it is important that it should be said. If you take the two main communities, for the Catholics, the Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, is the man who said he <Col N="1956" /> would not stand idly by and then stood idly by.  That is another thing, incidentally&mdash;a small digression&mdash;the official record of what the Taoiseach said on that notable occasion omits the word &ldquo;idly&rdquo;, just says that he said: &ldquo;We will not stand by&rdquo; but the word &ldquo;idly&rdquo; is audible on the recording made at that time, which Deputies can consult in RTE, if they wish.  It was edited out of the official record and that is a small index of the rather odd way in which these things are handled.</P>
      <P>For the Catholics, too, he is the man who put himself forward as second guarantor and was able to guarantee them nothing at all as they were buffeted about in their agony between the two varieties of IRA, the British Army, the UDA, and Lord knows what forms of private enterprise lawless violence there.  What good was a second guarantor to them in those conditions?</P>
      <P>For the Protestants, the honeyed words which Mr. Lynch so often addresses to them come across as velvety blackmail, sleeven provisionalism. He may make a mild, conciliatory speech today.  They know he will make a truculent and military speech tomorrow if the Twenty-six Counties situation or the inner pressures of the Fianna Fáil Party so require.  I admired at the time his Tralee speech in the autumn of 1969. I had not learned to know him so well then through his actions as I have now.  It is very sad to think of what his Government were actually doing at the time that Tralee speech was made, what, at least, certain powerful members of his Government were doing when they were engaged in certain activities which helped the Provisional IRA to come into being. The Taoiseach either knew or did not know what certain of his Ministers were then doing.  What view you take of that, whether he knew or did not know, depends on whether you regard the Taoiseach as competent or, alternatively, as honest.  Personally, I think he is highly competent and that he knew what was going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this record, unfortunately, the Taoiseach can do no good now on the <Col N="1957" /> North.  With this record his very presence as Taoiseach is a scarecrow, a deterrent, not merely against unity but against the beginning of any dialogue with Ulster Protestants.  We need a credible Taoiseach and a credible Government.  We need to drop our claim to jurisdiction over people who have conferred no such right of jurisdiction on us until some day perhaps they do.  We should be saying to the North, in effect, &ldquo;What we want to see in Northern Ireland is peace first and foremost.  Then we want to see reconstruction with equal opportunities for all.  We are not insisting on unity.  We will be glad to talk about unity if and when a majority among you want to talk about it.  Until then we shall not be talking about it.  We shall refrain from all propaganda about it.  We are taking all necessary steps to prevent our territory from being used as a base for attack on you.  Nor shall we permit private people within the area of our jurisdiction to make public statements arrogating to themselves the right to make war or peace.  We will not tolerate any private armies or headquarters of private armies on our soil.  We are ready to co-operate with all elected representatives in the North and with the British Government in all ways in which we may facilitate peace and reconstruction in the North.  What we are interested in is sharing this island in peace, justice and equality of opportunities. Some day political unity may be the best way of sharing this island. We recognise that it is not now an acceptable way.  We are not interested in imposing our own conceptions on those who do not share them, whether these concepts are theological or political.  We are interested in dialogue, that is, we are prepared to listen as well as to talk&rdquo;.  We have, of course, never listened to the people whom we have purportedly tried to persuade.</P>
    <P>All that needs to be said.  I believe our people would overwhelmingly approve it if it were said but it needs to be said by people who will be believed when they say it.  It needs to be said by people whose practice will live up to their word.  The record of our present Taoiseach and his Government&mdash;his <Col N="1958" /> Governments&mdash;in such that they will not be believed in the North whatever they say because their practice has belied their words.  That is, perhaps, the gravest reason why we need a new Taoiseach and a new Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney in his speech this morning suggested that it was abominable heresy, blasphemy, and what not, on the part of certain speakers in this debate to suggest that we should abandon insistence on unity.  Now, there is a very interesting text here.  I am to quote, a Cheann Comhairle, from Suiona Priobháideacha an Dara Dáil &mdash;Private Sessions of Second Dáil&mdash; 1921-22, which has just been published by the Stationery Office and released to the world for the first time.  I shall quote from pages 28 and 29 of the debate for Monday, 22nd August, 1921:</P>
    <P>An tUachtarán&mdash;</P>
    <P>Éamon de Valera</P>
    <P>&mdash;explained it was difficult to have a policy for Ulster when they could not get in contact.</P>
    <P>This is put in the third person; it is a minute.</P>
    <P>Their present aim was to get in touch with them.  They had not the power, and some of them had not the inclination, to use force with Ulster.  He did not think that policy would be successful.  They would be making the same mistake with that section as England had made with Ireland.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They would be making the same mistake with that section as England had made with Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;that is a very important statement indeed and it is one which has been lost to us down the years because it was said in private session of the Dáil; it was not offered to the people as a thought.  But, when some of us more recently said that our claim to the Twenty-six Counties elected Parliament, our claim to impose our concept of what was right on Northern Ireland, was essentially a colonial claim, we were shouted at in some quarters as betraying the nation, the past, the heroes and all.  Yet, that it essentially what Éamon de Valera said here: &ldquo;They would be making the <Col N="1959" /> same mistake with that section as England had made with Ireland&rdquo;&mdash; that is, the colonial mistake.  He went on:</P>
    <P>He would not be responsible for such a policy.  Ulster's present position was that she claimed the Six Counties as a constitutional right given to her constitutionally through the Realm and did not want to be under the domination of the rest of Ireland whose sentiments, ideals and religion were different. They said they would not give away their established rights and that they were prepared to die for them.  The question was how they were to deal with Ulster&mdash; peace or war conditions.  At the present the Ministry proposed to act as they had done before under war conditions.  He could not definitely say further than that their object at present was to get in contact to see what exactly Ulster wanted.  The moment contact was established they were up against a big difficulty.  Ulster would say she was as devotedly attached to the Empire as they were to their independence and that she would fight for one as much as they would do for the other.  In case of coercion she would get sympathy and help from her friends all over the world.</P>
    <P>There is a certain understanding of the Ulster Protestant's position contained in these words which was lost sight of for many years thereafter.</P>
    <P>Deputy J.J. Walsh asked if they understood that under no circumstances were they prepared to give any sanction to dual nationality in this country.</P>
    <P>He was a hardliner.</P>
    <P>An tUachtarán replied as far as dual nationality was concerned, they never recognised it, but that fact would not prevent the British Government from establishing it. For his part, if the Republic were recognised, he would be in favour of giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic if it so wished.  Otherwise they would be compelled to use force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1960" /> Deputy J.J. Walsh indicated that he disagreed with that policy.</P>

      <P>That is another matter.  This is what he said.  On that occasion, and in that debate, his whole emphasis was on the theme of consent of the governed and that this was the key to the whole problem.  It was the key to the claim of the majority of this country to be released from English rule and should also be the key to our conduct in relation to those who reject our rule.  He laid the emphasis there and that is where it belongs&mdash;on accepting the principle of consent of the governed.  No majority in this country has yet done it properly.  The Ulster Protestant majority in Northern Ireland did not bother setting about getting the consent of the Catholic minority.  They seem to act sometimes as if they wanted not to get it.  The majority in this country never accepted the legitimacy of the same principle as applying to the position of the Ulster Protestant as long as they object to being ruled by the Parliament here.  That principle of consent of the governed is the key to the whole situation here in the long run and is a key which has been lost for more than 50 years.</P>

      <P>I am grateful.  I want to thank Deputy Tully very much for allowing me to speak now.  I will reciprocate some day.  I wish to thank the national newspapers for their conduct during all the trouble over the last three years.  They all behaved very well in so far as the troubles in Northern Ireland were concerned.  This morning I had to interrupt Deputy Blaney.  The reason I interrupted him was because he spoke of the late Mr. Childers, the father of Deputy Childers, who contributed more to the national independence of this country than any man in Ireland.  He made it possible for us to have freedom here.  For 13 years Deputy Blaney was a Minister in this Government.  We are a party governed by majority rule and the day that any party, whether the Labour Party or Fine Gael, cannot be ruled by majority rule is the day that democracy will completely and utterly fail.  So far as we are concerned, the Taoiseach only did what the majority rule of our party dictated to him to do.  We did everything possible except declare war on the North of Ireland.  We tried to focus attention internationally on the position without involving our people or the people of the North in total war.  If Deputy Blaney and others want their homes destroyed, that is their business. I went through the Civil War.  I saw homes burning in my parish.  I am nearly 29 years here.</P>

      <P>I want to thank you, Deputy Tully.  We went through all these things.  If the Taoiseach did anything in this House, he did it on the instructions of the majority of our Party.  Is the Taoiseach wrong in taking majority rule and abiding by it after consulting us?  I want to say the hardest thing I ever said against anybody.  Deputy Blaney is not in the House now.  I am sorry that is so, and that a few others are not here also.  They took upon themselves to be bigger than the whole group of the Fianna Fáil Party and to do anything they liked.  I want to <Col N="1962" /> tell the leader of the Labour Party and the representatives of the Fine Gael Party that I believe in majority rule.  May I also say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Last Saturday my home was picketed for two and a half hours.  I was out and when I came home my wife had collapsed. I had to go for a doctor.  I do not give a damn if these people stand by me every day of the week, but I do not like anybody upsetting my wife in my own home.  I had to get the doctor for my wife and she had to get treatment.  These men were indicating that we are not Republicans. This is our country and anything I can do in my time I will do, and so will my party and all the parties in this House.  It is our fondest desire to do everything we can to reunite our country.  This crowd are trying to frighten wives, daughters and mothers.

      <P>I am sure that Deputy P.J. Burke, looking around at some of his former colleagues, can recall what his late colleague, Deputy Seán Dunne, said: &ldquo;With friends like these what need we of enemies?&rdquo; I have been here quite a long time and, in my early years here, on the occasion of the Taoiseach's Estimate, it was usual for the Taoiseach of the day to give what we genuinely referred to as something similar to the American President's &ldquo;State of the Nation&rdquo; speech.  He usually tried to review what had happened during the year that had gone and what the prospects were for the coming year and, indeed, he did it quite well and, in his reply at the end of the debate, he would deal with the points that had been raised during the course of the debate</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the pattern in the days of Mr. de Valera and in the days of Mr. <Col N="1963" /> Lemass.  It happened in the first year, I think, of Deputy Lynch but he, becoming very astute as the years went by, developed a new technique.  What he does now is he gets up and talks for three-quarters of an hour or so, saying things which any of his backbenchers could say, not giving much information, not being a bit contentious, just passing it along quietly and waiting until everyone else has spoken, and then, knowing there is no opportunity to reply or comment for a period of two or three months, while the House is in recess, he launches his attack on everybody and, as Deputy Corish said yesterday, he usually finishes up by saying we can go off on our recess quite comfortably because the country is in safe hands. At least, he has said so up till now and I will be very interested this evening to see if, finishing his speech in reply to this debate, he once more says that the country is in safe hands because, while I do not want to introduce a note of acrimony, I would like to point out that, judging by recent happenings particularly, it would appear as if the country is in anything but safe hands.</P>
    <P>Surely we can all see that what has happened over the last six or 12 months is simply the chickens coming home to roost on the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil.  Surely Fianna Fáil must understand that they have brought this upon themselves by closing their eyes to what they knew or, if they did not know, must have had an educated guess about, was happening even within their own Cabinet.  I do not want again to drag out here the events which were discussed two-and-a-half to three years ago as a result of the arms trial and what followed, but anybody who comes in here and pretends all this did not happen, pretends there was no truth whatever in it, pretends that Fianna Fáil, the pure-souled patriots of this country, sailed along over the years without doing anything out of the way, nothing which anyone could be ashamed of, is either distorting the facts or is not prepared to face up to them.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that the situation which has arisen has left us, along with the worry of the North, a worry for <Col N="1964" /> the South because, if we are to take seriously the activities of some of the people who have been going around masquerading as patriots over the last few months, we must realise that the Government, the very State itself, is in danger when we hear people talking about the State as if it were a puppet state, as if the Government had no authority to rule, as if the right to rule lay in the hands of self-elected people outside this House.  When we hear people in this House saying that authority has gone outside, that Dáil and Seanad Éireann are no longer as important as they were, that they do not really matter, then surely the Government have something to think about and surely the people have something to think about.</P>
    <P>May I repeat now what Deputy Corish said yesterday.  There is one way to test.  If the people who claim they have the authority to speak for the majority, and that includes Fianna Fáil, if they have this authority, then why do they not test it?  Why do they not give the people the opportunity to decide?  We had by a mistake, or a trick&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;the moving of the writ for the Cork by-election, the by-election resulting from the lamented death of a Member of this House.  Now, if Fianna Fáil win, which is very unlikely, they will say the people are behind them; if they lose, they will say it does not matter.  God be with the days when Mr. Seán Lemass spelled it out openly and said: &ldquo;If we lose we will have a general election immediately&rdquo; and was as good as his word.  Unfortunately, those who now control the destinies of this State do not seem to be of the same calibre as Mr. Lemass. Whether we agreed with him or whether we did not, he was man enough to stand up to realities.  If any of the so-called republican bodies feel they have a right to talk, then the place to do their talking is at a general election and, if we cannot persuade, coax, entice the Government to have a general election, then let us see what the colour of their money is in the Cork by-election.  Let us see how far they will go.  Let us see what the popular support is for <Col N="1965" /> them.  I honestly believe we are now reaching the stage at which, unless we are very careful, those people to whom I referred will do here what they have been promising or threatening to do for a long time; they will succeed in persuading enough people that they represent the people and they will do untold damage before action is taken to either control or prevent it.</P>
    <P>While we blame these people, and rightly so, it is only less than half a century we have to go back to find the example they are following.  They are doing exactly what was done before and it is no use for old men to come along now and say: &ldquo;We were wrong.  We should not have done it.&rdquo; They did it and the youth and the not so young today are now following their example.</P>
    <P>With regard to the North, as far as what is happening there is concerned, while we must condemn what is happening because of acts by the British Army, we must also remember that atrocities are being committed by both sides.  It is a shocking thing that the Irish nation should have some of the things which are being done in the North bandied around the world as the normal activities of the Irish people.  Whether a person is murdered by the British soldiers, by the UVF or by the IRA, he is just as dead.  If he is maimed he suffers just as much if one does it as the other.  Therefore, the sooner we stop, or persuade these people to stop, doing these things&mdash;in the name of Christianity, if you do not mind&mdash;the sooner we will be able to face up to the rest of the world and say that we are, in fact, civilised human beings. Certainly the activities of some of these people cannot be described as civilised by any standards.</P>
    <P>To come now to the economy of the country, I am sorry that the Taoiseach in his opening address here yesterday did not go into a little more detail about what was happening and what he hoped would happen to the economy over the next 12 months. Even if he had given a guess as to what was likely to happen over the next few months it would have been a help.  It <Col N="1966" /> does appear that the Government are reasonably satisfied with the way things are going but they must know that on the economic front the signs of Government failure are everywhere to be seen. Whether we measure them by high unemployment, by escalating consumer price trends or in terms of real economic growth, the Government have failed on all counts.  The late Seán Lemass said on one occasion that the way to judge whether a Government were doing well or otherwise was to consider the employment and unemployment figures.  If we go by that and consider our present unemployment figures, it is obvious that the Government must be condemned for their failure.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be a clearly defined strategy for economic development. It seems to be a question of playing along and the recent IDA report can in no way substitute for a detailed comprehensive approach in planning for our need of a long-term sustained growth.  The Government have not resolved the problem of increasing productivity fostered on income increases. They may say that is not entirely their fault and that the fault lies with the trade unions and the workers who are looking for more than their share.  In this context we must consider prices.  Surely the Government understand that if they allow price increases there must be corresponding increases in wages.  A Bill was passed here a few days ago for the purpose of taking action in respect of price increases but on the following day the Minister for Finance said there was no way in which prices could be controlled at the retail level.  If that is the position why did this House waste its time passing a Bill to control prices? Was that Bill merely eye-wash to cod people who do not understand the position as well as the Minister for Finance understands it and who might be led to believe that some effort was being made to control prices?</P>
    <P>If prices cannot be controlled the workers are entitled to seek compensation so that they can live at least as well as they lived 12 months ago and that is not the situation now.  The position has not been helped by the <Col N="1967" /> proposed introduction of VAT.  I was amused to hear the Minister for Finance tell us, not once but on a number of occasions, that we need have no fear of increases in prices as a result of VAT because this tax is simply a substitute for another tax. When it was pointed out to the Minister that he had said something similar in relation to the introduction of decimal currency he did not seem to understand that what happened then could and would happen as a result of VAT.  At the time of the introduction of decimal currency, the Minister suggested that there was a danger that people would be inclined to charge too much for small articles but that this would be offset by reducing the prices of other articles.  It did not take very long for certain people who believe in collecting a fast halfpenny to add on the halfpenny to the fast selling items and take it off the slow selling ones.</P>
    <P>Under VAT something similar will happen.  I do not wish to go into this question in detail because it has been discussed at length already.  But the Minister must be prepared to accept that there will be a lot of trouble in having wage adjustments fixed because the workers realise there will be increases in prices.  That is the reason why we in the trade union movement are having so much difficulty in having a long-term agreement accepted by the workers.  The workers know that there is no point in accepting an agreement for 12 months when the Government, who are supposed to be controlling certain prices, allow such increases to take place that any increase granted would be eroded within a very short time.</P>
    <P>If anybody wishes to verify whether consumer price increases have increased to the extent we are suggesting, we would remind them that during the past 12 months the consumer price increase has been 8 per cent.  The increase in respect of food prices alone was 10 per cent as against 4.5 per cent for the previous year.  Is it any wonder, then, that people who must live on a weekly wage are not satisfied to accept that an increase which they are being <Col N="1968" /> offered now will not be sufficient to carry them over a period of from 12 to 18 months?</P>
    <P>I would like to see a period of stability.  I would like to see a situation where we could be sure that during the next 12 or 18 months there would not be an increase in the cost of living. However, nobody could guarantee that for as long as the present Government are in power because, apparently, they have decided that prices will be allowed to rise in any way that those who control prices wish them to rise.</P>
    <P>Another problem in respect of this wage increase is the question of house prices.  If we take into account rent and rates, we find that during the past 12 months the cost of housing has increased by 13.5 per cent.  The extraordinary thing is that while many people are living in accommodation rented to them by local authorities, the Minister for Local Government can stand up here and assert brazenly that there is nothing wrong in charging rents of between £4 and £8 per week. That might be all right for a Minister or even for any other member of this House but it is not all right for any man who is trying to rear a young family to have to put aside one-sixth of his earnings, and in some cases, one-fifth, before he can spend any of the money that he has earned so hard.  In addition to that the State have refused to do anything about the personal allowances for income tax.  Twenty years ago when the standard wage was £6 per week the income tax allowance for a single person was £6 10s per week and £10 10s for a married couple but now the standard wage is more than three times what it was then but the income tax allowance is almost the same.  If it was considered wrong to charge income tax then on what was considered to be the minimum required for existence, surely it is very wrong now to charge income tax on two-thirds of earnings?  Apparently so far as the State is concerned there is nothing wrong so long as people do not notice the wrong.  They seem to think there is nothing wrong in taking one-third of a £2 increase and then to take a further one-sixth of that increase by way of rent.  When all these expenses <Col N="1969" /> are considered as well as the extra social welfare contributions is it any wonder that a man should have asked me recently to whom the increases in wages were being given because, as he said, he got very little by way of them?</P>
    <P>When a man finds that he is not getting sufficient to live on he asks his employer to allow him work overtime if possible but of course the State is waiting for its 35p in the pound on every pound he earns and the overtime is taken into account also in assessing his rent.  Yet we are told that this is the affluent society and that everybody should be happy with the situation as it is.  It is obvious that anyone who says this votes Fianna Fáil and has been indoctrinated with the idea that whatever Fianna Fáil do must be right.</P>
    <P>In relation to housing the situation is that the number of new houses built by the local authorities in 1967-68 was 4,045, and of other houses built by private individuals, 7,972; in 1968-69, local authorities built 4,613; others, 8,420; in 1969-70 the figures were 4,706 and 8,938 respectively; in 1971, they were 3,875 and 9,796; in 1971-72 they were 5,106 and 10,815.  In the North of Ireland, about which there is so much talk of how bad things are, and we know how bad they are, the situation is that the ratio is three to one of local authority houses against private houses.  Here it is two to one the other way round.  Surely there is something wrong.  If the Minister for Local Government could stand here yesterday and the day before and tell Deputies that although he knew that schemes submitted for sanction to his Department, schemes submitted for payment of loans from the Local Loans Fund which would allow them to start, were held up by his Department he could not see anything wrong with that.  He said it was all right, that he would release them <i>en bloc</i> when he thought the money would be released.</P>
    <P>Would the Taoiseach, when replying, say if we have reached the stage where money required for local authority housing, even with the exorbitant rents being charged, is no longer available? If that is so, we should know it because there is no point in Government Ministers issuing statements about the high <Col N="1970" /> level of housing and saying that any money required is available if it cannot be got from the Department of Local Government because that is the acid test.  I am sure there is no Deputy who in the past 12 months has not had occasion to bring this to the notice of the Minister for Local Government&mdash; with very little result I may add.</P>
    <P>Similarly, people building new houses or reconstructing them apply for grants to the Department.  Is the Taoiseach aware that it is almost impossible to get any money out of the Department of Local Government and the only way we appear to be able to get a response is by putting down a question to the Minister.  Then, in some peculiar way the money becomes available and the grant is paid and the Minister can stand up and say: &ldquo;That grant was paid.&rdquo;  When he is questioned it is revealed that it was paid the day before the question was answered or two days after it was asked.  If the present Government, for whatever short time they will be here, are prepared to stand up to 100 or 150 questions on housing loans and grants being asked every day that these questions are to be taken, I guarantee to the Taoiseach that those questions will be put down.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Taoiseach has come in for the final stage of the debate.  I should like to know if he is aware of the situation in regard to factory closures.  There is a great song and dance about new factories opening and we are told what a great thing it is if a factory is opened, usually in the West of Ireland or occasionally near the area I represent on the Cavan or Monaghan border.  They do not build in County Meath because they do not get the grants they get in Cavan or Monaghan which are represented by people with sufficient influence to have them classified as undeveloped areas and they are, therefore, able to qualify for increased grants.  We do not hear of the factories that are closing.</P>
    <P>Navan has been known for many years as a furniture town but a couple of large furniture factories have closed there.  The last one to close was Crannac and the workers there decided to take steps to protect not only their jobs <Col N="1971" /> but an industry which had its roots in that town traditionally.  I am glad these workers have been successful but I want to ask the Taoiseach: if those workers could prove that they were in a position not only to keep their factory open and keep their jobs but to increase an export business which the factory had and thereby produce wealth for the nation, is there any explanation as to why, when factories are closing, no effort is made by any Government Department to see if there is a way to keep them open?</P>
    <P>I instanced here what I considered to be a scandalous case, a case where a factory closed putting 140 workers out of jobs.  Those workers signed on the labour exchange and on average they got over £10 per week and were entitled to get that sum for 12 months. Most of them had long service; they had about £25 per week and were entitled to 50 per cent of that in redundancy payments leaving them a net £22.50 a week for 12 months.  In addition, the State lost the production of the factory, lost social welfare insurance and lost the income tax which would have been paid by these workers. It is estimated that about £140,000 was lost in the first 12 months and that, over a little longer period when all the redundancy money had been paid, almost £250,000 of a loss would have accrued to the State.  That factory could have been kept open with a loan of £60,000.  Surely there is something wrong when something like that happens. That is a case I know of without reference to the many hundreds of factories that have closed without any explanation.</P>
    <P>The State should carry out, in the case of every substantial factory at least, a cost-benefit analysis to see if it is cheaper to keep the factory open or to close it.  If it is to be closed there should be a good reason and, if it is to be kept open, it does not matter who keeps it open.  The State must enter into this matter in a much bigger way.  I believe it is up to them to take control and run factories which some people want to be rid of in order to get some liquid assets and they do not mind about people who lose their <Col N="1972" /> livelihood as a result.  This situation is ludicrous and should not be allowed to continue.  I ask the Taoiseach to make some effort to remedy it.</P>
    <P>There are so many things which should be dealt with on this Estimate and such a short time to deal with them that I must omit quite a number of matters I had intended to deal with&mdash;I do not blame Deputy Burke. Apparently, no effort is being made to do anything about employment despite the fact that we had 80,000 unemployed last winter and now have about 68,000 and that, unlike other years, in June and July of this year when the normal trend in unemployment is downwards, we have an upward trend.  Surely something has gone seriously wrong.  Apparently, the State are not interested in doing something about it.  Yes, they have talked about a Fourth Programme of Economic Expansion, the Second Programme having died a natural death and the Third one being forgotten half-way through in case anybody would think of referring to it.  I suppose the Fourth one will not fare much better.</P>
    <P>When Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Local Government some years ago he used talk about crystal balls and he would look into the crystal ball to see what was happening. Apparently, he did not pass on the crystal ball to his successor.  The result is that the Taoiseach is unable to say what is going to happen next week. He had better buy himself a new crystal ball or get somebody in his Department to try to find out what is likely to happen.  Without talking about the EEC at all, it does look as if our industrial expansion has ceased and we are now running into a slide which must get greater as we come nearer to entry into Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said yesterday, and rightly so, that we contested the referendum against entry into the EEC, that we did everything we possibly could to prevent it.  We put the facts before the public and, while doing so, met and discussed with members of both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, and particularly with Fianna Fáil, various things which we believe <Col N="1973" /> would bring ruin to this country.  We got what they considered, and what the public considered, to be satisfactory answers.  The answers having been given and accepted by the public, we are now committed to entry into the EEC the very same as the other two parties are.  That having been said, however, it is rather a pity that those who are now striking notes of warning&mdash;I think that is the expression they are using&mdash;about things that can go wrong, should have had those notes of warning struck before the referendum took place.</P>
    <P>Surely the farmers of Cork who fatten pigs, as quite a number of them do, for a living should have been told there is no future for the bacon industry in this country in EEC conditions. They might as well have been told that because it is the truth.  Did they not hear the gentleman from Denmark who was interviewed on &ldquo;Farmers Forum&rdquo; on Radio Éireann just before the referendum, who explained that in Denmark there are 12 million pigs per year fattened and handled in 12 factories, each of which handles one million pigs.  When he was asked: What about expansion in the EEC?  he said: &ldquo;We hope to expand to 16 million.&rdquo; Then the interviewer, feeling he was on good ground, said: &ldquo;Does that mean there is a prospect for pig-fattening in Ireland in the EEC?&rdquo; The Danish gentleman was a little taken aback but he gave an answer, and I do not think it was the one that was expected, because he said: &ldquo;Any person in Ireland who is fattening more than 1,000 pigs per year will be all right, but if he is not I would advise him to get out of the business now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure they will be heartening words when they are eventually passed on to the people of Cork who are depending to a certain extent on the fattening of pigs for their livelihood, and when it really comes down to brass tacks I hope it will not be denied any longer and that the people will be told this.  The Government knew this before the referendum took place and did not go to the trouble of telling them this was so.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments has been going screwy for some time and I <Col N="1974" /> understand that the deficit for 1972 was expanding to around £70 million. I take a peculiar view of this, because the balance of payments deficit may not mean an awful lot to the ordinary man, but if the upward trend continues it is bound to cause concern, although the Government do not seem to be very concerned about it.</P>
    <P>As far as the whole question of investment in this country is concerned, there are some people who believe there should be some way whereby external assets should be brought back to this country.  I do not know how it could be done because most of it is held by private individuals or private concerns.  However, the Government themselves are responsible for generating the industrial expansion which will be necessary if the country is to continue at all but they are not doing anything about it and had not, indeed, until the timorous step taken this year by the Minister for Finance when he decided he would go for a deficit budget.  This was the first step in that direction, and, as I say, it was a timorous one.  Those of us who have been watching those figures over the years are satisfied that something similar to what happened over the past two years is bound to happen again.  I referred earlier to the question of the increases which are granted in wages and which are taken back by the Government in income tax.  In view of the amount of increased income tax which is being collected by the State I would suggest that when the Minister was going for the so-called deficit budget he was quite satisfied in his own mind that by the end of the year enough money will have come in&mdash;let us call it buoyancy of the revenue or anything else&mdash;to compensate for that and that we will have a balanced budget.  The unfortunate thing is that unless some effort is made by the State to accept that it is its responsibility to try to create full employment we will not have full employment.  Therefore if this Government do not accept that responsibility, and I am satisfied that this Government do not want to accept it, then they must get out and make room for a government which will be prepared to face up to this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> It has been stated on a number of occasions that State investment is perhaps greater in this country than in any other country except the Soviet Union.  That may be so, but it is the type of State investment we are not looking for.  We firmly believe that the State should be able to take up a great deal of the money which is uselessly spent on imports and spend it in this country, thus creating employment. I would refer, as I did on one previous occasion here, to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. A very substantial amount of equipment for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is required annually for replacements and expansion of the service.  Most of that is at present and will continue to be imported for no reason at all except that the Government have not decided that they could set up an industry which would manufacture this type of equipment and thereby make employment available.</P>
    <P>Time is running out so I want to conclude on this point.  Recently we had an example of muddling in this country which should never happen again.  We have, thank God, and have always had, a police force and an Army which have been loyal to the State, and, I hope it will long remain so.  However, last year the Garda were treated shamefully before eventually a report that was prepared gave them a promise of a little of what they were entitled to but which has not yet been fully implemented.  It has solved some of their problems but does not solve the problem at senior level and that is where it must now receive attention.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Army should have got an increase.  It should have been paid to them, not promised, many months ago.  It was only when there were threats, which should not be necessary, of unrest in the Forces, at a time when it is essential to keep the Defence Forces happy, that the Minister for Defence announced that an increase was being given.  Even the announcement being made officially by the Department was incorrect in its content and therefore caused a lot of extra trouble.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1976" /> Would the Taoiseach realise that both the Government party and the other two parties here are interested in keeping the ship floating, are interested in ensuring a happy and free Ireland, that they are interested in seeing things done in the correct way. He should realise that if he is prepared to say &ldquo;I want this done; it is in everybody's interest that it should be done&rdquo;, he can call on the support of both Fine Gael, I am sure, and ourselves in doing it.  However, if he shilly-shallies, makes double-meaning statements and suggests something which eventually turns out to be entirely different, he can hardly blame us if we wonder whether or not it is worth pursuing the matter any further or supporting him any further. We, therefore, say to him now: &ldquo;You are having a by-election in Cork.  Why not go the whole way?  Why not either dissolve the Dáil this evening and have a general election instead, or if you are not prepared to do that do as your predecessor did and say that if you lose Cork you will take it as evidence that the people are dissatisfied with your Government and test them in a general election.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil is now going into recess and this time there must be a real doubt as to whether it will meet again.  I propose to suggest in the remarks I am going to make that the various problems now facing the country, referred to in his speech by the Taoiseach, have produced a state of mind amongst the people which now make a change of Government absolutely imperative for their solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, we have the vista of Europe which now opens up in front of us.  It is not necessary to say now that in relation to Europe we face a period of very serious challenge but also we face an era abounding in opportunity.  It is essential for the survival of this country and our people that we go into Europe knowing the role we propose to play in the building of an entirely new international society.  We must also go into Europe confident in our ability to avail of the opportunities which Europe will provide.  This means that next year, in <Col N="1977" /> particular, from January 1973, those who lead and those who constitute the Government of this country must be known to have the people's loyalty and support and must be a united team portraying a dynamism and a confidence which can affect the outlook of the ordinary people of this country.</P>
    <P>Do the present Government provide that?  I do not believe they do.  I believe that the Taoiseach now leads a second rate team.  I am sorry to have to say that the ability and the competence of the personnel constituting this Government must be amongst the lowest in Europe.  This is not the kind of team that will give confidence to our people as we enter Europe.  This is not the kind of ministerial team that will expand and expound the kind of dynamism which our people require to enter with confidence into Europe and to avail of its opportunities.</P>
    <P>In relation to Europe it is too serious for us to face what is involved with a Government that is too long in office, that is tired and weary.  I believe in that respect also the need is there for new men and new ideas.  Europe is one problem but we also have what has been referred to I must say by almost every Deputy, very properly, in this debate, as the problem of incipient civil war in the North.</P>
    <P>The outbreak of violence, hatred, murder and arson have shocked our people and have caused dismay to people from other countries watching us.  Those of us living in this island appear to be a community divided and torn asunder by bitter divisions based on past events and of bitter religious bigotry.  All of us who have been engaged in politics over the past 50 years have known of the danger of this.  Let us not cod ourselves that this is something emerging now to our astonishment, surprise and dismay.</P>
    <P>All of us have a responsibility for not facing facts decades ago.  We have a responsibility for our double-thinking, double-dealing and double standards. Let us not forget that in the part of Ireland over which our tri-colour flies we made a blatant effort <Col N="1978" /> to establish a purely Gaelic state. Time and time again in the past by the things we said and the intolerance we displayed we have tried to assert that an Orangeman could not be an Irishman and we made it clear by the way we administered our affairs here that we were aiming for a Gaelic speaking Ireland, an Ireland which would only acknowledge the heritage and traditions of those who comprised the majority of the people on this island.</P>
    <P>Was that a mistake?  If it was let us frankly admit it now and get on with the job of healing the breaches which our actions in the past have created. That was not the only mistake.  We have a Constitution which asserts the rights of this Parliament to legislate for all of Ireland without regard to the views, the wishes, the ideals or the sentiments of those living at the moment in our Six Northern Counties. How does that assertion coincide with the declared policy by the Taoiseach that we seek only union with the will of the majority of those at present living in the North?  For years we down here have refused to recognise that on this island, as part of the humus of our community, there were people who came here historically from different strains, from a variety of backgrounds, and who held traditions which they regarded as sacred, who held ideas and views they were prepared to die for.  We consistently refused to recognise that fact and to recognise that our society and our community is essentially pluralistic in origin.</P>
    <P>Who can forget that an evening paper yesterday carried a banner headline: &ldquo;Gardaí Protect Orangemen&rdquo;, instead of acknowledging the fact that every man, no matter what his creed, his background or his ideals may be, is essentially and fundamentally an Irishman and that the divisions we talk about are divisions between Irishmen who should have and share a common responsibility in the future of this island.  These are the things we have done to ourselves. These are the mistakes we have made in the past.  Let the blame be shared by all of us because there is none of us who is a Simon Pure in this respect <Col N="1979" /> and there is not one of us who can look at the record and say: &ldquo;At least I was not one of those.&rdquo;  We all were. But this is changing now.  The question is whether it is changing too late.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Government now asserts&mdash;each time he speaks a little more emphatically, each time he speaks a little more explicitly&mdash;on behalf of the Irish people that down here we do not seek unity by violence, by force, that we only seek the re-union of our people with the consent, the agreement, the co-operation and generous support of the majority of the people who live in the North.</P>
    <P>I give credit to the Taoiseach for so speaking.  I give credit to the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party for saying that, because this was not the policy of Fianna Fáil.  Let us recognise that. Deputy Blaney who spoke here today could speak with conviction when he assailed these views as not representing the Fianna Fáil Party in which he grew up, and in which so many others grew up, but the credit is that the change is there and that they now speak the kind of good sense and pure patriotism that, if it had been spoken 50 years ago, we might not have seen the birth of partition and division and, indeed, might not have seen the bitterness of a civil war that caused so much bloodshed and suffering to our people.</P>
    <P>Of course this view honestly expressed by the Taoiseach, and now supported by the vast majority of the Fianna Fáil Party and by the members of the Government, has not been expressed without its cost, without a price which had to be paid in dismissals of Ministers and resignations of Ministers, in sackings from the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party.  All this was a price that had to be paid for a fundamental change in policy and change in outlook. What is the present position?  I suppose I can say, as a Fianna Fáil watcher, that probably now an uneasy peace has eventually been arrived at inside the ranks of Fianna Fáil.  Probably the position now is that so far as the Government are concerned they now constitute a coalition based on the common instinct of over self-preservation and designed to tide the transition <Col N="1980" /> between this and the next election. That coalition exists between the old guard Fianna Fáil Republicans and the supporters of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>That is as it may be but here again in relation to our common problem, the problem in the North of Ireland, its future and what may emerge, can we afford a continuance of such a Government in office?  Can we afford a continuance of a situation in which necessarily, if not the Taoiseach, certain other members of the Fianna Fáil Government, must speak with double tongue in order to assuage the ruffled feelings of those who never knew the truth.  Can we afford the continuance of a situation which may make possible double standards in government in relation to a matter so important as the survival of our community and of those of us who live on this island.</P>
    <P>I, as an Irishman, with feeling, share with every Deputy who has spoken here, from the Fianna Fáil benches, from the Labour benches and from my own benches, the condemnation of what has been happening over the last 12 or 18 months in the North of Ireland.  I want to say that if the harm now being done by the IRA, by the Provisionals&mdash;I do not mind what they call themselves&mdash; by these gunmen, to the cause of Irish unity is to be curtailed and diminished and reduced it is essential that we have in office in this part of Ireland a united and strong Government that can speak clearly without hesitation and whose Leader has not to think before he speaks.  If we do not achieve that there is a very grave danger that those misguided men may feel that somewhere in Dublin, in the Government, they still have friends. We cannot forget that much of what has taken place in the last two years in Belfast and in Derry would have been avoided, and certainly would not have continued, were it not for the common belief that it represented at least the view of a number of Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>In relation to the North of Ireland, just as in relation to Europe, the situation of this country and the welfare of its people requires and necessitates <Col N="1981" /> a change in Government.  Look at our economy.  Look at our domestic situation. Look at the ordinary matters relating to the bread and butter of the people.  Look at how, in relation to discharging their responsibility as a Government, this Government have cared for the ordinary people.  Inflation has been referred to.  We have had continuing and violent inflation marked with high unemployment.  We have had a series of stop-go policies in relation to economic activity.  Looking back on all of this, it is becoming more and more apparent that the period since the last general election has been marked spectacularly by the consistency of this Government in failing to deliver the goods.  There has been an absence of policy and programming and the only consistency has been in failure.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford a continuance of that kind of situation.  How is our economy ever to expand to provide a way of life for our people, to provide a home and a job for every one of our young people, how can that hope be held out to them if from the Government, from the Government's Ministers, there is nothing but evidence of muddling, spasmodic thinking and a complete failure to plan or hold out a programme?</P>
    <P>We had an effort some 18 months ago, a last minute effort, conceived in haste, to bring in some form of control in relation to prices and wages and incomes and the very moment people asked what did this mean it was dropped like a hot potato by the Minister for Finance.  We have had another effort at controlling prices and in particular one felt in relation to social needs that the price of houses and the cost of houses to people might well be controlled but that went out of the legislation.  Why?  Was it because the silent men in the back rooms of power objected to that kind of control?</P>
    <P>We have had recently an example of an obstinate Minister surrounded by advice from bureaucrats refusing to recognise, in these days of inflation and of rising prices, the sanity of zero-rating food under the VAT proposals. What does this indicate to the people? <Col N="1982" /> It indicates a team of Ministers whose only common bond is the fact that they are all Ministers and all members of Fianna Fáil but they do not act as a team.  There does not appear to be a policy which binds them together. There does not appear to be an aim towards which they are directing their efforts.  There is no goal ahead for Fianna Fáil.  It is mark-time and stay in office as long as you can, boys.  Can we afford this kind of Government? Look at the result on the lives of the people.  Altered though the names may be, no matter how the appearance may have been changed a bit, we are still carrying on with a standard of health services which came straight from the last century.  We still carry on in relation to the health of the people on the basis that want must be established before the State recognises an obligation.</P>
    <P>We have not yet learned the lesson which every other country in Western Europe learned after the last war, that a community survives by community effort and that there is a common responsibility on every person in each community to help to shoulder the problem of his neighbour.  We from these benches over the years have preached the necessity for health insurance, for providing a comprehensive scheme of medical services based on community insurance.  That has been tinkered with in the last couple of years but there has been no step forward towards providing a fundamental improvement in the standard of our health services.  How could there be when there is not a united Government with a clear policy ahead of it?  How could there be when Fianna Fáil are so formed and constituted that they believe that what was done under the Health Acts of 1953 and around that period remains static Fianna Fáil policy?</P>
    <P>In relation to health services, in relation to social welfare services for the raising of standards of our people, the provision of income related benefits and of proper family allowance&mdash;all these things which other countries are constantly aiming to achieve and improve&mdash;we are doing nothing.  We have not even faced up to the one <Col N="1983" /> question that every citizen of Ireland living in Belfast or Derry will ask you: what will happen if we go into the Republic?  What about the social welfare standards?  We have not even begun to think along those lines.</P>
    <P>This, Sir, is because we have in office a Government the personnel of which&mdash;they are all decent men; they are all fine men; individually they have their own gifts and so on&mdash; taken together, is a second division team and that is not good enough for Ireland now that we are playing in the first division.  We need a better team of Ministers if we are to survive and if our people are to have their problems dealt with.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Europe.  I mentioned the North.  I mentioned the domestic front.  I believe that the result of the emergence of these problems, the result of the failure of this Government properly to face up to them, has resulted in a feeling&mdash;and I regret to have to say this&mdash;a feeling of disillusionment amongst our people today, disillusionment with the Government&mdash;that is understandable and may I say as an Opposition Deputy, perhaps tolerable&mdash;but that disillusionment has extended further than that. There is today, I regret to say, a disillusionment with the functioning of democracy itself.  Our people are losing heart.  They are losing heart at what has taken place, particularly in the last two and a half years since the last general election.  From the heights of Government itself we have seen very, very low standards in these high places and this has caused a reaction, a reaction against the Government initially and a reaction against the functioning of democracy itself.</P>
    <P>There are those who have tried to batten on this reaction, those who have tried to turn young people, and older people too, in disgust against not merely how democracy has functioned in this country but against the institutions of the State itself.  Thanks be to God, that effort has not been accompanied with any significant degree of success and&mdash;it has been correctly referred to here&mdash;the spectacle of Irish <Col N="1984" /> people, in the name of Ireland, attacking Irish soldiers at the Curragh is a matter of shame on anyone who conceived such a result.</P>
    <P>But there exist at the moment in our society real areas of danger and there are a number of agents very avid to make these conditions worse.  As I say, this has been contributed to largely by disillusionment with the Government and by the conduct of this Government since the last general election.  The people today do not know where this Government stand. They recognise now that this Government have been too long in office, too long there.</P>
    <P>It is well to recall to the people outside that the Fianna Fáil Party have now been continuously in office for 15 years and that prior to that they were in office for a total of 19 years.  For all the things which have happened in this country over well-nigh the last 40 years, and for all the things which have not happened, all the hopes that have been blighted, all the bitter disappointments that the people have suffered, the blame lies largely at the feet of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Today the ordinary citizen of this country does not know where the Government stand nor do they know who controls the Government.  Is it the Civil Service?  Is it bureaucracy? Does the Taoiseach merely read out speeches prepared for him by a civil servant?  Who writes his speeches? Where do they come from?  Are they expressing the faith, conviction and belief of the Taoiseach himself, or are they an agreed formula from time to time to declare what is commonly agreed on among disparate elements?</P>

      <P>At this moment, is there a liaison committee at the back of the Government contriving to keep the difficult Fianna Fáil dissidents in line, and at what a price? On what grounds?  On what conditions? Who controls Fianna Fáil? There ought to be no such question asked.  It ought to be clear in this Dáil that the people have a government, rightly or wrongly, that carries their confidence and retains their trust. This was not the Fianna Fáil Party which the people voted for in 1969. Let us remember the boasters&mdash;a united party, the party of reality. Where are the absent men?  Where is Kevin Boland?  Where is Neil Blaney? Where is Charles Haughey?  Where are all the others that composed the government which was elected in June, 1969?  Do the men who are now in government speak with the same tongue?  Do they act in the same way? Do they represent the policy and the promises and the programmes which were put before the people in the last general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have to face Europe and to provide hope for the unfortunate, suffering people in Belfast, Derry and elsewhere in the North of Ireland, if we have to provide for our own people here at home an assurance that it would be the continuing aim of Government every day in every way to improve our own country and to make things better for Irishmen and women to live and to work in, and if we are to restore confidence in democracy, there must be for the people a real prospect of a change in government.  Responsibility rests on those to whom the people look to make this possible.  We are all Irishmen here in this Dáil in all political parties.  We have been called to political action.  A vocation and dedication to the giving of service, often service that is not recognised, <Col N="1986" /> exists in each of us.  In all of the political parties each of us endeavours to do his best to make his contribution to the improvement of our country. Those who serve in Fianna Fáil and those who serve in the present Government and who have served for many years have done their best as Irishmen to help to improve our country.  But that is what is behind us.  Now there is need for a change.  There is a need for fresh minds and for new men to give the people new heart and new hope in the work of government.  I hope that in the weeks and months that he ahead this message will be carried to every part of Ireland.</P>

      <P>As anticipated, this debate inevitably covered a very wide field.  I indicated at the outset that I would try to meet and answer as many points as I could.  I did not sit in during all the speeches but I got a report of their content.  It would be very difficult for me in the time at my disposal to deal with every point made, but I will endeavour to deal with as many points as I can.</P>
      <P>It was inevitable as a result of the times that are in it that the situation in the North of Ireland would be very much highlighted in the course of the debate.  I will try to deal later with some of the points made in that context. While I was sitting in during Deputy Tully's speech he made an allegation which repeated one made yesterday by Deputy Corish with regard to speeches made by me before and during the referendum campaign.  The Deputy alleged that at no time did I give the people any indication that there were certain problems and certain dangers inherent in our membership of the EEC and that certain difficulties might have to be met, particularly by industry.  It was suggested that only now that the referendum is behind us am I referring to problems or difficulties which might arise as a result of EEC membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I want to reject completely any suggestion to this effect.  I consistently enunciated the view, which I repeated yesterday, that EEC membership held out the best prospects of attaining our development objectives, <Col N="1987" /> but I warned that successes would not be universal nor automatic.  I have checked the record on this point.  I want to say that from the beginning of the year up to 10th May I made something over 20 speeches in all dealing with the EEC.  Not all of these speeches contained warnings about the problems or difficulties that membership would entail because their context did not on occasion lend itself to such remarks.  In dealing with the general aspects, such as sovereignty, it would not have been appropriate to digress into warnings about vulnerable enterprises or industries, but in the set of speeches which dealt with industrial or employment prospects I find in each one of them there is a warning of obstacles likely to arise and necessary to overcome in relation to such subjects as industry and employment. For example&mdash;I want to say this deliberately in order to nail this suggestion; I will not call it a lie because I would not be within the rules of order-but, to nail this unfounded suggestion, I give as one example what I said when I was speaking in this House on March 21st, two months before the Referendum.  I said:</P>
    <P>I am not seeking to play down the difficulties which would have to be overcome in some sectors.  The Government have never pretended that the structure of industry would remain unaffected by the transition from a highly protected market to free trading conditions.  In fact, they have over the years spared no effort to facilitate this transition both by encouraging existing industry to adapt to a changing environment and by new export based industries on a large scale.  Notwithstanding all that has been done there are likely to be some losses.</P>
    <P>Was that not a warning or was it something that Deputy Corish and Deputy Tully could dismiss?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When I opened the <Col N="1988" /> Referendum campaign on April 17 I said this:</P>
      <P>We have never denied that free trade will cause problems for some firms for, over the years, we have used money, time and energy in making Irish firms more efficient so that they could compete with imports. These efforts have had a great deal of success but, again, we would not deny that some firms still need to do more.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the poll, I said in a statement in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 7th May:</P>
      <P>The Government have never pretended that membership of the EEC will not lead to some economic difficulties. There will, for example, be an increase in the cost of some foods, principally beef and butter, and some industries will suffer, but these difficulties must be weighed against the economic advantages of membership.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I have dealt with this point at too much length, but I have quoted these excerpts because not only Deputy Corish and Deputy Tully but other Opposition speakers frequently make allegations which cannot be substantiated. There were several other examples, in fact, in the course of the debate to which I need not refer but, if I had time to deal with them, I can assure the House that I could establish that there is no substance whatever in the careless generalisations in which some Opposition members frequently indulge.</P>

    <P>The question of landing rights was raised by Deputy O'Donnell.  I know he is deeply interested and involved in this subject.  I refer to the landing rights for USA airlines in Dublin. Deputy O'Donnell alleged, as he has done before, that a deal had already been made, a deal which would be <Col N="1989" /> announced after the Dáil had adjourned for the Summer Recess.  Again I want categorically to deny that allegation. It was made by other people too on the eve of the referendum, people who had a vested interest of one kind or another in the defeat of the Referendum proposal.  I do not have to elaborate on who they are, but I want to say that no deal whatever has been made and no agreement has been reached with the Americans.  Discussions have been going on in an endeavour to reach a solution, but it is not possible at this stage to say when a decision will be arrived at.</P>

    <P>Several speakers, including Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish, referred to the forthcoming legislation on value-added tax.  Deputy O'Higgin's also referred to it.  The Deputies alleged that it would mean an increase in prices, especially food prices. Again, I want to reject these suggestions. Every Deputy must know that basically the switch to turnover tax will simply mean a switch from the existing turnover and wholesale taxes which presently affect food.  There is no reason, therefore, why the changeover should lead to any increase in prices.  This is especially the case with food where there is no change in the <Col N="1990" /> present position.  In contrast, some suggestions have been made from the Opposition benches to the effect that food should be exempted so that taxation on non-food items would, therefore, be increased.  This would obviously mean changes in all prices with increases in the majority of cases. I think it is well to remember that the poor and the not-so-poor, the middle-income group, who buy food also like to indulge in the modest luxuries of having a drink or a smoke and perhaps buying a transistor radio or a television.</P>

      <P>Changing all prices at a time when many prices are rising anyway would, for other reasons, as the Deputy well knows, create conditions in which the upward pressure of prices would increase.  These would also be the conditions in which it would be most difficult to supervise or control all price changes in order to ensure that any tax reductions were passed on in full to the consumer.  It is for this reason the Minister for Finance pointed out that the passing on of all tax reductions could not be guaranteed, and for the Deputy to allege this means Government incompetence is, I think, unworthy of him. He ought to know better.  I am sure he does.  He knows perfectly well that any administration in any democratic society, if faced with a similar proposal to change prices, could not guarantee the precise outcome because, <Col N="1991" /> as he well knows, it would take an army of officials to supervise all transactions.</P>
      <P>While I am on prices, perhaps I could refer to what Deputy Cosgrave said.  He said that, as a result of value-added tax, there would be an increase in prices because decimalisation did cause some increase in prices.  I do not deny that, but I do deny that the introduction of decimalisation was itself the sole cause, though it is a fact it was utilised and exploited by some people.</P>

Deputy Cosgrave said that decimalisation had caused an explosion in prices and that statistics could be produced to support that claim.  I would ask the Deputy what statistics he is speaking of?  Prices increased in 1971 but there was no explosion because the increase was at a lesser rate than the rate for 1970.  It was a 9 per cent increase as opposed to 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>We do not have to look very far for an explanation as to why prices increased in those two years. In 1970 workers 'wages increased by about 17 per cent and by about 13 per cent last year.  Everybody knows that such large increases in labour costs must inevitably affect prices.  There is no use in pretending otherwise.  I mention this point not only for the benefit of Deputy Cosgrave but for the benefit also of Deputy Keating, who criticised attempts to create the impression that wage costs were the main cause of <Col N="1992" /> inflation I am not trying to say something against the interest of workers that is not capable of being established. I know this view is accepted widely but if Deputy Keating does not accept my word for it, I would refer him to the ICTU document which was presented on this subject at their recent conference in Galway.  It is said in this document, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Trade unions cannot escape from the dilemma posed by the vicious spiral of prices-incomes, prices-incomes escalating in turn, that the gap between increases in income and the growth of national production (in 1971 incomes increased by 13 per cent while GNP increased by only 3 per cent) has not been the sole cause of rising prices but that it has, unquestionably, been a major and persistent cause.</P>
      <P>The document goes on to say that the National Prices Commission put it very well in one of its reports when it stated that:</P>
      <P>It was quite clear that increases in money incomes unmatched by improvements in efficiency are the main causes of price increases.  It is not possible to get a quart from a pint pot, when the quart is nevertheless sought.  Price increases are the mechanism that force people to make do with the pint that is the limit of the pot's capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suppose Deputy Keating would take the word of the ICTU on this question if he is not prepared to take my word.  I shall depart now from the economic side of the debate and refer to the suggestion made by Deputy Cosgrave yesterday when he tried to create the impression that my statement that the Government were resolved not to allow private armies use our territory to impose their will either on the people of Northern Ireland or on the people of this part of the country, represented a change in attitude on the part of the Government to those engaging in subversive activities.  I reject totally that suggestion whether it comes from Deputy Cosgrave or from anybody else.  The policy of this Government towards private armies and subversive groups has been firm and unambiguous.  The Government have <Col N="1993" /> not hesitated to take effective action against such groups immediately it became clear that such action was necessary in order to deal effectively with them.</P>

      <P>Successive Fianna Fáil Governments, including the present Government, have never lacked the strength and determination or the political courage to take whatever steps were necessary to protect the State and its institutions and to uphold its laws.  I would remind Fine Gael that the preservation of the rule of law is not something which was invented by them or which is their sole prerogative.  It is time they stopped pretending it was.  Of course, Deputy L'Estrange is one of the great defenders of the institutions.  Regularly he alleges that the Government are not doing enough but I would like to ask this great caller-of-bluff what more would he or his Party do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of violence for any political purpose was condemned rightly on all sides during the course of the debate.  In this part of my contribution I propose to direct my remarks to those who are pursuing violent means in the cause of Irish unity in the North of Ireland.  However, in referring to them, I do not wish in any way to suggest that they are the only ones who are engaged in violence.  I would ask those people who seek to unite Ireland by violence if they really want a united Ireland.  Do they know what a united Ireland means?  Do they not realise that a united Ireland means a united Irish population?  Not only are the perpetrators of violence driving the population further apart but they are putting off further the <Col N="1994" /> day of reconciliation.  Also, they are playing into the hands of the extreme and militant Unionists.</P>
    <P>These Unionists are represented on such bodies as the UDA who, as the IRA know well, will exploit every situation for their own ends, the principal one of which is continued Unionist domination and continued suppression of the minority, for example, as we saw on Sunday week last, the denial of houses to those who were justly and legally entitled to them.  If those people who use that violence stop and think they must arrive at the same conclusion at which any objectively minded person would arrive; or, if they have arrived at this conclusion, are they, instead, coldly, calculatedly and deliberately trying to drive the North into full-scale civil war?  If that is the case they are flying in the face of reason and in the face of the great majority of those whom they purport to protect, those whose yearning for peace has been manifested many times.  They refused to listen to the women whose homes they say they protect, the women-for-peace who, with their families, have to bear the agony, the suffering and, indeed, bereavements in their families.  These women played an important part in bringing about the short-lived truce and are now desperately trying to restore it.  We saw them in the precincts of this House during the week but so far as I know the people who support, guide and, perhaps, decide on the type of violence that is being carried on in the North refused to see these women.</P>
    <P>I said yesterday that those who pursued violence should be denied support and resources.  I said also that we must speak out clearly and dispel any romanticism or idealism which may surround this violence.  Appeals to history or any roll call of the patriots of the past do not legitimise squalid acts of bloodshed.  It is an insult to the Irish leaders of the past to link their names with these acts of violence.  It is a travesty to try to equate any motives of the men and women of the 1916-21 period with the motives of those who prolong the present agony.  If violence is pursued to the point of provoking <Col N="1995" /> civil strife in the North, I should like to tell those who do so that they need expect no support, no resources and no symathy from here or from anybody in this part of the country whom we represent in this House.</P>
    <P>We have had our civil war.  Some people in the House remember it; most of us do not, but we all know what its consequences were.  Those who were involved in it on one side or another have, in the intervening 50 years, to some extent or another in one constructive way or another, contributed to the healing of the wounds, personal, mental, social and economic of the civil war.  They have passed on to us a high standard of toleration&mdash;I think it is no longer necessary to make the claim that we do value toleration in this country.  They have also passed on to us the true principles and practice of Republican democracy and they have given us, no matter what we say among ourselves, a sound and progressive economy.</P>
    <P>We do not want, nor will we permit by act or omission, these wounds to be torn open again or our democratic institutions or economic structures to be torn down.  The strife in the North has already caused enough economic damage not only to the people of the North but to us here also.  The jobs of workers, Catholic and Protestant, in the North have been literally bombed out of existence.  Industrial investment, North and South, has been retarded and the tourist trade of both parts of the country has been seriously damaged.  To sum up on this, violence has destroyed jobs and job opportunities and has thereby denied thousands of ordinary men and women a decent means of livelihood both North and South.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of violence I should like to refer to the incident after the Orange parade in St. Johnston, County Donegal.  I have not yet got the details or a full report of what happened there but I want to say to the people of St. Johnston, no matter what religion they profess, that adequate security forces are now available to ensure the security of their lives and their property.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To come to the Northern subject in general, it has been suggested that I share the view&mdash; at least by implication&mdash;that we have a right here to dispose of the Northern majority over their heads in negotiation with England.  Almost anything can be implied or imputed to anyone but I want to deny that allegation.  It would have been considerably more useful to have described where and when I suggested anything quite so extraordinary: in fact, I have said exactly the opposite.  It has also been suggested that my disapproval of a plebiscite on the Border in the North in some way contradicts the Government's policy that Irish unity is to be sought by agreement.  I want to say emphatically that it does nothing of the sort.</P>
      <P>My main objection to a plebiscite is&mdash;and I think it was stated here from the other side of the House&mdash;that it purports to give one section of the Irish people a right of decision on a question that affects the country as a whole.  In so far as it is the Government's policy to seek areas of agreement between North and South which would lead by gradual stages to agreement on unity itself, it is completely consistent with this that we should oppose a step which we believe leads in exactly the opposite direction.  I mentioned that I had other objections also.  It is claimed, for example, that plebiscites in the North about the Border would take the issue out of Northern politics.  I know of no firm foundation for such a claim; indeed I believe the opposite can be readily demonstrated.  We are told that the positive reason for a plebiscite is to reassure the Northern majority.  It seems to me that it is the Northern minority who have suffered most since 1920 and have suffered in the last few years, the last few months and even in the last few weeks and that the minority also&mdash;perhaps even more so &mdash;need assurance.  Adequate assurances have already been given to the majority, time and again, including the assurance of my Government that our policy is to obtain Irish unity by agreement and not by force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1997" /> May I say to Deputy O'Higgins that this is no new-found policy.  It is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and there is no member of the Fianna Fáil Party now who disagrees in one iota with that policy.  Even Deputy Dr. O'Brien, when speaking today, referred to a speech by Mr. de Valera, subsequently Leader of Fianna Fáil, in the Dáil in 1921 in the Secret Debates, in which he ruled out any question of force in relation to unity in the North.  That has been Fianna Fáil policy consistently since 1921.  It has also been suggested, more particularly, I think, by Deputy Dr. O'Brien, that to talk about Irish unity as the only solution encourages civil war.  Again, in so far as this might be imputed to me, I should prefer that the whole question to which Deputy Dr. O'Brien referred and which I have used frequently, and not only in the article in the magazine, <i>&ldquo;Foreign Affairs&rdquo;,</i> should be used.  I said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I consider that the only solution is an Ireland united by agreement in independence.</P>
    <P>In this connection the words &ldquo;by agreement&rdquo; are deliberate and meaningful. I do not believe that the idea taken as a whole should drive anyone to have recourse to arms; on the contrary, it is an invitation to the conference table.</P>
    <P>There are others who feel that no reference should be made to unity when talking of affairs in the North. I do not share that view.  It is widely known, both at home and abroad, that there is a strong desire for a united Ireland among the people of the South and amongst the great majority of the Irish people as a whole.  If, then, we were to remain silent so that all references to unity were left to men of violence, this, to my mind, would be open to the dangerous interpretation that we shared not alone this goal of unity but that we were also acquiescing in the violent means being used allegedly to promote it. The sublety of silence would be lost in the clamour and confusion of the exploding bombs and the unseen bullets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> The need is to make clear that we have not as a people suddenly changed our basic attitudes and aspirations; nobody would believe us if we tried to pretend this.  In the same way we do not believe, nor do we expect, the Northern people to surrender their traditions or loyalties whatever the pressures might be.  Progress in understanding and in respecting one another demands that we be capable of speaking plainly and honestly when necessary and at present it is surely necessary that we should speak plainly to disassociate ourselves from violence in any form.  There are also those who appear to expect that plain speaking will demand that we should attempt to set out in detail our views on the course of future progress.  A leader writer in a newspaper today, it seems to me, made a suggestion of that nature.</P>
    <P>On this I should like to say that, while it is desirable and necessary to indicate one's basic position, there is no merit in attempting to dictate the course which future events might follow.  Indeed, part of the problem of the North is that there is too great a tendency already to enunciate positions from which people are unable or unwilling to depart.  Progress in understanding and resolving common problems requires not alone plain speaking and honesty but, when necessary, calls also for an ability and willingness to adapt oneself to changes, changes which may necessarily form part of progress.</P>
    <P>In this connection I claim no novelty for the suggestion I made in the course of the debate yesterday of a regional form of administration for the North of Ireland.  It must now be obvious even to the most intransigent Unionists that Stormont as it has existed will not re-emerge.  I envisage the regional administration emerging only after discussions between the interests concerned.  While a necessary preliminary must be reconciliation, I have said again and again that the interests I have in mind are the legitimate representatives of both Northern communities and the representatives of the Governments in Dublin and Westminster.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> I would be prepared now or next week or as soon as ever possible to take part in such discussions, but I believe that to take a rigid position in advance of these discussions would prejudice even their being started. The minority in the North will not accept Government by Unionists and this cannot be reimposed on the situation. They demand, and must be guaranteed, the right to work peacefully towards Irish unity.  On the other hand, there is no intention&mdash;and may I repeat it again and again&mdash;of imposing unity on the majority of the North by force.  The British Government have inferred that they will not stand in the way of unity between North and South.  For my part I have suggested that they should go further and encourage such an agreement rather than obstruct that agreement by policies that I believe are not intended to have that effect.</P>
    <P>Within these considerations it should not be beyond the wit and skill of political leadership in the North, in London and here to consult together to find a means of eliminating the violence, of creating a regional administration in the North from which no options are excluded and of moving in the direction of a permanent accommodation in the country as a whole. Time is not on the side of peace.  We must move quickly and convincingly in the time we have left.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins, whose speech we heard a few minutes ago, tried to disparage the capacity and capability of the members of this Government, individually and collectively.  Others have tried to do it too, but I would say to Deputy O'Higgins and Fine Gael that, man for man, Minister for shadow Minister, we are prepared to match them at any time, and we will be here a long time.  However, I shall come back to this in another way in a few minutes.  He made allegations, first of all, that we had no policy that would bind us, that our actions are the result of <i>ad hoc</i> policies dictated by bureaucrats, that even the thoughts in our speeches are formulated and our speeches themselves written on our behalf.  If that is the case, the people <Col N="2000" /> of Ireland must be very guillible indeed because we have proceeded in the present Government as Fianna Fáil have done for the past 40 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said we have no policy that will bind us together.  This is an interesting remark coming from Deputy O'Higgins who is a member of a party whose policy changed, not only from general election to general election, but from by-election to by-election. But what are the prospects for a policy that will bind the new-found coalition together?  I noticed nothing in Deputy O'Higgins's speech that would indicate that they in Fine Gael were ready, willing and able to form a one-party Government, a very notable omission.  Of course it is hardly surprising, in that, as soon as Deputy Corish said his party were prepared to go into coalition, Deputy Cosgrave described it as a dramatic development &mdash;dramatic, I suppose, because there at last he saw a chance of Fine Gael getting back into Government, realising they could not do it alone, realising that the people of Ireland had rejected them as a single party so often that they now must have recourse to the Labour Party.  I said in a television or radio interview subsequently that we have always said that it is before, and not after, an election that the people should be told of the imminence of a coalition.  But that is not enough.  That suggested coalition should formulate its policies before the election.</P>

As Deputies opposite know, we in the Government party have to keep our Deputies here to maintain the business of the House while Opposition Deputies are free to go to any part of their constituency they like.
