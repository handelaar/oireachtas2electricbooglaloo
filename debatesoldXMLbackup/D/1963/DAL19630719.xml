      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I gave notice that I wanted to raise two issues and two issues only.  The two issues are matters which were referred to by Deputy O.J. Flanagan.  I have in my possession a copy of the actual minutes, Sir, which I showed to you yesterday.  In one statement, Deputy O. J. Flanagan said:</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister for Finance heard the rumours afloat in this city that both Deputy Sherwin and Deputy Leneghan got £3,500 for their votes?  That is the rumour in this city and I want the Minister to tell the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Interruptions followed.  I want to say, in connection with that statement by Deputy O.J. Flanagan, that he might as well have said £1 million because there is not a word of truth in it.  I do not believe there were any such rumours and, even if there were, it would not justify a Deputy in coming in here and talking in that fashion.  All persons and Parties are subject to such rumours by Opposition individuals in the city.  It is common knowledge that Daniel O'Connell was supposed to have a bastard in every village in the Kingdom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan had no grounds for making the statement.  There was not a word of truth in it.  I submit he did it solely because foul-mouthed people outside would repeat it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with that. I shall now deal with the next remark which Deputy O.J. Flanagan made. This is a more serious remark because the implications are graver.  Here is what he said, according to this copy of the report of the proceedings which I have:</P>
      <P>Again, in connection with this Bill &mdash;the Finance Bill&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;there is a rumour widely circulating in this House that Deputy Sherwin has been given an IRA pension&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the type of pension has no qualification&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;which is retrospective for the past four or five years.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&ldquo;in connection with this Bill&rdquo;: in other words, because I would agree to vote for this Bill, I would get a pension. There is not a word of truth in it.  However, I want to explain that I have been an applicant for a disability pension for the past 30 years.  I have been before four medical boards in St. Bricin's Hospital.  In fact, I should have had the pension since 1937.  That I have not the pension is due to my own folly because I did not apply for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, when things got financially bad with me in 1944, when I found myself on relief, down and out, I decided I would apply for it.  I was then told it was too late, that the statutory period had passed.  I had already been informed that I would have qualified with no trouble at all. Therefore, three years ago, I decided I would apply again because I found <Col N="1523" /> myself in the position that I had no business, no income, nothing except this Dáil allowance on which, as you all know, when all expenses are deducted, you could not live.  I realised that owing to my age and because politics are not certain, I could find myself back on relief again.</P>
    <P>I have been crippled for 40 years and all the evidence is in Coláiste Caoimhghín.  I cannot work.  The evidence from seven hospitals and five medical experts and numerous lay witnesses is there.  I decided I would apply again.  I wrote to the Minister for Defence in 1959 and again in 1961 before the last elections.  I am prepared to give all the evidence to any inquiry. I received a reply in March, 1961, that is, six months before there were any elections, that the matter would be considered&mdash;an amendment of the Bill to allow me to make my claim would be made.  All this has no connection whatsoever with this Bill.</P>
    <P>A year ago, a Bill was passed by this House amending the pensions code which allowed certain people, if the evidence was sufficient to justify it, to make an application.  All the Fine Gael Party are aware of this Bill.  I actually discussed it with some members. Some members of the Fine Gael Party are aware of that situation, including Deputy O'Keeffe, the former Lord Mayor.  It would have been no trouble to Deputy O.J. Flanagan to turn around and to ask about the matter and to be told that it had nothing to do with this business at all.</P>
    <P>I want it to be known that last January I underwent an exhaustive medical examination.  The medical board&mdash;doctors, not the Government&mdash; decided I was suffering from a serious disability and that I was entitled to a wound award arising out of wounds inflicted on me in 1922.  Because I did not agree with the terms of it, I refused to accept it.  I refused to sign any documents and I sent it back.  The same award was not retrospective.</P>
    <P>In other words, what was said about this pension has no connection with this Bill.  It was something which was done long before the Bill was ever here. <Col N="1524" /> It relates solely to my injuries which I can prove and which have been accepted by a medical board.  Therefore, there is no truth in Deputy O.J. Flanagan's statement that I got anything whatsoever in connection with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have never received as much as a stamp for my services in 40 years and, in connection with the Party opposite who are now in Government, I have never had any consultations with them about the Bill.  If I got anything, I got a bottle of minerals from Deputy J. Brennan.  That is as much as I ever got.</P>
    <P>I want to say this, that I did receive offers from the Opposition, not direct offers.  I could have been Lord Mayor of Dublin, if I had wished.  It was offered to me on a plate.  However, I want to object on behalf of all disabled IRA men because of the implication made in this statement.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan came in here the other night and threw all the muck he could against me and <Col N="1525" /> some other Deputies.  He said there was a rumour that I had got £3,500 from Fianna Fáil for my vote.  Since I came in to this House, I have never discussed with any member of Fianna Fáil the matter of voting one way or the other.  I meet Deputy Calleary 40 times a day and I stay in this city with him but the question of how my vote was to go has never been discussed between us.  I have voted strictly in accordance with my conscience because I know well that the people to whom I have to give an account of my stewardship are the people of my own constituency and I would be very short of memory if I did not remember the day when there was not one employed man in that constituency.</P>
      <P>I was not asked by one member of the Fianna Fáil Party to vote one way or the other and I was offered no favours.  The other people sent everybody in the country to threaten, bribe, cajole and intimidate me into voting their way.  That is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to provide for the further financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. the finances of which are provided at present under the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. Acts, 1959 and 1961.  The main provisions of the Bill are:</P>
      <P>(i)  to increase from £3,000,000 to £4,000,000 the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares of the company;</P>
      <P>(ii)  to increase from £1,250,000 to £2,000,000 the aggregate amount of grants, voted annually, which may be made to the company;</P>
      <P>(iii)  to increase from £400,000 to £2,000,000 the existing statutory limit on repayable advances by the Minister for Finance for housing purposes; and</P>
      <P>(iv)  to provide for the payment to the company of grants for houses in line with grants normally payable under the Housing Acts and also for the payment of housing subsidies.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be well aware of the functions of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company which is charged, generally, with promoting the welfare of Shannon Airport, with particular emphasis on the encouragement of commercial, industrial and trading enterprises at the Airport.  While the stimulation of passenger and freight traffic through the Airport remains a primary concern of the company, it was realised at an early stage of the company's existence that the greatest scope for its energies lay in the development of the industrial estate and the taking advantage of the attractions for industry which already existed at Shannon, viz. freedom from customs restrictions, enjoyment of certain taxation privileges and proximity to an international airport holding a key position between America and Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order further to encourage the <Col N="1528" /> setting up of industries at the airport, factory buildings, which may be rented, are provided by the company. Factories may also be purchased outright or may be built on sites leased from the company with the aid of grants from the company.  Grants are also made available for machinery and for the training of workers.  Houses for employees of the industrial estate are also provided by the company at reasonable rents or to purchase and developed sites are made available for executive-type houses and for speculative building.</P>
    <P>The share capital subscribed to the company has been used for the provision of factory buildings and dwelling houses, and associated services, the rents from which go to supplement the company's grants-in-aid.  The repayable advances have been used to meet one-half of the expenditure by the company on the provision of housing.  The grants-in-aid are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to industries including grants towards factory buildings, new machinery and the training of workers.  The finances provided to the company under existing legislation up to 30th June, 1963, were as follows:</P>

    <P>Of these amounts, £2,270,000 has been expended on the industrial estate, £1,040,000 on the housing estate, £492,000 on grants to industrialists and £413,500 on the running expenses of the company.  It is now urgently necessary to increase the limits under existing legislation to enable the company to continue to function.</P>
    <P>The company was set up a little over four years ago.  I think it will be agreed that its record in that short time has been one of considerable achievement.  Deputies had the opportunity about a year ago of seeing for themselves what has been accomplished on the industrial and housing estates.  At 30th June, 1963, 12 factories and six trading enterprises were in operation and a total of 1,698 workers were employed of whom 917 <Col N="1529" /> were male and 781 female.  This employment has approximately doubled the number of persons employed at the airport.</P>
    <P>The output of these factories, practically all of which is exported, includes products as diverse as pianos and floor polishers, electronic equipment and knitwear, diamond drills and radios.  Twenty-six standard factory premises and three smaller premises were completed all but one of which were occupied.  Together with a special factory constructed by an industrialist with the aid of a grant from the company, the total area of factory space as at 30th June, 1963, was 509,190 square feet.  Eight standard factory premises are under construction giving a total area of factory space when these are completed of 656,940 square feet.  Ancillary services including water, sewerage, electricity and a boiler house have also been provided.  Thirty-eight houses and 137 flats have been built and 158 houses are under construction or contracted for.  Thirty-five houses and 123 flats are already occupied.  A community centre comprising a shop, bank and recreation hall has been provided and four shops are under construction.  Arrangements are also in train for the provision of other amenities necessary for a growing population.</P>
    <P>Five existing industries are expected to require additional factory premises in the near future and new industries are expected to be set up in the next year with a considerable expansion in employment.  Plans are in hand for the construction of six further factory premises.  By the middle of 1964, the company's factory building programme is expected to comprise 40 standard factories completed or under construction and three small factories completed, eight warehousing units, a boiler house and a commercial office block. While a certain amount of factory accommodation must be provided in anticipation of actual demand, factories are built on the basis of likely demand and building programmes are sanctioned on this basis.  It is, of course, impossible to foresee exactly the extent of future development but the increase in the share capital to £4 million <Col N="1530" /> should be sufficient for the time being.</P>
    <P>Housing is provided in parallel with industrial development, of which it is an integral part.  Shannon is in a somewhat isolated position and it is essential in order to attract workers who do not reside within convenient reach of the Airport, that a sufficiency of living accommodation at reasonable rents be provided so as to cater for both married and unmarried workers desiring to live adjacent to their work.  It is necessary to strike a balance between planning on an over-ambitious scale so that houses might be left unoccupied and on the other hand under-planning to the extent that workers would be discouraged from taking up employment at the Airport because of the lack of suitable accommodation.  Housing is, therefore, provided on a minimum but expandable basis.  This means that the schemes are planned to meet the known demand but that they are expandable to meet very quickly new requirements which may arise.  The company is careful to keep in line with governmental and local authority requirements in its planning and construction of houses and its aim is to develop the housing estate in accordance with the best principles of town planning.  Because of its isolated position and the need to develop sites and to provide services, the cost of housing at Shannon is relatively high, but contracts are placed by open competitive tendering which ensures that costs are kept at a competitive level.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on housing and community services up to 30th June, 1963, provided out of share capital and repayable advances amounted to £1,040,000.  Under existing legislation, repayable advances up to a maximum of £400,000 could be made to the company to meet one-half of the expenditure on housing.  The Bill provides that all expenditure on the provision of dwellings and community services, including expenditure already defrayed out of share capital, will now be met by way of repayable advances.  These advances are repayable over a period of 35 years at the current Exchequer lending rate, this being the basis on which advances are made for local <Col N="1531" /> authority housing.  With the increase in the limit on repayable advances to £2 million a further £960,000 will be available to meet expenditure on housing after 30th June, 1963.  In addition to housing for factory workers, the company provides developed sites for executive-type houses and for speculative building on the basis of the recovery of the full cost of development. As at 30th June, 1963, 20 sites had been provided for executive-type houses.  The company is anxious to encourage speculative building at the Airport and is in negotiation with a number of builders in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the payment from the Transport and Power Vote of a subsidy in respect of each dwelling or other unit of accommodation constructed by the company.  The subsidy is necessary because the rents which it is considered the workers may reasonably be expected to pay fall short of the full economic rents.  The economic rents are calculated on the full cost of construction after deduction of the equivalent of the normal housing grants available to private persons under the Housing Acts.  In the early years, the subsidy will be relatively high but provision is made in the rental agreements for increases in the rents as wages generally increase thus reducing the amount of the subsidy required. Capital grants equivalent to the grants available to persons under the Housing Acts will also be payable and this is provided for in the Bill.  The payment of these grants will be subject to compliance by the company with requirements similar to those laid down by the Housing Acts in the case of grants payable under these Acts.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an increase from £1.25 million to £2 million in the aggregate amount of grants payable to the company.  These grants provide for the running expenses of the company and also enable the company to pay grants to industrialists for buildings, machinery and the training of workers.  Grants paid to the company up to 30th June, 1963, amounted to £905,500.  In addition, the company received £141,500 by way of rents and other income. £555,000 was used by the company <Col N="1532" /> for its running expenses and grants were made to industrialists as follows:</P>

    <P>While the company's most fruitful field of operation lies in the development of the Industrial Estate, it should also be remembered that a primary purpose of the setting up of the company was to stimulate passenger and freight traffic through the Airport.  The combined number of transit and terminal passengeres using the Airport decreased only slightly in 1962 over 1961 but the company is urgently concerned to secure Shannon's share of the traffic growth on the North Atlantic as well as to attract passengers from Britain and the Continent.  The evolution of faster and longer-range aircraft is necessarily having an adverse effect on transit traffic through the Airport but the company has set up a travel promotion department to take advantage of the opportunities which undoubtedly exist for the development of tourist traffic through the Airport.</P>
    <P>In its tourist promotion activities, the company, of course, co-operates fully with other tourist promotion bodies including Bord Fáilte and the air companies.  The success of the local tour arranged for tourists taking in places of scenic and historical interest and culminating in the mediaeval banquet in the restored Bunratty Castle is an example of what can be achieved by imaginative planning.  A further development will be the establishment of a folk park in conjunction with the Bunratty Castle project.  I myself visited the folk park at Arnhem and was so utterly convinced of its national value and attraction to tourists that I suggested a similar development to the Shannon company.  I am glad to say that the initial problems have now been solved and that a folk park will shortly be added to the attractions of the Shannon region.  The cost will be borne equally by the company, Bord Fáilte and an amenity from the Department of Local Government.  The park will be operated by the Shannon company in conjunction with Bunratty Castle.</P>
    <P>The main objective of the promotion <Col N="1533" /> drive is to establish Shannon Airport as the natural gateway for American visitors to the south-western and western areas with all the amenities they offer for mountain, lake and shore scenery, fishing, golfing, hunting and archaeological study.  In this connection may I repeat what I have said earlier.  Neither SFADCO&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We do it all the time.</P>
      <P>Neither the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, Bord Fáilte nor the national airline alone can promote tourist development at a sufficient pace to offset the inevitable decline to some extent of transit traffic at the Airport.  Regional tourist associations equipped by local authorities and other local interests with promotional funds representing a percentage of tourist spending in the areas can help to create their own image of each tourist area, can stimulate group hotel publicity, encourage group booking, entertain travel writers and agents and can assist in local resort development and in promoting interest in fishing, golf etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that the regional tourist association movement is beginning to progress in the area.  Contacts with Americans of Irish origin organised on a regional basis is one example of tourist promotion offering a great potential in the future.  Kerry, Limerick, Clare and Galway&mdash;the Shannon Counties&mdash;are competing with regional development competitive promotion work all over Europe.  The growth of terminal freight traffic through the Airport is slow mainly because of the great disparity at present existing between air and surface rates but as air freight costs lessen it is expected that the volume of air shipments will increase substantially. Nearly half of the terminal freight generated at Shannon in 1962 was <Col N="1534" /> attributable to the industrial estate and in the first quarter of this year air freight generated by the Industrial Estate was up by 15 per cent compared with the first quarter of 1962. Three firms at the Airport engage in freight forwarding and consolidation and two other firms in warehousing operations while two American companies of international repute are considering Shannon as a distribution point for their markets in the UK, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</P>
    <P>A big expansion in warehousing activities is expected as a result of an extensive campaign publicising the advantages which the Free Airport holds for freight warehousing and distribution. By the provision of warehouse facilities, air cargo is attracted to the airport for storage and redistribution.  Shannon is very well placed as a centre for entrepot and distribution operations but to develop the Airport's potential in this field it is necessary to provide adequate facilities.</P>
    <P>Eight warehousing units, each of about 3,500 square feet, are being provided initially by the company with provision for expansion to meet demand.  The introduction recently by Pan-American Airways of an all-cargo Boeing jet freighter service through Shannon linking cities in the United States with important European and Middle East centres should also provide a very considerable fillip to the growth of air freight through the Airport while the company is active in endeavouring to secure improved cargo rates, improved services including increased frequencies and speedy clearance at destinations, and the publicising of the facilities available by air.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to believe that the outlook for the future of the Estate is other than bright but we must, of course, combine optimism with prudence. The concept of an industrial estate at Shannon was a revolutionary and therefore, speculative one.  That so much has been achieved in such a short time justifies the bold and imaginative experiment undertaken four years ago and I am convinced that it will continue to play its important part in the economy.  The financial limits <Col N="1535" /> proposed in this Bill are realistic though they may perhaps be a little on the tight side since they represent only the minimum financing which the company will require in the next few years.  If I have to come back to the House before that time, I will make no apology as the need for further finances will be a measure of the company's success.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, it is with confidence that I ask for approval for this Bill, in giving which Deputies will have expressed their satisfaction with the achievements of the company to date and their confidence in its continued progress.  For my own part, I wish to congratulate the Board and management of the company and also the management of the various enterprises in the estate on the results achieved; and to urge them to even greater efforts in the future.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will pardon me saying that it is rather ironical for him to be taken to task for an abbreviation because we all know that his tendencies in speech are rather the other way.  The Bill itself is another example of the habit of this Government of bringing in measures of this sort involving very large sums of money at the tail-end of the Dáil programme so that they will not get, they hope, the full and complete consideration they would get if introduced at the proper time.  I am not going to develop that except to say that the Minister himself is aware that even on the programme of business that had to be completed, this Bill was not included on the first occasion.  However, it has come here now and beyond saying that method of doing business is not the right one and is one that must be changed if the Dáil is to act as a proper consultative and criticising assembly, I shall make no further comment. These changes not merely must be made but must be made at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be more successful in regard to this project than the Taoiseach was in regard to the Verolme project which he <Col N="1536" /> announced in June, 1959 and about which we heard a sad-ish story yesterday. I trust the Minister's reputation and the reputation of the child he now has in his arms will be better than the Cork child and indeed certain other children his colleagues are attempting to make out are healthy but which in fact are quite the reverse. These are merely methods by which slush money can be poured out instead of being put into proper productive investment.</P>
    <P>I was amused and very gratified to hear the Minister say that the future of Shannon depended on its being made a regional distribution centre for air freight.  Fianna Fáil have a habit of taking quotations out of their context and have done that in a most unjust, unfair and disreputable way.  Twenty years ago, the Leader of the Opposition said that there was only one chance of keeping Shannon as a viable proposition and that was to use it as the entrepot of Europe in the same way as Hamburg is used as the entrepot for shipping and that if it was not used in that way, Shannon would be overrun by rabbits.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were very keen on quoting the second part but completely ignoring the first part of that speech but the Minister today has come in in relation to this Bill and has completely vindicated the view then expressed by the Leader of the Opposition. With faster-flying, longer-range aircraft, if Shannon is to survive, it must survive in this way.  We all know how Hamburg is the distributing centre for shipping for the whole of Western Europe and if we are to have a future, now that jet aircraft can fly safely such tremendous distances and now that it is not necessary even in adverse winds to touch down at the nearest point on either side of the Atlantic, it is only by following out what the Leader of the Opposition said 20 years ago that the investment at Shannon can be brought to a satisfactory yield.  I am glad the Minister, albeit unwillingly and without reference to the Leader of the Opposition, has accepted the wisdom of what he said 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Bill itself, I am <Col N="1537" /> still not quite clear in regard to the exact basis on which the financial provisions are founded.  I am not quite clear as to the basis upon which the computations are made of the additional sums required and I do not understand the method of financing proposed.  I do not understand how it is now proposed to adjust the difference between share capital, on the one hand, and advances, on the other hand.  As I understand the matter, the entire capital of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is held by the Minister for Finance.  Perhaps the Minister would oblige me by confirming that I am right in that respect? If I am right in that respect, what is the reason for breaking up the financing of the company between share capital, on the one hand, and advances, on the other?  In normal commercial life, that arises because it is intended that the share capital will be the permanent investment and the advances will be something temporary which it is intended at a later stage to pay off or to translate into share capital by way of public issues.</P>
    <P>Is it believed that the advances which are being increased from £400,000 to £2 million are only temporary advances that will be paid off and that of the total investment of £4 million authorised under this Bill, £2 million will be repaid and £2 million remain outstanding on a permanent basis?  The manner in which the headings 1 and 3 are set out in the Minister's speech would give that impression, taken commercially, but then, of course, the Minister later on says the schedule is made on a very tight basis and that he may have to come to the House again.  It does not seem to me to hang together as a sensible operation.</P>
    <P>That is another reason why this type of legislation should not come in at the tail end of a session.  It would be far more desirable to have a substantial period between the speech by the Minister on Second Reading and the other Stages of the Bill so that not merely could one consider what the Minister has said but, in addition make such inquiries outside the House as might be necessary to comment on his <Col N="1538" /> statement more fully at a later stage, such as on the Money Resolution.</P>
    <P>The Minister, perhaps, when he is replying, will deal specifically with that point.  As I say, the share capital is set out as £2,910,000 and repayable advances as only £400,000 and while the share capital is being increased by £1 million, the advances are being increased by £1,600,000.  It seems to me to be completely out of reality to suggest that the moneys being provided now by way of repayable advances are, in fact, any less permanently invested than the share capital as such.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the fact that on 30th of last month, there were 12 factories and six trading enterprises on the estate.  At a later stage in his speech, he referred to three firms engaged in freight forwarding and two other firms engaged in warehousing operations.  Are these five firms referred to intended to be five out of the six mentioned by him as trading enterprises and, if so, why was he so coy about the sixth?  Is there any particular reason for that?</P>
    <P>The Minister discussed housing in relation to the Airport.  There were two possible ways of considering the housing of workers there.  It would have been possible either to do as the Minister has done, to house them directly in the Airport itself or to build up the surrounding towns and villages into what one might call satellites for the Airport for housing purposes.  It is a matter about which I frankly admit there could be two opinions.  I am not as fully acquainted with that area as other Deputies who represent it are but, at the same time, I know a little about it and it would have appeared to me to be an opportunity to reverse the trend that is all too patent today in Irish rural life where we see small towns and villages dying out year after year.</P>
    <P>It would have been possible, I am sure, to do something in that area to reverse that trend and probably to be able to do it cheaper, even with a recurrent cost of transport into the area, than the whole new building that is being carried out and that the Minister <Col N="1539" /> now envisages.  I would have thought that it would have been better to build the area around it rather than to create an entirely new housing estate, an entirely new town, and I do not think the journey necessary would be such as to make those housing arrangements so difficult or so costly.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister, in referring to the economic rents of the houses and talking about the subsidy being relatively high in the early years, in fact means that the rents are calculated on something equivalent to the differential rents scale to which we have become used in local authority housing, a differential rents scale apparently calculated on a somewhat different basis.  I wish to hear a little more about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not purport to give us any information about the expenditure of £555,000 for running expenses. I am not clear whether that is intended to cover just the year to 30th June or what period, but it is part of the general problem of control and information about State companies.  As I say, the end of a session is not the time to consider all that.  The failure of the Verolme project to live up to its original promise and the manner in which State enterprises are every day looking for more money makes it quite obvious now that this whole problem is one which can no longer remain pigeonholed but must be faced at some stage in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I am in some doubt about the establishment of the Folk Park to which the Minister has referred in the vicinity of Bunratty, for the reason that I gather that what is intended is something entirely typical of Irish national cultural life.  I have frequently taken and paid for, at a not unreasonable price, let me say, the hospitality of the hotel there.  It is not an hotel in the vicinity of which the Minister could conceivably plant a folk park representative of Irish national and cultural life.  The provision of one in propinquity to the other is something that only someone with a split personality would be able to conceive.  This does not seem to me to be a feasible proposition at all, unless the Minister is <Col N="1540" /> proposing that his park will be on the other side of the river and that one could go away from it across the river to a different mode of life altogether. However, I am sure the planning of such a matter will not defeat the ingenuity of those who are so excellent at announcing plans but so bad at ever putting them into actual operation in such manner as to benefit the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say more except to repeat that I object to legislation of this sort being thrown at us at the end of a session, legislation involving a substantial outlay and involving of necessity therefore, an adequate opportunity for consideration of that outlay.  I am glad the Minister in his speech on this Bill has taken the opportunity of acknowledging that Deputy Dillon was right when he said, 20 years ago, that the only future for Shannon Airport was to make it an entrepot for air traffic in Western Europe in the same way as Hamburg became a sea entrepot over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker referred to a split personality.  That description reminds me very much of the Minister because, on every occasion given to him in the last 12 months, he has devoted himself to a condemnation of subsidies in any shape or form.  At every chamber of commerce dinner, at every function at which he was allowed to speak, and here in this House, he has condemned the idea of subsidies, right, left and centre.  In his dislike of subsidies, he has allowed CIE to tear up the railway lines of this country.  He is the Minister who comes in here this morning and asks for money to subsidise&mdash;that is the only word I can use&mdash;what is turning out now to be a very doubtful proposition for the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister's must be a split personality. Why is it wrong to subsidise the railways, which are providing a vital service, and why is it right to subsidise houses, flats, castles and luxury apartments for the executives of fly-by-night companies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a comparison.  Is the Minister for or against subsidies?  Can he be against subsidies for the type of thing I have mentioned, the preservation of vital traffic links, and for them when the subject happens to be a pet of his own?  There is no proper fundamental philosophy in this Minister for Transport and Power.  There is no right thinking.  His is a pragmatic approach.</P>
      <P>His opening speech reminded me of an auctioneer trying to sell a bad property.  The more he spoke, the less inclined one was to fall for what he was trying to sell.  He brought in everything he could think of; the only thing he left out were the hostesses in Bunratty.  Every other possible attraction was mentioned in his effort to sell this measure to the House.</P>
      <P>Now, if this is the way in which the Minister and his Government want to spend the money they are going to raise by way of the turnover tax, then let me tell the Minister that the list of priorities is all haywire.  He stated that this measure was designed to provide money to promote the welfare primarily of Shannon Airport.  Let us examine that.  What does it mean? Promote the welfare of Shannon Airport. Has it been decided that, in spite of economic reports, findings and everything else, Shannon Airport must be kept going at all costs?  Has it been decided that for the sake of prestige, money must be poured into this company, and this locality, and that at a time when the needs of other areas are neglected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say the priority list is all wrong. Promote the welfare of Shannon Airport. Provide there sites for factories, build factories, give to those who come to set up industries and provide work, ten years, or more, free of taxes on pretty nearly everything; give them every possible facility, but have no control over them so that, so soon as they have made their money, they can fold their tents and disappear overnight. Build luxury flats and houses <Col N="1542" /> in this locality in which 95 per cent of the raw material going into the factories for processing has to be imported from abroad.  Spend the Irish taxpayers money on that while the people living on small holdings in the surrounding counties in Connacht are left with no alternative except the boat to Britain or to the United States of America, for the small group that can get in there.</P>
    <P>Within the last month, a meeting was held in the west of Ireland and at that meeting the horribly serious plight of the families in the west was discussed. There was no sign of Government support in the form of money to help there.  Yet millions can be poured into Shannon Airport to help it, to preserve it, to give a living there primarily to those in executive positions. We know, and it is beyond dispute, that a number of firms which have come in have paid shameful wages to their workers.  Young girls have been forced to travel ten and up to 20 miles to work at the lowest wages in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the wages is below trade union rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that there is the biggest turnover of labour in Europe at the Shannon Free Airport because of the pay and conditions.  It is always a bad sign of employment conditions when there is a big turnover in labour.  It is a sign that you are only getting in young people who want to get a few shillings together and then emigrate.  You can see the advertisements in the local papers or the placards inviting men and women to work at Shannon.  Even people landing at Shannon are invited to take up work.  They cannot get people to stay. But there has been no criticism or crib by the executive class or the managerial class.  They get priority.  They will get the luxury flats and the best houses but the workers can travel 20 miles by bus for £3 or £4 per week. This is the new Ireland that is being built while entire families in the west of Ireland have to get out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Go down to Limerick and you will see closely-knit groups of Europeans, with their children being taught their <Col N="1543" /> own language, living apart from the native population, so that when the time comes, they can fold their tents and disappear.  They are not becoming part of the Irish population; they are not being absorbed into the Irish way of life.  Perhaps you may get the individual family where a son or a daughter turns out to be a great step-dancer or who speaks the Irish language and then that family is singled out as an example of what these people are doing.  One swallow never made a summer.</P>
    <P>As I said, 95 per cent of the raw material used in these factories is imported while all around, within 40 miles land, which can produce raw material for processing, is being neglected.  In parts of my constituency, you cannot even see the land for want of drainage, but there is no money for that.  What is the position?  First of all, we must promote the welfare of Shannon Airport and one of the ways to do that is to give grants, build factories, build houses for all those groups who are assembling transistor sets, and so on, in it.  Having decided that that was not sufficient to preserve Shannon, we go into the tourist field. Every Deputy is in favour of promoting tourism and I do not object to money being spent in County Clare or any tourist area if it is spent for the purpose of developing tourism, on a proper line but we must sound a note of warning when we find this type of expenditure.  Anybody who comes here with his own money is entitled to spend it whatever way he likes, on building any kind of hotel or guest-house, or developing a park, but when it comes to the utilisation of grants from the State, it is time we had another look at the matter.</P>
    <P>To suggest that anything around Bunratty is typical of Ireland is sheer nonsense.  Deputies may get up and criticise me about this but is it typical even in the very description&mdash;&ldquo;in silent Bunratty&rdquo;&mdash;or even the description of the girls who work in it and who are described as hostesses?  In any other place, they would be described as waitresses but here the snobbery has to come in.  It would make you sick to <Col N="1544" /> think of all the humbug that goes on and then to look at the little split personality in charge of his development work.  To promote the welfare of Shannon Airport is the Minister's main objective.  What has happened the companies which are in production there? It was hoped they would export their products through Shannon Airport but what has happened?  Last week when I sought to extract the facts from the Minister, he tried to suggest that the figures presented by leading spokesmen for Pan-American Airways or other airways were incorrect.</P>
    <P>I again challenge the Minister.  Is it not a fact that many of these companies are now exporting overland or by ship? Is it not a fact that it has been found more advantageous and more economical for them to send their goods by road to the north of Ireland and from there to Britain and elsewhere or to export direct by sea?  Was it not one of the reasons why this House was asked to provide money for this company to ensure that it would use air transport from Shannon?  The fact that they are not using the runways beside them is not a hopeful sign for that Airport.</P>
    <P>Why are conditions not laid down when grants are being given to these companies that they must use air freight if the intention is to promote Shannon Airport?  What are the Government doing?  We have a transatlantic air company and what are they doing?  They touch down at Shannon but they fly on to Dublin and if the Government were serious, there would be only one stop and that would be Shannon.  We know that there has been pressure from the people, from the tourists and from air companies for the planes to land at Dublin and the Irish airline people are no fools.  We have to accept that Dublin is a place to which people want to come.  They do not want to come to Shannon and be delayed half an hour there when their destination is Dublin.  We saw when President Kennedy was here that he was able to cover the whole country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have a feeling that <Col N="1546" /> before very long the houses and the luxury flats in Shannon will be used for housing American military men and technicians and designers.  I have a feeling that the factories erected in Shannon will be used for the storage of American equipment.  I have a feeling that the Airport will be used as an air base and that Shannon Estuary will be a sea base.  I hope I am wrong.</P>
    <P>I shall do everything I possibly can outside this House to ensure that that will not happen, but, as a result of the statement of the Taoiseach in this House within the past fortnight, I have a feeling that the very significant talks between himself and President Kennedy included the idea of Ireland's being a very strong base for America outside NATO altogether&mdash;away altogether from NATO&mdash;and that next October or November when the Taoiseach visits the United States, this is one of the matters which will carefully be discussed.  It is quite possible that this country will be faced with a welcome issued on its behalf by the Taoiseach to the Americans to take over Shannon when all this money is poured into it and when the programme initiated by this Government is proved a failure.</P>

    <P>Nílim ro-shásta ámh le tógáil baile mór eile i gContae an Chláir.  Tá go leor bailte mór agus beag againn cheana féin.  Im thuairim-se, ba cheart na tithe do thógáil i gCorra Caitilín, i gCaisleán an Chláir, in Inis, i nDroichead Abhann Uí Chearnaigh agus i Luimneach.

Ní thuigim, dá bhrí sin, cad na thaobh go ndubhairt an tAire gur áit iar-gcualda é seo agus go raibh géar-gá le tithe do thógáil ann.  Dá ndéanfí na tithe do thógáil ins na bailte a luaidh mé, ní bheadh ar an gcomhlucht siopaí, scoileanna, ná eaglais ar bith do thógáil ag an Aerphort.  Tá gach córas, uisce agus uile, ins na bailte agus ní bheadh aon díomailt airgid a gabháil le tógaint na dtithe.  Ba bhreá leis na siopadóirí ins na bailte roimh-ráite breis airgid d'fháil uatha san atá ag obair ins na monarchain agus chuideodh sé leo an 2½ faoin gcéad do chur ar ceal.

      <P>It is a matter of considerable regret to me that the educational deficiency from which I suffer prevented me from enjoying what the last speaker said with considerable fluency.  I must come into the debate on the spine-chilling note on which Deputy McQuillan finished.  I think Deputy McQuillan finds things under the bed in a most impractical way. What we are trying to do in Shannon is to rescue an airport that has run into difficulties.  This is remarkable and unusual and I hope it will be a successful project.  I regard and always have regarded it as a very valiant attempt to save this Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great imponderable surrounds Shannon Airport.  The passing of the piston engine seemed to indicate the passing of Shannon as an airport.  The <Col N="1549" /> development of Aerlínte, and the transatlantic services and the success of these services is something that gratifies all of us but, like all silver clouds, it has a dark lining.  The dark lining in this case is that Irish International Airlines creamed off all the business which might tempt the other airlines to use Shannon as an airport. To that extent, the success of Irish International Airlines was probably an all-over injury to Shannon.  I am glad to note lately that there is a slight movement back by some of the great airlines, Sabena and one of the American companies, to touch down again at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>That is not what we are discussing here this morning.  This would seem to be a very expensive buttressing of Shannon but our efforts in that direction have always seemed to me to be the only possible and reasonable ones. In the four or five years of its history, we have brought an unusually diverse kind of activity to the area.  We are seeking to build there a community where no community existed, to have work where no work existed, to build homes where no homes existed, to bring people where no people existed and to enable them to support themselves in the homes we have built for them.  It is almost in the realm of fantasy but it may come off and it is the wish of every Deputy here that it will come off.</P>
    <P>It is distressing to learn that the air freight services are not being used sufficiently by those who have been induced to come into production there. I hope that it is only a passing complaint. I should like the Minister to indicate what injury might be done to our efforts there if our efforts to enter EEC are successful.  I have a reasonable knowledge of these developments. The factories seem to be competent; the housing developments are extremely attractive; and if there is a slight air of artificiality about the whole place, we cannot complain because it could not be done in any other way.  The original proposals were almost incredible.  Those who initiated them took on a formidable task and I want to pay tribute to Mr. O'Regan and his colleagues for the efforts they are making to make this an important <Col N="1550" /> centre of this State.  We hope they will succeed because the Irish people have made a very great investment there.</P>
    <P>I have no brief for the criticism that has been thrown at Bunratty Castle. The restoration work there has been done with good taste and the activities carried on there, the nightly banquetes, are very satisfactory and attractive.  It is a pity that more Irish people do not go to these banquets and see what happens there.  Telefís Éireann could do worse than spend an hour there and let the Irish people see how pleasant it is.  In contrast with the Shannon Shamrock hotel nearby, Bunratty Castle is most attractive.  This is one of the things that we do quite well in Ireland.  I do not know who is behind the functions in Bunratty but it must be very hard work to run them and it is extremely well done and done in the utmost good taste.</P>
    <P>I think most of us realise that the real danger to Shannon and to all these developments lies in the struggle to make Dublin the major transatlantic terminus.  If these proposals succeed, Shannon will die.  We must all be aware of what is at stake in resisting the proposal.  All our investments in Shannon will be lost if that campaign is successful.  Dublin, as a city, will eat much more into the entire economy of this country and will add to the great demographic imbalance we have.  I wish this project every success and I hope sarcasm and cynicism will not be permitted to kill the very great effort being made there.</P>
    <P>We should make an effort to maintain the Airport in immaculate condition and good appearance. Frequently, the passenger from America leaves from the airport in Boston.  It is a pretty tawdry and run-down airport itself.  All of us would like to see travellers who get on the plane in Boston arrive at an airport which reflects a good standard.</P>
    <P>On a visit to America recently, I found advertising is conducted by Board Fáilte, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and Aer Lingus.  I think that is probably a wasteful diversity of our activities in <Col N="1551" /> public relations there.  It is desirable that all advertising to the American public in regard to Ireland, Aer Lingus, Shannon Airport and so on should be from the one source and under the one direction.  That would provide an attractive economy and prevent expensive duplication in the expenditure of moneys.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that the impact of Shannon as a radiating influence of employment and tourism in the west and south-west is very important.  We must make sure that this hidden struggle we are all aware of to make Dublin the international terminus does not succeed.  If it does, it will deal a death-blow to the hopes of the south and south-west and of this great Airport. We must pay tribute to the Government for apparently resisting this matter so long.  I want to assure them they will have the support of the whole of this House and all the people of the country, apart from some people in Dublin&mdash;probably some American airlines&mdash;if they continue to resist this pressure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased at the way in which this debate has been approached and I am particularly gratified at the absence of any political controversy regarding the future of Shannon and its 2,000 employees.  I have nothing very much to criticise in what the Minister said, but I am disappointed he did not give a more general review of the present position of the Airport as a passenger terminal and did not try to forecast future trends.  I realise it is very difficult, as the Minister pointed out in reply to a question from me, to forecast passenger movement.  As a result of this Bill, and particularly of the discussion which has taken place, I feel that, on the whole, the future of Shannon is quite bright. I welcome that.  I am very interested in all the activities at the Airport. Irrespective of any political controversy that may have raged in the past regarding Shannon, I am wholeheartedly behind the Shannon Development Company in their efforts to maintain Shannon and to develop the Industrial Estate and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main sections of the Bill deals with housing for the workers at <Col N="1552" /> Shannon.  The Minister pointed out that Shannon is in an isolated position. There is no existing community there. Therefore, if we want to attract workers and ensure a future labour pool for the industries set up, it is necessary to provide housing.  Speaking on the Minister's Estimate last November, I went into this matter of the recruitment of workers.  A stage has now been reached when workers have to travel distances of up to 40 miles per day to and from their work at the Airport.  The provision of housing is not alone desirable but absolutely essential for the future of the Industrial Estate.</P>
    <P>One of the disappointing features of the Industrial Estate is that it has not succeeded as well as we would like it to succeed in generating air freight traffic through the Airport.  The Minister informed me in the House six months ago that the Industrial Estate generated only one-third of the total air freight through the Airport.  I am glad to see there has been an improvement in that position today and that the figure has now gone up to 50 per cent.  If the various industries at Shannon can provide an increased amount of air freight traffic through the Airport, the future of Shannon is assured.</P>
    <P>I realise that the big problem regarding air freight is the matter of costs.  It is true, as Deputy McQuillan said, that some of the industries at Shannon are utilising land and sea transport.  It would not be possible for the Government or the Shannon Development Company to insist on any industry utilising one form of transport rather than another.  Is it possible, however, that an effort might be made to attract a particular type of industry.  Some of the factories in Shannon are producing goods ideally suited to air transport. The most recent one was the Shannon diamond factory where small units, of high value, ideally suited to air freight, are produced.  Other industries make products of a bulky nature which would not be so suitable.  Is it possible that a special effort might be made to attract industries whose products are suited to air freight.  I do not say that in any critical manner but it is an <Col N="1553" /> idea that has been agitating my mind for some time.</P>
    <P>I feel that promotion of tourism is of very great importance to the future of Shannon.  I am glad the Shannon Development Company has been, for the past year or so, making an all-out effort to promote tourism in the Shannon area.  Last year, speaking on the Estimate for Transport and Power, I suggested that perhaps a more co-ordinated effort might be made towards the development of tourism not merely in the Shannon area but on a regional basis covering Galway, Clare, Limerick, North Kerry, North Cork and North Tipperary.  In the past month or so, a regional tourist development association has been formed in Limerick but I should like to see greater co-operation between the SDC and the regional association in Limerick.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is vitally essential that local co-operation should be forthcoming for tourist promotion.  I am fully conscious of the value of local effort, particularly in regard to the development of angling which has a great potential in Counties Limerick and Clare, but I wonder if it would be possible that some special assistance might be given to the Limerick Regional Development Association. We have not much experience in tourism promotion.  We have good intentions and there is a spirit of co-operation there but we need assistance in regard to technical know-how and in the matter of getting various small local groups in Limerick and Clare and the SDC co-ordinated into one central authority.</P>
    <P>Board Fáilte might be able to make a special officer available for 12 months or so to direct the work of the association. Some specialist advice is available, I feel sure, but it is not sufficient to send an official from Bord Fáilte to the monthly meetings.  We should have for, possibly, 12 months at least, a well-qualified officer to show us how to get things done and who, at the end of the period, would possibly depart in the knowledge that we would then know how to go ahead ourselves. We are pretty well equipped with first-class <Col N="1554" /> hotel accommodation in the Limerick area but there is a considerable potential for another type of tourism. I am particularly keen on the angling potential and I am glad to say that plans are already being formulated to promote package angling holidays through Shannon Airport.  Everything that can be done to promote tourism not only in the Shannon area&mdash;which to us means the area from Ennis into Limerick, around by the Airport and Bunratty&mdash;but also in the whole region comprising Limerick, Clare and Galway, can help to promote passenger traffic through the Airport.</P>
    <P>I did not like Deputy McQuillan's speech.  At first, I was inclined to take him seriously but as he went on, I thought there was no cause to worry about it.  In conclusion, I think for the first time since I came to this House I am happy in mind about the future of Shannon.  I have a tremendous admiration for the manner in which the officers of the SDC have tackled the problem and it was also very encouraging to find that this debate was not spoiled by any political controversy.  The workers at Shannon can be assured that both sides of the House are sincere in their efforts to ensure the future of Shannon and particularly the future livelihood of the 2,000 workers.  I trust this Bill will assist the SDC and that we can look forward to greater things in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the very courteous way they have received the Bill and for their constructive criticism and comment.  I really should apologise for the late coming of this measure which was due to a number of circumstances over some of which I had no control.  I assure Deputy Sweetman that very great care was taken in the examination of the Shannon project particularly because of its novelty, and the whole question of deciding the housing policy and the finance connected with it and all other policy matters was not rushed.  The advice of intelligent people was sought and considered at a number of different levels and that is one of the reasons why the Bill has come here rather late. <Col N="1555" /> Great care was taken in examining this proposal and the whole future of Shannon Airport and the Industrial Estate because it is something entirely new in the history of this country.</P>
      <P>I think I need not deal with what Deputy McQuillan said.  Were I to agree with him, I would shoot myself tomorrow morning and have done with it and save a lot of debate in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The companies operating at Shannon are world famous and we can have confidence in the strong foundation of industry being built up there.  One of the interesting features of Shannon is that world famous companies which made profits for many years have chosen to come to the industrial estate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman asked me to elaborate again the nature of the financial proposals.  The factories in Shannon are being financed out of the share capital of the company.  The Minister for Finance is the shareholder and the only way he can get a return on the capital is by way of dividend. The company calculates the economic rent covering interest, a sum to recover capital and running expenses.  The full economic rents are not charged but in a few years nearly the full rent will be charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment on this basis of calculation the factories are providing 78 per cent and it is hoped that in the course of years the arrangements will provide that about 96 per cent of the full economic rent will be available. What the Minister for Finance would <Col N="1556" /> do later on when these rents have started accruing is a different matter. The position is that it is share capital and that any rents received could be paid as dividends but at the moment they are being ploughed back into the general operation of the factory administration.</P>
    <P>Then there is a sum paid for administration, for promotion, for publicity, for general running expenses and for grants to factories.  Finally, the housing capital is made available in exactly the same way as it is to housing authorities. There is the same method of repayment but the repayment is made after due allowance for the normal grant that would be made available under the Housing Acts for the houses and flats built, and after a sum has been voted from my Department in respect of subsidies made available to secure rents that are reasonable.  That, I think, is a full description of how the repayable advances operate.  They are worked in exactly the same way as in connection with the Housing Acts, over the same period with the same rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman posed the question that many people quite reasonably pose about the housing policy.  The housing policy has been very carefully examined.  Of the workers at Shannon, some prefer Limerick, some prefer to live in Ennis, some come from the surrounding countryside, some migrate from other parts of Ireland, and a few have come from abroad, workers with specialised knowledge.  However, we now have enough experience to know, from those who manage the factories and as a result of the knowledge of the officers at the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, that we must provide a certain number of houses. There are a certain number of people who want to live at the airport, to enjoy the community services there and live close to their work.  All we can do is to ensure we do not overbuild or underbuild.</P>
    <P>The supply of labour in the area can be predicted to a certain extent from the knowledge of the numbers who are leaving school and so forth.  It cannot be predicted exactly because, for example, in the last four years in <Col N="1557" /> Ennis they have been progressing industrially and we hope Limerick will now progress industrially, so that the amount of labour which will be drawn into the Airport from outside will be changing in the upward direction in the future.  Deputy Sweetman expressed the hope that the Folk Park would not be placed in such a position that it would appear to be surrounding the adjacent hotel.  The cottages will be erected on a special piece of land in association with Bunratty Castle and I think the House will be satisfied with the result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Which side of the river?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure which side of the river.  That has to be planned.  The main thing is to make the general arrangements and obtain financial sanction.  I should state here in contradiction of Deputy McQuillan that the wages paid at Shannon are at least trade union wages and in many cases much higher.  As Deputies could see for themselves when they inspected the factories, the working conditions are very satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The observation was made that a number of people who live in the countryside rather far away from Shannon find the travelling expenses very heavy, as they live beyond the point from which subsidies are paid by the factory managers for bus travel. We hope to construct some hostels for girls who are mainly concerned in this complaint, and that will relieve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to air freight, 50 per cent. of the goods in connection with the Industrial Estate are air freighted. The Shannon Free Airport Development Company are now more selective even than before in choosing industries. While they hope a considerable volume of air freight will emerge, they cannot impose an absolute condition that all the raw materials coming into the factory and all the finished goods going out will be air freighted but at least the Shannon Free Airport Development Company have reached the point where an element of selectivity can be introduced into their decisions <Col N="1558" /> whether to accept a proposal from a factory for space or not.  However, it would be impossible to make this a 100 per cent operation.  The reason for an adverse trend in air freight arrangements which was noticed by Deputies recently was the beginning of containerisation by land which to some degree is a challenge from the surface carriers to the air carriers.  The air carriers will have to meet that later on by arranging more economic operation, and we cannot be too dissatisfied with the position.  It is a fact that half of the freight from Shannon Airport comes from the Industrial Estate, that of the goods produced at the Shannon Industrial Estate one-half is air freight.  That is not an unfavourable position although naturally we would like to see it improved.</P>
    <P>Deputy A. Barry made a very helpful speech, for which I thank him. As regards his question about the EEC, it would be impossible to predict what would happen to the Shannon Industrial Estate if we joined the EEC.  From all the reports I received from the company, however, and from talking with industrialists down there, I can say they are quite confident that it will provide opportunities and a challenge, and that as long as goods are efficiently produced at Shannon and a high rate of productivity can be maintained, there will be a great future for Shannon if we join the Common Market.  Whether under the new circumstances we would be allowed to offer grants or taxation remission to new firms coming in no one can predict.  In the case of some members of the Common Market, they were allowed to continue for a period industrial grants and taxation incentives&mdash;I think in the case of Italy.  It would be impossible for me to state what the result would be in our case. That would be a matter for negotiation but I am sure the existing industries, if anything, would be able to benefit from the Common Market position.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about the nature of the air service at Shannon. It would not be wise for Shannon to be the terminal position for Aerlínte. <Col N="1559" /> I do not think it would gain us anything in the long run and I would not propose to ask them to take that decision or to make that change.  The number of transatlantic services operating to Shannon this Summer is not unsatisfactory and part of the job of Bord Fáilte, the Free Airport Development Company, and such regional associations as, I hope, will grow in the area, is to convince Americans that Shannon is a natural centre for the scenic, tourist and fishing facilities in the West of Ireland.  I hope they will succeed in convincing Americans that this is the natural airport at which they should disembark for all these facilities.</P>
    <P>That will be a very big job.  Some success has been achieved and I think the best way of tackling the problem is by making Americans, in particular, feel that Shannon is a very natural centre at which to disembark for the tourist areas of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked whether some help could be given to the new Limerick tourist association.  The answer is that Bord Fáilte will give technical and co-ordinating advice. If a travel promotion officer is appointed, Bord Fáilte will pay, at least initially, part of his salary.  That has been found profitable at Galway where the first local promotion officer was appointed.  The same thing would apply to any regional associations, whether combined as between counties and areas, or in relation to one particular area.</P>

Deputy Sweetman asked for a statement of the total of all running expenses of the company, including grants to industrialists.  The grand total of expenses up to 30th June, 1963, was £555,000.  That comprises administration expenses, salaries and wages, travelling, postage, rent and rates, repairs and renewals, interest on repayable advances, depreciation, boiler house operation, lighting, heating, power, and promotion expenses.  Promotion expenses&mdash;it is an interesting figure&mdash;amounted to £228,000 out of the total of £555,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his remarks last night, Deputy Cunningham, in what appeared to be a boastful way, said this Bill for social welfare increases was one of the results of the turnover tax, thereby trying to create the impression that the turnover tax was introduced in order to finance certain social welfare increases.  He sought to give the impression that this was one of the benefits that flowed from the introduction of the turnover tax.  It would not be wrong, I think, to say that that is somewhat inaccurate since it has been admitted by the various Government spokesmen that this Bill has been introduced because the turnover tax was introduced in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>It should be made clear once again that this is not a Bill which improves the payments made under the social welfare code.  It is merely a partial compensation for the increases that must occur in the cost of living&mdash;it is admitted will occur&mdash;when the turnover tax comes into operation.  As has been said by members of the Government Party, this is not, in fact, full compensation; it is only partial compensation. Each year, in the past five or six years, and even before that, various Ministers for Social Welfare have given some increases, but these were increases introduced to compensate for any increase in the cost of living and, in some cases, the increases were a little over and beyond any increases that had taken place in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> This year, however, the introduction of this Bill does not represent in any degree a gratuity or an improvement to those who are in receipt of social welfare benefits.  It is merely a partial compensation for the increases in the prices of commodities that must necessarily occur when the turnover tax comes into operation.  Evidence of that can be found in the Minister's own statement.  The Minister said: &ldquo;The effect of these increased payments&rdquo;&mdash; he is referring to children's allowances&mdash;&ldquo;can perhaps best be illustrated by a few examples.  The monthly allowance for a family with three children will go up from £1 17 6 to £2 12 0 per month&rdquo;.  I think that three children may be the average family in Ireland.  I may be wrong in that, but let us take the example of a family of three children.</P>
    <P>The increase which will be given to such a family under children's allowances will be 3/4d per week.  We must remember that these increases, in the insurance groups particularly, necessitate the payment of an increase for the insurance stamp, to the tune of 8d per week.  That means that for the family of three the increase will not be 3/4 a week but 2/8 a week. Surely therefore, it cannot be suggested that 2/8 a week would compensate a man with a wife and three children who had £8, £9 or £10 a week? Therefore, whilst none of us object to these increases, it cannot be said that the increase in children's allowances in respect of that particular family will compensate for the increase that will undoubtedly occur.</P>
    <P>On the Finance Bill, the Minister for Industry and Commerce intervened&mdash; I have not got the exact quotation&mdash; but he admitted that the increase in children's allowances would not in all cases compensate for the increase that must take place in the cost of living. Therefore, this Bill had to be brought in.  I have an appreciation of the mind of the Minister for Social Welfare in respect of necessary social changes. Even in this Bill he has continued the good work in a lot of tidying up, but in this case there was no option but to bring it in because there would have been a greater outcry about the turnover tax if the people did not get some <Col N="1563" /> compensation by way of social welfare improvements.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government are treating the Minister properly.  I do not believe he is getting a fair share of the increased taxation proposed to be raised under the Finance Bill.  I remember occasions when the surplus, so to speak, after the imposition of taxes, etc., in a Budget amounted to £2 million, £3 million or £4 million a year and this Minister and other Ministers for Social Welfare received a much higher percentage of it.  It is not a great tribute to the Government or to the House that in a budget in which we propose to raise an extra £15 million or £16 million we should at the same time give the usual 2/6 to the old age pensioners, the blind persons, and the widows in receipt of a non-contributory pension.  It is not a wonderful thing to spend only £4 million of that sum to increase the social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The general trend of the speeches from the Government side has been to challenge the Opposition that they would not give the money.  That is not entirely correct.  As far as we are concerned for 1963/64, in regard to social welfare payments, we cast a positive vote with the Government for the raising of over £4 million&mdash;in respect of corporation profits tax, amounting to £3 million, in respect of tax evasion proposals, to the extent of £700,000 and in respect of the increase in the tax on profits from rents, to the tune of £600,000.  I do not want to go over the arguments of the last few months about the introduction of the turnover tax, especially as it affects the price of foodstuffs.  As I said, the Government speakers have said: &ldquo;You would not give us the money.&rdquo;  There is no particular merit in saying that that is how Oppositions have behaved in the past.</P>
    <P>I remember one occasion when the prices of cigarettes, tobacco and drink were taxed by the Government of which I was a member and practically all the money thus to be derived it was stated by the Minister for Finance, would be devoted to social welfare improvements. Fianna Fáil, however, had no <Col N="1564" /> hesitation in voting against all those proposals which involved a few million pounds.  I am not going to make a point about that but if we are to be twitted by members of the Government Party, we can point out that Fianna Fáil behaved like that, and always did in every Budget that was introduced when I was a member of the Government. I have not got the figures to hand but Fianna Fáil could well have been accused of being in favour of social welfare increases but were not prepared to give the money.  We are prepared to give much more than the Government want to give so far as social welfare increases are concerned. We were not prepared to do that merely by default but our members walked into the Division Lobby with Fianna Fáil in respect of the taxes I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>What we are concerned with, amongst other things, in the raising of taxation is how the money is to be spent.  We would have been much more enthusiastic about the various Budgets and proposals by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare in the past five or six years, if more tax revenue had been devoted to social welfare recipients.  In recent years, the tendency has been, as far as the figures available to me are concerned, to devote a smaller percentage of the tax revenue towards social welfare. It is a bad trend and whilst it may be said: &ldquo;When you were Minister for Social Welfare, you gave only 2/6 and you did not do anything about this category or that category,&rdquo; I can say that when I was Minister for Social Welfare, when there was an inter-Party Government, a far bigger percentage of tax revenue was devoted to social welfare than has been devoted in the past five or six years.</P>
    <P>Our concern should be the present and the future.  There is nothing I deplore as much as going back even one year, let alone ten years, 15 years or 40 years.  My concern and that of my Party is the present and the future and, in this case, the present as far as these people are concerned and what the future may hold for them.  I would <Col N="1565" /> ask the Minister and the members of his Party, especially those who are not Ministers, to try to ensure that out of the money paid by the taxpayers, a reasonable proportion is devoted to the unemployed, the sick, widows and those who have not sufficient on which to live by reason of old age.</P>
    <P>There is nothing much that we in this House can oppose in respect of this Bill.  However, out of an increase in taxation of £15 million or £16 million, all we can devote is the sum of £4 million per annum and, in this financial year, something like £1¾ million.</P>
    <P>Maybe I have chided too much.  I wanted to congratulate the Minister on the tidying up he has done in this Bill and which he has done since he became Minister.  Deputies come up against very irritating aspects of social welfare from time to time.  There are hundreds and thousands of cases with which the Minister could not expect to cope within a short 12 months or even within many years but to his credit, I would say that even in this Bill, which is concerned with monetary improvement, he has cut out a lot of what people describe as red tape and irritants that seem to be attached to the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be applauded, too, for the changes he has made in respect of the old age pension means test.  It is not the ideal means test and so long as we have means tests, there will never be an ideal one.  However, he has raised the amounts and made certain changes with regard to investments or capital which widows or old age pensioners may have when they apply for these pensions.  Last night, Deputy Tully mentioned all these things and, as I am doing now, he congratulated the Minister on these very excellent improvements.</P>
    <P>An example of an irritant as far as my experience goes was the payment of the total amount of the contributory old age pension to a man who had been separated from his wife for some reason or another.  That is corrected in this Bill.  As far as I can gather from the Minister's speech and from what Deputy Tully said last night, it <Col N="1566" /> means that in certain cases separate payments may be made.</P>
    <P>There are many other changes which I cannot now remember but I noted them last night when I read the Minister's speech and the Minister is to be complimented on them.  He will have our wholehearted support in any monetary or other improvements as far as the social welfare code is concerned. We get into a mess when we talk about raising the money to do all these things but it is not just a question of voting for the money and for the increases as well.  There are many other complications, as was demonstrated in the discussion we had on the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>We believe that to improve the social welfare code moneys should be got other than by taxing what we regard and what we describe as the necessaries of life.  We have demonstrated for years that we will support taxation when we are convinced as members of a political Party that these taxes are raised from the people who can best afford them.  That could lead to a long discussion which I do not want to pursue on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister referred to something that is not in the Bill, namely, the improvements in the wet time payments and of course the consequent increases in contributions.  I do not want to be narky or anything like that but the Minister may have misled the House to some extent.  There was some sort of consultation with the trade union movement but not consultation in such a way that there was agreement between the two bodies&mdash; between the Minister and the Congress of Trade Unions &mdash; before the final figures were published.</P>
    <P>I know it is not for any outside body, and rightly so, to direct the Minister as to what payments should be made in respect of wet time or what the contributions should be. However, I think it ought to be made clear that there was no consultation in the manner of there being an actual agreement between the Minister and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. I would not say they are entirely dissatisfied with the results.  I do not <Col N="1567" /> think these new rates and contributions are in the hands of the officers or the members of the Executive of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as was inferred last night.  These were communicated, I am informed, by telephone to a member of the trade union movement, not necessarily a member of the Executive.  I do not want to make a strong point about that.  These new rates seem to be reasonable and the increases proposed by the Minister do not appear to be unreasonable, either.</P>
    <P>A practice has been followed in respect of new contributions that those who would have no wages would not be asked to contribute as much as those who might be regarded as being in a higher wage bracket.  I notice from the proposals here, in respect of the wage that is paid, the increase in the insurance stamp is the same all round&mdash;an increase of 8d. per week.  It may be only pennies but we should make an effort to preserve the principle of charging an increase for the social welfare benefits somewhat in proportion&mdash;I will not say strictly&mdash; to the wage a man earns.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, the agricultural workers will have to pay an increase of 8d. per week and the wage earner or salary earner who is insurable and who earns twice or three times what the agricultural worker earns has to pay 8d. as well.  As far as I remember, in the past when these new rates were proposed, it was not a flat increase. Some consideration was given to those who could be regarded as being in the lower income group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  They always were.  However, I wonder if the Minister has given consideration to the position of the employer in this?  The principle, which in general is not a bad principle, that one-third would be borne by the employee, one-third by the employer and one-third by the State, has generally been accepted in this House and seems to be reasonably satisfactory.  However, the Minister <Col N="1568" /> might consider, in any future cases, asking the employer to pay a little more than the worker.</P>
      <P>After all, there are many countries where the employer carries a very big share of the cost of social insurance. In this country, it cannot be said that there is an unusually heavy burden on them in carrying one-third of the cost. Apart altogether from legal considerations, I think the employer has a moral responsibility for his workers, especially those who have served him for a long time, in times of sickness, unemployment and old age.</P>
      <P>That is as much as I have to say except again to say that the Minister is to be congratulated on many of the small improvements he has made in our very complicated social insurance code.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to delay the House for only a few minutes but there are a few words I would like to say on this Bill.  First, I would like to say that we welcome this Bill.  It will increase the benefits for existing recipients all round.  Last year the Minister made some amendment in the means test which had the effect of bringing more people into the scheme, particularly small farmers of the west. That is a good thing but the reason I have intervened in the debate is to ask the Minister if it is at all possible for him to investigate the whole question and try to devise a more suitable scheme that will not have the effect of discouraging production amongst the small farmers of the west in general. If he could investigate the matter and, as a result of these investigations, bring some measure into the House to achieve that effect, he would be doing a good day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this Bill, it is right for us to take into account the entire budgetary proposals of the Government.  Everyone in the House will agree that an increase in social welfare benefits is necessary.  No one will gainsay the fact that even if we did not have the budgetary proposals of the Government, it would still be necessary to increase the social <Col N="1569" /> welfare benefits.  I cannot help feeling that they are not adequate to meet the existing circumstances of the people who receive them, even without waiting for the impact of the Budget increases.</P>
      <P>It is an accepted fact that the cost of food is going to go up in every detail under the Budget.  I have been making inquiries amongst those in a position to know what these prices will be and I think it is accepted that the price of butter, one of the most essential food commodities for old and young people, is to increase by 3d. a 1b.  That is only one staple article of diet necessary for nutrition and health.  Can one accept that these proposals are adequate to offset the impact of the burden these people will have to bear in the immediate future? If these proposals go through, as I assume they will, and if the tax is successfully collected, the Government will have a sizeable sum of money at their disposal.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that he is being equitably treated in the amount of money being placed at his disposal, not only to offset the tax impositions but also the gradual and steady rise in the cost of living?  Apart altogether from the Budget, the cost of living is gradually, inexorably and steadily going up.  We welcome this Bill and while we welcome the increases, we feel they are not adequate. I do not suppose that is the fault of the Minister for Social Welfare.  He had to argue his corner in the Cabinet and somebody else was arguing his corner there as well. Yesterday another Minister was in this House looking for money to save a dockyard and I expect the Minister for Social Welfare had to be satisfied with what he got because it was as much as he could get in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I now want to raise a few points in regard to the Bill and to social welfare as a whole. Every Deputy gets larger correspondence and more requisitions relating to social welfare than to any other subject.  We are dealing with the less protected members of the community and we all do our best to meet these individuals and to see that they secure <Col N="1570" /> the benefits to which they are entitled. There are certain sections in this Bill which propose to ease the position in relation to payment of non-contributory pensions and pensions to the old, blind and widows.  This is a matter that needs considerable clarification by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Legislation of this kind carries a rule that a person is entitled to a pension, or a certain percentage of that pension, if he has a certain income.  I find it hard to imagine that that rule can be applied unless very radical concessions are given.  I should not like to feel that those who are administering these Acts are entirely tied by rule to fixed lines of income.  I think the Minister should give some clarification to the House as to how the income is assessed.</P>
    <P>I want to pass on to him one or two cases that have come to my notice. Recently, I had a case of a man and his wife who were drawing an old age pension.  They were both on a small farm which was in the benefit of the elder son to whom it had been transferred. The husband, a thrifty type of person, had saved a certain amount of money.  He also was thrifty in the sense that he insured his wife.  His wife predeceased him by about nine months.  When the man himself died, it was found that, as a result of the insurance and any small savings he had, he had something in the region of £500, which he divided equally among his family.  Then somebody disclosed that fact&mdash;maybe some very efficient official in the district&mdash;and a claim was made on the relatives for back payment of the pension.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give the House clarification.  I know in this case the man had £500, or so I am informed.  What is the rate of income attributable to £500?  There must be a fairly high rate of annual return attributable to that sum in the light of the sum the relatives were asked to restore in payment.  As I know the position, not being a financier myself, if you invest £500 at the very best return you can get&mdash;say, six per cent&mdash; you get £30 per year.  If a man has £500 invested and is getting on that a return of £30 a year, does that <Col N="1571" /> entitle the Department to ask the relatives to pay back the arrears? Both these people were receiving the full pension.</P>
    <P>The reason I cite this case to the House is in an endeavour to put before the House a practical example of what has come to my notice.  I would ask the Minister to clarify what the capital charges are.  How many other cases have come to light?  I do not suppose my correspondence is any more voluminous than that of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party. At the moment, I should imagine, it is rather lighter than the many letters they are receiving on different subjects. I am constantly getting letters about back claims, about the question of farms and so on, about what happens when somebody comes down and values the stock.  Here we have a hard and fast line.  If it is above a certain income, the person is entitled to so much.  How is that line arrived at?  In fairness to Deputies, they should have a full and unequivocal statement from the Minister as to how it is arrived at in relation to money generally and also in relation to the valuation of land.  That would place us all in a very much easier position to advise people generally.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister if he has discretion in the matter.  There are cases where the money may possibly be available, where it may be ground out of the individual concerned or the representatives thereof, but it may involve undue hardship to pay that money.  The Department never follow a case where they know they have no chance of getting it.  You cannot get blood out of a stone.  But there are cases where they find they can get this money by the sale of stock.  There is a widow, maybe, with a small farm who is forced to sell the stock or portion of the land to meet the commitment for back pension.  Has the Minister discretion to say in this case: &ldquo;I feel it would be a question of undue hardship for any money to be repaid.&rdquo; If so, would the Minister give sympathetic hearing to the many such cases that come before him?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" /> There seems to be another principle involved in regard to the old age pension. It is largely tied up with the question of capital assessment.  The thrifty, hardworking person who saves all his life, who may very well rear a family and after that save for the rest of his life, is not eligible for a pension when he comes to 70.  As far as I can make out from my investigations into the non-contributory old age pension, anybody who has any money available in the bank does not seem to get sympathetic consideration.  In fact, under existing legislation, I do not think the Department are allowed to give such a person an old age pension.</P>
    <P>I know of another case of a person who owned a small amount of property.  He owned a house valued at £200, a fishing boat, which somebody valued at £500 but which I think was worth more like £50, and he had a small amount of money in the bank. He was not eligible for the pension.  I know this man was suffering considerable hardship.  He was gradually eating into his savings and was getting worried.  It was having a bad effect on his health generally.  Because he had been thrifty and had saved a bit of money, he did not appear to be entitled to any pension.  The best information I could get from the Department was that, when his savings were absorbed, he would be entitled to a pension.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is the sort of legislation we should introduce in this country.  If we have that sort of legislation, the Minister should have full discretion to tell the House, as I hope he will be able to tell the House, that he will give more sympathetic consideration to such cases.  The reason I mention these cases and expand on them is that I feel legislation passed here has to be administered by the civil servants.  It is not their fault. They are given certain legislation and they have to administer it.  But when you are dealing with social welfare or medical benefits, anything that covers the wide range of social services, the personal element enters into it.  If the Minister has discretion, he should use it with all the power he has.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which <Col N="1573" /> I have found a good deal of dissatisfaction&mdash;the matter of the reciprocal arrangements we have with the United Kingdom with reference to benefits here.  Some sort of reciprocal agreement has been hammered out.  I am told it is the best terms we could get here.  I find in many cases of benefits due that people who have been in England have considerable difficulty and delay in getting these benefits. The Department of Social Services in the United Kingdom has to be written to.  Very often it is about two months before they reply.  Then the matter has to be referred back and everything has to be checked up.  It is very often found that the information sent is inadequate because the person concerned may have worked in several places.</P>
    <P>As we have so many of these cases, would it not be possible for the Minister to approach at political level&mdash; because it is only at political level anything can be done rapidly&mdash;his opposite number in the United Kingdom?  Unfortunately, there are thousands of Irish workers in the United Kingdom.  Some of them come back and get further employment here.  When they get back they find they may have a few months' benefit here.  That has to be checked on the other side.  Would it not be possible for the Minister to set up a liaison by direct representation to his opposite number in the United Kingdom to ensure that these cases will be cleared as quickly as possible?  I think it will be found to be a great saving of time for his officials if there is some direct contact through his Department where I presume there is some section dealing with this&mdash;and probably with a lot of other things. There are sufficient cases of this type to make it worth while to see that the money is paid as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is not right that a person who has had to go to work in England and who comes back here, gets a job and is subsequently laid up should have to wait ten, 11 or 12 weeks before getting a penny from anybody.  He must go on outdoor relief to maintain himself, something which such people do not like.  If they are paying insurance <Col N="1574" /> and entitled to benefit, they should be able to get it.  My experience is that anything on a political level with goodwill on both sides can be agreed.  I do not think there is any use in letter-writing: it is well worth a trip by the Minister to meet his opposite number in the United Kingdom to see if he can settle things to everyone's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has no jurisdiction over workmen's compensation but I want to mention this <i>vis-à-vis</i> social benefits.  It often happens that a man meets with an accident and is paid a compensatory sum of a few hundred pounds.  There is usually commutation of the sum concerned.  He goes back to work with a different employer. This is a case of which I heard only this morning.  The man was regularly insured and his insurance paid.  He met with another accident and was duly paid workmen's compensation for a short period.  Then the matter was re-examined and the doctors discovered that he was not a case for workmen's compensation but national health insurance.  His employer made a claim for national health insurance and was told this man had received a compensatory sum as a result of an accident&mdash;not the same accident.  I appreciate it was a mistake in the Department and that they thought it was the same.  This man actually got £200 and he appeared not to be entitled to national health insurance. Would the Minister clarify the position regarding these situations which constantly occur?  I get them quite often.</P>
    <P>If a man gets a compensatory sum, how is that set off against national health insurance benefit?  If he receives £200, must he wait until the amount he would have received in health insurance to cover the sum he has had for compensation is paid, before he is entitled to any other benefit?  These are everyday points and I do not know if the Minister has authority to deal with such cases.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Department of Social Welfare.  I seem to have an unusual amount of work with that Department and an unusual number of complicated cases.  I have <Col N="1575" /> always found that they meet me in every possible way but there are some cases where they are hidebound by restrictions in laws that we pass in Dáil Éireann.  I suggest the Minister should use any powers he has to the fullest extent wherever it is possible for him to intervene to mitigate cases of undue hardship.</P>

      <P>Taking up the point mentioned by the previous speaker, the Bill provides for certain changes in the method of calculating means for old age pension purposes and also for widows' and orphans' pension purposes.  The present method of calculation is to exclude the first £25 of the capital involved, to take 5 per cent of the next £300 and 10 per cent of any remaining capital.  This Bill proposes to exclude £100&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one side-effect to that which I would like to mention.  Under the present system where old age pensioners are concerned, the £25 exclusion is maintained.  I should hope that in time the Minister will be able to increase that figure at least to the amount which will exclude the cost of a decent Christian burial.</P>
      <P>The point mentioned by Deputy Corish and others in regard to the compensatory aspect of the Bill is one I should deal with at least briefly.  It is a question of fact as to whether those people who are entitled to social benefit will be better or worse off as a result of the combined effect of the turnover tax and this Bill.  Deputy Corish is on record with others as saying that this Bill will not compensate social recipients in full.  That is not so.  If Deputy Corish and others were right, it would mean that an old age pensioner spends in cash over the counter more than £5 per week.  I do not believe that is so.  It should not be necessary to waste time on statements or allegations here which are capable of being examined factually. So far as social recipients are concerned, this Bill will more than compensate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> In reply to Deputy Dillon whose woolly and derisive speech was the only blemish on this debate, I say without fear of contradiction that the small farmers are certainly compensated by this Bill.  I have always had misgivings in connection with old age pensions on the score that 35/- per week has differing values, depending on the background of the person who receives it.  If I appear to be speaking against people who live in the country, I do not intend it.  I am merely expressing what I believe is the truth. An old age pensioner and his wife living in the country are usually entitled to a right of residence, a right of support, clothing and maintenance in the farm dwelling.  Their counterparts in the town are not usually in that position.  People living in the country have free turf, free milk, free vegetables and free food generally, whereas those in urban areas very often must pay for these items.  Thirty-five shillings to them does not represent nearly as much in benefit as it does to their counterparts in the country.  For that reason, I would approve of the suggestion made by Deputy Tully here last night that, in certain cases anyway, home assistance should not be taken away from old age pensioners automatically on becoming 70.  This should apply particularly to people in urban areas and towns who have not the benefit of the rights and privileges I have mentioned already.</P>
    <P>With regard to the farming community generally, I have some proposals, which I hope are constructive, to offer to the Minister, here again, in contrast to the sneering and unconstructive approach of the shadow Minister for Social Welfare who spoke last night.  It seems to me that Deputy Geoghegan was right when he said that the object of the Department of Social Welfare ought to be not to discourage social progress on the land. Take, for instance, a person with five or six children who is living on a holding with a valuation under £4.  If that man either purchases or is given by the Land Commission extra land which takes his valuation over £4, then he automatically becomes disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance <Col N="1577" /> during a certain portion of the year, and that irrespective of whether he is single or married or, if married, has no children or very many.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister will agree that in time some alteration must be made in this system.  Of course, our object should be ultimately to wipe out unemployment assistance altogether by removing the necessity for it, but, as the law stands, no distinction is made between a person who is single and the person who has a number of children.  Take, for instance, a single person who is just under the means test ceiling and, therefore, qualifies for dole <i>vis-à-vis</i> a married man with six children whose means are just over the ceiling.  The Minister is not empowered to make any allowance for the fact that this man has a large family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That was changed last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware it was changed.  To come back to the point I mentioned about the local authority valuation, which still certainly applies, a man may be anxious to improve his position in life and to provide for his wife and family to the best of his ability.  He is placed in a fearful dilemma because, if he takes this extra piece of land, then he cuts himself off from unemployment assistance during the summer months and he simply cannot get on without it. It is no use pretending that because a person's valuation increases from £3 15s. to £4 5s., he has ceased to be poor and becomes able to support his large family.  I hope, therefore, some method will be found of taking this situation into account.  I believe that is what Deputy Geoghegan had in mind when he said that nothing in the social welfare code should operate to become a barrier to increased production on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the administrative machinery which has been mentioned by previous speakers, I wish to join with them in congratulating the Minister on his achievements since he took up office in this regard.  There are still a number of improvements which can be effected.  One of them would require <Col N="1578" /> a change in the law and is, therefore, at present outside the Minister's power, that is, the recovery of overpayments from people or from their estates when they are dead.</P>
    <P>At present the Minister is under a statutory obligation, pursuant to a law now over 50 years old, to go after and recover these overpayments.  My personal belief is that in the process, the Department of Social Welfare is not gaining money but is losing it.  I have no figures for that and I am hazarding a guess, but I believe that if it were examined, it would be found that the recovery of these overpayments is, in fact, an uneconomic proposition but, that aside, it seems to me to be wrong that the Minister should be under a statutory obligation, no matter what the circumstances, no matter what the merits of the case, to recover these moneys.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, urge the Minister to include as soon as possible a provision in the law which will no longer make that obligatory on him and which will leave it at the Minister's discretion as to whether or not action should be taken.  There are, of course, certain cases of deliberate fraud but these are few enough.  The Minister certainly should have the power in such cases to recover any money obtained from the State by such fraud.</P>
    <P>In regard to the transfer of land by older people to their sons, there is still the provision that enables the Department to exclude people who transfer their land for the sole purpose of qualifying for the old age pension. That is wrong.  Very many people do transfer their lands for the purpose of qualifying for the old age pension and do qualify for it.  I find it difficult to know how the Department can distinguish between them and decide that a particular person has transferred his land to his son for the purpose of qualifying for the old age pension and how can they separate one from the other.  It is highly desirable from a social point of view that land should be transferred by elderly people to their sons.  It is an encouragement to their sons and daughters to marry and stay on the land.  The time has come when <Col N="1579" /> old people should be encouraged, with the social objects I have mentioned, to transfer their land, while, at the same time, being assured that there is no danger of their being disqualified from receiving the old age pension.</P>
    <P>With regard to the non-contributory old age pension, there seems to be a good deal of confusion.  I do not suggest this is the fault of the Department, but one has come across cases where two people, who worked side by side all their lives, applied for contributory old age pensions, and one received it and the other was turned down, or given a lesser amount.  In many of these cases, it seems to me that the records available to the Department are not complete.  As things stand, I do not think there is much the Minister can do about it.</P>
    <P>In Britain, when a person is some distance short of the necessary contributions, the Ministry of Pensions advise him that on payment of a lump sum, which will make up the difference, he will qualify for a contributory pension.  I recommend to the Minister that some such system should be introduced here so that applicants a little short of the level for a contributory old age pension will be enabled to qualify on payment of a lump sum. In Britain, too, the information to which I have referred is volunteered to the prospective applicant.  He does not have to go searching for it, or looking for somebody to find out for him; he is merely told that on payment of a certain amount of money, his contribution record will be complete and will enable him to qualify for a full pension.</P>
    <P>With regard again to contributory old age pensions, I should hope that the Minister will be as lenient as possible where he is satisfied that the records, for some reason, are incomplete, either through the negligence of the employer or, in some cases, of the applicant himself.  In rare cases, it seems to me that some records which should be available in the Department are not, in fact, there.  Knowing the Minister, I feel sure he will take all these factors into account.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the changes <Col N="1580" /> made in this Bill to alleviate the means test, to make provision for an allowance for the first child, to provide for increased social insurance benefits, and all the other very laudable alterations in the Bill.  I feel that this is only a first instalment and that the Minister will, in time, not merely increase all these benefits still further but alter the entire structure of social assistance schemes for the benefit of the rural community in particular.</P>
    <P>None of us is happy about the present level of social welfare benefits. Everyone of us would like deserving people to receive more.  It is the object of this Party to give them more as the national income expands.  It is rather unfair of Deputy Corish to suggest that more could be given at the present time.  I do not believe more could be given when one takes into account all the increased payments that have to be met by the Exchequer &mdash;increases that everybody asks for, the Garda, who are entitled to their increase, and everybody else in the community.  While we are not satisfied, I think it cannot be said that we are not doing our best.  Certainly it cannot be said that the Minister is not doing his best since he took up office in the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill.  It is one of very great importance and it contains some very commendable provisions.  With regard to social welfare generally, there is one rather extraordinary feature.  If a man in my constituency goes over to England, to earn any amount of money in complete safety, returning here at some later date, he can avail of all the social welfare benefits available under this Bill, particularly unemployment assistance.  If, however, a man stays at home, instead of going to England, and takes a currach out into the treacherous seas around my constituency, he is immediately deprived of unemployment assistance.  That, in my opinion, should not happen.  It is something the Minister should remedy because it is grossly unfair that such a man should be penalised for his industry here.  I appeal to the Minister to adopt a sensible approach in such cases.  All <Col N="1581" /> his next door neighbour has to do is to report him, to say whether he was out or not, and then a young brat of an investigating officer can come along and have that man's unemployment assistance stopped.  It is very unfair.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that during the past few months I have asked a number of questions about the unemployment assistance problem in my county.  The Minister has not gone even one perch along the road.  Surely I put it into his mouth by asking these questions that there is something wrong.  I do not ask questions lightly.  There is something radically wrong.  It was decided to remove a certain number of investigating officers and we had hoped that the Minister was doing a good day's work, but what is happening now? Another set of these young men have come along.  They have decided that they are going to let the Minister and his Department know that they are very important people.  The only way they can do that is by going around and inflating poor people's means and thereby reducing their unemployment assistance.  This is a grave injustice to people where no work is available.  I would ask the Minister to look carefully into this matter which requires investigation.</P>
      <P>With regard to insurance, if a man goes out and works one hour with the county council, the Board of Works, or the Land Commission, the insurance stamp is affixed for that week and he reaps very substantial benefits as a result.  But let us take the man who sets out in the currach, the frail type of boat which operates off Mayo.  He is a share fisherman, or a part-time fisherman, and he gets no stamp at all. That is wrong.  I am aware of the fact that a share fisherman can affix a stamp but I am also aware of the poor benefit he obtains as a result.  Once it is known that a man has genuinely gone out as a share fisherman, or a seasonal or part-time fisherman, he should be able to have stamps affixed and should be in at least as good a position as the man who works in the county council quarry or along the road for a few hours one day a week and draws substantial benefits as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is probably difficult to <Col N="1582" /> introduce fishing into a matter dealing with social welfare but the fact remains that we have one Minister trying to develop fishing and we have another Minister making it almost impossible for him to carry out that development because there is no social justice in this.  I want to bring this to the Minister's notice so that he will take steps to have the matter remedied.  He has already informed me that the matter is being investigated but it is time some conclusion was arrived at.  I would suggest that when the final decision is reached, it should be on the side of the man who risks his life in the Atlantic to make his living instead of leaving the country.</P>
    <P>It may appear to many people in the midlands or in the east that the people in the west of Ireland get social welfare payments which do not appear to be just, but I live in an area where workers are migratory and go to England.  Are we to put them in the position in which they will remain permanently in England or keep them as migratory workers?  We would be doing a grave injustice if we left them in the position they are in.  Many of them are married men who return to their homes and it is only fair that they should be paid unemployment assistance when they return.  It is a very good incentive to them to return.  The present system of going into their means should come to an end.</P>
    <P>If a man goes to England in April or May and returns at the end of the year, not only does he bring back a substantial amount of money but while he is away, he sends back substantial amounts also.  That is a great contribution to the State.  That man should not be penalised for doing that.  If he had to live in the State, he would have to be maintained at Government expense.  If he comes back now and brings back a second-hand television set, or a radio, and if his neighbour does not like him and reports him, then this investigating officer &mdash; who probably never got enough to eat himself &mdash; calls on him and the man is deprived of unemployment assistance.  It is a shocking state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister if he intended <Col N="1583" /> to continue accepting anonymous letters as a method of operating his Department and to my amazement, he said yes, that he was still going to give credence to anonymous letters.  Surely in a Catholic and Christian country it is a shocking state of affairs that the Minister, or even the lowest official in his Department, is going to be influenced by anonymous letters.  I have one way of dealing with anonymous letters &mdash; and goodness knows, I got enough of them in the past few weeks. What I do is put the letter into an envelope and sent it without a stamp to the man who is reported in it and when he gets it, he will very soon find out who reported him.  It is the right way to deal with such letters.  I would ask the Minister to put an end to the status of the anonymous writer.  It is unfortunately this Minister's Department which receives most of the anonymous letters.  He should realise that practically all these letters about people are written for spite and as long as they are effective and the people know they are effective, they will be written.  I would ask the Minister to be big enough to give a directive to the people within his Department to throw anonymous letters into the wastepaper basket.</P>
    <P>With regard to the contributory old age pension, which is certainly a very significant step in the social welfare advance, I want to say there is something wrong.  The Act under which it is operated is very liberal, but, on the other hand, up to 1947 or 1948, the records of insurance contributions, on which that Act is based, are not substantial and are of a very doubtful type.  I know the Minister has been quite liberal in his dealing with applicants for contributory old age pensions. On the other hand, I am also aware that many people perfectly entitled to a pension are not getting it because the records are missing.  In the past, we had a whole conglomeration of national health insurance societies operating in this country.  A very peculiar thing happened.  People did not regard an insurance stamp as worth a penny, not to mind fourpence <Col N="1584" /> which is what it was worth in Ireland in 1932.  Consequently, they did not bother their heads about whether or not they handed in an insurance card.</P>
    <P>What happened with people who worked for county councils, the Land Commission or the Office of Public Works was that they did not bother handing in an insurance card.  When pay-day came in these offices, somebody was sent out to the local post office where the insurance cards were then available.  That person collected the cards, wrote the name of the person concerned on the card and stuck a stamp on it but there was no insurance number.  Eventually, these cards found themselves in the Custom House.  Today, nobody can trace the names of the people concerned or the cards or the numbers as there were no numbers on them.  That is causing very grave concern in many parts of this country.</P>
    <P>The local national health insurance agent of that day probably did not bother his head at all.  A man came into him to join the society.  He was not known even to exist.  It was only when the point was reached that it was known that the national health agent was paid on the basis of the number of his clients that he became active. Some of them did not become active at all: some did.  When they became active, they went out to the workers and found out who were working but, where it was an old man or somebody like that, the agent did not bother his head at all.  In many cases he was probably a shopkeeper or something like that.  As a result, and as these records are not available, many people today are not obtaining a contributory old age pension.  It might not be much to an ordinary single man but take a fellow of 70 years who is married to a young lassie of 50, as happens in my part of the country.  The widow is suffering there.  She is not as valuable as she should be and he is not as valuable to her as he should be.  This is very serious.  I would ask the Minister to make known to us publicly what steps we can now take to rectify that very obvious wrong.  I am sure we can find a way out of it.  Any money he spends on old age pensioners and on <Col N="1585" /> keeping a bit of harmony in the house is money well spent.</P>
    <P>Another matter also causing a great deal of concern to many people in many areas with regard to unemployment assistance and verification of evidence of unemployment is that the very same system is operated in the wilds of Erris and on the bogs of Donegal as is operated in Dublin city. Surely that is crazy.  Surely a man living in Dublin who is unemployed is doing nothing and probably the bit of exercise in walking daily to the employment exchange or elsewhere to give evidence of unemployment is good exercise and does him no harm.</P>
    <P>But, out in the country, the ordinary farmer with a small little farm with a valuation of less than £4 is entitled, if he is married, to avail himself of unemployment assistance the whole year round if he cannot get employment.  If that man is living within roughly two miles of the employment exchange he must walk into the town, because such offices are only in towns, every day of the week.  I know a fellow who walks that distance every day of the week for one shilling.  That means that he makes six visits in the week for a rate of 2d. per day.  He has a bit of land.  If he remained at home and only dug the weeds out of his land I am sure he would do himself more justice than to go into the town every day for the sake of one shilling a week.  But, if he does not do so, when he reaches the age for the contributory old age pension he will be out&mdash;therefore he has to keep coming in.  He is caught every way.</P>
    <P>It does not matter whether it is one shilling or 20 shillings, the thing is a cod anyway.  If he lived, say, six miles from the employment exchange the position would be completely different.  The Gardaí would be sent out to accept his signature just one day in the week for the same benefit or perhaps an increased benefit or, if that did not happen, he would be permitted to sign evidence of unemployment on the day of the week when he came in to collect the money.</P>
    <P>This is so absurd that I do not believe the Minister knows about it. Indeed, if he did he would surely do <Col N="1586" /> something about it.  When a man comes into town he meets a few friends and he spends his day there.  His day is wasted.  He cannot cut his turf.  But his neighbour a few miles away, who is not subject to this rule, goes in probably one or two days a week, or not at all, and can use the rest of his time in improving his farm, as he should.</P>
    <P>We have reached a position, according to this, that the man near the employment exchange is regarded as a crook and must come in every day and sign that he is unemployed while the man living five or six miles away from the employment exchange &mdash; he is a decent man, I have no doubt&mdash;does not have to come in at all because the Gardaí go out.  That is an extraordinary position.</P>
    <P>I brought this matter to the notice of the Leader of the Labour Party.  I pointed out to him that he was representing these people and that it might be thought that I was trying to make political capital out of the situation and so I told him that he is the man who should raise the matter.  I am raising it now.  I am not pressing the case to make anything out of it but I would ask the Minister to look into this absurd position.  It makes no difference to me what the people of Dublin or any other city may do.  I do not have to answer to those people but I have to answer to the people in my constituency.  Surely it is an absurdity?</P>
    <P>When saying all this, I am speaking against myself because I live in a town. When I say people should not come in every day, I do myself a bad turn because I keep a publichouse.  The oftener they come in, the better for me.  However, I would not be honest or fair or just if I did not say that a grave injustice is being imposed on these poor people.  It is an absolute absurdity that they should have to come in every day for a few shillings. During the recess, the Minister should go around country areas similar to the one from which I come and make inquiries.  He will find out that what I am saying is absolutely correct.</P>
    <P>I am glad the turnover tax has gone <Col N="1587" /> through because I believe it is definitely going to improve our social welfare services.  Unfortunately, we are now reaching the position in which the social welfare services will become the prerogative of the rich man, if we are not very careful.  We are now reaching the point at which we are overlooking the very poor man and it seems that, at a time at which the national economy is expanding, and many people are making plenty of money and getting away with murder, the poor man is likely to be overlooked.</P>
    <P>Instead of worrying too much about unemployment benefit, disability benefit and all the other benefits under which a few shillings a week are paid, we should think of the fellow who has to live on unemployment assistance. Instead of sending out a crowd of little blackguards who probably never had enough to eat themselves to inflate the means of these people, we should send out some commonsense people to investigate their means or, rather, to ignore their means.  We should be more realistic in our approach to these applicants for unemployment assistance. These people are the worst off elements of our community and it is time, at this stage, that the Minister succeeded in getting a different approach to them.</P>
    <P>They are not well off.  They have very little means.  If an investigation officer from Tipperary is sent to Mayo and if he values the Mayo man's cow at the same value as the Tipperary man's cow, he is not being just to these people.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter as soon as he can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Deputy who has just concluded remark that he welcomes the turnover tax and, at the same time, reveal such defects in the social welfare code is rather farcical.  The increase in social welfare benefits under this Bill follows the pattern of previous years, a pattern of a half a crown a week for old age pensioners, the unemployed and the sick.  The innovation is the 5/- increase <Col N="1588" /> for the first child in the family in the children's allowances.  These are the increases we have been used to in the past.</P>
      <P>One would have expected that, having regard to the intention of the Government to impose a tax on foodstuffs, a turnover tax that will bring in at least £11 million a year, and having regard to the colossal burden this turnover tax will involve in increased costs of the essentials of life, food, fuel and clothing, the Government would have done something more to ease this burden which will be out of all proportion to the additional benefits that are being offered.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that already there has been an increase in the cost of living this year to the extent of about six points.  Surely an increase of 2/6 a week is not adequate to compensate for that increase in the cost of living? Added to that we have the genuine fears of stiff increases in prices stemming from the turnover tax.  The Government hope that the shopkeepers will absorb this tax and that, if they cannot do that, they will increase commodity prices by only 6d. in the £.  It is the belief of the Labour Party that this tax on foodstuffs is giving unbridled licence to the profiteers of this country to increase their prices.</P>

      <P>We are now discussing social welfare.  The Deputy seems to be dealing with a measure that has already passed through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating, as other Deputies have done, the cost of living to social welfare benefits.  I am entitled to advert to the fact that the cost of living, instead of being increased by 2½ per cent will be increased by five per cent or seven per cent.  To suggest that social welfare beneficiaries are adequately compensated in these circumstances is absurd. It is not merely absurd; it is perpetuating a fraud on the most underprivileged section of our community. The 2/6 a week for our old aged, for our sick and unemployed, has already been absorbed by the increase in the cost of living and the standard of life of those people must be reduced still <Col N="1589" /> further, down to a bare subsistence level by reason of the new impositions in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Even the family which can now look forward to the 10/- for the first child must realise that the 10/- they are being given by the Government, on the one hand is being taken from them on the other, by the known fact that on 1st Novermber there will be an increase in the prices of food, fuel and clothing, and of every essential of life they must buy.</P>
      <P>There are certain defects in the social welfare code which are greatly to be deplored.  The Minister consulted with the employers' federation and the trade unions on the question of wet time.  Has the Minister taken cognisance of the appeals from the Congress of Irish Unions, trades councils and so on for a substantial increase in social welfare benefits?  A halfcrown is worthless in these times. It is a miserable pittance to offer anyone. Can anyone name any essential of life that can be purchased nowadays for half a crown?  Having regard to the depreciation in money which has taken place since 1939, the £1 to-day is worth approximately 11/8d.  It has been truly said that the increases which the various Governments have given to the social welfare beneficiaries over the past 30 years have amounted in all to 1/3d. or, at most, 1/6d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There does not seem to be a genuine understanding of the needs of these people.  When we compare these benefits with the benefits given to the sick, the unemployed, the widowed and the orphaned in other countries, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves as a Christian State.  Those of us who have communed with our fellow-countrymen across the Border are deeply conscious and proud of the manner in which those sections of the community are cared for by the Government under which they are now forced to live.  Their position is far superior to that of their counterparts in the Twenty-Six Counties.  That they are well cared for is reflected in the number of homes for the aged and special cheap entertainment and other facilities, which indicate that such countries <Col N="1590" /> as England and the continental countries have a real understanding of how the aged should be treated.  We in this young nation have a particular responsibility to look after our aged. The people now forced to exist on 32/6d. a week are the men and women who made possible the freedom we enjoy today and our right to speak in our own Parliament.  Many of those people are living alone in abject poverty.  Many more have been forced to flee into county homes, which are full to the doors.  I cannot get an additional bed in the county home in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to join the Common Market, the people we now seek to help would be helped out of all proportion to what is being done for them now.  They would be given a dignity, status and remuneration by the State comparable with that of their counterparts living in the EEC countries.  Apart from the economic effects of the Common Market, we look forward with hope and enthusiasm to the great uplift it will bring to the social welfare classes.</P>
      <P>There are certain penal clauses in the social welfare code which I greatly deplore.  We have appealed to the Minister on many occasions to make the old age pension available at the age of 65.  We know of no good reason why he should not accede to that request.  It may be true that people are living longer nowadays, but the rigours of life are such that many are forced to retire at 65.  I appeal to the Minister to heed the appeal of the Congress of Irish Unions speaking for such a large percentage of the people and to seriously consider making the old age pension available at 65.  He may well find that the cost to the Exchequer would not be as considerable as many people suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have acted on old age pension committees down the country realise that the means test as applied to non-contributory old age pensions is unfair, inequitable and unjust in every sense.  It is infuriating to <Col N="1591" /> see an extensive farmer, possibly with a valuation of £100 and many more thousands in the bank, being awarded a non-contributory old age pension, when a person who finds it extremely difficult to exist fails to get the pension. The code ordains that if a farmer purports to hand over his farm to his son or some other relative, he is automatically entitled to the old age pension.  We do not object to the transfer of his property, which is a laudable thing, but the inference is that he is being turned out of his home and that he has to fend for himself on 32/6 a week.  Of course, the contrary is true.  He continues to live, and rightly so, in the luxury of that farm and to be maintained by his children. On the other hand, it is a most infuriating experience for us to see ordinary people, whose sufferings and hardship are intimately known to us, turned down on the basis of the means test because they are £1 or £2 over the stipulated amount.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister continues to have regard to income emanating from outside the country. I have particularly in mind the case of an ex-British soldier in my town. Because he got a small increase in his British Army pension which brought him above the statutory limit under the means test, he lost his old age pension.  Is that fair or just?  On the other hand, we see people with property, farmers or those with a considerable amount of money invested, receiving old age pensions.  That system is unfair, inequitable and unjust.  We are grateful to see the day when social welfare contributors can claim an old age pension as a fundamental right irrespective of means.  The Labour Benches welcome that.  The Minister should liberalise the means test and see that there is not this cheeseparing in the manner of assessing means which now exists and which has been responsible for many people being refused pensions, having them reduced or losing them through having a few shillings over and above the stipulated amount.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that the ramification of the whole system in regard to unemployment benefits is directed <Col N="1592" /> against the applicants.  The social welfare code makes it extremely difficult for applicants to obtain benefit. If a person is dismissed, although it may be a wrong dismissal&mdash;perhaps due to an overbearing attitude of a boss or foreman&mdash;that person is penalised for six weeks.  He must appeal against that decision and go through the ignominy of a special court set up for that purpose&mdash;the appeals court. Whatever reasons there may be for losing his job he is denied benefit until the Minister's Department are satisfied that the reasons for his dismissal were good in their opinion.  If a man leaves employment, as many of us are forced to do because of bad conditions or wages or tyrannical superiors, he also is penalised and will not receive benefit for six weeks.</P>
    <P>What are these people expected to do for six weeks?  If they are married it involves great hardship and mental torment in regard to getting the wherewithal to live for themselves and their families.  When the appeal is heard you either get benefit or you do not or you get part of the benefit claimed. It is particularly deplorable that emigrants who return perhaps with the possibility of getting a job here or to visit a sick relative, even though they have stamped cards in this country for 20 or 30 years are debarred at employment exchanges in this country. Their appearance is resented.  I feel the code is so arranged as to make it extremely difficult for the applicant to get benefit and that the primary purpose and ulterior motive behind it is to keep down to the minimum the number of persons registered as unemployed at any given time.  Those who return from England and seek what they are legitimately entitled to are told: &ldquo;Nothing here for you&mdash;go away. You can appeal against it.&rdquo;  They get no benefit.  They sign on interminably and many of them are forced in the end to borrow their fare back to England.  That, it seems, is what is desired: that they should not be given any opportunity of replacing their roots in their home town and looking for a job there.  I know this is a fact. Many of my colleagues who come back for genuine reasons are so frustrated in the employment exchanges that they <Col N="1593" /> could not remain, due to hunger and hardship and affront that they never expected from a Christian State and had to return to the welfare state in Britain where they are well cared for.</P>
    <P>We know no good reason why there should be a three-day waiting period. It was a good social welfare Minister who reduced the period from six to three: it would be a very good Minister who would eliminate it altogether. It is particularly injurious to short-time workers on three or four days a week and people in haphazard employment. They suffer greatly as a result of this stipulation.  Because of the magnificent machinery of the Department for the payment of claims, by and large&mdash; and I must pay tribute to that&mdash;claims are attended to with speed and efficiency. The difficulty of securing benefit has been largely eliminated once a genuine claim is made.  That being so, it is high time to eliminate the three-day waiting period altogether and pay those people for any days on which they are obliged to sign as unemployed.</P>
    <P>Deputies Corish and Tully will have adverted to the fact that increases in social welfare of this kind are looked forward to with some joy by these recipients, particularly the most destitute element in our society, those who must call on home assistance to sustain them in addition to any social benefits they may be entitled to.  Having conceded the 2/6 increase to a widow and to an unemployed man, I appeal to the Minister to make clear by public statement that it is not intended that these recipients of home assistance should have their allowance reduced or interfered with in any way as a result of the increases given in this Bill.  Otherwise, these increases will be undone by the home assistance officers withdrawing the assistance. What happened in the past is likely to happen this time unless the Minister intervenes.  It is not enough for the Minister to say that it is a matter for the local authority or for the county managers.  The county managers are waiting for their cue from the Minister and, unless the Minister makes a statement, I know that whatever the Minister gives in this respect will be <Col N="1594" /> taken from them by the home assistance officers.</P>
    <P>Likewise it was a very sad revelation to us to learn that, by reason of the manner in which those people in our county homes are paid for, whatever benefits they may have by way of pension are, in the main, taken over by the local authority.</P>

      <P>Another defect in respect of recipients of unemployment benefit is a flagrant one which I am sure has been brought to the Minister's attention on many occasions, that is, that those people who because they are indirectly involved in a strike are denied unemployment benefit.  It is perhaps understandable enough, if one is legitimately on strike and in receipt of strike pay, that one should not be conceded unemployment benefit in these circumstances.  However, it is wrong that other groups of workers, men who are locked out as a result of a strike, who are indirectly involved, have no responsibility for the strike, or perhaps do not condone it, should be victimised under the social welfare code.  We believe these people, having been locked out of a job, are entitled <Col N="1596" /> to unemployment benefit.  It is an antiworking class piece of legislation, an anti-working class bias, which lays down that these people who are locked out as a result of a strike, however far they may be removed from it, should be denied benefit. That is something to which the Labour Party take complete exception and on which they will agitate until the Minister realises his responsibility to such people.</P>
      <P>It has been alleged from the Government benches that the Labour Party voted against increases in social welfare benefits.  That allegation is completely unfounded and is an attempt to slander this Party, as has been done in the past.  The measure which we opposed with all the vigour and determination at our disposal was the turnover tax and the whole country understands fully our reasons for that action.  Let me say in passing that we also supported the Government's proposals in many other respects, particularly in relation to corporation profits tax and other such measures in the Finance Bill which more than provided for the amount of social welfare money required to implement these increases this year.</P>
      <P>It is to be regretted from our side of the House that, when there has been all this vain boasting and pretence from the Government Party that they and they alone are the people who are concerned about social welfare beneficiaries and that they and they alone are the people who have given any worthwhile increases to them, the plain facts are that the amount of money from the national Exchequer being expended on social welfare is falling annually.  The Government are becoming less and less generous in the manner in which they deal with these categories of persons.  That is evidenced by the fact that these persons are getting less and less of the national cake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We as the Labour Party say that in the priority of things, these are the people who should be helped most, who should get a greater share of the national estate which they helped to create in younger life, which they helped to create and are now old, <Col N="1597" /> which they helped to create and are perhaps thrown on the unemployment scrapheap or are now ill, which can happen to any of us.  In those circumstances, it is deplorable that less and less money is being allocated from Government sources to these beneficiaries. The 5/- increase for family people and the 2/6 increase for others is inadequate when the cost of living has been increased out of all proportion by the recent piece of legislation in this House.</P>
    <P>If the Government were really sincere in their determination to assist these people, knowing that they were going to increase the cost of living as a result of the Budget proposals, they should have provided in this Social Welfare Bill an increase of at least 10/- for the aged, the widowed and the unemployed and increased children's allowances substantially.  The proposals before us here today are totally inadequate to compensate all these categories of persons, first, for the increase in the cost of living which has already taken place and, secondly, for the colossal increase in the cost of living which is bound to result from the turnover tax when it is implemented on the 1st November.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMedler" hpid="Mr. Medlar Mr. Medlar">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Medlar</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Deputies, welcome the increases in the various social welfare benefits outlined in this measure.  The previous speaker made a Border-Partition speech.  He went to great lengths to point out that the social welfare benefits paid over the Border were superior to ours.  Benefits are generally paid in accordance with capacity of those who have to pay them.  This is an agricultural country, producing, we are told, 80 per cent of the national wealth.  The Deputy should have compared the prices obtaining for agricultural commodities here with those obtaining across the Border. He should have given us the other side of the picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real purpose of my intervention in this debate is to appeal to the Minister on behalf of a very small section of the community.  I refer to the child dependants of the non-contributory old age pensioner.  I understand that the children of all other <Col N="1598" /> beneficiaries under the social welfare code get benefits but the children of the non-contributory old age pensioner do not.  I would ask the Minister in equity to give their case sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>And also the contributory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMedler" hpid="Mr. Medlar Mr. Medlar">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Medlar</NameTxt>
      <P>In many of these cases, the wives of the non-contributory old age pensioners have young families and are constrained to work on neighbouring farms in order to supplement the family income.  Those earnings are taken into consideration by the investigation officer when making his report. This is a matter that should be remedied.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker accused the Government of being insincere.  He told us that the two per cent turnover tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>2½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMedler" hpid="Mr. Medlar Mr. Medlar">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Medlar</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;plus the general increase in the cost of living would amount to six per cent.  On my calculation, the 2/6 increase on the 32/6 per week pension represents an increase of 7½ per cent.  Finally, I appeal to the Minister to give the cases I have mentioned sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced by the Minister by reason of the recent attack by the Government on the living costs of the very poor.  It is because the Government in their Budget and consequential financial legislation decided to tax the food of those in receipt of State assistance that this measure has had to be introduced here.  It would be a better thing if a measure of this kind had been introduced by reason of the recognition by the Government of the principle of social justice and the social need of those who have to depend on assistance from the State for their continued existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that, if the Government in their Budget and their financial legislation had not decided to tax the food of the poor, this miserable measure we are discussing now would never have seen the light of day. It is brought in by the Minister on <Col N="1599" /> behalf of the Government, by a Minister who is somewhat ashamed of what has been done to the living costs of the very poor in recent weeks.  It is intended to alleviate in some measure the injustice that has been done.  As an individual Deputy, so far as I can see, it does not appear that this measure is either adequate or sufficient for the purpose for which it is presumably designed.</P>
    <P>We are put in the situation in this House now that we cannot as individual Deputies amend this measure in such manner as to impose any additional burden on the Central Fund and we have either to accept what is proposed now or reject it.  To a person in need, I suppose half a loaf is better than no bread, and what is proposed here must be accepted; but I should like to join with Deputy Treacy in the point he made in relation to the position that will undoubtedly arise in regard to those at present in receipt of home assistance, disablement allowances, and various other benefits administered by local authorities under the aegis of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>If this measure passes in its present form, there can be little doubt that any increase granted will be set aside by a corresponding reduction in the level of home assistance.  That is contrary to the professed object of this Bill, which is alleged to alleviate the increase in living costs likely to be caused by the proposed taxation on food.  If we are to pass this measure, I believe we should pass it in such a way that, contained in the Bill itself, will be a prohibition on permitting any of these increases herein proposed to be used of themselves as a reason for reducing the level of home assistance or disablement allowance paid to any recipient.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the very poorest section, those who at the moment are recognised by the local authority as sufficiently necessitous to qualify for some measure of home assistance and who are, therefore, amongst the very poorest of the poor, will gain no advantage under this <Col N="1600" /> measure unless we provide specifically in this Bill for that prohibition.  Perhaps their old age pensions will increase, or their social welfare payments will increase but by the degree to which those payments are increased, the measure of home assistance provided for them will be reduced.  I know that I am probably saying what has been the frustrating experience of Deputies on all sides in relation to the social welfare increases granted by legislation from time to time in the past.</P>
    <P>We find that because there is an increase in an old age pension, contributory or non-contributory, or in social welfare, or whatever it may be, the person in receipt of a special allowance under the Army Pensions Acts, or some other branch of State assistance, finds the payment he had is reduced by the amount of the increase granted by the legislation passed by this House.  In those circumstances, a category of person who is generally amongst the most necessitous finds that in fact he gets no increase whatever and has to face the rise in the cost of living which was the cause of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am going to suggest to the Minister, while it is not the intention, and it would not be the desire of the House, to hamper or slow down this legislation in any way, that when we reach the next Stage, the Minister should accept a verbal amendment from me.  This would be to the effect that the Bill would incorporate a provision which perhaps might be moved by the Minister in the Seanad, which would be a prohibition against local authorities deciding that the increases provided here should of themselves affect any payment by way of home assistance or disability allowance being received at the moment by any person. If that were enshrined in the Bill, it would ensure that the benefit of the alleviation would be enjoyed by the most necessitous of the groups we intend to benefit.  Without such a provision, the Bill is not satisfactory and accordingly an amendment of that kind should be incorporated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the improvements <Col N="1601" /> he has outlined in this Bill.  Listening to some other speakers, I thought that it was a continuation of the long and tedious discussions which we had in relation to the controversial turnover tax.  The suggestion the Opposition are making, that this will increase the cost of living to an alarming extent, is purely propaganda and part of the campaign directed against Fianna Fáil for their courageous stand in bringing in such a measure to enable not alone the general economy to develop, but in its train, to provide additional social welfare benefits for the community.  The measures outlined by the Minister are in line with the progressive thought in the legislation brought in by Fianna Fáil since they became a Government many years ago.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to various measures for old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.  These measures in the main were introduced by Fianna Fáil and have been improved consistently down the years as the economy of the country developed. The previous speaker denigrated our efforts in that respect.  He has not shaken off the mantle of conservativism of Fine Gael's outlook in regard to social welfare.  They never outlived the taunt that for economic reasons, they took a shilling off the old age pensioners.</P>

      <P>As long as that is on record, we can have no faith or confidence in the speeches of the Opposition, particularly Fine Gael, in regard to social welfare measures. Having said that, I should like to express disappointment that the Minister did not take the opportunity of reducing the limit for compulsory insurance for non-manual workers from £800 a year, a figure which was fixed as far back as 1958.  In spite of what the Opposition say, salaries and wages have gone up by some 30 per cent to 40 per cent in most cases, and there is a strong case for a revision of that ceiling.  Workers have gone out of insurance and have forfeited rights which they enjoyed under social <Col N="1602" /> welfare legislation.  These, as we know, are the rights to old age pensions, perhaps a pension for a widow, not to mention disability benefits.  They are also deprived of the benefits of the Health Acts.  I hope that the Select Committee at present considering the Health Services will consider that matter.</P>

I should also like to refer to a matter which a colleague mentioned yesterday, which perhaps does not come within the scope of this Bill, the question of workmen's compensation. I am glad to see that the Minister is to bring the scope of workmen's compensation within the ambit of his Department.  It will be a marked advance and will bring many benefits to workers generally.</P>

      <P>In spite of the carping and querulous nature of many of the speeches from the Opposition benches, I do not think the debate on this Bill has disclosed any great need for a long reply.  As I said at the outset, the Bill is concerned mainly with the provision of substantial increases in all of these social welfare schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think all Deputies who spoke, even <Col N="1603" /> those who spoke illogically, irresponsibly and recklessly such as Deputy Dillon and Deputy Treacy&mdash;even they &mdash;all expressed themselves as at least being in agreement with the increases. In fact, some of those who are so noted for their generosity in these matters when they are out of office expressed the opinion that even greater amounts might be desirable.  Therefore, in spite of the complaining nature of some of the speeches, I think the overall picture presented was of a House that was unanimously anxious to facilitate the Government in improving social welfare generally.  As I think Deputy Cunningham remarked, the atmosphere was different from that which prevailed last week and in previous weeks but of course it was a bogus atmosphere.</P>

      <P>Despite anything that has been said by Deputies on the other side of the House, the fact of the matter is that this Social Welfare Bill which effects a real improvement in the position of every recipient of social welfare benefit, male or female, single or married, with or without children, is being enacted in the teeth of the most bitter and persistent resistance of every element of the former Coalition. In fact, the unanimity of approach to the question and the concerted nature of the attack make it clear, I think, that the Coalition are in the process of trying to reform their ranks in the hope of being able to foist on the country again another Government of the type that brought economic disaster and chaos on two previous occasions.</P>

      <P>It is the object of this Government to continue the present pattern of a continuously expanding economy, with a consequent continuing improvement in the living standards of the people. Unfortunately, the system here is not so perfect that all sections of the community benefit automatically from increased production.  Just as trade unions have to see that workers get their due share, I regard it as my function to see to it that the social welfare classes, if I may so describe them, do not lag behind either.  That means that I think it my duty to ensure, if it should be necessary to do so, that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, does not forget to collect from the economically productive sections of the community some of what they gain so that it may be re-distributed to those who need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition like to talk unctuously about the old age pensions and Deputy Dillon now seems to have <Col N="1607" /> become aware for the first time that there are some other types of social service.  He never showed any awareness of that fact before.  He likes to talk about these things but he hates to talk of taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been talking about nothing else for the past two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>But you like to keep them in watertight compartments.  I will make sure, while I am Minister for Social Welfare that whenever improvements in social welfare are considered, the collection of the money will not be forgotten.  Social welfare is a praiseworthy activity that cannot be carried on without taxation.  They are two things which must go together. The Opposition would like to give the impression that they are in favour of improvements in social welfare but they are against taxation.  Whenever improvements in social services are being discussed, I will insist that the collection of the money will also be adverted to.  That money can be got only through taxation.  I consider it an essential function of mine to make arrangements, as the national income increases, for the distribution of some of that money to those in need.  You cannot be in favour of increased social services and against increased taxation. You must be for both or against both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to improvements that could be made in the different schemes.  I also see room for improvement there.  I find it hard to imagine a stage ever being reached in this country when there will not be room for improvement in social welfare.  Last year, and again this year, in addition to the increases given in the Budget, we made further arrangements to extend the different schemes so that they would embrace more people in need of assistance. Deputies can see other desirable things to do and so can I, but I must take account of the fact that it would be foolish to try to go ahead of the economy in these things, that all improvements and the prospect of further improvements depend on continued expansion so that the taxation <Col N="1608" /> measures necessary to effect these improvements must take due account of the over-all consideration that economic progress must be maintained.</P>
    <P>We have also to recognise the fact that we must virtually go it alone in this matter and that every effort we make will be vigorously resisted by the Opposition using every method, both fair and foul.  The combined effect of last year's Budget and Social Welfare Bill was to transfer £4.35 million to the recipients of social welfare from other sections of the community.  This year the sum being so transferred is £6.4 million.  That total of almost £11 million is being transferred to the social welfare classes despite the combined efforts of all the Opposition parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon seized on the fact that £1,870,000 is the cost of the provision for the first children in the increased children's allowances. From that, he argued that it was wrong to provide such a big proportion of the total money for the first children.  The fact that that is the cost of the provision in respect of first children does not mean that it is all going to people with small families.  In my opening statement, I mentioned that 84,000 families will come into the scheme for the first time.  That means that 84,000 one-child families only will benefit from this provision.  It is not difficult to work out from that that only £504,000 goes to families coming in for the first time.  The remainder of the £1,870,000 will be spread over families that are already drawing children's allowances. <Col N="1609" /> That argument of Deputy Dillon's is typical of the superficial approach to this question of the Fine Gael Party in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The total provision for children's allowances is £2.88 million and only half a million of that goes to the smaller families.  I think it is not unreasonable at this stage that we should decide to give some allowance to people starting off in life in that way.</P>
      <P>Another matter raised by Deputy Tully was the question of people who have been paying insurance contributions for some time and who then get promotion in their jobs, and become minor officers of local authorities, and thus lose all they had paid towards a contributory old age pension.  The position of such persons is that, if the period of full insurance is long enough, that is, if they only get this promotion to a pensionable post towards the concluding stages of their careers, they should be in a good position to satisfy the average test for contributory old age pension on reaching 70, at least at the partial rate if not the full rate. They will also qualify for some pension from the local authority.  On the other hand, if they have only been paying the insurance contribution for a comparatively short period, that is, if they get this promotion at a comparatively early stage of their career, then they will have more pensionable service and qualify for a greater pension from the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take my word for it there is something in it and have a look at the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that in the future when this happens, that is, when people have actually been paying contributions for a contributory old age pension for a considerable number of years, they will feel they are losing something to which they have contributed and should at least be given the option of continuing their contributions and, therefore, continuing to hold the entitlement they acquired.  I <Col N="1610" /> do not know whether it will be feasible to do anything in that regard or not. They are not in the same position as people who move out of compulsory insurance.  These people still continue to be compulsorily insurable for widows' and orphans' pensions.  A person who ceases to be compulsorily insurable can become a voluntary contributor.  Whether it is possible to arrange that these people could become voluntary contributors for old age pensions purposes while they are compulsorily insured, for widows' and orphans' pensions, I do not know, but I shall look into the question.</P>
      <P>The question of the percentage the State contributes to the social insurance fund was raised.  As Deputies know, in theory, it should be one-third, and that is what is aimed at. There was a suggestion that the tendency was to reduce this amount.  In fact, it is considerably over 33? per cent at the moment.  The percentages over the last ten years or so may be of interest to Deputies.  In 1954, the percentage of the State contribution was 36.14 per cent; in 1955, 29.90 per cent; in 1956, 29.12 per cent; in 1957, 38.19 per cent; in 1958, 41.20 per cent; in 1959, 40.26 per cent; in 1960, 36.88 per cent; and in 1961, 37.09 per cent.  If the percentage of the State contribution in any particular year is to be taken as a measure of the Government's interest in this matter and of their consideration for the recipients of social welfare benefits, the figures show that this Government would come well out of it.  The percentage ranges from 29.12 per cent to 41.20 per cent&mdash;29.12 per cent when Deputy Corish was Minister for Social Welfare and 41.20 per cent when the Tánaiste, Deputy MacEntee, was Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>There was an insinuation that the State was not being as generous in this regard as in Great Britain.  Actually, the comparison is the other way round. The average contributed to the national insurance fund in Northern Ireland over the same period was 12.24 per cent; in Great Britain it was 14.9 per cent, whereas here the average was 36.28 per cent.  I do not think the State can be faulted in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> A number of Deputies raised the question of unemployment assistance as applied to small farms, particularly in the west, and had certain criticisms of it, particularly its effect on production from those farms.  Various suggestions were made as to what should be done to remedy this situation, but I do not think any of the suggestions made were really acceptable.  This is an unemployment assistance scheme.  It is designed to deal with a different problem entirely from the problem of western farmers on small valuations. It is only by a radical change that this disincentive effect, which it undoubtedly has, can be remedied.  I am examining the possibility of devising some such scheme, and I hope eventually it will be possible to introduce it.  Of course, when I do, it will cost money; and I know what that will mean.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan pointed out that 35/- means more to the average rural old age pensioner than to the average urban old age pensioner. Generally speaking, I suppose this is so.  But the tendency has been to get away from differentials between town and country rates.  I think that tendency should be maintained.  It would be a mistake to go back to the idea of separate rates for town and country. The general pattern in that regard may not apply in individual cases, and if you had different rates you would meet cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan also referred to the position that formerly existed where there was an overriding means limit for recipients of unemployment assistance.  That meant on occasions that a person who was in receipt of quite a substantial sum because he had a large family was cut off from unemployment assistance altogether if his means increased and put him outside the overriding limit.  Since the Social Welfare Bill of last year that position has been changed and there is now a means limit which is automatically adjusted in accordance with the number of children a person has.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also suggested that it might be a good idea, in the case of people who have not sufficient <Col N="1612" /> contributions to entitle them to a full contributory old age pension, to have an arrangement whereby the person could pay a lump sum to make up the arrears, as it were.  At present we are in a transitional period in respect of this and the bulk of the contributory pensions being paid now had no contributions paid in respect of them and it would not be possible at this stage to allow persons who do not qualify under the liberal conditions that apply, to buy pensions at a higher rate by paying lump sums.  But when the scheme is fully operating and a big number of those getting the pensions have paid contributions to them, it may then be possible to consider a suggestion such as this which I find interesting.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that home assistance should not be reduced as a result of the increases in social benefits.  I have told all local authorities these increases should not be taken into account in assessing means for home assistance.  Since a number of Deputies referred to the matter I presume this must have happened in some cases and I shall have no objection to issuing a further circular in regard to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leneghan raised the question of share fishermen and fishermen generally and their difficulty in qualifying for home assistance and also the fact that share fishermen are not insurable. The question of the insurability of such fishermen and those with intermittent earnings in general is under examination. I realise this is a difficulty affecting the development of the fishing industry and I hope to be able to do something about it in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmons spoke of the need to raise the limit for compulsory insurance for non-manual workers which has developed because of the upward movement of wages and salaries in recent years.  The limit has been adjusted periodically and I am satisfied that the time has come to consider a further adjustment.  This is being considered in the Department but a decision was not possible in time for this Bill.  The Deputy said that non-manual workers whose salaries had increased above the present limit for compulsory insurance had forfeited rights which they had acquired and paid for, such as the contributory <Col N="1613" /> old age and widows' pensions. I suppose that is true in a number of cases, but anybody who moves out of compulsory insurance altogether can become a voluntary contributor.  I think these rights are worth preserving and the voluntary insurance scheme is one that Deputies should recommend to people who find themselves in that position so that they will continue paying as voluntary contributors and so maintain their rights.</P>
    <P>Non-manual workers whose salaries have risen over £800 have lost entitlement to employment and disability benefits but when the limit is raised this situation will be remedied.  It was also said that they had also lost entitlement to certain services under the Health Act.  I want to correct a misapprehension there.  There is no element in the insurance stamp contribution covering the cost of any of these services so that nobody acquires a right to services under the Health Act by virtue of the fact that he is a contributor to the social insurance scheme.  But in defining the categories of people entitled to health services one category was described as those insured under the social insurance scheme.  That had the effect that when a non-manual worker moves out of compulsory insurance, he loses benefits previously enjoyed under the Health Acts.  As things are at the moment, he would automatically become entitled to these services, if the income limits were raised.  I think that is not a problem for my Department. It is only a complication arising because entitlement in the case of that category was put on the basis that people were insured under the social insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Medlar referred to the fact that non-contributory&mdash;Deputy Tully reminded him it applied also to the contributory scheme&mdash;pensions were the only social benefits in which there were no allowances in respect of children.  The extension of the old age pension schemes to bring them into line with social services generally is one of the improvements I have in mind.  I do not think there would be a big percentage of old age pensioners involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I admit I have come across some cases of hardship due to the absence of this provision and I am advised that the cost would be quite considerable.  I think it is a logical development however and I hope to introduce it at some stage. Like everything connected with social welfare this will cost money and I must advert to the fact that when it is proposed to raise that money the proposal will contribute to unleashing the combined fury of Labour and Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take occasion to recall to the Minister's mind something that appears to have upset him greatly.  I sympathise with him and with his colleague because it must be a cause of mortification and distress to them to see the consequence of their own actions.  They are very much given to handsome gestures in public but they do not like to have them examined in their consequences.  We have been discussing here during the past six weeks the Fianna Fáil proposal to tax food, fuel and clothing and the Minister for Social Welfare very sensibly said today: &ldquo;You cannot divorce these things.  Taxation policy of that kind cannot be divorced from the social services policy.&rdquo;  I quite agree with him, but I gather from his speech here today that he bitterly resents the fact that I directed his attention to that close association between these two things last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy in regard to <Col N="1616" /> taxation on food, fuel and clothing was first implemented when Fianna Fáil reduced the food subsidies by £9 million when they first got into office.  I told some of the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil then that they would live to see the day when Fianna Fáil would require them not only to tramp into the lobby to remove the subsidies on food but also to put a tax on foodstuffs. A great many Fianna Fáil Deputies derided such a policy as unthinkable and said I was trying to malign them in the public mind.  However, they have had to do it.  They are now taxing foodstuffs; they are taxing clothing; they are taxing fuel and they are going to raise £7,500,000 this year in addition to the £9 million they took away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister's slow and pedestrian mind is opening slowly to a realisation of what I have told him.  This Bill provides 35/- a week old age pension and everybody feels this is a very material step forward in the provision for old age pensioners, but the fact is that if regard is had to the inevitable consequences of Fianna Fáil legislation since they came into office, it will be found the real value of the old age pension we provide here is 11/8 in terms of 1939 money and we are to-day, after a quarter of a century, increasing <Col N="1617" /> the old age pension by 1/8 a week.  Those are inescapable facts founded on the statistical material supplied by this Government.  What I want to direct the attention of Fianna Fáil to is this: they have now set their feet on the slippery slope of taxing foodstuffs and other essentials and they will be pushed further along that line if the people do not throw them out.</P>

      <P>Surely I can point out that if this line is pursued, what we are in fact doing is taking back from the beneficiaries of social welfare with our left hand what we give them with our right hand?  The rate of old age pension, to my knowledge, was three times increased by the inter-Party Government and three times increased by the Fianna Fáil Government since 1939.  The net result is that they are getting 1/8d. more than they were getting in 1939.  Why?  Because the value of money has been steadily depreciated by the Fianna Fáil policy of taxation.  Do they realise what they have done?  There is £16,500,000 from foodstuffs and now they have started on clothes and fuel and there will want to be a social welfare amending Bill passed every three months if that continues and if we are to keep abreast of depreciation in the value of money. In regard to the old age pensioner, I want to make this prophecy.  Today the 35/- pension is worth 11/8 and they have not got it yet.  By the time they get it it will be worth 11/6.</P>

I suggest to Deputy Colley we here in Ireland are responsible for our own people.  I agree that in Brazil, with which we now seem to be declaring some affinity&mdash;its manners and customs were commended to us last night&mdash;inflation has run mad and I quite agree with Deputy Colley that in places of that kind, the value of money melts like snow in summer sunshine.  I think he will agree with me that it would not be a desirable situation to see developing here.</P>
      <P>I do not think at present we are in any immediate danger of runaway inflation of that character but it is dishonest and disreputable to be thumping a tub, to be glowing here in Dáil Éireann about increasing the old age pension and rejoicing that you are able to do so much more in the sphere of social services when those of us who really know the facts and understand them realise that in 25 years, the real value of the old age pension has gone up 1/8 as a result of the Fianna Fáil policy of taxing food and now fuel and clothing as well.  As surely as we are in this House, that 11/8 will not be worth any more than 11/6 by the time they get it next November.  Think well on that.  Examine your consciences, because you will have to answer for it and, when you are called upon to do so, you will want a better alibi than Deputy Colley; it is not good enough to say: &ldquo;You cannot blame us for this when it is happening in Brazil.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No, Sir; it does not.  The position at the moment is that, out of the funds available to local authorities, provision is being made to supplement in the case of very necessitous cases by way of home assistance whatever assistance they get under the social welfare code.  A person in receipt of an old age pension, or some social welfare benefit, on examination as to means and so on, can obtain additional assistance if the home circumstances are such as to require a supplementary payment in the form of home assistance.  It has happened before, and I fear it may happen again, that because the local authority is not subject to any direction from the Minister&mdash;it may entertain his advice or it may reject it&mdash; when a social welfare payment is increased, to the extent of that increase, there is a corresponding reduction in home assistance.  I want to ensure that the intention expressed by the Minister here today, an intention desired by most Deputies, will in fact have effect.  The Minister stated here that a reduction of home assistance on that account should not happen. We know it should not happen but it has, in fact, happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy an example of a legislative assembly doing it in practice, if he will just keep quiet for a moment.  If this amendment is accepted, or the Minister indicates an amendment on these lines will be incorporated in the Bill, this will mean that, while the local authority, acting on the assistance side, may reconsider the mode and level of home assistance in particular cases&mdash; perhaps in the case of a person who had been unemployed or who was not able to work but who found employment or found that he was able to work&mdash;and review the grant of home assistance on grounds of that kind, they will not be allowed to review home assistance merely because an old age pension is increased from 32/6d. to 35/-.  Under the law they are entitled to do that, and they do it under the law, irrespective of the admonitions, circulars, or suggestions to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can there be any objection to providing in this Bill that that may not happen?  That is what I am concerned to ensure.  If we provide a section in this Bill ensuring that there is a legal prohibition on any of the increases here proposed being regarded as a ground for reviewing home assistance, I think we meet the case.  It certainly has been my experience that this kind of thing has happened in many cases. There is an example.  It has happened in regard to other increases, increases which are perhaps outside our scope and which I mention only as an example.  I refer to the special allowances under the Army pensions code. At the moment they are affected by any social welfare increases and that kind of example is availed of by local authorities in operating home assistance. <Col N="1623" /> I mentioned in my amendment disability allowances which are payable under the Health Acts.</P>

      <P>May I repeat and remind the Chair that we on this side of the House are allowing the Committee Stage of a Bill, the Second Reading of which was passed to-day and it was not possible to circulate amendments before the Bill passed its Second Reading.  In those circumstances, I am moving an amendment, the contents of which I indicated on Second Reading.  I have been through this before and I should be allowed to proceed.</P>
      <P>I was referring to the example of the disability allowance.  It is an example of a payment which is made on the health side of local authority activities.  It is payable to a person in necessitous circumstances but by reason of an increase in the disability allowance, home assistance is automatically reduced by the amount.  Unfortunately, that example is there.  It is applied by local authorities, despite the fact that, to my knowledge, both the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health have urged local authorities not to do it.  In spite of circulars to that effect, it is being done.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that as an example of what may happen under these proposed increases, if there is not a prohibition preventing local authorities from reducing the amount of home assistance. If that is not there, the danger is they will feel entitled, as they are under law, to reduce what they regard as a compensatory payment.  Accordingly I propose that before Section 2, there should be incorporated a new section in the terms I have handed to the Chair.  &ldquo;That the payments hereby proposed shall not of themselves be regarded as grounds for reducing the amount of home assistance payable to any person.&rdquo;  I recommend that amendment to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there have been any cases in which what Deputy O'Higgins says happened has happened.  We have, from time to time, sent circulars to local authorities pointing out to them that such reductions should not be made.  I have no reason to believe that those circulars have not been complied with and I have no reason to believe that similar requests will not be complied with in the future.  I do not think that there has been any need shown to compel the local authorities in this respect.  We have every reason to believe that the Department's wishes have been carried out in the past and that they will be carried out in the future.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is right to ask the House to coerce the local authorities in this respect when there is no case made and no evidence produced to show that such coercion is necessary. In fact, the granting of home assistance is based on an examination of the need of the applicant for it.  According to Deputy O'Higgins, the net results of the taxation provisions in the Budget and the increases in social welfare will be to create a disimprovement in the situation of these social welfare recipients. If that is so, then so far from there being a reduction in home assistance, there is more likely to be an increase.</P>
      <P>Of course, Deputy O'Higgins knows that he is wrong and is now trying to argue the other way and to argue that these increases in social welfare will automatically give rise to decreases in home assistance, unless we do something about it here.  I believe the local authorities will act responsibly and before I would agree to doing something like this, I would require to be convinced that local authorities behave in an unreasonable way.  At the moment, I am not so convinced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>While it may be true that some local authorities are <Col N="1627" /> inclined to reduce home assistance, I find that has not been the practice. After all, local authorities made provisions some months ago to pay home assistance cases.  The number of cases is very static and the amount has already been decided upon.  I do not think there will be any general cutting by the local authorities which might produce a saving in the amount allocated.  As far as I know, Deputy O'Higgins was present when the representatives and managers indicated recently it was not the practice in respect of other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The distribution of home assistance is subject to means test.  At the beginning of the year, local authorities make provision for it by way of a round sum which will be available for distribution.  The means are reviewed periodically.  If the circumstances of a person should change the means may be increased or lowered.  To suggest that such a review does not continually take place is not to face up to the situation as it exists.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the increases which are going to be paid should not be nullified by a diminution of assistance and that on previous occasions he has had that information conveyed to the local authorities.  I am sure that a continuation of that view is needed. The weakness in that type of legislation is in connection with those officers who must keep within regulations laid down for them in the assessment of means.  Would the Minister include, in any regulations, a guide for the officers who make these assessments in regard to means tests.  That is very necessary.</P>
      <P>I have often been unable to understand how the assessment of the means of an applicant is made.  Take a person who lives on a cottage plot.  He might be assessed with a notional income in regard to the occupancy of that plot although it might be absolutely unproductive. The Minister should ensure that what is being done by this legislation will not be negatived by any other operation which would tend to reduce it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell me the position when the means exceed £52 10s., £65 10s., and so on?  They are contained in the Table here.  Are notional sums of money included as perquisites?  I have mentioned occupancy of a cottage plot.  Does that carry a notional value?  Take an old person living with a relative.  Is there a notional value of so much per night? I think it is one shilling a week in respect of the occupancy of the room. Generally people in the category needing this type of assistance find, when their means are investigated, that, for some reason which they cannot understand, values have been assigned to perquisites which they enjoy and which they believe is their right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person with £52 10s. a year has a full pension.  However, anything <Col N="1629" /> over that amount reduces it.  Therefore, small items such as I have mentioned might tend to put these people over the figure of £52 10s.  What I want to hear from the Minister is what is the yardstick by which the means of the individual are calculated in this case.  If a person has a weekly income, one can understand it; if a person has a cash payment, one can understand it; but if a person has a cottage and a plot, are we attaching to them a notional value?  If an elderly person is living with relatives or a son or daughter, and enjoys a room in the home, are we putting against them a notional value in regard to income?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to a cottage plot or any little land, the assessment is a factual one on the income extracted from the land.  If there is no income, the assessment is small.  The letting value of the land is taken into account and it is very small.  In the case of a person living with and maintained by a relative, there is a small notional assessment.  It would only have a marginal effect on the old age pension.  It is only about £3 or £4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the assessment is but it would be very small in that case.  It would operate only to put a person out of one of these categories and into another.  It would not operate to deprive a person entirely of a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>It puts him from one category into another.  It deprives him of 5/- a week and that would continue over his lifetime.  I think the Minister should try to do something in respect of that situation.  Those who live in such circumstances are the weakest <Col N="1630" /> section of the community.  You often find them living alone with a cottage plot which is producing nothing and which has no letting value because it is probably worn out.  If you fix a notional value, you are inflicting on them a hardship which the Minister or anybody else in this House does not wish.  I would ask the Minister to examine the circumstances of people who live in such dwellings and see that they will not lose 5/- a week or £5 a year for the rent of such plots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make special reference to the case of elderly people living with relatives.  I agree that the assessment cannot operate to do more than move them from one category to another but nothing is more exasperating for old people than to see a neighbour apparently in identical circumstances, in receipt of a differential. It is extremely difficult to explain it to them and I think it would be the feeling of most Deputies that they prefer to see old people living with relatives rather than living alone. In all my experiences, one of the most pitiable is old people living alone with the ultimate end that they have to be removed to the county home because they can no longer look after themselves.</P>
      <P>Where they live with children or with their relative, you have the happy situation that the old persons not only feel they are at home but feel they are an asset to the home and the family where they live.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might examine the question of providing that where an old person lives with the family, no notional charge will be made on the ground that, so far as we are concerned, all of us would prefer in every case where it is possible old people should be looked after by their own families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it can be said that a miserable 5/- a week should not deter a dutiful family from looking after an old person.  That is true, but it is a source of considerable irritation to an old person to find that he is getting 5/a week less than another old person living alone next door.  These are the kind of details that make the difference between peace and contentment among <Col N="1631" /> old people and the circumstances which give rise to misunderstanding and annoyance.  By the time we have all reached our seventh decade, we will not be as susceptible to pure reason as we are in the greenery of our youth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that social welfare officers investigating cases such as those mentioned by Deputy Jones should be very liberal and I think the general experience is that they are. The value they would place on a cottage plot would be very small indeed.  With regard to the question of its being worn-out land, that fact would be taken into consideration.  I feel sure that the effect of having a cottage plot would be very small indeed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon made an eloquent plea for people living with relatives. On the other hand, the case was made on Second Reading that a person living alone is in a much worse position. Surely the actual value to the person who is sheltered and maintained by his relatives is more than one shilling a week?  Surely it is a very notional value that is placed on it.  That is the only differential made in the old age pension in the case of persons living alone and persons living with relatives. I feel a case can be made that the person living alone should be entitled to a much higher old age pension than the person who is lucky enough to have a son or daughter to look after him.  In any case, this does not arise in a great number of cases.  The fact is of all the non-contributory old age pensioners in the country, something over 91 per cent. are in receipt of the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a thrifty old person who has a small nest-egg in the bank, is there a notional value placed on the income from that small amount of money on deposit, or is it calculated on the actual receipts by way of interest from the bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That was raised during Second Reading and I overlooked <Col N="1632" /> replying to it.  There is a method laid down for assessing capital as means in these cases.  In fact, this Bill makes a substantial change in that method in the case of widows and orphans, but not in the case of old age pensioners. In the case of old age pensioners, and as used to be the case with widows and orphans, the first £25 is ignored, the next £375 is assessed at five per cent and the remainder at ten per cent. That is a notional annual value for the capital possessed by the applicant.</P>
      <P>At first it seemed to me that that was a rather harsh way to assess it, but it is not really.  In fact, a person over the age of 70 can purchase an annuity which will give him a greater return than the amount assessed according to that method.  I agree that in the case of a younger person, such as a widow, that argument does not apply.  For that reason, in this Bill I have made a change in the method of assessing capital in that case, but the same justification is not there in the case of old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>I agree that a person who has been thrifty all his life and saves some money naturally feels aggrieved if he sees a neighbour who was the opposite during his lifetime able to get an old age pension.  I must say there is something wrong with a system which appears to place a premium on improvidence. I do not see how that problem can be solved.  The principle of a means test in regard to social assistance payments is sound&mdash;that any money available should be utilised to benefit those who have nothing and to raise their standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only solution I can see for it is that it may be possible to do something at a later stage under the contributory old age pension scheme.  If it could be arranged that a thrifty person could become a voluntary subscriber for a contributory old age pension, that argument would not exist in the future.  He could not say: &ldquo;Because I am thrifty, I cannot get an old age pension, while my neighbour who was not thrifty can.&rdquo;  The reply to that would be that the best thing he could have done was to become a voluntary contributor to the <Col N="1633" /> social insurance scheme.  However, that is a very big question to be examined. It is the only solution I see to the problem.  Certainly the method by which capital is assessed for old age pension purposes is a defendable one.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider this case as being in a special category?  Elderly people like to put aside a certain sum of money to provide for their deaths.  They do not put it into a trust but generally leave it in the local bank with an instruction that it is to be used for the funeral expenses. They do not wish to put a burden on those who will be struggling after them.  Could the Minister devise some method by which such small sums of money generally amounting to £300 or £400, could be dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That amounts to a suggestion that a greater amount than £25 be ignored in the calculation of capital as means.  As I said, I can see practically unlimited scope for improvement of the various social welfare schemes.  That is one of the things I shall bear in mind in the future.  All these things cost money to implement.</P>

      <P>I mentioned already the difficulty of widows on non-contributory pensions if they are under the age of 48.  If they have no children, they are not entitled to a pension.  In rural Ireland, a woman of that age finds it hard to get employment of the right type to enable her to remain in the country.  There is not the same scope for domestic employment as was available previously. Even in agricultural Ireland, with the growth in mechanisation, there is not the opportunity for these people there used to be in the dairying areas in milking.  That was a common employment for these people in which they earned a living of a kind.  I know there has to be some age limit, but these are a class of people who do <Col N="1634" /> not find moving easy at that age. They generally have to leave the country to get employment of the right type.  Could the Minister deal with their case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, I made an improvement in this respect.  Prior to this, when a child of a widow reached the age of 16, her widow's non-contributory pension ceased entirely, not only the portion in respect of the child but her own until she reached the age of 48.  In last year's Social Welfare Bill, that was changed so that in those circumstances now the widow would retain the pension.  What Deputy Jones suggests is to go a step further on that road.  That is a step I should like to take and hope to take in the future, again when money becomes available.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister laid down any general rule applicable in the cases of women whose husbands have disappeared?  Is there any agreed period which the Department will take, corresponding to the 20 years which I think the High Court recognises as the period after which it is in order legally to presume the death of the person who has disappeared?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely you must establish something more than that? There is no specific time in the Department but if investigations disclose that reasonable efforts have been made to trace the husband and it is reasonable to assume he is dead, the widow's pension can be granted.  Only last week, I came across a case of a lady who applied in 1954 for a widow's pension in respect of a husband who had disappeared in 1928.  After some considerable time and investigation, in 1960 the claim was granted.  A fortnight ago, the husband, from an address 15 miles away, applied for an old age pension.  These things happen, but they show that when there is a reasonable <Col N="1635" /> assumption that the husband is dead, widows' pensions can be, and have been, granted and will continue to be granted.  The Department merely investigates to see if it is reasonable to assume that the man is dead.</P>

    <P>In page 28, lines 32 to 35, to delete all words after &ldquo;authority&rdquo; down to the end of the subsection and substitute: &ldquo;may apply, in the case of land where the rateable valuation thereof does not exceed £10, to the District Court of the area where the land is situated and in the case of land where the rateable valuation thereof exceeds £10 to the Circuit Court having jurisdiction in the area where the land is situate, for an order requiring the owner to comply with the notice and the court, if satisfied that the owner should comply with the notice, may order the owner of the land to comply with such notice <Col N="1642" /> upon such terms as to the court seem just&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister already knows why we have been moving amendments of this type and we do not think it will take any power which the Minister and the planning authority may need in regard to good planning.  All that is being asked is that when a person's property is affected the planning authority may not move into the person's land without seeking the authority of the court.  In the case of land which is of a valuation less than £10 the district court is available to the planning authority and in regard to land over that value the circuit court is available.  The Minister has met my proposition in regard to where a person obstructs the entry to land and what I am asking here is not to put the citizen in the position of having to obstruct at all.  If the planning authority adopt the legal process which is open to them there can be no grievance on any side.</P>

In so far as planning policy is concerned, I still assert &mdash; rightly or wrongly; I think, rightly&mdash;that this is a function for the Minister and his administration, while the determination of the law is and will remain a matter for the courts.  I thought we had reached general agreement on these principles. In a later amendment, amendment No. 31, we are providing that which I promised to provide in response to the specific request of the Leader of the Opposition who said at column 1896 of volume 203 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>... what we are seeking to assert here is not the right of the courts to determine whether a plan is good or bad.  All we want to assert is the right of the court to determine where circumstances exist which would justify forcible entry on a citizen's property in order to vindicate the purpose of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will, I think, succeed in meeting <Col N="1643" /> that in amendment No. 31.  In that amendment, I believe I am keeping faith with the promise I made.

A person need only say: &ldquo;We will not have you in,&rdquo; and the planning authority will then have to go to court in order to go in legitimately.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are dealing with the enforcement of planning control.  I reminded the House on a previous occasion that the original Town Planning Acts contained a provision under which a resolution could be passed in relation to planning.  Various authorities passed a resolution, but did nothing further. <Col N="1645" /> They did not make a plan; they did not make any regulations.  The fact that a local authority passed a resolution in regard to planning did not give any rights to that authority one way or the other, since no conditions were laid down with regard to planning.  I am advised that there is a constitutional defect in this Bill and, if this Bill goes through in its present form, any planning authority entering on property will be acting unconstitutionally.  All the efforts which have been put into this Bill, the admirable qualities it contains, will be completely nullified by the effect of going into a person's property in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with the unauthorised structure.  The only way in which these structures will be unauthorised is by planning control having been deemed to be in existence.  If a resolution was passed bringing the Town Planning Acts into force in a particular area, but having done that, the local authorities failed to lay down any conditions or standards or to issue directions by which the individual might be guided, then at that stage there was no standard by which an individual could be compelled to erect a structure.  In this case, if the planning authority, in pursuance of this, were, having served notice on the person, to move in to the property or interfere with it, I am advised it would be unconstitutional and that this Act would certainly be challenged at that stage.  It is held that it would prove to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>It is because of this, and because we do not want to see an imporant piece of legislation which we believe to be defective going through the House, that we tabled this amendment.  We would be failing in our duty if we did not point this out.  The planning authority, be failing to seek the order by the ordinary recognised process which is available would, by entering on a person's property, be doing something they are not entitled to do, and the person would be protected by the Constitution. I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment so that when this becomes law the efforts which the Minister and his advisers have put into it will not be negatived in that way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> As I say, I have been advised that since the various authorities did not make any plan, or regulations, or lay down standards under the previous Town Planning Acts, they are now protected and the power which they would claim to have would not entitle them to give directions against an individual and move into his property or home and carry out alterations or remove a structure.  I do not believe the Minister or the House wants that.  What we want in this legislation, which is admirable from every point of view and with which we have agreed from the beginning, is something on which the country might build securely for the future.  I suggest it does not cost the planning authority anything; they protect themselves by seeking the interpretation necessary from the courts in respect of this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should emphasise that every section of the Bill was vetted with a view to its consitutionality long ago and on many occasions during the course of the discussions.  As regard the Act of 1934 about which Deputy Jones has spoken, the passing of a resolution under that Act obliged the planning authority to make a planning scheme.  Anybody who put up a structure was knowingly running a grave risk that it could be removed without any compensation.  What we are proposing is no more and no less than carrying into the new legislation the obligations and duties imposed under existing law.</P>
      <P>In regard to its constitutionality, we have examined this and every other section minutely.  The amendment really deals with Section 35 which enables planning authorities to deal effectively with the developer who leaves an estate unfinished, who leaves footpaths in a bad state, roadways broken and potholed, water surface drainage uncatered for and litter-strewn corners on sites unprotected and in a mess.  These are matters we intend to deal with and everyone will agree that every possible step should be taken to ensure that that type of situation is not allowed to go unchecked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has already been evident in <Col N="1647" /> various parts of this city.  We have listened here time and again to complaints by Deputies from all sides of the House about this type of situation and about the difficulties of house purchasers in not having the services they thought would be provided.  That is a very necessary and desirable section without which this Bill would not be a very effective measure.  The amendment would not in any way help to do something that many of us wish to have done.  In fact, if anything, it would seem to condone the inaction of these developers who have failed to do their job, misled people into believing that they would do a certain job and then washed their hands of the whole estate and left things unfinished.  I think none of us wants a recurrence or a continuation of that.  I put it to the House that we should not amend the section and that the powers in it are desirable and very necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister recognises that the atmosphere that surrounded the discussion of this Bill precludes the suggestion that there is a desire here to frustrate the general purposes of the legislation.  I am prepared to concede now that we have discussed the merits of certain matters on Committee Stage and agreed to differ about them.  However, in respect of these two amendments, Nos. 20 and 21&mdash;although we are on No. 21 and No. 20 has been disposed of&mdash;I should like the House to look at the two together.  It is purely the aspect of constitutionality that induced us to bring forward these amendments and to press them at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on this side of the House recognise the amount of work which has been put into this Bill and the spirit in which it has been discussed.  We want the Bill to work but we live, for good or ill, under a written Constitution. We are all familiar in our experience with pieces of legislation which appeared good to this House but which, tested in the High Court and Supreme Court within the framework of the Constitution, were declared unconstitutional, whereupon we found ourselves without powers which the <Col N="1648" /> Oireachtas thought the Government should have.  Not infrequently, it was in respect of a relatively insignificant element in the Act that the whole Act was declared unconstitutional and the whole work of the legislation had to be begun again and in the meantime things got done which it was the clear intention of the Oireachtas should not be allowed to be done.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister has taken elaborate precautions to check the provisions with his advisers as to their constitutionality.  However, I do not think it is necessary for me to reinforce what Deputy Jones has already said.  We have taken advice on it not primarily for the purpose of coercing the Minister to accept our view but really to avoid the possibility of an Act so laboriously enacted being destroyed on its first reference to the Supreme Court by some interested party.  I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that our advice from persons not unfamiliar with constitutional litigation of this kind has been that without the remedies proposed in amendments Nos. 20, 21 and 23 it is their considered opinion that a coach and four could be driven through this Bill, when enacted, on constitutional grounds.</P>
    <P>If it was our purpose to frustrate this Bill our best bet would be to say nothing, to sit back and simply say: &ldquo;It is all right.  This can be blown sky-high as soon as it is enacted.&rdquo;  On the contrary, our purpose is to advise the Minister of what we believe to be the genuine danger to the Bill and what we consider to be the minimum amendment which will correct the constitutional defect so that if the Act is subsequently challenged it will survive any challenge based on the Constitution because we believe that the Bill in its final form will truly represent the consensus of opinion in this House albeit that in respect of certain details we have been constrained to differ.</P>
    <P>It is on those grounds that we press these amendments on the Minister&mdash;I shall not say for his own protection but for the protection of the piece of legislation which he played his full part in bringing to what we hope will <Col N="1649" /> be a satisfactory conclusion.  I suggest that perhaps the Minister would review this Bill further, in the light of the information we have given him, with his legal advisers and save the Bill in the Seanad if it transpires that there is any doubt.</P>

Being aware of it, we have renewed our review and consideration of that which is said to be objectionable.  Having done so, in the knowledge of the advice which the Opposition Party received, I still say we are satisfied it is all right.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 51, between lines 53 and 54 to add new subsections as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() An appeal shall lie from every determination of the arbitrator under subsection (1) of this section to the Circuit Court having jurisdiction in the county where the land, or part of the land which is the subject of a claim for payment of compensation, is situate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>() Rules of Court shall provide <Col N="1651" /> for appeals under subsection (2) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The acceptance of this amendment would give an individual who is aggrieved in the matter of compensation offered to him for his land which is being taken from him or being interfered with the right of appeal from the arbitrator's decision to the circuit court.  This is a right that the individual should have.  When the section was under review, the Minister mentioned the framework in which arbitration is set in this country.  Could the Minister tell me now if these arbitrators are paid a fee only?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are on salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to an arbitrator who makes an award in these cases, and I know the word &ldquo;arbitrator&rdquo; connotes acceptance of what he decides, there is the case of the individual who places a higher value on his property than the arbitrator may place on it.  What we want to provide in this amendment is that the individual who feels aggrieved by the award should have the option of appealing to the circuit court.  We do not think it unreasonable to write that into this legislation.</P>
      <P>We have not provided in this Bill for many appeals to the courts but we feel that where a person's property is concerned and where you may take it from him, the award of compensation made should be the subject of review by the circuit court which operates in the area and which is well qualified to deal with this question of values in that area.  We feel the individual should be free to exercise that right. If the arbitrator is wrong in his decision, and individuals can make mistakes, at least there is then the right of a review.  I do not feel that the fact that we put this into the legislation now will mean that every individual will move from the arbitrator's hearing the circuit court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, if the individual feels that his rights are being interfered with to the extent that he is not getting what he feels he should get, he will not lightly go to the courts because, <Col N="1652" /> should his action be mistaken and should the courts find that the compensation offered to him is fair and just, he will find himself footing, not only his own costs, but the costs of the planning authority as well.  We feel that this is something which ought to be put into this legislation and I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment so that the individual who is justly concerned about the measure of compensation being offered to him will have the right to appeal to the circuit court.  It is a fundamental right that an individual should be able to appeal to a higher authority when he feels he has a grievance.  I strongly urge on the Minister that he should put such a provision into the legislation so that we can respect the rights of the individual who feels aggrieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have agreed to differ in regard to certain matters where the Minister has felt that certain types of appeal which we recommend for inclusion in the Bill would amount to giving the judiciary authority to review the work of the planning authorities.  This proposal does not fall within that area of disagreement between us because it does not propose that the courts should have the right to determine the propriety of the decisions of the planning authority. All we seek here is that when these matters have been disposed of and the consequences referred to the arbitrator for the determination of compensation, if the person whose property is being sequestered feels that the arbitrator's award is inadequate, he should have the right of appeal to the judiciary.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that in our human experience, no matter how excellent a man may have been who is chosen as arbitrator, his attitude to the claimant for compensation may create in the mind of that claimant, perhaps unreasonably or unjustly, the belief that the arbitrator has leaned excessively in the direction of the valuation proposed by the planning authority and that he has unduly rejected the estimates and submissions made on behalf of the proprietor whose property is being acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1653" /> I would suggest to the Minister that to leave such an impression on the mind of an individual is objectionable from the point of view of good government and a sense of justice fully done. As Deputy Jones pointed out, probably in 80 per cent of the cases, the person will come to the conclusion that, by and large, the arbitrator has given him a fair award.  But let us not forget, and I think this is tremendously important, that we should envisage the circumstances in which we are legislating. Certainly the planning authority and property owner will try to reach agreement without going to arbitration. It is only when there is disagreement and the owner feels that the planning authority are offering him much too little that he is likely to go to arbitration.</P>
    <P>It is not impossible that the owner may be unreasonable and may be assessing his property as worth far more than any reasonable person would value it at but that is the feeling with which he goes to arbitration.  The arbitrator is chosen by this strange machinery which provides that the President of the High Court, the Chief Justice and a representative of the chartered accountants society or some such body chooses a panel of persons. In practice, it has been one person. The owner feels his property is being taken from him rather than purchased. He feels the planning authority are proposing to take it for less than it is worth.  He arrives before the arbitrator, makes his case, produces his witnesses, presses his claim&mdash;and is bitterly disappointed by the arbitrator's award.</P>
    <P>If we are to make this good law, surely that person ought to be entitled to a second opinion?  When he goes to the arbitrator, he is advised&mdash;and believes&mdash;that his property is worth £10,000.  The planning authority say: &ldquo;We think it is worth £3,000, but we are prepared to consider £4,000.&rdquo;  The property owner revolts from such a proposal.  He goes to the arbitrator. The arbitrator says: &ldquo;I think the planning authority have been generous in this matter.  I shall not go below what they expressed themselves prepared to give, although I believe £3,500 is the proper sum, and I award <Col N="1654" /> £4,000.&rdquo;  The property owner, ablaze with indignation, comes out of the court and declares he has been wronged.</P>
    <P>On whom do we place the unbearable burden of saying that an individual in that state of mind shall be entitled to take the legal advice open to him and go to the circuit court? At present, if I put my house and garden on the list for valuation which comes up in March for the Valuation Commissioners to determine whether the valuation is to be raised or lowered, I have the right to go to the circuit court from the decision.  That is a decision which may affect only 30/or £3 in my liability for rates.  Here is a case where a person is being asked to part permanently with his property and, reasonably or unreasonably, believes he is being offered half the value.  Full of indignation, he goes to the arbitrator, only to be told: &ldquo;We think you are getting plenty for it.&rdquo;  Is he to be denied the appeal the ordinary ratepayer has from the Commissioners of Valuation?</P>
    <P>In how many cases need we apprehend that such appeals will be made? Am I not right in saying that more than half of such cases will never even get to the arbitrator?  They will be settled by agreement.  Any prudent adviser to a property owner will advise: &ldquo;Settle this if you can&rdquo;, and the planning authority will always go a little beyond its true value in order to avoid litigation.  Of the remaining 40 per cent, half at least, if the arbitrator improves the price a bit, will say: &ldquo;That will settle that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Possibly one-fifth of all the cases may get as far as the circuit court in the initial stages while the public are familiarising themselves with the general working of the Act.  But I believe after the Act is in operation for a protracted period, experienced solicitors and valuers will be able to tell clients with a very high degree of certainty: &ldquo;We have seen exactly similar cases which went all the way to the circuit court, and that is probably what you are going to get.&rdquo; Having given that advice, they will say: &ldquo;That is what the planning authority are offering you.  If you take our advice <Col N="1655" /> try to get £10 or £15 more, and if you get it, take it.&rdquo;  In the initial stages, we may get 20 per cent of the cases going to the circuit court.  Who is going to be terribly hurt by that? Nothing will be held up.  Everybody will go on about their business while the narrow question of compensation is being determined.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that, if that concession is made, a very major defect in this Bill, as we see it, will be removed.  I would be prepared to say if such a concession were made to the property owner, which is no more than his right, there would be very little legitimate scope for a sense of grievance in regard to the compulsory acquisition of property under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Listening to the arguments just made and isolating oneself from all other legislation, one might be convinced that the argument has a certain amount of right, but when one looks around and realises that this measure is only a small part of the arbitration in regard to land values that annually takes place, one must ask why no effort has been made over the years in respect of all the other cases.  In the Sanitary Services Act, the Land Acts, the Drainage Acts and the Housing Acts this whole basis of arbitration is enshrined.</P>

I am not convinced of the merit of Deputy Dillon's argument, but I concede that, if one took cognisance of his argument, the problem should be approached on a wider basis.  The whole matter would be far better discussed on the broad general basis of amendments to all such Acts dealing with land values fixed by arbitration.  I should probably still oppose it, if I am here, but that does not mean that Deputy Dillon or his Party should not take up the idea on the broad basis and let us have it decided once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this amendment, the arbitrator is acting in each case in what one would regard as a judicial capacity, unlike the inspector from the Valuation Office.  He is present and hears the evidence on which he does not give advice to somebody else who makes the decision as the Valuation Commissioner does.  In each of these cases, the arbitrator of valuations coming under review under this Bill will hear the evidence, try to elicit the facts and finally make a decision which he is in a definitely advantageous position to make because he is a specialist in this field.  He has been appointed because of his specialisation and is without question&mdash;and this is no reflection on anybody&mdash;far better qualified as a judge of land values in any part of the country than any member of the judiciary.  He is selected by a committee composed of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, and the Chairman of the Surveyors Institution, Irish Branch. Neither the local authorities nor anybody here has any say in his selection. These three eminent people when called upon appoint a man who is without question a specialist in the <Col N="1657" /> knowledge required and no committee could be better for the purpose or more aware of the need for a real specialist in this matter.</P>
    <P>When the arbitrator sits on a case, you will have probably the best specialist available in this field in the country.  This is his job whenever he sits, year in, year out.  He must acquire as he goes on more knowledge and information and must become an even greater specialist&mdash;and he began probably as the best man procurable.  It is he, after hearing evidence personally, after eliciting all the necessary information, who makes the decision and I should assert that decision, without doubt, is likely to be the fairest and most just decision one could get in matters like this.</P>
    <P>Another point about going to the courts is this.  Have we sufficiently considered the fact that the planning authorities themselves would be enabled to take these cases to the court?  They could and might well do so frequently without the same burden being imposed on them in the way of costs as would be imposed on the other party to a dispute, who might not wish to go to the court.  Such a development might not be so welcome to many of those who will be parties to land value disputes.  It is only a thought but it is worth considering.</P>
    <P>The system of arbitration is an oldestablished one and the procedure is well known down the years.  The primary purpose of arbitration, to my mind, is to avoid going to the courts and the attendant additional costs.  It is also there on the basis that the best procurable specialist in the country is the man who from time to time must be relied on by the authorities and individuals who may feel aggrieved.  That type of man has given first-class service all along under the various enactments I have mentioned and many I did not recall.  I believe the movement of these disputes to the courts would not be likely to be to the advantage of the individual landholders who may come before the arbitrator.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, I do not feel that even in this isolated instance, in the measure before us, I could subscribe to <Col N="1658" /> the idea of having the findings of the arbitrator subject to court proceedings. When we examine other legislation and enactments that have enshrined the arbitration system and try to discover whether as a result of experience the arbitration system has failed, I assert it is shown that it has not failed.  Since that can be said after so many years and so many difficult cases, I feel any effort to change the system should fail at this stage.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2) A planning authority shall not prosecute in a case in which an offence under section 53 of this Act is alleged to have been committed in relation to an advertisement unless the advertisement is exempted <Col N="1659" /> development and they have decided that the advertisement would injure the amenities of their area and, in the case of an advertisement advertising a public meeting, unless the advertisement has been in position for seven days or longer after the date of the meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was put down to allay the fears expressed on the Committee Stage by a number of Deputies in relation to Section 53.  It will make clear that the planning authority may prosecute under this section only in respect of advertisements which constitute exempted development and, accordingly, are not otherwise subject to control.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;81. &mdash;(1) Where (in the case of occupied land) the occupier or (in the case of unoccupied land) the owner refuses to permit the exercise of a power of entry conferred by this Act on a planning authority, the authority shall not exercise the power save pursuant to an order of the District Court approving of the entry.</P>
      <P>(2) The following provisions shall have effect in relation to an application for an order under this section:</P>
      <P>(a) the application shall be made, on notice to the person who refused to permit the exercise of the power of entry, to the justice of the District Court having jurisdiction in the district court district in which the land or part of the land is situate.</P>
      <P>(b) the application shall be granted unless the proposed entry is to be made pursuant to section 31, 32 or 33 of this Act on a structure and the said person satisfies the court in a case of noncompliance with a condition, that the condition was complied with or, in any other case, that the structure is not an unauthorised structure,</P>

      <Col N="1660" /> (c) an order made on the application may require that entry shall not be effected during a specified period of one week or less commencing on the date of the order.</P>
    <P>(3) Any person who, by act or omission, obstructs an entry approved of by order under this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds; and if in the case of a continuing offence the obstruction is continued after conviction, he shall be guilty of a further offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five pounds for each day on which the obstruction is continued.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment will be to delete the section which made it an offence to obstruct the planning authority in the exercise of any power of entry given under the Bill, and to substitute this new section.  It means that if the occupier of a property to which the planning authority wish to gain access under the terms of this Bill objects&mdash;and I do not mean physically obstructs&mdash;we shall take care to see that is clearly understood&mdash;then the onus will be on the planning authority to go to the court to seek an order that would give them the right of entry to that property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased we have had a great measure of useful discussion <Col N="1662" /> on this Bill.  We hope this legislation will do all the Minister intends it to do and that it will be an effective instrument of good planning.  There is just one thing I would ask the Minister to do at this stage and that is to provide a handbook in simple nontechnical language which would be available to the public for reference. When planning reaches a certain stage in various areas and when the town planners get together, no doubt a map will be on display at the various county council offices.  That will be helpful but I would also ask the Minister to publish a handbook explaining the provisions of this Bill in simple, nontechnical language so that the public will have an idea of what concerns them in regard to planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a valedictory word on this Bill before it leaves the House.  As an experienced parliamentarian, I have participated in a very minor and insignificant way in the discussions on this Bill but I have been a close observer of its progress in this House.  As an experienced politician, I accept the principle that it is never expedient to praise a member of the Administration but, subject to that reservation, we have reason to congratulate the Minister and Deputy Jones for a very fine performance in the enactment of a formidable piece of legislation which, we are all probably agreed, has been improved by its passage through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be only becoming for me here to express fully my admiration for the manner in which Deputy Jones has dealt with this piece of legislation on behalf of our Party and the Opposition. His encyclopaedic knowledge of it and his unfailing diligence and skill in bringing before the House those aspects of the legislation which we thought were susceptible of improvement have resulted in very valuable amendments to this Bill. That, in turn, resulted in an accented demonstration of the perfection of parliamentary legislation.  That, I freely admit, could not have happened if Deputy Jones's efforts had not been met by the Minister, and when I speak of the Minister I speak of him in the <Col N="1663" /> widest sense of that term, in the spirit in which he has met them.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the discussion, there are certain matters outstanding between us on which we are constrained to disagree.  I think the event will ultimately prove who were best advised but, in regard to most essentials, substantial agreement has been arrived at.  For that I think we have every reason to be grateful from the point of view of the functioning of our own Parliament.  Would that every piece of legislation were dealt with by Dáil Éireann in the same way that this Bill has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Sir, because I can afford to view these matters with equanimity, I think this is an occasion when the Third Estate may with propriety say a word to the Fourth Estate.  I have seen this Bill carried through the long and tedious examination involved in this legislation.  Outside of this House, I do not suppose one hundred people know the vast volume of meticulous work that has gone into this legislation for the benefit of the people as a whole.  But let half a dozen Deputies here lose their tempers for ten minutes and it makes the front page of every national newspaper in the country.  I think that is something we here in Oireachtas Éireann are entitled to deplore.  There is a lack of proportion in it, which is most unfortunate from the national point of view.  It operates to denigrate our institutions not only in our own eyes but in the eyes of the people.  Ninety-nine per cent of the time of this Dáil is taken up with the tedious process of the review of legislation and the questioning of Ministers as to the due performance of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>To our eternal credit, 99 per cent of our time is taken up by that deliberation and by the appearance here of every Minister of State, from the Taoiseach down to the youngest Parliamentary Secretary, to answer faithfully to each individual Deputy in so far as that Deputy considers it to be his public duty to interrogate him.  If, on occasion, the deliberative atmosphere of this House is ruffled by transient storms, this would not be a <Col N="1664" /> human institution at all if that were never to happen.  I hope that in the years that lie ahead those concerned to draw a true picture of the functioning of our institution will dwell no more than equally&mdash;that is all I ask&mdash; on the kind of work that culminates with the passage of this Bill and the kind of passing tempest which all too frequently is excessively advertised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more than happy that we have reached this juncture.  I am happy not merely because of the pleasant words from a rather unexpected quarter but particularly gratified because of the feeling I have had ever since this Bill was introduced.  From the start of this measure I felt that no matter how excellent it was, how good or how bad its provisions might be, it could only get off to a good start if it were agreed, or as near to being agreed as is humanly possible.</P>
      <P>We have had many long sessions on this Bill on all its various stages.  We have dealt with something in the region of 300 amendments.  Not once during the disposal of these amendments was the division bell rung.  That represented to me the fulfilment of the wish I expressed at the outset that we would get as near as possible to an agreed measure.  While we still have certain reservations and certain opinions as to what ought or ought not to be contained in the Bill, we have, by and large, completed in this House a Bill which can be said to be almost agreed, if not in all its details certainly in most of its provisions.</P>
      <P>Those who contributed to the debate and who participated in the various discussions&mdash;here I refer in particular to Deputy Jones, who as has been mentioned, gave a great deal of time and thought and study to the contents of the Bill; some of his proposals have been added to the original text&mdash;are to be commended.  This Bill comes on the heels of a rather exhilarated exchange which took place here in the past few days, which was much publicised, and the publicising of it is something I deplore just as much as does Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a happy omen that we should finish this evening on a definite note <Col N="1665" /> of accord.  In so far as the matters mentioned by Deputy Jones are concerned, he will be happy to know that the handbook he suggested might be prepared is actually in course of preparation. I gave instructions a few weeks ago that it should be prepared for the benefit of the ordinary public and particularly for the benefit of planning authorities throughout the country.  In addition, lectures will be arranged in the next few months similar to those which proved so successful last year. It is our intention to have in the future a summer planning school at which planning matters can be discussed.  No doubt other subjects may be discussed as well.</P>
    <P>This Bill will clear the way for urban renewal and redevelopment, particularly in the case of our bigger centres of population, such as Dublin city.  When we started out it was not evident that this urban renewal and redevelopment could be carried out without very grave financial burdens on local authorities.  I am now aware that there is a very real interest in this matter on the part of the big financial houses and the big financiers.  They want to participate in this urban renewal.  I have very clear evidence of this interest.  I am glad that it should have been aroused because it will mean that local authorities will not be alone in carrying the financial burden of such urban renewal and redevelopment. They will have coming to hand offers of financial assistance, offers to take over obsolete areas and developing them privately.  Above all, there will be ready to hand, even at this stage, quite substantial amounts of money which will go to supplement the finances of any local authority, particularly in our cities, who wish to get on with this vital renewal work of our city structure.</P>
    <P>If there is to be any real result from this Bill that is the first result I am anticipating.  I believe it can become a reality at quite an early date.  It will be good for all of us but particularly for the cities which due to the age of their structures and the changing times and patterns of our life, have become obsolete.  That is something to which we can look forward and something <Col N="1666" /> on which in the Seanad I may say more.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like to express something which I have not yet expressed and which I seldom express and that is appreciation of my own officers and advisers who have done trojan work, unrewarding work if you like, but who, when the finished article emerges and the developments arising from this measure take place, will have their reward then.  I should like to thank them for the unceasing work which they have put into preparing this measure.  I say that and I mean it in this case because I seldom say it in any other case and I say it because I believe it and it is not a mere formula. In case anybody might have any doubts about who I am referring to I mean my own Department of Local Government officers.  I think I should refer to one person in particular&mdash;not by name&mdash;and that is the Parliamentary draftsman.  I think that at times he did not get much sleep as a result of the occasions on which matters were referred back to him either by myself, the Opposition members or my officers I do not think he has had a great deal of peace in recent weeks.  I should like to thank him publicly.  If the Bill does anything like half of what we believe it is capable of doing then the work of all those who have taken part in this&mdash; members of the House, the officials, the draftsman and all others&mdash;will be well rewarded and well repaid in that we will have a better and more ordered life in our community.</P>
