      <P>Last week I put down a civil question to the Taoiseach inquiring what the arrangements were in regard to the reception of President Kennedy by the House.  Yesterday I received a communication from you, Sir, stating that you were disallowing the question because the Taoiseach had no official responsibility in this matter. I want to know, and people would like to know, who has responsibility, what the details are and why all the secrecy about it.</P>

There are a variety of other matters connected with the visit on which I assume consultation will take place as soon as the Taoiseach can arrange it. So far as the Oireachtas is concerned, it is a matter for us to arrange here under your presidency and that of the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  Is that not correct?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,074,300 be granted to complete <Col N="824" /> the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry, including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land. </P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister towards the end of his statement yesterday, said that the total investment value in the State forests is now in excess of £40 million.  That is a very important fact to which we should have regard. Instinctively, all of us have desired to see forestry expanded in this country largely because it is a means of using the type of land for production which otherwise tends to fall into desuetude but when you face the fact that existing forests represent an investment of £40 million, you should not overlook that that represents an annual charge on the Exchequer of £2 million.  That charge has been building up to the present level over the past 40 years.  I think it is right to say that the total yield from sales from forests this year is of the order of £500,000, but against that there are substantial charges for forest maintenance and we are at present approaching the point, I think, where our annual outgoings on maintenance and development are approximately offset by our timber sales.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if that is not a somewhat optimistic estimate of the situation but all the time now we are paying £2 million per annum in standing charges on the capital investment.  I should be glad to hear the Minister give us some long-term estimate of when we may expect the forests to begin to yield a profit which will meet the annual capital charges and whether there is any prospect of their ever catching up on the annual losses that we have been sustaining through the interest payable on capital investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must bear in mind that forests take approximately 40 years to mature fully and although we get thinnings and poles from them in the maturing process, the value of the timber is only available at the end of the 40 year term. That means it is only now that the relatively small acreage of forests planted when the State was first <Col N="825" /> founded is reaching full maturity. But I do not think it is unreasonable, in view of this annual charge of about £2 million, to ask that we should have a long-term estimate of when the whole forestry programme is likely to show a real profit, or at least break even without imposing any charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>On page 6 of his statement, the Minister dwelt at some length on the Forestry Division's decision to plant extensively in the western counties and commented that almost half the lands at present being considered for acquisition are situated in that area.  He also said that of the 25,000 acres which it is envisaged will be planted this year, some 40 per cent will be located in the western counties.  I should like to know in how far the Glenamoy research station has contributed to making that possible.  When I was a member of the Government, there was quite a good deal of controversy as to whether you could profitably plant bog soil to forests and it was largely with the purpose of resolving that problem that we established the research station at Glenamoy, half of which was devoted to the Department of Agriculture and the other half to Forestry.  I understand some of the work done at Glenamoy has helped to make bogland available for plantation but I should like to hear whether any clear resolution of the controversy has been achieved.  There were people who advanced the proposition that planting trees on bogland was a waste of time and money.  There were others with the directly opposite view and I should like to know whether we have reached the stage when you can confidently say that planting on bogland is safe and calculated to produce in due course a crop which will reach full maturity.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that felling is mainly confined at present to special orders for the ESB and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It would be of great interest to the House and to the country if the Minister could give us a prognostication over the next few years of what the prospects are of the growing yield of forest produce which is suitable for sale standing to timber merchants.  We know a good <Col N="826" /> deal of timber now coming from the forests is being used in the factory at Athy, in some of the chipboard factories and I think in some of the paper factories.  All that is most satisfactory but it concerns relatively immature timber.  I take it that what is sold to the timber merchants is the mature timber and I should like to know what are the prospects of the rate of growth of available timber for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that the increased distribution of wages was a useful boost to the spending power of the areas in which the wages were paid, but, unfortunately, he went on to say:</P>
    <P>It also indicates a sharp rise in the cost of our forestry operations. Forestry costs are particularly sensitive to wage variations because of the high employment content of forestry work. </P>
    <P>In that connection I should be glad if he could tell us what are the prospects for timber prices in the world.  I always remember with some anxiety a period back in the 1930s when prices for primary products were falling very heavily.  I remember meeting in Canada the Minister for Forestry there.  I said to him: &ldquo;This collapse in the price of timber must be a bit of a headache for you.&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;Not in the least, Mr. Dillon.  When the price of timber rises, we move down to the southern verges of our forest areas, which are the parts we cut and replant.  That timber is relatively expensive, and when prices are high we exploit that.  But as prices fall, we move back into the virgin forests.  With our modern equipment&rdquo;&mdash;this is speaking 30 years ago &mdash;&ldquo; that timber virtually costs us nothing. It is merely a matter of where we cut.  To us the price is relatively unimportant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They, of course, are blessed in Canada, as they are in Russia and some of the Scandinavian countries, with vast areas of virgin forests, which are simply a national bonus accumulated down the centuries.  Unfortunately, we have no such national bonus.  All our forests, like the Black Forest in Germany, have been planted by hand. All our forestry is relatively expensive. <Col N="827" /> I should be glad to note from the Minister what the prospects are for timber prices generally and whether he expects over the long term, considering world demand and potential world supply, that the price will tend to rise or fall.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I should like to ask the Minister about, and doubtless he will be able to explain it to me.  I recently spent a holiday in the Black Forest in Germany.  One of the strange things that struck me, being Irish, on visiting the Black Forest was that the further you went in the Black Forest the more abundantly clear it was that the municipal and forestry authorities, far from looking at it with apprehension, made every conceivable arrangement to encourage people to walk through the forests and to enjoy the very great amenity of spending your holiday time visiting the forests.  There were walks cut through them and benches fixed for people's convenience to rest and so forth.  You felt this was a tourist attraction which the German Government were anxious to exploit in every way.  It is a delightful tourist attraction. Right in the middle of the forest in various places you came upon large restaurants for the convenience of tourists.</P>
    <P>Am I mistaken if I get the feeling here in Ireland that one approaches a State forest almost with a guilty feeling? As you approach the edge of a forest here you get to feel more and more like a rabbit.  This is a place where human beings and rabbits are not welcome.  I have great sympathy with the forestry authorities.  I know the danger of irresponsible people in forests either throwing away bottles, and precipitating fires through some of the glass falling on the undergrowth, or of people throwing away cigarette ends and matches or even contemplating lighting picnic fires in forestry areas.  I can understand the anxiety of foresters regarding dangers of that kind putting valuable plantations in peril.  I have seen people guilty of acts of extraordinary folly resulting in horrible loss.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> Yet what I do not quite understand is this.  In Germany they do not seem to be afraid of that at all.  It is not all Germans who go there.  As we know, in the Black Forest there is a very high percentage of tourists and foreigners, but they are exhorted and encouraged to use the forest freely and it is widely publicised as one of their principal tourist attractions.  I do not think we take the same view.  Some people may say at first that the quality of the forests is different, that the continental forests are largely hardwoods, whereas our own are planted with softwoods. That is not true.  The Black Forest and the Vosges originally were primeval forests, but the Germans now make quite a boast of the fact that every tree in the Black Forest has been planted by hand.  With the cutting of timber down through the centuries and a careful policy of replanting, in fact almost all the indigenous timber has been converted into lumber and replaced by trees planted by the local authority or whoever is responsible for that particular area of forest.</P>
    <P>There is a high percentage of hardwoods in these continental forests, but the vast bulk of the wood is softwood, susceptible to the same perils as we would experience here.  Furthermore, it is true to say in these regions the average annual rainfall is very much lower than with us.  They have much longer periods of intense drought and high temperature than we ordinarily have.  Yet I get the feeling in these forests that peripatetic tourists are welcome, while in ours the reverse is the case.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on that when he is finished and make it clear whether, in fact, the forestry authorities here would desire to see the forests used as a tourist amenity or whether there is some special circumstance obtaining here which creates dangers that do not obtain on the continent.</P>
    <P>This is one of the Estimates in which any Minister responsible for it is in the happy state that he carries with him the cordial goodwill of every side of the House and everybody's best wishes for the success of his labours. I listened to Deputy Tully with sympathy when he spoke of small millowners. <Col N="829" /> I remember fighting many a hard battle when I had partial responsibility for these things.  If the Forestry Division is ever to have an opportunity of justifying itself economically, it must have access to the most profitable market it can find for the disposal of the produce of the forests for which it is responsible.</P>
    <P>During the war reasonably strict restrictions were made on the export of timber from this country.  There was an acute shortage of certain essential materials here and in every other country, and it was natural that we should look after our own people before we supplied anybody else.</P>
    <P>There is no shortage of timber in the world now and I want to urge on the Minister for Lands that no sort of restriction should be tolerated on the free sale of timber by the Forestry Division.  If they can sell the timber out of their forests to an Afghan, to a Chinaman or to a Greek at a price higher than a person here is prepared to pay, they should be allowed to sell it because the fellow here can buy timber anywhere in the world and use it in his factory.  It is utterly intolerable that our Forestry Division should be asked to bear the burden of subsidising domestic industry.</P>
    <P>Such a practice is only calculated to knock the heart out of men who are trying to make a success out of a broad forestry programme and if they have not access to the broadest type of market, then they are forever dragging a ball and chain around their ankles and their efforts to reach even the break-even point at which they will be able to repay the capital invested plus the running costs of our forestry programme will be set at nought.  The Minister for Lands has a very special duty to resist pressure from any other member of the Government who would seek to restrict the absolute freedom of the Forestry Division to sell timber at the best possible price, however and wherever they can get it, and whatever is the purpose or the destination of the timber.</P>
    <P>Subject to those observations, I do not intend to say very much on this Estimate.  We all have difficulties in our several constituencies about people <Col N="830" /> looking for work in forestry.  I do not know who actually appoints the labourers in the various areas but my impression is that the procedure followed is that somebody applies to the labour exchange.  Is it the forester-in-charge who does it?  I am continually writing to the Minister or to the permanent Secretary of the Department saying that Pat McCloskey or someone else wants work but I am never quite sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The forester-in-charge applies to the local labour exchange when there is a vacancy in his area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we all have experience of constituents who want jobs sending us particulars of their circumstances.  My policy in that respect is to send these particulars to the Minister's office.  I suppose he communicates it to the forester-in-charge. Everybody seems to be saying that the supporters of the other political Party are getting all the jobs.  If and when that appears to me to be true, I shall say so here plainly and bluntly, but I feel an equal obligation, when I believe it is not true, to say so, and broadly speaking, it is my experience that people get the jobs largely as a consequence of the due performance of their work and of their family circumstances.</P>
      <P>If a man does an honest day's work and is married, he has a prior claim. Whether he is married or single, if he does not do an honest day's work, he should not be re-employed by the Forestry Division.  So far, I do not think anybody whom I ever sought employment for got employment, but I have not any reason to believe that was due to any malice towards my supporter particularly.  I have seen others who made no representations getting employment but perhaps those who made representations to me had already been turned down for good and sufficient reasons.  I hope, though, that when people are being employed on forestry, the rules will continue to be observed and that family men who are good workers will be given preference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now reached a stage in <Col N="831" /> afforestation where the temporary character of employment is passing away.  There is a growing corps of more or less permanent skilled employees on the forestry staff and would the House not think the time is ripe for the Department of Lands to institute an ordinary superannuation scheme for these permanent employees? I fully appreciate that all the employees are not absolutely permanent but I do not think I exaggerate when I say a large proportion of the employees working in the forests now are on as permanent a basis as road workers or other county council employees.</P>
    <P>That being so, surely it should not be beyond the genius of the Department of Lands to work out a workable superannuation scheme to which these permanent employees could have access?  It is a bad thing to have a group of men who feel themselves to be in permanent skilled employment, working where all other similarly employed persons round them have that ultimate element of security&mdash;not only permanence of employment but participation in a superannuation scheme &mdash;being denied that amenity.  I would urge on the Minister for Lands to have this problem looked to at once because I believe it is now capable of solution and should be attended to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me compliment the Minister and his officials on this Estimate.  It is not my intention to speak for very long, there being only a few points of special interest to me.  Our forestry programme has expanded down through the years and as time goes on, we can all agree it will change the whole look of the countryside, particularly in western areas where the scene has been so barren and bleak.  This change is all for the better.  I want to thank the Minister for the increase in wages given to the sawmill workers in Cong, giving them a measure of parity with their fellow-workers in Dundrum.  That arrangement has been very much appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main reason for speaking is to press a point that has been worrying farmers in the west where young plantations <Col N="832" /> have been springing up on mountain land being taken over and prepared for planting.  I mention this because in certain areas not all the land taken over by the Forestry Division is suitable for planting, especially where there are clusters of rock, identified locally as dens for foxes, and that is exactly what they are.  Before planting is done, I suggest that these places should be sprayed or, if that is not possible, then the furze and whins should be burned out.  If that is done before planting takes place, it will not constitute a hazard and it will rid these areas of vermin.  In the western areas, farmers suffer heavy losses through the depredations of foxes, particularly in the lambing season.  The housewife suffers heavy poultry losses. It is not unusual in my experience to meet as many as 12 foxes crossing the road at night, sometimes with young lambs in their mouths or the housewife's poultry.  If my suggestion of chemical spraying or burning is accepted, that should help to get rid of these coverts.</P>
    <P>With regard to fire hazards, I do not think there are sufficient notices warning people of the danger.  Where the forest fronts the road, there should be notices at frequent intervals.  That would help to eliminate a good deal of the danger.</P>
    <P>Last year I mentioned a survey of lakes or springs for the purpose of having these clearly marked on maps in order that fire personnel in the different areas would know where to locate water when it is needed at short notice.  Those who are not familiar with this kind of terrain have no appreciation of the speed at which a fire in heather, gorse, or furze can spread; its passage is as swift as that of the hare running before the hounds.  It is very important that all available water supplies should be mapped.</P>
    <P>There are occasions when the Forestry Division refuse land because the bog is too deep.  I suggest that the Land Commission should take over this turbary and let it for ten to 15 years with an intimation to the lessees that they must cut a level depth of eight or ten feet.  After that, the <Col N="833" /> ground could be prepared for planting at a later stage.  That would be a good day's work, in my opinion, because it would provide a pool in the future when land for afforestation may threaten to become scarce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about forestry workers.  I do not think the situation is quite so simple as he says it is. Temporary workers very often go into an area where there are many people unemployed, people who may be in worse circumstances than these purely temporary workers are themselves. It is very hard for these to see others coming in from outside and practically taking the bread out of their mouths.  If these were permanent workers, I would have no objection, but they are purely and simply unskilled temporary workers, engaged on making drains, or something like that. I hold local people should be recruited first and, if there are not enough local people, then there will be no objection to bringing in workers from outside. The more local employment there is, the greater interest there will be in the young forests and the more care will be taken to prevent fires or vandalism.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and his Department the best of luck.</P>

      <P>The Minister and his Department are doing very good work where forestry is concerned. There are, however, certain things I should like to tell the Minister, things it might be useful for him to know, and things which might prove useful to the people in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  There are many good, faithful and loyal workers who have given long service and who feel that the provision made for them by the Department is not in keeping with the times.  When they become ill or disabled as a result of their hard life as forestry workers in our wet climate, they may be incapacitated for two, three or perhaps six months and do not receive any worthwhile compensation. The Minister should consider that matter very carefully.  That is a very serious situation for a married man to find himself in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where possible, senior men should <Col N="834" /> be given the opportunity of working on the forest that is nearest to their homes.  I have been approached by men who are now 65 years of age, who have been working for the Department for over 20 years and who have to cycle a distance of 16 miles a day, which represents considerable hardship. That is particularly the case in Leitrim where the roads leading to plantations are very bad.  I have already made representations to the Department on behalf of these people and I would ask the Minister to ensure that such workers will not have to undertake long journeys to their work if it is possible to provide work for them nearer to their homes.</P>
    <P>I have received letters recently from forestry workers representing that they should receive the same treatment as is given to county council and other similar workers who enjoy a five-day week.  The forestry workers cannot understand why they should not get equal treatment.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that forestry workers will be put on an equal basis with county council workers.  It has been represented to me that the persons concerned have small holdings and that if they were free to work these holdings on Saturday it would be of considerable help to them.</P>
    <P>There is another problem that arises in the constituency that I represent. When the Forestry Division commence negotiations for the purchase of land an official calls on the owner.  The owner may not be a person who is able to negotiate a deal.  We find that it may be only after three bids are made that agreement is reached.  That should not be the case.  If a county council engineer makes an estimate for road work or anything of that kind, he does not change the estimate for any Deputy, county councillor or anybody else.  The official should arrive at his price only after careful consideration and should stick to that price.  There have been cases where widowed mothers have not been able to negotiate a good bargain with some of the officials.  A very awkward situation arises when the owner asks a Deputy or county councillor for advice in the matter.  The only advice such a person <Col N="835" /> could give is to hold out for the highest bid.  If the official concerned decides on the price that the Forestry Division will give and adheres to that decision it will mean that there will be no bargaining and it will not be possible for one person to say that he got a higher price than another.  That would make the position much more satisfactory for those disposing of land.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, generally speaking, it is easier for the Forestry Division to purchase land than it is for an individual buyer.  A local person may be anxious to purchase a field or two or three fields of the land adjoining his holding.  I have made representations to the Forestry Division that such persons should be facilitated but the reply I have received is that the Forestry Division do not buy land for the purpose of disposing of it.  I fully realise that, but there is always the isolated case where the person anxious to acquire a small portion of land could not secure it at any price.  If the Department were to consider the matter, they would realise that a local person could be provided with a very comfortable holding by being given the field that adjoins his land.  I know of several cases where that would apply.  The people concerned would be most grateful if they could get the additional small portion of land they want.</P>
    <P>In the Ballinamore district in my constituency I was invited to the home of a businessman who occasionally goes out to the rural areas on a Sunday evening with his family in his car. He told me that he noticed many acres of cutaway bog that were going wild, some of it partly cut, some of it completely cut.  He wondered if the Department could do something about clearing up that type of land and putting it into shape.  Another Deputy has already mentioned the question of cut-away bog.  Such stretches of land could be acquired for nothing in many cases because they are of no benefit to the neighbourhood.  The matter should be carefully considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A matter that has been brought to my notice frequently is the purchase of <Col N="836" /> road material for forest roads.  In my constituency such purchases are made by tender.  Priority should be given to the local man and the road material should be taken out of the local quarry. Generally speaking, forest roads do not carry any great volume of traffic, once the forest has been planted and the work has been carried out.  Perhaps in 40 years' time when the forest is being cut down the road will be used more extensively.  People in the Glenfarne area have asked me about this matter and I have made representations to the Department about it.  I would be grateful if the Minister would consider it.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, thinnings were piled in various plantations and a price was fixed on the lots of thinnings by number.  I cannot give the number or the price, but I know that if people did not pay the price, the thinnings were left in the woods to rot.  That should not happen.  If the thinnings are not bought, they should be offered at a price.  They should not be left to rot. They would be very useful as firewood. There are some unfortunate people who might be glad to take the thinnings away for firewood.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the highest percentage of land being purchased and planted by him is in the western part of Ireland.  I suppose we can well understand that.  It is a sad thing to have to say&mdash;and I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will not rule me out of order&mdash;that it is due to the fact that the young men down in that area are not getting sufficient employment, with the result that they have to sell their small holdings and bail out.  That is a fact, and that is the reason there is so much land for forestry in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister and the Department on being practically able to achieve the 25,000 acres target set for the past number of years for planting. Most of the planting is done during the winter months, and it is to their credit that they were able to get the work done in view of the winter we had last year.  When buying land for planting, and when a person has been good enough to offer land for sale, <Col N="837" /> they should try to offer a price in a reasonable space of time.  I gather that one is lucky if one can get an offer out of the Department inside a year, and it usually takes much longer.  That is hard on the farmers who have offered land.  They cannot make any plans for the future.</P>
      <P>It is very annoying for a Deputy when people keep coming to him every three or four months and he makes representations to the Department and the Minister, and there still seems to be no improvement in the matter.  If you could make an offer first and then go into the legal end of it and look into the title, you would at least know whether the person was prepared to accept it, but you are inclined to go into the legal and and title end first before making an offer.  In the sale of a farm, the person buys the farm and then goes into the legal and title end.  Your Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's Department should do the same. People would be happier if they did. We must encourage people to offer land to the Forestry Division so that they will be able to get their 25,000 acres. We must always remember the years to come.  A high target has to be reached in the next five or 10 years. In the interests of good public relations, something should be done to make these people an offer and then go into the legal end.  We all know that legal people are notorious for being slow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With large-scale planting each year, we are creating extra employment.  If people were not engaged on this work, they would be looking for employment elsewhere.  It is work which develops our natural resources and our national wealth.  Just as on a farm, no country can leave an amount of land lying idle.  Forestry is turning inferior land into good productive land that will bring in quite an amount of money in years to come.  Unfortunately it takes quite a while for forests to mature. <Col N="838" /> They must be treated as a crop.  Some of the Scandinavian countries are mountainous and have a lot of inferior land but in Sweden, for example, 55 per cent of the national income comes from forestry.  It is only natural that 40 per cent of the planting is done in the west where the land is poor in parts.</P>
    <P>I should also like to remind the Minister that in my constituency, Kildare, we have a number of low bogs and cutaway bogs which could be planted.  In quite a number of cases, there is no direct ownership.  They have been cut, and are lying idle and unproductive.  There are some dangerous drains and bogholes, and it is a pity to see that land going to waste. I imagine it would be quite suitable for forestry purposes.  There are low bogs around the Bord na Móna areas which could be taken in, and which would help to relieve unemployment when Bord na Móna lay people off during the autumn.  The Department's busiest time is the winter period.</P>
    <P>With the amount of timber being planted, the Minister's Department should be looking to the future.  They should be thinking of a pulp mill.  We import quite an amount of newsprint each year.  Some of our timber could be used for this purpose. That would certainly save quite an amount of the money which goes out of the country to buy pulp. A pulp mill could very easily be set up.</P>
    <P>More encouragement should be given to private planting.  I know there are many objections to it and it needs a good deal of incentive because, with most farmers, when there is a piece of land at the end of their farm that is suitable for planting, they feel that if they plant it it is their family that will reap the benefit of it and it is hard to look 40 years ahead but they should be made realise that if that planting were done on a large scale, it would increase their acreage immensely and would be most useful as a shelterbelt in exposed areas.  There is an old saying in my county that a shelter is half the feed to cattle in the wintertime.  It is the same in the summer.  They have a nice cool place in the shade in which to lie in some of those forests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> I am glad to see that the Forestry Division are co-operating with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in regard to supplying poles for telephone lines.  It is only natural that there should be that dovetailing and that one Department should supply the raw material for another.  It is money saved from going out of the country and it creates employment within the country.</P>
    <P>In a number of areas, there are roads leading up to forests.  I am thinking in terms of a farm having been taken over; part of it has been divided by the Land Commission and the other part has been taken over by the Forestry Division.  There are Land Commission farms and houses on this road and at the end of it, there is the forest.  Some scheme should be brought in for repairing those roads, particularly coming into the wintertime.  It is not always that these people are able to collect sufficient money to have a rural improvement scheme carried out. Even if the Forestry Division contributes something, it is still hard to get enough money to put such a scheme into operation.  A headline should be set by the Minister by having at least some gravel used to fill up the holes because this is usually a bone of contention with the people living on these roads.  In Kerrinstown, Killucan, the Forestry Division took over a forest and there was a freshly-made Land Commission road there.  The result is that ever since it is very hard for the people to get in or out of that road.  It has never been repaired by the Land Commission.  The Forestry Division are using it and they are taking timber away from this forest and the people living along that road have been paying the penalty for that.  Something should be done to help people in such a situation.</P>
    <P>A superannuation scheme should be brought in for people working in these forests.  Their neighbours who are working for the county council or with Bord na Móna have such a scheme. Quite a number of these people have been working for years and it would be a great incentive to them if they could look forward to a pension when they retire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> Another matter I wish to bring to the Minister's notice is that of the price offered for land.  Very often a price is offered and when it is not accepted, the offer is increased.  If that is done by a private person, well and good, but when it is a Government Department, that procedure should not be adopted. In most Departments, there is a set price and they will not change one way or the other but the Forestry Division are inclined to change the price once or twice.  The result is that people will not accept straight away.  They will bargain and the negotiations are drawn out.  It would be better if, as in other Departments, the one offer were made. The Forestry Division have an idea what the land is worth and they should give the full value of it straight away.</P>
    <P>I should like again to compliment the Minister and his Department on the way they achieved the 25,000 acres planting in the past year, in spite of such a hard winter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my congratulations to the Minister and his Department on the great national work they are doing.  The afforestation scheme in my county is of inestimable value by virtue of the fact that large numbers are employed, particularly in mountain areas in Kerry where employment was never available before.  I would, however, ask the Minister to expedite the purchase of the various parcels of mountain land that are on offer in County Kerry.  From time to time, there are foreigners who are interested in making offers and the Minister should push ahead with all speed to get possession of any parcels of land which are available.</P>
      <P>I have in mind particularly a parcel of land in Glencar, County Kerry, where a firm of Dublin auctioneers got a lien from the landlord on 280 acres. This would be a very suitable area for afforestation purposes.  It runs along the shores of the lake and would add to the scenic beauty of the area.  It is also a tourist route.  The Minister should get control of these parcels of land and not leave them available to foreigners who are inclined to purchase so much of our land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commercial timber which is coming to hand, in my county anyway, <Col N="841" /> is of exceptional first-class quality and is contributing very much towards reducing imports of timber from foreign countries particularly those countries which are doing very little trade with us.  The Forestry Division are to be congratulated on their method of turning out this timber for sale.  In most cases, it is cut down and sold in lengths.  Where standing timber is sold, there is a good road system and easy access to the timber which is very useful for the timber merchants.</P>
    <P>In recent times, I have noticed an exceptional demand for beech within the country.  It is at a very high price and is not as plentiful as it used be.  I remember during the war years large quantities were available but there was very little commercial use for it.  Now it seems to have come into its own again.  I wonder if the Forestry Division is keeping an eye on this side of things and developing beechwood along with the other types of trees being planted.  I am given to understand in the trade that more and more beech is likely to be required in the future.  I am not sure what the general programme of the Forestry Division is, or if they are planting large quantities of beech, but I suggest that they have regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>It has often struck me that within the Forestry Division some form of control should be exercised in regard to the importation of timber.  I do not know what type of control they could exercise.  I do not know which Department controls this in the ordinary way but I suppose there must be some control somewhere.  Timber seems to be available from countries which are doing very little trade with us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that I am stepping out of line but I am merely trying to draw attention to the fact that there appear to be large quantities of timber available in countries such as Nigeria.  I am in the trade and I am wondering if sufficient control is being exercised.  The Department of Lands should have some say in the <Col N="842" /> general importation of timber as timber is their business.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon wondered if the price of timber would come down and thus affect the Forestry Division.  Indications all over the world point to the fact that there is not sufficient timber grown to meet all the uses to which timber is now being put and frantic efforts are being made to develop other substitute materials. The supply of wood will never exceed the demand so, therefore, we have nothing to fear.  We can go ahead with our planting as fast as we can and we will be developing a real national asset.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon also expressed a wish that at some point we should reach the stage where afforestation would be self-paying.  That would be a great achievement and a good position to be in but we have to remember that were it not for afforestation, large sums of unemployment assistance would have to be paid out in areas where this work is undertaken extensively. Therefore, it is not really the loss it appears to be on paper.  The very many people we employ all over the country would, as I say, have to be paid large sums of unemployment assistance and the Exchequer would be paying out in another way.</P>
      <P>In regard to cutaway bog, there must be great possibilities.  There is proof that trees grew there in other days because you find the ends and butts of trees in the bog and if they grew there once, it should be possible to grow them there again.  The Department have their eyes on that possibility and are prepared to plant where the ground is suitable.  I would urge the Department to develop planting to the maximum in the western areas.  It is a most profitable form of investment and gives the nation the best advantage by keeping people at home in useful employment.  The best way we can serve the interests of these people is to procure all the available land and to push the matter of sales as quickly as possible.  I should again like to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the exceptional work they are doing in my county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a constituency in the west of Ireland which has tremendous forestry potentialities I would be lacking in my duty if I did not speak on this important Estimate. Too much stress cannot be laid on the importance of afforestation, particularly in the west of Ireland where we are faced with the problem of emigration and people leaving the land. The Minister, who also comes from the west of Ireland, can appreciate the importance of afforestation and while the Minister and I differ politically, credit is due to him for his great efforts in this regard since he took over the Department of Lands.</P>
      <P>I should like to see more and more progress in afforestation in my constituency. We have a lot of good mountain land which is ideal for afforestation and we have a lot of cutaway bog.  Employment is created, first of all, at the planting stage and also at what we describe as the thinning out stage and again when the product reaches maturity.  I am sure that the Minister will keep in mind, and I am certain that he has found this from his continental travel, that industries can be established near forests.  I hope he will keep in mind the possibility of timber industries close to the forests in the west.  It would be an ideal solution to the emigration problem.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the Minister for Education, the Minister for Lands should issue a pamphlet to every national teacher so that children will be made aware of how to plant trees. Ten or 15 minutes should be devoted each day to explaining to children how to retransplant trees.  Great interest could thus be aroused in young children in afforestation.</P>
      <P>Frequently there are advertisements in the newspapers and on television appealing to people to exercise care in relation to throwing away lighted matches, cigarette ends, and so on, when passing forests.  In co-operation with the Department of Education, that matter could be emphasised in the schools.  From childhood, then, one is trained to be careful in this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> Quite often, in my capacity as a business man, I travel in Northern Ireland.  Between Enniskillen and Armagh, I always admire the scenic beauty of the State forests which extend to the roadside.  It has recently struck me very forcibly that something should be done about roadside planting.  Quite a lot of planting could be done along our roadsides in co-operation with the local authority. Land would not have to be acquired. The Minister might take up the matter with the Minister for Local Government in conjunction with the county councils.</P>
    <P>I am sure a lot more land would be offered to the Forestry Division for planting if an attractive price were offered.  For many reasons, it might be suggested that if you pay too much for land for planting, it will have an economic repercussion later on forest costs.  The day has gone when even a small farmer in the west will be prepared to accept from £2 to £10 an acre.  If the Minister wants more land, he will have to explore the possibility of increased prices.  He can at all times count on my assistance in encouraging the local farmers to offer more and more suitable land for afforestation.  In return, I want the Minister to consider setting up more forests for the benefit of the people of my constituency.  It is an ideal area for planting and there is plenty of suitable land there.  Unfortunately, the farmers there consider that the price offered is not attractive and I appeal to the Minister to consider giving an increased price for land for planting purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which they have received this Estimate and, in the main, for the constructive approach <Col N="846" /> of different Deputies to the problems confronting the Forestry Division. Some Deputies have mentioned the price offered by the Forestry Division for land acquired under their intake machine.  Other Deputies, including the Leader of the Opposition, appear doubtful about the mechanics of this whole business.  That is an indication that the Department must be careful about its costings.  The raw material of the Department is the land it acquires for planting.  The fact that we have been able, over the past few years, to reach the target we have set ourselves of 25,000 acres of planting per annum and that we have been able to acquire sufficient land for that purpose is, I think, the real answer to those critics of the prices we pay for land for forestry purposes.</P>
      <P>Let me emphasise that 90 per cent, I think, of the land acquired for forestry is wasteland, useless for any other purpose.  In many cases where the Forestry Division get blocks of perhaps 200 acres, only possibly 35 to 45 acres of that area is plantable. There may be a large peak of rock in the centre of it or a large area of marsh incapable of being drained or planted, with the result that although the price paid for that land varies from £5 to £7 per acre, actually if you relate the price to the plantable area, it will be very high for forestry purposes.</P>
      <P>Let me reject immediately the suggestion by Deputy McLaughlin that the reason the Forestry Division are going ahead so rapidly west of the Shannon is that many people are leaving their land.  That is not so.  The fact remains that west of the Shannon there are in counties such as my own, and indeed in Leitrim, the county from which the Deputy hails, vast tracts of marginal or mountainous land suitable for forestry and nothing else.  Many of these old commonages are now coming into the hands of the Land Commission simply because the common owners who had them were making very little or no use of them and from an agronomic or other point of view in regard to the economics of the user of these areas, it would be far better both for the individuals and the nation that these areas should be under timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> There is a vast potential for further forestry development in the west.  In county Mayo alone, I estimate a potential 100,000 acres still to come into the forestry machine.  This is marginal, mountain land that would be better under forestry than any other form of user.  From my own observation driving through county Leitrim, of which the Deputy spoke, a vast amount of land there appears to me suitable for nothing but forestry.  Unfortunately, we are not getting offers or co-operation in that county to the extent we would like. It is difficult to get the people to part with their marginal land but I am satisfied that, above all the counties of Ireland possibly, the economic saving of that county, which is a very poor one, would be an intensification of forestry development there.  The Deputy from that area who spoke&mdash;I am sure he is sincere in what he said&mdash;should endeavour to persuade more of these people to make their marginal land available to the Forestry Division for planting and in that way provide what would be permanent employment so badly needed in Leitrim and other such counties and generally in the congested areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan complained of the prices and some other Deputy in dealing with prices suggested that only one price should be offered. Generally, I think that is the practice of the Forestry Division, except where it comes to the notice of another official, apart from the man who inspected it, that something was overlooked and in such cases another offer is often made.  On occasions, when dealing with very small units and where the legal costs involved are substantial in comparison with the purchase money, in order to get the title question straightened out, the Forestry Division are inclined to give the small man a higher price than they would normally pay in order to enable him to get over his difficulties in this respect.  Generally, when an inspection is made by a qualified man, the price which in the opinion of the Forestry Division is a fair value is offered and there is no further bargaining.</P>
    <P>I agree that it would be undesirable <Col N="848" /> to have a performance going on between the Forestry Division and the individual owner such as sometimes goes on with a man selling a cow at a fair.  It would lead to undesirable results if you had offers and counter-offers going on over a long time in such a way that an individual might feel that by holding out he would be able to squeeze another 10/- an acre from the Department and be able to say he succeeded in doing better than his neighbour with the same quality land.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made about the time lag between the inspection and the offer from the Department but I should like the House to understand that a few years ago when we set our sights on a target of 25,000 acres per year, we did not have the machinery or organisation to deal with such a programme.  We are now carrying out the highest rate of planting per head of the population in the whole of western Europe and we have reached this stage in a very short time.  You might describe it as a sudden jump forward and we have maintained this pace over the past four years.  To maintain a rate of 25,000 acres per year, according to normal forestry practice in other countries&mdash;and indeed that is what we should have here&mdash;would require a reserve of 75,000 acres.  You need that amount for efficient planting of 25,000 acres per year so as to have full economic user of your land force, machinery and so on.</P>
    <P>We have not that plantable reserve and until we are in a position to build up such a reserve we shall have complaints on occasion about men being laid off from time to time in different areas.  We cannot achieve stability with our labour force unless we achieve the plantable reserve to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Considering the vast expansion in our planting programme, we have done very well and we have tried to get our machine geared towards this steady national planting programme. That entailed more staff, more training of foresters in the Forestry School and it entailed stepping-up the organisation <Col N="849" /> all around to cope with the new amount of work involved in maintaining this programme.  To those who say that we should go faster, I would reply: if we are able to maintain this steady rate which we are now achieving, we are doing a very good job for the country.  For the future, I shall be quite satisfied if we can continue at the steady rate of 25,000 acres per annum.  In accordance with our national resources, it is a very high target and Deputies are already beginning to see that we are commencing to change the appearance of the countryside.</P>
    <P>As we go ahead, it is becoming more and more difficult to acquire sufficient land to keep up a regular planting programme of 25,000 acres a year.  The average unit in the intake machine is becoming smaller and smaller.  It is like the situation on the Land Commission side where the cream is gone off the milk and all the big estates in the west have been taken over.  The land that is easy of acquisition has been acquired, and consequently we anticipate, as has been the experience in other countries, that as forestry development goes ahead, the smaller the average size of the unit will be.  Therefore, there will be more trouble, more inspections and more delays dealing with individual title investigations for these small units.  Consequently, you have this slowing down of the process.</P>
    <P>If there is on the administrative side any way by which we can speed up the machine, I shall be very happy to adopt it.  Since I came into office, I have taken, as a matter of practice, a number of shortcuts in dealing with title difficulties, and the new procedure is relieving the bottleneck on that side pretty effectively.  However, if I feel that in order to speed up the intake of commonages we should have another look at the law on the matter, I shall have no hesitation in coming to the House and asking for any additional powers it is suggested I require.</P>
    <P>At all events, without labouring the matter, I feel very strongly, both from what I have seen abroad and from my experience here, that if we can continue <Col N="850" /> with a consistent annual programme of planting 25,000 acres, we will be doing a very good job in our circumstances and in a comparatively short period will have made up for the great national lack of forestry development over the years.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of points made by Deputy Dillon.  He seems to be somewhat concerned about the cost of this whole programme.  He seems to be under a misconception when he suggests that the £40 million investment in forestry to which I referred is costing £2 million a year to service.  That is not so.  That £40 million includes the interest on the capital since the programme began.</P>
    <P>The Deputy need be under no misapprehension so far as the future of timber and timber products is concerned. From every indication, their future is both sound and assured.  Even in the Scandinavian countries, there is a market to which we could export industrial pulp, if we had it to export. These countries are, in fact, importing industrial pulp for their industries. Every year new uses are being found for timber and timber derivatives as a raw material.  Leaving aside the paper industry, the plastics industry and many other forms of industry are finding new uses for timber in one form or another.  When one contemplates the educational development of the millions of illiterate people in the emergent African countries, there is bound to be a tremendous upsurge in the demand for timber for paper.</P>
    <P>I would also like to correct Deputy Dillon's misconception so far as his visit to Canada some time ago is concerned. When we talk here about countries in which their forests are indigenous and have grown naturally over the generations, it is not generally appreciated that the rate of growth there is far and away behind ours. When comparing notes with Mr. Spooner, my opposite number in Canada, who was on a visit here a few years ago, I was astonished to learn that the natural forests there have a rate of growth approximately half ours here, because the ground is frozen for approximately six months and there is no growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> I was also agreeably surprised to learn, when visiting forests in Norway and Sweden, that the rate of growth for indigenous timber there, such as Norwegian Pine, results in their reaching maturity in from 80 to 110 years.  That maturity can be achieved here with Sitka Spruce and similar types in from 38 to 45 years.  I have seen as large development in volume here in half the time it takes to develop such trees in their natural conditions.  Therefore, even though our forests have been denuded down through the centuries, we have the tremendous advantage of the Irish climate, soil, sunshine and rain which give us a faster rate of growth and volume development.  In that way, we are economically far better placed than the ordinary individual appreciates. People are inclined to believe that where trees are indigenous, timber production is more economical than in countries like this.  In practically all these countries when it comes to reafforestation, they are more and more planting in the same way as we are here.</P>
    <P>In some of these countries, a lot of forest is held in private ownership. It is a common practice for an individual to have 20 or 25 acres of arable land and to have 200 or 300 acres of natural forest.  He regards that natural forest as a bank.  He draws on it generally only in times of family crisis, when there is a death in the family, when his wife is ill, when he wants to buy a new tractor or make some other capital investment.  When I was there, there was a national campaign to try to get farmers to cut down trees which were mature, from 80 to 100 years old.  The reason they did not do it was that they would have to pay a tax on the proceeds and the idea of the farmers was to hand over their forests to their sons, not to cut down the trees, and thus to get out of paying the tax.  Of course, farmers there are no more anxious to pay taxes they can avoid than they are here.</P>
    <P>At all events, it can be said that even in countries where they formerly relied on natural regeneration, they are now assisting it and from a point of view <Col N="852" /> of commercial development, they are planting in the same way as we do here.  Even in areas where they clear fell except for leaving one, two, three or four trees for the purpose of natural regeneration, they practise regeneration also by manuring the ground.  In Canada, too, when they are clearing out old forests, they are beginning to plant in the same way as we do here.  In these countries, from an investment point of view, they have to wait for results at least twice as long as we have to wait here.  Therefore, in the fullness of time, when out forests develop, we should, with our perfectly natural resources here, be in a position at least to compete on costings with many of these countries, notwithstanding their vaster areas and even though their forests had not been denuded down through the years as were ours.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon seemed to think there was special antipathy by officials of my Department towards people coming in to see our forests.  Let me admit candidly that one of our great national weaknesses is that we have no forestry tradition like they have in the countries to which I have referred, generally throughout the Continent and in Germany particularly.  Consequently, until our people get the forestry tradition or, as Deputy Crinion or some other Deputy suggested, until our children are taught it, there is grave danger.  I am satisfied that most of the damage that has occurred through forest fires here has been due more to ignorance than to any other factor and also because of the lack of the forestry tradition.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputies to understand that the Forestry Division must be particularly careful about younger forests. Where the trees are small, there is competing vegetation and until the trees get big enough to close in and cut out the sunlight from this competing vegetation, there is grave danger of fire.  That is the reason why Forestry Division officials have to be very careful about allowing the public to go into young forests where the competing vegetation is high.  In a case like that, the dropping of a cigarette butt or a broken bottle might be the cause of serious fire damage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> Where we have mature forests, we have been in consultation with Bord Fáilte and are making a start to open up those forests for the benefit of tourists and the public generally, and as a local amenity.  In this connection, we have made a start with the Gougane Barra forest and I would cordially invite Deputies who are free in the autumn, or the fall of the year, as the Americans call it, to go to that very beautiful forest which is now being opened up and a road being laid through it, and enjoy the wonderful contrasts as between the Japanese larch and the other conifers there.  We have made a start there and as forestry development goes on, and as we have areas suitable for this purpose, it is our intention in conjunction with Bord Fáilte to make them available as a tourist attraction and as a local amenity.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that some of the forests with which I am familiar will be just as great an attraction for tourists and our own people as the Black Forest in Germany is at the moment.  One of the reasons why our vast forestry development areas in this country are not better appreciated is that they are generally away from the main roads.  I appreciate Deputy Browne being impressed by the route between Enniskillen and Belfast&mdash;I have travelled it myself&mdash;but vast areas of mountainous and regional land have been planted in this country in the past few years that are even already transforming hills and valleys but, generally speaking, they are not situated in very well-known areas, being away from the big arteries.  We have areas of from 6,000 to 7,000 acres planted throughout the country and I have no doubt in a few years they will become well known as spots that will attract visitors from all parts of the land as well as tourists from abroad.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully suggested that timber coming from Irish plantations should be seasoned properly before going into building construction.  I do not think anybody would disagree with that view.  It is important to note, however, that the Institute for Industrial <Col N="854" /> Research and Standards have laid down and published standards of moisture content for building timbers. These standards can be applied equally to local and imported timber. This question of imposing standards is, I understand from the trade generally, laid down by the architects or engineers in charge of particular jobs. It was bad business in earlier years that certain standards were not rigidly adhered to.  I am sure, as Deputies have said, that our timber materials, properly handled and seasoned, are not only equal to but better than those coming in from abroad.  It is solely a question of handling them properly, as was suggested by Deputy Tully, and I think now that, in the main, considering the standards laid down, this is being done.</P>
    <P>He also raised the question of Mulroy Nursery in Donegal.  Although it is closing down, I understand the position is that there will be work there until next March for the present labour force and the position can then be reexamined. I reiterate that it is the standard practice of my Department to try, where men become redundant, to have them re-employed on another forestry job, if there is one in the area, or within a reasonable distance of that area.</P>
    <P>There was complaint by some Deputies that some workers have to travel too far to work.  That is inevitable in some areas.  The men have to travel considerable distances because the location is generally up on a mountain or in an isolated area, but due allowance is made for all that.</P>
    <P>It is not as simple as Deputy Tully thinks to provide a five-day week.  The position is not the same as it is where county council workers are concerned. They are engaged in the one area all the time, doing the same job.  One of the difficulties about forestry workers is that, if we are to maintain our present output, we cannot have them working beyond a certain number of hours in the summer time; if we make any departure, we will be infringing certain provisions of the Conditions of Employment Act.  If it were possible to work out a system under which we could get the same output, I should <Col N="855" /> be very happy, but I cannot see how it could be done.  If there is a way out of the difficulty, I and my Department will be very glad but, because of the nature of the work, certain special difficulties present themselves.  While I and my Department would be glad to have another look at the matter, the answer to the proposition posed by Deputy Tully is certainly not apparent to me at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also raised the question as to whether the wages tribunal for forestry workers would be set up in the immediate future.  I can only repeat what I said here before.  A number of wage adjustments have been successfully negotiated between my Department and the unions and the absence of a tribunal did not militate in any way against the workers.  I said, too, on a former occasion that the whole question of industrial disputes is now under consideration by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and others and it would be premature for us to go ahead with one type of tribunal until a conclusion is reached in the wider field of management and worker relations generally. It would be wise, I think, for us to hasten slowly.  When all this matter has been fully considered, some tribunal, not alone for forestry workers but for all categories of workers, will emerge. Meanwhile, no one has suffered because of the absence of such a tribunal. Adjustments have been successfully negotiated to the satisfaction, I think, of all those concerned.</P>
    <P>As I have said on a number of occasions, forestry is not the answer to the problem of Bord na Móna cutaway bog.  Deputy O.J. Flanagan and others raised this question.  A couple of years ago, I and my officials took this matter up with Bord na Móna.  We spent a day on the bogs.  Their requirements are pretty substantial and it will be some years before cutaway bogs will be available for forestry.  Even then, they will not prove to be the solution to absorbing Bord na Móna workers in the off season because reclamation and preparation work have to be done at a certain time and these <Col N="856" /> operations will not fit in with Bord na Móna operations.  It is, too, the aim of the Forestry Division to build up a permanent labour force.  We find that such a force pays the Department.  The more experienced the men become, the more productive they are.  Our aim is not to lay off men or take men on casually but to build up a permanent labour force maintained full time so far as possible.  Absorbing men laid off by Bord na Móna in forestry work is not a practicable proposition.  Neither is it likely to become one in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about PAYE. It was news to me that there was a different practice where forestry workers are concerned as compared with other State employees.  On inquiry, I found that there is no variation in the practice.  Deductions are made on a weekly basis.  Where deductions do not commence until near the end of the financial year, involving heavy financial commitments for the workers concerned, that is the exception rather than the rule.  It arises because workers have failed to send in returns or have sent in incomplete returns.  Generally speaking, the deductions are made weekly and it is only in the odd case this complaint could possibly arise.</P>
    <P>Studies by the research section of the Forestry Division are going ahead to ascertain the annual increment of trees of various species here under our conditions and until these studies are completed, it will not be possible to give dependable forecasts of the produce available in future years.  It can be taken for granted that a steady increase in produce will be available but the whole purpose of this study is to try to do what has been suggested here, that is, to give a forecast to the trade and to the country as to what will be available over a given period or at any given time in the future.  We hope that when this study is completed, we will at least be able to make a reasonable rough and ready forecast to tell those concerned what we expect to be coming on the market in future years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> It is impossible for us without carrying out this special research study now to make any proper prognostication. We are forced to rely for the present time at all events on yield tables published by the British Forestry Commission and they are not truly applicable to our conditions and cannot be relied on because, as I have pointed out already, conditions vary between the different countries and even between this country and England with different species.  It is our experience that conditions vary and that we cannot rely on what is laid down by them for growth estimates of different species in our conditions here.  At all events, Deputies can rest assured that this matter is in hand and that we hope, with the help of our research backroom boys, to be able to give reasonable forecasts as to the growth potentiality of our forests and that in time should be of use to people in the business in planning their own developments on the industrial side.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan referred to what he calls a haven for foxes being provided by the Forestry Division of my Department.  I have got some complaints under this heading in recent times.  I thought that where there is an active regional game council they would naturally concentrate on forests in their area to eliminate the fox menace.  I know that in all counties where regional game councils are active, they have put a price on the head, or rather, on the tail of the fox when it is delivered to them but I am surprised that they have not attacked the fox at his source.  Many of these game councils are using the forests as sanctuaries for breeding and for birds and I will have the Deputy's complaint&mdash;evidently there is some special difficulty in County Galway&mdash;brought to the notice of my foresters who are dealing with this work in the field.</P>
    <P>It is natural, I suppose, that the foxes, with their traditional skill at evading capture, should make use of the dense undergrowth and cover now available to them in some of our forests and in so far as the Forestry Division can help in eliminating this menace I can assure the House that they will do their utmost to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> Fundamentally, it is a matter for the game councils where they are active and in so far as I can I shall bring this problem to the notice of game councils in the various areas for their attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan also referred to the danger of forest fires and suggested that the fire chiefs should be made aware of lakes or rivers adjacent to forests so that they would know where to find water when called to forest fires.  I am glad to inform the House that the question of the provision of reservoirs for fire fighting is at present under consideration, that we had discussions between the chief fire officers and representatives of the Forestry Division and of the Department of Local Government on this subject.  We have been considering this matter and I trust we will be able to work out a national scheme applicable generally throughout the country and have the fullest co-operation between my Department, the Department of Local Government and the fire authorities of the various local authorities.</P>
    <P>Let me say again that forest fires almost invariably occur through ignorance on the part of local farmers. Not so many of them, except around centres of urban population, have occurred accidentally as a result of carelessness on the part of trippers. The biggest danger we find is that farmers for their own purposes start to burn whins or heather on their land or mountain near forest areas.  They are supposed under law&mdash;and indeed it is an offence for them to fail to do so&mdash;to notify the Garda authorities and notify us but in many cases they do not do this and they are careless in lighting fires close to forests.  Some of the most disastrous fires from the point of view of the Forestry Division that have occurred, have started in this way&mdash;fires that have been started deliberately either to clean out old gorse or heather or fires started on bogs that have gone out of control and those concerned not being able to do anything about them and not realising the danger of the spread of fire in areas close to forests.  These have been the cause of our greatest loss.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> We have made appeals on various occasions to these people to be more careful.  I want to warn them now that the time has come when we have to adopt a tougher attitude on this issue. Sufficient warning has been given to all and sundry on this question and, in future, where they are brought before the courts, the Forestry Division will press for the application of the full rigour of the law to them. The State forests are the people's property We must instil a forestry tradition into our people and, if necessary, we will have to do it the hard way.  The time has come, in my view, when we can no longer afford to take an easy view of the ignorance or carelessness of people who, irrespective of the consequences, light fires that may spread to young forests.</P>
    <P>I agree with all those Deputies who have referred to the slowness of the progress in the private planting sector. While I could say, if I were one of those given to statistics, that since we started this campaign we have achieved 100 per cent expansion, I do confess that I am sadly disappointed at the rate of planting in the private sector. I know from experience that there is a vast amount of land in small areas on practically every farm that could well be used for private planting both for the benefit of the individual concerned and for turning a useless piece of land that is a burden on the farmer, in as much as he has to pay rent and rates on it, into a valuable asset.</P>
    <P>It was for this reason that, notwithstanding the technical advice I received from the officers of the Department, I cut down the area which would qualify for a grant, from an acre to a half acre.  Some of my technical people thought that the planting of a half acre could not be regarded as silviculture.  To get people, and particularly the small man west of the Shannon, to utilise the odd half acre of waste land, or to do it a half acre at a time, I made that change in the grant system, and it is now possible for an individual to plant a half acre this year, and a half acre next year, perhaps when work is slack, and qualify for a grant.  I do <Col N="860" /> not know whether we could go any further by way of inducement to try to get people to utilise their waste land for afforestation.  I appeal to all Deputies to use their influence with their constituents in this field, to try to make our people more conscious of the benefits of private planting, for their own good, for the future of their own families and for the ultimate future of the nation.</P>

Is í Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí a dhéanann na mion-oibreacha mara de ghnáth thar ceann na Roinne agus is í an Oifig sin freisin a dhéanfaidh an obair i gCill Rónáin.</P>
    <P>Faoi scéim na dtithe gloine tá conradh déanta chun trealamh téacháin a chur isteach i 25 tithe i gCo.  Dhún na nGall, agus tá mé ag súil go gcríochnófar an obair sin i mbliana. Tógadh 194 tithe faoin scéim seo go nuige seo agus tá córas téacháin curtha nó á chur isteach i 78 díobh.  Maidir leis na tithe a ndearnadh damáiste mór stoirme dóibh i gConamara agus i dTuar Mhic Éadaigh, tá socraithe idir láimh chun iad a atógáil agus tá beartaithe dul ar aghaidh anois chomh tapaidh agus is féidir é leis an obair sin.  Ní féidir liom a rá go cinnte cén fhaid eile a thógfaidh atógáil na dtithe ach déanfar gach dícheall é a chur i <Col N="863" /> gcrích i mbliana chun go mbeidh siad réidh le haghaidh séasúir fáis na bliana seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Suim £1,000 a meastar a chaithfear ar na deontais i leith cránacha agus síolta a dháiltear faoin scéim seo. Meastar go mbeidh timpeall 50 cráin ag teastáil i mbliana agus is cránacha de chaighdeán níos airde fós ná iad sin a dáileadh go dtí seo a dáilfear. Ó thús na scéime dáileadh 450 cráin san iomlán agus, de réir gach tuairisc, d'eirigh go maith lena bhfurmhór mór.</P>
    <P>Chífear go bhfuil méadú £2,000 as soláthar atá á dhéanamh le haghaidh scéimeanna talmhaíochta eile faoin bhfo-mhírcheann.  Is é faoi ndear sin ná an t-éileamh méadaithe a bhí ar an scéim a tionscnaíodh chun talamh féaraigh a fheabhsú sa Ghaeltacht le cúpla bliain anuas, agus fós socruithe bheith déanta chun téarmaí chuid B de Scéim Chonamara de Thionscadal na Talún a leathnú go dtí na limistéirí Gaeltachta uilig amhail ón lú Márta, 1963.  Tá scéim maoth-thorthaí na Roinne leasaithe freisin i gcaoi is gur féidir leis an Roinn anois deontais suas go dtí £500 a íoc in aon chontae in aon bhliain áirithe i leith fás aon sórt maoth-thorthaí nó glasraí.  Maidir leis an scéim chun talamh féaraigh sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú, íocann an Roinn deontais caoga faoin gcéad den chostas i leith leasú saorga a thabhairt, i gcomhréir le tástáil ithreach, le haghaidh plásán ó acra amháin go dtí trí acra an ceann.  Tá an-éileamh ar an scéim agus cheana féin feabhsaíodh 1,078 plásáin darb achar 2,363 acraí.</P>
    <P>Ba léir dom le tamall anuas go raibh géar-ghá leis na foirgintí feirme sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú agus nach raibh muintir na Gaeltachta ag baint mórán tairbhe as an scéim atá ag an Roinn Talmhaíochta de bhrí, is dócha, nach leor dóibh an chabhair a tugtar faoin scéim sin.  Tar éis an scéal a scrúdú i gcomhar leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta, tá socrú á dhéanamh anois chun scéim foirgintí feirme na Roinne sin a oibriú sna limistéirí Gaeltachta ar théarmaí speisialta. Beidh deontais 50 faoin gcéad níos airde ná na gnáth-dheontais a íoctar faoin scéim le fáil ag Gaeilgeoirí sna <Col N="864" /> ceantracha sin agus íocfaidh Roinn na Gaeltachta an t-airgead breise a bheidh i gceist.  Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh tairbhe don Ghaeltacht as an socrú sin.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar £15,000 á dhéanamh le haghaidh meánscoileanna i mbliana. Ó cuireadh tús leis an scéim sa bhliain 1958 tógadh nó leathnaíodh 8 meánscoileanna sna limistéirí Gaeltachta le cabhair ón Roinn.  Cuireadh deontais os cionn £37,500 san iomlán ar fáil i leith na n-oibreacha sin.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar £10,000 á dhéanamh arís i mbliana le haghaidh hallaí siamsa. Faoin scéim seo tugtar deontas de 80 faoin gcéad den chostas nó £5,000, pé acu is lú, mar chabhair chun halla siamsa a thógáil, a fheabhsú, a leathnú nó a fheistiú.  Iocadh deontais arbh fhiú £12,255 iad san iomlán faoin scéim seo ó cuireadh tús léi sa bhliain 1960/61 agus fuair 6 hallaí tairbhe na ndeontas sin.  Tógadh ceithre hallaí nua faoin scéim.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-Mhírcheann E den mheas-tachán tá soláthar chun deontais bheaga a thabhairt le haghaidh imeach-taí cultúrtha agus sóisialacha, mar shampla deontais le haghaidh feiseanna, féilte drámaíochta nó d'fhonn scoláireachtaí Gaeltachta a bhronnadh ag feiseanna agus cabhair a thabhairt do choistí áitiúla sa Ghaeltacht chun oirnéisí ceoil agus a leithéid a chean-nach.</P>
    <P>Már chúnamh breise do dhaltaí meánscoile sna limistéirí Gaeltachta ceapadh scéim sa bhliain 1961 faoina dtugtar deontais bhliantúla, suas go dtí £500 in aghaidh na scoile, chun cabhrú le húdaráis meánscoile sna lim-istéirí Gaeltachta seirbhís iompair a chur ar fáil do dhaltaí lae.  Ceapadh i mbliana nár mhiste buntáistí na scéime sin a thabhairt freisin do dhaltaí Gaeltachta a dhéanann freastal ar chúrsaí lae sna gairmscoileanna agus tá sé sin déanta anois.  Tá soláthar £4,000 á dhéanamh ina leith sin i bhFó-mhírcheann F agus soláthar £5,000 á dhéanamh d'fhonn cóir iompair a chur ar fáil do dhaltaí meánscoile sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá soláthar sa scéim freisin faoina bhféadfar teacht i gcabhair i gcásanna áirithe ar dhaltaí ó na limistéirí Gaeltachta a mbíonn orthu freastal ar mheánscoil nó ar <Col N="865" /> cheardscoil atá gairid dóibh ach nach bhfuil suite sna limistéirí Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Déantar soláthar £1,000 faoin bhFo-Mhírcheann seo chomh maith i leith seirbhísí tarchuir idir Oileán Cléire agus Dún na Séad.  Is ar choth-abháil an bháid, ar leis an Roinn é, a chaithfear an t-airgead seo.</P>
    <P>Níl aon athrú ó anuraidh ar an soláthar £48,000 i gcás an deontais £5 agus ní dóigh liom gur gá éinní speisialta a rá ina thaobh.</P>
    <P>Déantar soláthar £10,000 faoi Fho-Mhírcheann H le cabhrú chun foir-gintí a thógáil, a shealbhú, a oiriúnú agus a fheistiú mar choláistí Gaeilge. Go dtí seo tá £12,053 caite ag an Roinn faoin scéim agus má leantar ar aghaidh leis na tograí atá beartaithe i gcóir na bliana seo caithfear an £10,000 atá á sholáthar sa mheas-tachán seo.</P>
    <P>Tá suim £100,000 á cur ar fáil mar dheontas-i-gcabhair do Ghaeltarra Éireann arís i mbliana.  Cuirtear an t-airgead seo ar fáil chun caiteachas reatha an Bhoird a shlánú, agus ní miste a rá go gcaitear é chun riaradh ar ghnóthaí de shaghas scéimeanna printíseachta agus tréineála agus forbartha agus, freisin, chun freastal ar aon uireasa a tharlaíonn sna gnáth-chúrsaí trádála.</P>
    <P>Mar a foráltar san Acht is féidir airgead a chur ar fáil don Bhord ón bPríomh-Chiste le haghaidh cuspóirí caipitil agus sa bhliain seo caite cuireadh £30,000 ar fáil chuige sin.  Ar ndóigh, aisíocann an Bord an t-airgead sin agus ús air.  Ón uair a bunaíodh an Bord tugadh iomlán de £180,000 ar airleacan dó, agus tá an t-iomlán a bhí dlite go dtí deireadh Márta seo caite aisíoctha cheana, sé sin, £25,603 idir bun-airgead agus ús.</P>
    <P>Níor foilsíodh cuntais an Bhoird don bhliain airgeadais seo caite go fóill ach tuigtear dom go dtáinig feabhas ar chúrsaí gnótha an Bhoird i gcaitheamh na bliana agus ar an bhfostaíocht sna tionscail atá á reach-táil acu.  Leagfar Tuarascáil agus Cuntais an Bhoird faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas a luaithe is féidir agus beidh gach eolas faoi imeachtaí <Col N="866" /> an Bhoird i rith na bliana seo caite le fáil iontu siúd.</P>
    <P>Tugtar cabhair airgid faoi Fho-Mhírcheann L ar mhaithe leis an drámaíocht Ghaeilge.  Tá an soláthar méadaithe i mbliana ó £3,500 go dtí £5,000 chun deontas reachtála £1,500 a chur ar fáil don Amharclann nua i nGaoth Dobhair.  Tá cúnamh á thabhairt cheana do Thaibhdhearc na Gaillimhe agus do chumainn bheaga drámaíochta sna limistéirí Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Baineann £25,000 den soláthar £40,000 faoi Fho-Mhírcheann M leis an scéim faoina dtugtar cúnamh do choistí áitiúla chun scoláireachtaí saoire sa Ghaeltacht a thabhairt do pháistí ó áiteanna lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. Ó thosaigh an Roinn ag tabhairt cabhrach den sórt seo sa bhliain 1957, tá forás mór tagtha ar obair na gcoistí sin.  Táthar tar éis na scéime a leathnú ó thaobh daltaí meánscoile dhe tríd an teorainn uasta aoise a ardú ó 14 bliana go dtí 18 bliana. Dá dhroim sin uile cuireadh 4,724 páistí ó 96 coistí áitiúla chun na Gaeltachta sa bhliain 1962/63 i gcomparáid le 333 páistí ó cheithre coistí sa bhliain 1957.  D'íoc an Roinn deontais arbh fhiú £21,934 iad faoin scéim sa bhliain 1962/63.  Deontas £5 a íocfar i leith gach páiste i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Leasaíodh an scéim roinnt i mbliana d'fhonn líon na gcoistí áitiúla a mhéadú, dá mbéidir é.  Meastar go bhfuil bua ar leith leis na coistí áitiúla sa mhéid go bhfuilid in ann súil a choimeád ar feadh na bliana uile ar na páistí a bheidh le cur chun na Gaeltachta nó a bheidh tar éis tréimhse a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht.  Tugann sé sin deis dóibh léachtaí agus a leithéid a shocrú dóibh i dtreo go mbainfidh na páistí an tairbhe is mó is féidir as tréimhse sa Ghaeltacht nó nach gcaillfidh siad tairbhe na dtréimhsí a bheidh caite acu sa Ghaeltacht.  Measaim nach mbeidh gluaiseacht seo na scoláir-eachtaí Gaeltachta socair ar an bhforas ceart go dtí go mbeidh coistí iontaofa áitiúla bunaithe ar fud na tíre uile.  Is é beartas na Roinne bunú agus neartú na gcoistí sin a chur chun cinn ar gach bealach is féidir.</P>
    <P>Tá san áireamh faoin bhFo-Mhírcheann seo freisin soláthar le <Col N="867" /> haghaidh scéim faoina gcuirtear páistí chuig scoileanna Gaeltachta&mdash;gach páiste ar feadh téarma scoile amháin. Íocann an Roinn deontas nach mó ná £19 le haghaidh gach páiste&mdash;is é sin, tuairim leath an chostais&mdash;agus meastar go mbeidh timpeall £15,000 ag teastáil le haghaidh na scéime sin i mbliana. Cuireadh 455 páistí chun na Gaeltachta faoin scéim sin i rith na bliana 1962 agus d'íoc an Roinn suim £8,637 mar dheontas ina leith.  Reachtáiltear an scéim seo i gcomhar le Gael Linn. Admhaítear go forleathan gur scéim an-tairbheach í agus ba mhaith liom an deis seo a ghlacadh le Gael Linn a mholadh as a fheabhas a rinne siad an scéim a eagrú agus a fheidhmiú.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar £1,000 á dhéanamh faoi Fho-Mhírcheann N i ndáil le scéim nua trína gcuirfear cúnamh airgid ar fáil do bhuachaillí as na limistéirí Gaeltachta a bheidh ag freastal ar chúrsaí printíseachta tamall ó bhaile. Tá ganntanas mór ceardaithe de bhunadh na Gaeltachta féin ar fud na limistéirí Gaeltachta.  Féadfar a locht sin a chur ar a dheacra atá sé don ghnáth-bhuachaill sa Ghaeltacht deis a fháil cois baile chun cúrsa printíseachta a dhéanamh agus ar a chos-tasaí a bheadh sé air cúrsa a dhéanamh in aon áit eile.  Ar an ábhar sin, tá socraithe ag an Roinn, i gcomhairle leis an Roinn Oideachais agus leis na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais sna contaethe Gaeltachta, go gcuirfear liúntaisí cothaithe ar fáil ar choinníollacha áirithe d'fhonn cabhrú le buachaillí Gaeltachta a mheidh orthu cónaí as baile i ndáil le cúrsa printíseachta. Liúntas nach rachaidh thar £100 a bheidh i gceist don chéad bhliain phrintíseachta agus £50, ar a mhéid, don dara bliain.  Ní bheidh aon liúntas iníoctha i leith bliana i ndiaidh an dara bliain.  Tá súil agam go rachaidh an scéim nua seo go mór chun tairbhe do bhuachaillí na Gaeltachta, agus ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais sna contaetha Gaeltachta mar gheall ar an gcúnamh mór atá á thabhairt acu in oibriú na scéime.</P>
    <P>Le críoch a chur leis an ráiteas seo ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil an Roinn ag brath go mór ar Ranna eile <Col N="868" /> Stáit, ar údaráis áitiúla agus ar chumainn deontacha chun na scéimeanna éagsúla a chur i gcrích.  Tá an comhoibriú sin á fháil go fial ag an Roinn uathu agus tá mo bhuíochas féin agus buíochas mo Roinne tuillte acu uile.  Beidh mé toilteanach i gcónaí aon mholtaí a thiocfaidh chugam agus a measfar a rachadh chun leasa don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht a bhreithniú chomh báúil agus is féidir é.  I bhfeidhmiú scéimeanna na Roinne tugtar tús áite do na ceantair Fíor-Ghaeltachta agus do na daoine a labhrann an Ghaeilge de ghnáth agus a choinníonn beo bríomhar í mar theanga urlabhra.  Is deimhin liom go dtiocfaidh an Dáil liom sa bheartas sin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all concerned with the welfare of this Department but I am bound to say that the Minister's account of it today is not a very exciting document.  I remember with nostalgia the Connemara Scheme which I inaugurated when I was Minister for Agriculture and for which we had high hopes.  In that plan we had great hopes of expanding production in a variety of directions in the Gaeltacht and associating with these plans effective plans for marketing the increased output.  I cannot see any reference to such plans here, although I notice that there are proceeding in Glencolumbkille in West Donegal, projects on those lines in which intensive production on the small farms of that part of the Gaeltacht is being promoted and the Irish Sugar Company is providing a guaranteed outlet for the increased production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see here that Scéim na Muc is labouring along.  I always believed, and still believe, that there is a very wide scope for the expansion of pig production in the Gaeltacht but the key to increased production is a guaranteed market.  If you produce pigs in a remote part of the Gaeltacht, to get them to the factory can present a serious problem.  I cannot imagine why the Minister, who was himself a director of the Castlebar Bacon Factory when out of office, and who is intimately associated with the problems of that factory and the difficulties <Col N="869" /> they have traditionally had to get supplies adequate to keep themselves at maximum efficiency, does not see how urgently necessary it is, not only from the point of view of the Gaeltacht but from the point of view of a factory such as that, to bring the two elements together and get the pigs produced in the Gaeltacht and transported to the factories.</P>
    <P>I remember at one stage we had a system under the Pigs and Bacon Board that if there were a glut at any particular fair, you got in touch with the Board and they sent buyers down who would mark the pigs with a stamp and the pigs were then brought to the factory and slaughtered and when weighed and graded, the vendor would get the price of his pig.  If it was made known in Carna and every other small town in the Gaeltacht in different parts of Donegal and Kerry that people who brought pigs in on a particular day would be met by a lorry which would take the pigs to the factory and that the price would be sent back to them when the pigs were graded, if it were not practicable to pay for them by hand at the assembly point, the production of pigs in the Gaeltacht would be greatly stimulated. That is a form of production which can be almost indefinitely expanded without much regard to the actual acreage in the ownership of the producer. I believe on that head very considerable progress could be made in expanding production in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I remember also under the Connemara Scheme that we had planned for widespread fertiliser operations on the mountains in the Gaeltacht in order to increase the sheep-grazing capacity.  I understand that since then some scheme was operated in the Department of Agriculture to stripe and fence the mountains.  That may simplify the problem of adequate fertilising of the mountain grazing.  There are many great difficulties in getting it done.  In my time, all these grazings were commonage and it was extraordinarily difficult to find any equitable basis under which it could be done, unless you were prepared to do it free, gratis and for nothing; otherwise, half the owners would make a contribution <Col N="870" /> and the other half would not.  Whether the striping of these commonages and the fencing would simplify that, I am not quite sure, but I am certain that if the mountain grazing of sheep in the Gaeltacht were effectively fertilised &mdash;it would have to be done from the air&mdash;you could increase the carrying capacity of those mountains by almost 50 to 100 per cent.  Sooner or later it will be done.  I do not see why we should not do it.  The people in the Gaeltacht ought not to wait for someone to come from Germany or somewhere else but should do it themselves for the commercial advantage to be derived from it.</P>
    <P>Sheep are a type of livestock singularly suited to the Gaeltacht.  In our time, we now have the immense advantage that they yield a very valuable crop, not only in the lambs but in the wool.  There was a time when the wool was practically not worth the trouble of shearing it.  Now it is half the value of the sheep.  I feel that pigs and sheep could make a very material contribution to the prosperity of the people living in the Gaeltacht, if proper marketing facilities were provided and if the carrying capacity of the mountains were expanded as I suggest.</P>
    <P>I heartily congratulate the Department on the plan to enable children to spend a period in the Gaeltacht living in the people's homes.  That is an admirable plan.  It is one of the best ways of spreading a knowledge of the language and of preserving the language in the Gaeltacht itself.</P>
    <P>I am not so enthusiastic about the building of motels and establishments of that kind.  I believe that if you proceed on those lines, the probable result will be that the language will disappear altogether.  Hostels are mentioned here and holiday chalets. I do not know what &ldquo;holiday chalets&rdquo; mean.  Are they annexes to people's houses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all in favour of the scheme under which children are facilitated to stay with families in the Gaeltacht.  I believe it results in the children learning Irish.  It means that the language of the home is left intact and it brings a very useful income into the home.</P>
      <P>It is common practice to send children <i>au pair</i> to France or Germany and to receive a child back from France or Germany in a home here. Everyone knows it is the best way for a child to pick up a language.  In so far as the Irish language is concerned, it has the added advantage that it brings a very welcome income into the homes of the people living in the Gaeltacht.  It justifies them in the expense to which they go to improve their houses or to make their homes more acceptable and more alluring to the children who desire accommodation. It tends generally to raise the standard of accommodation throughout the Gaeltacht and that is excellent. I am all for that scheme.</P>
      <P>Hostels and chalets I look upon with rather a jaundiced eye.  What are they for?  Are they simply for the purpose of bringing a miscellaneous tourist influx into the area?  I doubt if many people will benefit in the area from the hostels and chalets.  Why should we build hostels and chalets in the Gaeltacht? There are some excellent hotels there.  People who want to go there as tourists can find hotel accommodation there and enjoy it.  Why should we build hostels and chalets in the Gaeltacht any more than in Arklow and Rosslare?  I do not understand the purpose of that scheme.  If it is for the purpose of bringing in a miscellaneous horde of trippers, I do not think anybody would benefit from it, the people in the Gaeltacht, the language or the trippers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> In so far as we encourage children and students to live in the homes of the people as their paying guests, I think that is excellent and should be helped in every possible way.  There is one interesting development here which I think is good and will give great service not only to the Gaeltacht but to the whole country.  The Minister speaks of secondary schools in the Gaeltacht. That is excellent.  Then he says:</P>
    <P>As additional assistance to secondary school pupils in the Gaeltacht areas a scheme was introduced in 1961 under which annual grants of up to £500 per school are paid to help the school authorities in those areas to provide a transport service for their day-pupils.  It was felt that the benefits of the scheme should be extended to Gaeltacht children who attend day courses in vocational schools and that has now been done. </P>
    <P>That is a most excellent departure.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister might set a headline for the whole country.  I have been reading the proposals of the Minister for Education about his composite schools, and so on.  I always believe that in rural Ireland the natural social unit is the parish.  I think we are passing out of the period when there was any justification for the system of having a multitude of small inadequate schools scattered over a rural parish in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister has decided to provide transport on this scale for secondary and vocational schools in the Gaeltacht parishes, he ought to urge on the Minister for Education that in certain parishes, as a pioneer scheme, we should invite the management to accept a scheme whereunder we could group together in one centre in the parish a primary school, a secondary school and, ideally, a technical school. Adequate transport should be provided to bring the children into all three types of school.  Let us put an end to the inadequate one-teacher or two-teacher school located in a remote area in a futile effort to bring teaching facilities within walking distance of every house in the parish.</P>
    <P>It would be much better to bring <Col N="873" /> adequate teaching facilities within driving distance of every home in the parish and to go around, as they do in every parish in America, collecting all the children in the morning, bringing them to school, then collecting them in the afternoon and bringing them home.  It is not necessary to bring them all to their own halldoor.  There can be shelters of the simplest possible kind along the road at which the children can assemble at a pre-arranged hour, be collected and deposited at the national school, secondary school or technical school, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if the Minister had an additional centre in that kind of parish, it would have a multiplicity of advantages. When you take the parochial primary school, the secondary and technical schools, between them there would be perhaps ten or 12 teachers serving these schools which creates an academic atmosphere and an exchange and interplay between the teachers in the various schools which is greatly to the advantage of the teacher.  You can afford to instal all sorts of amenities in a central school of that kind, catering for all the children of the parish, which you cannot even contemplate if you are building seven or eight two-teacher schools in the same parish.  The children have what seems to me the very material advantage that all the children from the one parish are all educated together in an atmosphere of parochial cohesion and association which I think is eminently desirable from the purely sociological aspect of the situation.</P>
    <P>One is almost afraid to suggest the sort of amenities that might be made available and would be quite conceivable in a set-up of that kind.  If you take a parish like Gortahork or a scattered parish like Clifden and had all the educational facilities in Clifden&mdash;or, take Carna and have all the educational facilities there&mdash;with buses bringing the children from all parts of the parish; if you had locally the primary, secondary and vocational schools catering for the whole parish and associated with them the entertainment hall which is mentioned here and for which a grant is available, you would have a valuable social centre in that area.  Instead of the very primitive <Col N="874" /> accommodation available elsewhere in the smaller schools, you could imagine very comprehensive and adequate sanitary accommodation and playing facilities and perhaps swimming pools.</P>
    <P>An odd thing is that even though children are living at the seashore, very often swimming in a pool has much more attraction for them than swimming in the sea.  To most of us who live in cities and towns it seems grotesque that if you go to the seashore you should go to a swimming pool when you have the whole Atlantic Ocean to go to.  But that is the way with children.  They can have diving boards and games of one kind or another which do not appeal to adults and which are not possible in the sea but which are quite easily provided in pools.</P>
    <P>I have often been astonished when bringing my own family to the seaside, to find my son, when he was a child, and his friends heading off to the swimming pool rather than going to the sea where I thought they would naturally enjoy themselves more.</P>
    <P>I believe, if the Minister showed an example of this kind in the Gaeltacht and demonstrated how useful it would be, that it would spread all over the country to the great advantage of the country as a whole.  He might be able to show the Minister for Education that the plan he was prepared to sponsor in the Gaeltacht was an effective means of making truly available to all the children of the parish the best we had to offer in primary, secondary and vocational education.  I think it tremendously important, if we are to do that, that we should make it available to them all.  It is a terrible hardship to accept the philosophy of the Minister for Education that in the general question of education the best can be the enemy of the good.  I think it is utterly wrong to say that we are setting out on a programme which is designed to provide what I would regard as the minimum educational facilities for certain areas and deny them to others.  Why not set out on a programme to say that in every parish in Ireland we propose to organise <Col N="875" /> educational facilities so as to ensure that the best we have to offer in primary, secondary and vocational education will be available to every child in the parish?</P>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity in the Gaeltacht as part of the Gaeltacht scheme, to set out as his objective that there shall be in every parish in the Gaeltacht effectively accessible to every child the best we have to offer in education, primary, secondary and vocational.  It can be done, but to do it, you must have transport and you must have one centre, but how could we better spend money in the Gaeltacht; how could the Minister better discharge his duties as Minister for the Gaeltacht than if he had it to say: &ldquo;I embarked on a programme the ultimate end of which is effectively to make available to every child in every parish in the Gaeltacht the best we can offer in primary, secondary and vocational education?&rdquo; I suggest that by a very slight adaptation of the plans he has already in hands, he could do not only great service to the Gaeltacht but to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned my admiration for the holiday scholarship scheme in the Gaeltacht.  Those are the right lines on which to proceed.  I should like to hear in greater detail from the Minister about the hostel and chalet scheme because I do not understand that.  But in so far as I can grasp it, it seems to have relatively little to recommend it.  I think all I have said about bringing children to the Gaeltacht relates to what the Minister had to say on pages 7 and 8 of his speech as contained in the document which he was kind enough to circulate for our perusal.  I should like him to know, as I am sure he is aware, that he has the best wishes of everybody in the House for the success of the Gaeltacht administration and the Department. I do not underestimate the difficulties they have to face but they must be venturesome, as we say in the west. I urge the Minister never to allow his Department to sink to a pedestrian approach to the problems of the Gaeltacht. There is no greater treasure in <Col N="876" /> our keeping than the language.  Preservation of the Gaeltacht is a matter of the greatest difficulty and delicacy and there is no more fatal approach to it than the attempt to turn the Fíor-Ghael-tacht into a kind of museum and give the people the impression that the concern of the Oireachtas is to imprison them in the Gaeltacht and leave them there for ever more.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, our whole approach should be to convince the people that they have in their keeping an inestimable treasure for which the rest of us are deeply indebted to them and we are prepared, far from turning them into museum pieces, to make the Gaeltacht an example which the whole country will ultimately follow.  I suggest that in the educational sphere the Minister has a very special opportunity to do just that.  Also, in regard to the intensive user of small farms the Minister has a great opportunity.  I wish the enterprise launched at Glencolumb-kille every success and trust it will be all it is promised to be but I am not sufficiently experienced in matters of horticultural production to pronounce for or against it.</P>
    <P>I am certain there is great scope in the Gaeltacht area for the expansion of pig and sheep production.  I believe the expansion of pig production is indissolubly linked with permanent and effective marketing, which is eminently practicable for the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I believe the expansion of sheep is very largely dependent on the ability of the Department of the Gaeltacht, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, effectively to fertilise the hill grazing.</P>
    <P>I do not think I could conclude without echoing the Minister's tribute to Gael Linn.  I am a passionate believer in the value of voluntary effort.  I am perfectly certain the schemes to which Gael Linn have put their hands in the Gaeltacht are of incalculable value.  The more independent Gael Linn is, the better it will function.  But I am glad the Minister has availed of his statement to pay a tribute to its work.  I would like to be associated with that tribute so that Gael Linn and all who work for it may know their activities are watched <Col N="877" /> from this House with attention and admiration.  While we appreciate their desire, and endorse it, to remain independent, fully flexible and free, they should always feel that if at any time they wish to turn to the Oireachtas for assistance and encouragement, they can be assured it will always be available from every side of the House.</P>

      <P>Ní mholaim cuid de na rudaí adúirt an Teachta.  Chuir sé áthas orm a chloisint faoin deontas le haghaidh feabhsú an phiara i gCill Rónáin in Oileán Árainn.  Bhí sé sin de dhíth, go mór mhór mar gheall ar an méid bád a thagann isteach is a théann amach ón gcladach ansin.  Mar a bhí sé, ní rabhthas in ann fanacht ansin ar chor ar bith oíche stoirmiúil. Maidir leis na deontaisí tithe, go dtí le goirid bhí moill mhór ar na deon-taisí seo i nGaeltacht Chonamara, ach creidim go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar an cheist anois agus nach fada nó go mbeidh deireadh leis an mhoill.  Go deimhin, tig liom a rá go bhfuil sé beagnach socraithe cheana féin.  Go dtí seo, bhí ar iarrathóirí fanacht chomh fada le sé mí sul a bhfuaradar freagra fiú amháin.  B'fhéidir go raibh cuid aca sásta fanacht mar sin, ach bhí mí-fhoidhne ar a lán aca.</P>
      <P>Molaim freisin scéim dheontas na mbóthar sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá feabhas mór tagtha ar na bóithre aon áit a bhfuil na deontaisí le fáil.  Tá súil agam nach mbeidh aon mhoill sa cheist as seo amach.</P>

Tá paróistí ann a bhfuil 25 míle ar leithead agus 20 míle ar fhaid, agus níl a fhios agam conas a bheadh sé in ann na gasúir a thabhairt go dtí an scoil i bparóiste den tsaghas sin.

      <P>Deir an tAire in a ráiteas:</P>
      <P>I bhfeidhmiú scéimeanna na Roinne tugtar tús áite do na ceantair Fíor-Ghaeltachta agus do na daoine a labhrann an Ghaeilge de ghnáth agus a choinníonn beo bríomhair í mar theanga urlabhra. </P>
      <P>An é dearcadh na Roinne nach mbraitheann aithbheochaint na teanga mar ghná theanga ar aon limistéir, ach ar na háiteanna ina ndéantar úsáid den teanga mar ghná theanga i gcúrsaí an lae?  In mo cheantar féin in iarthar Luimneach le blianta anuas tá an Ghaeilge dá húsáid mar ghná-theanga ach níl Gaeltacht curtha ar bun ann. Tá scéimeanna ag an Roinn Talmhaíochta agus ag Coimisiún na Talún chun teaghlaigh ó Ghaeltacht Chonamara agus Chiarraí a thabhairt go dtí Contae na Midhe, agus bunaíodh ansin limistéar ar a tugadh Gaeltacht air. Tá le tuiscint againn ón méid sin gur Gaeltacht í áit ina bhfuil na daoine ag úsáid na teanga mar ghnáth-urlabhra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sé tá ag cur as do na daoine in iarthar Luimneach nach dtuigeann siad cad chuige nach bhfaghann siad an chabhair chéanna as ucht an obair dhian a chuireadar isteach le blianta anuas le feabhas a chur ar an nGaeilge agus chun an teanga a thabhairt thar n-ais mar ghnáth-urlabhra, go háirithe faoi chúram Arus Íde Naofa.  Cén fáth nach bhfuil an chabhair chéanna <Col N="879" /> le fáil acu siúd atá dhá fáil ag daoine i limistéirí eile?  Goilleann sé sin go mór ar an dtinreamh ar na scoileanna sin, ar an líon dalta i rith an tsamh-raidh.</P>
    <P>Bunaíodh na scoileanna seo chun seans a thabhairt do dhaltaí óga agus araoile le teacht le chéile chun an Ghaeilge a chleachtadh ar gach slí agus ansan í a labhairt ar pháirc na h-imeartha, ag dul ag snámh dóibh nó ag freastal ar chéilithe agus cuir-meacha cheoil.  I rith an tréimhse sin bíonn oidí i mbun na leanaí agus cabh-raíonn siad ar gach slí leo agus féachann siad chuige gurab í an Ghaeilge a bhíonn dhá h-úsáid i gcónaí aca.</P>
    <P>Anois tá cumainn ann go bhfuil deagh-obair á déanamh aca ar son na Gaeilge&mdash;cuir i gcás, Gael Linn agus Coiste na bPáistí.  Cuireann na cumainn sin agus Cumann Lúith-Chleas Gaedheal scoláireachtaí ar fáil do pháistí.  Fé scéim atá i réim fé láthair tá £5 sa bhreis le fáil ag páiste a théann don Ghaeltacht gur Gaeltacht é ó thaobh limistéir geograife dhe ach níl an deontas sin le fáil maidir le páiste a théann chuig scoil fé stiúradh Aras Íde.  Mar sin, tá laghdú ag teacht ar an méid páistí a théann ansin.  Tugann Cumann Lúith-Chleas Gaedheal £2 le h-aghaidh mí a chaitheann an leanbh sa Ghaeltacht ach ós rud é go bhfuil deontas £5 dhá fháil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta maidir le páiste a théann go dtí an Ghaeltacht ní h-íonadh é go dtéann na páistí treasna na Sionainne nó go dtí Baile Mhúirne, nó don Daingean nó áit eile mar sin.  Nílim ag fáil locht ar an méid atá á dhéanamh ach fé mar a chítear dom, ní Cothrom na Féinne é dona daoine atá ag obair ar son na teangan chomh dúthrachtach is atá siad le blianta anuas.</P>
    <P>Bhíos ag caint leis an Aire an bhliain so caite agus chuireas an cheist seo faoina bhráid.  B'fhéidir nach féidir aon rud a dhéanamh fé láthair ach cuirim ós cóir an Aire arís é i mbliana le súil go n-abrófar rud éigin mar gheall air i dtuarascáil Choimisiún na Gaeilge atá beagnach réidh anois. Sílim go bhfuil sé réidh ach nach bhfuil sé aistrithe b'fhéidir.  Tá súil agam go molfaidh an Coimisiún go <Col N="880" /> mba chóir an deontas céanna a thúirt d'aon dream atá ag obair ar son na teangan pé áit sa tír ina bhfuilid ag obair.  Dá ndeintí é sin bheadh tairbhe níos fearr le fáil maidir leis an dteangain.</P>
    <P>Is oth liomsa agus is oth lena lán daoine nach bhfuil úsáid na teangan chómh bríomhar agus chómh leathan ar fuair na tíre agus by chóir agus nach ag dul i méid atá Gaeltachta na tíre.  Is léir gur ag dul i laghad atá an Ghaeltacht ó thaobh na daoine óga atá in ann slí maireachtála d'fháil ann.  Dá bhrí sin, aon rud is féidir leis an Aire a dhéanamh chun cabhair a thúirt do dhreamanna atá ag obair ar son na teangan, pé áit sa tír ina bhfuilid, ba chóir dó é a dhéanamh.  Má tugtar cabhair dóibh beidh buntáiste an-mhór le fáil maidir le sábháil na teangan agus a leathnú ar fuair na tíre.</P>
    <P>Rinne an tAire tagairt d'imeachtaí cultúra.  Iarraim ar an Aire an chabhair chéanna a thabhairt do dhaoine atá ag obair in aon áit sa tír chun feiseanna agus imeachtaí den tsaghas sin a bhunú a tugtar dóibh siúd atá ag obair i limi-stéirí Gaeltachta.  Má deintear é sin beidh níos mó measa ar ghluaiseachtaí den tsort seo.  Bheadh spiorad níos fearr ann dá dtuigfeadh na daoine atá i bhfeighil gluaiseachtaí den chineál sin go bhfuil an Roinn toilteanach roint airgid a thabhairt dóibh chun cabhrú leo.</P>
    <P>Bhí tráth ann nuair a bhí feiseanna go flúirseach ar fuaid na tíre ach is beag áit anois ina gcuirtear ar siúl  mar ghnáth-rud i saol na ndaoine.  Tá fleadhanna ceoil ann gan dabht agus is maith an rud é sin.  Tá súil agam nach fíor cuid de na rudaí a chloistear anois a bhíonn ar siúl ag fleadhanna ceoil seachas cultúr na Gaeilge.</P>

Más mian linn an Ghaeilge a shábháil, tá dhá ruda le déanamh&mdash;labhairt na teangan mar ghnáth-chaint na ndaoine a spreagadh in áit a bhfuil Gaeltacht <Col N="881" /> ann, beag nó mór, ina bhfuil daoine atá toilteanach í a h-úsáid mar ghnáth-theangain agus an tarna rud, an Ghaeltacht féin a shábháil.  Brathann sé sin ar shlí maireachtála a thabhairt dona daoine sa Ghaeltacht, Tá a lán cainte á déanamh maidir leis na deacrachtaí a bhaineann leis sin, Bhí cruinniú ar siúl i n-Iarthar na hÉireann mar ar pléadh an cheist seo.  Tá a lán daoine nach bhfuil sásta leis an scéal mar atá sé fé láthair i n-Iarthar na tíre agus sa Ghaeltacht.  Más mian linn go bhfanfadh na daoine sa Ghaeltacht tá níos mó le déanamh againn seachas na scéimeanna atá ann faoi Roinn na Gaeltachta dá fheabhas iad.  Sé an chúis is mó go bhfuil laghdú ag teacht ar líon na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil an t-aos óg toilteanach fanúint ann má cheapann siad go bhfuil saol níos sonnasaí ar fáil i n-áiteacha eile.  Sin é an rud is mó a chuireann isteach ar cheist na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Iarraim arís ar an Aire an chabhair chéanna a thabhairt do dhaoine atá ag obair ar son na teangan pé áit ina bhfuil siad ag obair ós rud é go bhfuil siad ag spreagadh an aosa óig chun an Ghaeilge a labhairt.</P>

I gcoitinne, bíonn na Teachtaí báidhiúil as na scéimeanna uilig atá ar siúl faoin Roinn agus is maith an rud é sin toisc go bhfuil cabhair gach duine sa Teach ag teastáil chun an teanga a chur chun cinn agus an Ghaeltacht a choimeád beo.  Cé go bhfuil dul ar aghaidh á dhéanamh ag an Roinn, ní féidir a rá go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ná an Ghaeilge sábháilte go fóill.

Aontaím leis, ámh, san méid a dúirt sé agus tá siúl agam go mbeidh ar mo chumas an cheist a scrúdú a thuille nuair a bheidh tuarascáil an Choimisiúin ar fáil.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tuarascáil sin agam i gceann cupla seachtaine nó i gceann míosa agus is dócha go mbeidh an tuarascáil seo cló-bhuailte agus ag an pobal i gceann míosa nó mar sin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon seems to be under a misapprehension about the reasons for the provision of hostels or chalets under Roinn na Gaeltachta. The purpose of the hostels, of course, has been fundamentally educational, to make provision for students in the Gaeltacht. It may relieve whatever apprehension the Deputy may have when I tell him that there is one of these <Col N="883" /> hostels in Galway used by the Carna nuns in connection with their secondary school.  They use this hostel to accommodate students attending Irish courses in the summer and to accommodate secondary students during the remainder of the year.  There are two in Cork also to accommodate students attending Irish colleges there and there is one being operated in Kerry which is owned by Gael Linn, and that is also for the purpose of students attending the Gaeltacht to learn Irish.  The idea of providing these hostels has been solely for the purpose of accommodating students who go to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish or to perfect their knowledge of the language and that is the purpose of the grants under this scheme.</P>
    <P>The purpose of providing chalets is a different one again.  The provision of chalets for the people in the Gaeltacht was, one, for the purpose of increasing the income of the individual owner of the chalet and, two, to provide much-needed accommodation in the Gaeltacht for a family, a father and mother and their children, to go there and learn the Irish language or to perfect their knowledge of it.  Some of these Gaeltacht areas have one asset, and one asset only; they are near the sea and, in some cases, they have very pretty scenery; otherwise, they are in very isolated regions.  It is not correct to state, as Deputy Dillon seems to think, that there is plenty of hotel accommodation.  Even where there is, it is out of the economic reach for the most part of the ordinary man in the street.  In these days parents are anxious to spend their holidays in the Gaeltacht to give their children an opportunity of absorbing the atmosphere of the Gaeltacht and acquiring a blas.</P>
    <P>I expected the chalet scheme to make greater strides; I had thought it would be more widely availed of. Those that have been erected have proved a tremendous addition to the incomes of those concerned.  I hope to bring home the benefits of this scheme more forcibly to those who have been so far slow to avail of it.  In <Col N="884" /> addition to the rents, there is also a potential market for the output of the small farmer since those occupying the chalets need fuel, vegetables, milk and so on.  It is not contemplated that these chalets should provide an attraction for the foreign tourist.  The idea is to fill a gap.  I have had several inquiries since I became concerned from people who have assured me they would be most anxious to go to the Gaeltacht for their holidays but are prevented from doing so because of lack of accommodation.  It is to fill that gap this scheme was devised.</P>
    <P>There is another scheme under which people get special help to add an extra room or make extra accommodation available for those who go to the Gaeltacht under the different schemes to which I referred earlier. There is need for more accommodation in the form of chalets and my only regret is that people have been so slow in availing of the very generous grant provisions.  May I say that I find the people in the Gaeltacht areas not good at catching on to new ideas unless there is some progressive local leader, such as the local priest, teacher, or some such person.  Their lack of initiative militates against them and against the development we should all like to see in the Gaeltacht.  I hope the stiúir-theoirí working in these areas now will succeed in arousing the people to the advantages that are there for them and that we shall see in the future greater results and much quicker development than has been the case so far.</P>

    <P>Deputy Dillon welcomed our efforts towards providing secondary education for children in isolated Gaeltacht areas.  This started as a pilot scheme and we have been extending it all the time.  I subscribe to the view that there is nothing more important than education for the advancement of the people in these areas.  Because of their <Col N="885" /> isolated locations, children were left without any hope of secondary education, unless parents were fortunate enough to be able to send children outside.  As everybody knows, most of the people are very poor.  The land is the poorest in the country.  Because of the isolation factor, it is nearly impossible to induce industry into these areas.  Special treatment in the line of educational facilities and scholarships is most important.  We have made a start.  We hope to intensify our efforts in the future.</P>
    <P>Some matters may have been mentioned with which I have not dealt in my reply.  I shall, of course, read the debate and any points that have not been dealt with will be specifically pursued.  The general position is that the new schemes introduced have been achieving reasonable success.  In their own way, they have brought considerable benefit to the people of the Gaeltacht.  With a little more encouragement, I think the people will take better advantage of these schemes.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am grateful to the House for the favourable way in which they invariably treat the Estimate for this particular branch of my responsibility.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, further to a reply of 7th May, his attention has been drawn to the fact that the number of unemployed persons on the live register at 11th, 18th and 25th May continued to be some thousands in excess of the figure for the corresponding dates in 1962; and whether he has any comment to make on this unemployment situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of persons on the live register on 1st June was 3,423 in excess of the total for the corresponding date a year ago.  This was not due to any deterioration in the employment position, which is indeed improving steadily.  Notwithstanding <Col N="886" /> the numbers of non-manual workers who recently surmounted the salary limit for compulsory social insurance, the number of social insurance stamps sold in the March quarter was the highest recorded in the last decade.  The number of persons engaged in transportable goods industries in March was the highest recorded in a first Quarter at the Quarterly Industrial Production Inquiry.  The population increased in 1962 and the net outward passenger balances by sea and air indicate that it is increasing again in 1963.</P>
      <P>It is clear, therefore, that, having regard to the falling-off in emigration and the increase in population, the higher numbers at present on the live register do not reflect any disimprovement in the situation.  In the Government's <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, the general outline of which will be published within the next few weeks, increased employment will again be a major aim.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is no doubt aware that there are in some places in the country unusual situations of unemployment.  Would he say, apart from what might be done by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, if there are any special plans he may have in mind to alleviate a serious situation of unemployment in a particular area?</P>

If there were special problems in particular areas arising out of local circumstances, the Government would certainly do what they could about it, but I am not aware of any such case at the moment.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to a newspaper report that the Master of the Coombe Hospital, at a recent public meeting at the hospital, stated that this country was &ldquo;one of the worst in the civilised world for infant mortality&rdquo; and that he believed this was due to lack of sufficient nourishment <Col N="888" /> for mothers during pregnancy and of adequate clothing for babies.</P>

    <P>These figures do not bear out the reported statement &ldquo;that this country is one of the worst in the civilised world for infant mortality.&rdquo; In fact, when certain special factors which affect the situation here&mdash;our relatively late marriages combined with high fertility&mdash;are taken into account, our figures bear favourable comparison with most of the countries mentioned.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second part of the question, since I became Minister for Health, no instance has been reported to me of an infant's dying from lack of adequate clothing due to the poverty of the mother and I feel sure that in recent times all my predecessors have had the same experience.  In any event, the Health Acts provide for the payment by health authorities to mothers in the lower income group of a maternity cash grant of £4 which may be used, where necessary, for the purchase of a layette.  Such a grant was paid last year in respect of one in every three births.  This grant is additional to the maternity grant payable under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I accept that lack of appropriate nourishment for mothers during pregnancy may contribute to infant mortality; but this lack, where it exists, <Col N="889" /> does not necessarily result from poverty.  Every expectant mother in the lower income group is entitled, under the Health Acts, to a daily supply of milk and this facility is widely availed of.  In addition, in the Dublin area charitable organisations provide a substantial mid-day meal to expectant mothers who seek it.  One such organisation, which receives a measure of financial assistance, also under the Health Acts, from the Dublin Health Authority&mdash;which in turn receives 50 per cent recoupment from the Exchequer&mdash;operates 16 centres spread throughout the city at which an average of 500 dinners were provided daily for expectant mothers in a recent year. It should be remembered that nutritional deficiency can result as readily from eating the wrong type of food as from an inadequate supply of food.</P>
    <P>In view of the foregoing, I do not consider it necessary to take any special measures at present to change the existing pattern of the maternity and infant services.  The matter will, of course, be reviewed by the Select Committee at present sitting.</P>

      <P>The use of any harmful ingredient in any article of food intended for sale for human consumption is specifically prohibited by the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.  In addition, wide powers are given to the Minister for Health under Part V of the Health Act, 1947, as amended, to make regulations for the prevention of danger to the public health from the manufacture, preparation, importation, storage, distribution or exposure for sale of food intended for sale for human consumption.  The current controls which apply in this connection are embodied in the Preservatives, etc., in Food Regulations, which prohibit the use, with certain specified exemptions, of preservatives and also <Col N="890" /> the presence in food of certain harmful colouring matters.</P>
      <P>The whole field of the use of additives and the presence of harmful ingredients in food has been under review by the Food Advisory Committee set up under the auspices of my Department to advise on this difficult technical problem.  Some time ago the committee made recommendations for revision of the regulations in certain respects but subsequently asked that action should be deferred pending a more comprehensive examination by them of some aspects in the light of recent developments in other countries. I understand that the committee expect to be able to submit a fuller report shortly and I hope that new regulations, based on their recommendations, will be formulated and published within the next few months.</P>

      <P>The information relating to the duties under headings (a) to (e) of the question is contained in a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.  As regards taxes on personal incomes and taxes paid by companies, I should point out that both individuals and companies pay income tax but that the statistics relating to that tax are not compiled in such a manner as would indicate the amounts paid by different classes of taxpayers.  In connection with the preparation of national income figures, however, particulars of total taxes on incomes and estimates of taxes on personal incomes are published in the report <i>National Income and Expenditure</i>.  Tables A.5 and A.15 of the 1961 report, which is the latest one available, give figures <Col N="891" /> for the years 1953 to 1961, inclusive. Estimates of taxes paid by companies can be derived by subtracting taxes on personal incomes from total taxes on incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that for national <Col N="892" /> income purposes taxes on personal incomes include contributions to social insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if injured employees who were covered by policies with the Equitable Insurance Company Limited are being paid workmen's compensation; if not, what is their position; and if he will now consider State coverage for workmen's compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as appears to be the case, the Equitable Insurance Company Limited is unable to meet claims under policies covering workmen's compensation risks, the liability falls on the employer. The question of the taking over of workmen's compensation by the State was dealt with by the Commission on Workmen's Compensation, whose report <Col N="893" /> is at present under consideration by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position where a firm is unable to meet its commitments arising out of a workmen's compensation claim and an individual worker is disabled permanently? Has he any redress against the employer or the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The employer is ultimately responsible for the claims of workmen for workmen's compensation and the insurance policy merely indemnifies the employer against the risk.  The actual liability is never removed from the employer.  He is always fully liable and is still liable no matter what happens to the Equitable Insurance Company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>An employer might not keep sufficient funds in hand to meet any claim and for that reason he is at a loss and the workman is at a loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather like closing the stable door after the horse has gone.  Will the Minister not agree that this has pinpointed the need for a secure insurance for employers and will he ensure that when the Workmen's Compensation Commission report is being considered finally, the fact that an insurance company, which was supposed to be a reputable company, has fallen down will be taken into consideration?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The affairs of the Equitable Insurance Company are in the hands of a <Col N="895" /> liquidator appointed by the High Court.  In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on such matters as dealings that may have taken place in the company's shares.  In any event, the supervision machinery set out in the Insurance Acts does not require any special information on these matters to be furnished to my Department and I could not have sought any information other than that available for public inspection in the Companies Registration Office or in the Register of Members maintained by the company itself.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 10, 12, 15 and 17 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory provisions relating to the supervision of insurance companies do not require my Department to do any more than see to it that the necessary returns are submitted in the prescribed form, that they are certified in the prescribed manner, and that they <Col N="897" /> show the company to be solvent.  The valuation of shares or other securities by public officials is not called for.  As I indicated in reply to other questions on 28th May, 1963, the returns submitted by this company during my term of office, and also during the terms of office of my predecessors, were in order and insolvency was not indicated until the latest returns came to hand.  I also made it clear on that occasion that there was no delay whatever on my part in putting the company into liquidation as soon as it became apparent that it was insolvent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the company asked for a prolongation of the statutory period?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's reply to Deputy Governey, will the Minister permit me to ask does his reply mean that in regard to a question of insolvency under the Insurance Act, 1936, the Minister has no particular responsibility to establish to his satisfaction that the information presented to him is accurate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

It is rather difficult to say where this new consideration begins and where the old left off.  That is why I am not inclined to be absolutely sure as to what the terms of my answer to the Deputy's supplementary question should be, in that it is really a continuation of discussions and considerations that have been going on. It might be true to say that the discussions are taking place and, on the other hand, if one were pinpointed on that, it might be said that these discussions are the tail end of what went before and that the new have not begun.</P>

      <P>While no formal permission was given to the film company, the police were made aware in advance of the company's intentions and the company were given to understand that no objection would be raised as long as the units carried out any directions that might be given by the police on the spot.

      <P>I am not so aware. The game of bingo is a recent introduction to this country and the suggestion that amusement caterers ever depended on it for a living cannot be well-founded.</P>
      <P>The principle whereby the operation of certain types of gaming and lotteries is reserved for charitable organisations was clearly accepted in the 1956 Act.

      <P>In introducing this year's Estimate for Fisheries, which reflects the increasing attention to the development of our sea and inland fisheries in accordance with the Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, I should like to mention a few facts and figures illustrating the progress made during the past year:</P>
      <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1963, the value of landings of sea fish increased by almost 10 per cent to £1,548,000.</P>
      <P>In the same year, the value of exports of fish and fishery products increased by some 36 per cent to the record level of £1,686,000.</P>
      <P>The estimated income from angling tourism rose by about 12 per cent to the new peak of £1,346,000 which may be regarded as invisible exports.</P>
      <P>Thus exports, visible and invisible, arising from our fisheries exceeded £3 million.</P>
      <P>Some 11,000 men were directly employed, whole-time or part-time, in our sea and inland fisheries&mdash;apart from thousands of others engaged in marketing, processing and transport of fish and catering for angling tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the sea fisheries side, the main endeavour in the past year has been directed towards implementing the intensified <i>Programme of Sea Fisheries Development</i> published as a White Paper in April, 1962.  In particular, the reorganisation of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is proceeding under a whole-time chairman appointed from 1st January, 1963, and considerable progress has been made towards the establishment of an advisory service to improve fishing techniques and promote co-operation among fishermen and a marketing service to assist in the development of markets at home and abroad for fish and fishery products.  I have full confidence that the development of these advisory and marketing services, together with the enhanced facilities and incentives for the acquisition and re-engining of fishing boats, <Col N="910" /> the training schemes for fishermen, the development of fishery harbours and the extension of exploratory and research work will, with a determined effort and the co-operation of all concerned, bring about the further expansion which is needed in the industry.</P>
    <P>In 1962, landings of demersal or white fish increased by over 17,000 cwt. to 230,000 cwt. and their value rose by £46,000 to £867,000.  Whiting was the most important species in both quantity and value: indeed the quantity of whiting was almost as high as that of all other demersal species together.  Other important varieties were, in order of value, plaice, cod, ray or skate, soles and haddock and, in order of quantity, ray or skate, plaice, cod, pollack and haddock.  The value of the pelagic fish landed, of which herrings accounted for over 85 per cent, increased by £44,000 to £303,000.  The value of shellfish landings also rose by £52,000 to £330,000, the principal varieties being lobsters, Dublin Bay prawns, crawfish and periwinkles.</P>
    <P>It is pleasing to note that returns so far in 1963 show a worthwhile improvement on those for 1962, the value of landings of all varieties of sea fish for the first four months of 1963 being almost £70,000 higher than for the like period in 1962.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that a co-operative effort got under way towards the end of 1961 for the marketing of processed herrings abroad.  The Irish Herring Export Group, comprising some of the principal fish processing firms and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, resumed operations in the 1962/63 season but, owing to the buoyant demand for all herrings landed, their activities were not on as large a scale as had been contemplated.  Consignments of salted, marinated and frozen herrings were exported by the group to Western Europe and to Czechoslovakia. Aside from this marketing endeavour, some established processing firms continued to work separately and exported sizable quantities of salted and marinated herrings to European countries and to the USA.  Exports of Irish fish products were sent to as <Col N="911" /> many as 22 different countries even as far away as Australia where Irish whiting commands a market.</P>
    <P>On the home market, the problem of trying to get more people to eat more fish more often has been tackled in a vigorous fashion.  As part of a publicity campaign to help in stimulating home consumption, a national fish cookery competition open to whole-time day students of vocational schools was organised by the Fishing Industry Development Committee.  This is an advisory committee composed of representatives of fish importers, retailers and fishermen with representatives from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Fisheries Division of the Department of Lands.  With the co-operation of the Technical Instruction Branch of the Department of Education and the various vocational education committees, the competition, which was confined to the cooking of whiting or herring, got under way.</P>
    <P>It was welcomed on all sides as a great success and throughout the various stages&mdash;school, county, regional and national&mdash;interest never flagged. The high standard achieved by the 5,000 students who took part was something to be proud of and this was in no small measure due to the painstaking work of the vocational education committees and their staffs and the enthusiasm of the students.  Further promotion work of a similar kind is being undertaken on a planned basis with the object of benefiting not only the consumer but the fishing industry as a whole&mdash;the fishermen who catch the fish, the auctioneers, wholesalers and co-operatives who market it in the first instance and the retailers who are responsible for its final presentation to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which is being increased by £40,000 to £200,000 this year, includes provision for grants of 25 per cent of the cost of new boats and new engines and for subsidising the interest payable by hire purchasers at the low level of 4 per cent.  Repayable advances up to £220,000 from the Central Fund to the Board have also been authorised <Col N="912" /> for financing the provision of boats and gear in the current year.  Eighteen new boats ranging from 26 to 56 feet in length were issued by the Board to hire-purchasers during the year ended 31st March, 1963.  The first of the new 65 foot fishing boats designed by the Board is nearing completion at their boatyard in Killybegs and the second has been laid down.  The demand for boats will be further stimulated by the intensified development programme now in operation.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the reorganisation of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in accordance with the <i>Programme of Sea Fisheries Development.</i> The Board's policy as a development body is to unify all sections of the industry into a cohesive force geared for expansion at all levels.  Fishermen are being encouraged to form co-operative societies with a view to replacing the Board's trading organisation. The Dingle fishermen have already given a lead by setting up their own co-operative society.  They recently took over the Board's premises and facilities at Dingle and are now handling all fish landed at that port.  Fishermen in other areas are thinking on similar lines and it is expected that those in our leading ports will follow this practical example of local initiative and enterprise.  The Board are ready to help in the formation of such co-operative societies and to assist in promoting sales of fish at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The Board's fleet maintenance scheme, which was previously confined to hire purchase boats, is being extended to cover all fishing boats. It is hoped that, by proper care and maintenance of boats, the time spent on actual fishing will be appreciably increased&mdash;with a corresponding improvement in fishermen's earnings.</P>
    <P>The Board's new advisory service aims to expand production through the improvement of catching techniques, the location of new fishing grounds and the organisation of education and training schemes for fishermen.  Regional advisory officers are being appointed by the Board and the sole work of these officers is to win the confidence of fishermen and <Col N="913" /> impart to them up-to-date information, advice and techniques.  In general the object of the service is to put the fisherman in a position to make the most of his opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Board are preparing a planned market development programme for home and export markets which will go into operation in association with the private trade and co-operative societies.  The programme will be designed to increase fish consumption at home, conduct market research abroad, and provide expert advice on the presentation and processing of fish products. In addition co-operative selling arrangements among fish exporters will be encouraged and export marketing will be developed on a quality control basis under an Irish brand.  A scheme of help and advice towards suitable structural alterations and the provision of equipment for fish retailers is being prepared, and will be fitted into the overall programme for the home market.  In this connection regional distribution from landing points will be encouraged.  In particular special sales promotion is being prepared for whiting which, as I mentioned earlier, is the species in most plentiful supply around our coasts.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should refer to the Board's fish processing factories which received a good deal of publicity in the House some months ago.  In accordance with the <i>Programme of Sea Fisheries Development</i> proposals were invited for the acquisition of the factories at Killybegs, Galway and Schull.  The aim was to transfer them to private or co-operative interests if acceptable proposals were received, thus relieving the Board as far as practicable of direct participation in commercial operations which can be effectively handled by such interests and enabling them to concentrate more intensively on development activities.  There was no question at any time of closing down the factories: indeed those at Killybegs and Galway are going concerns and will continue to be operated by the Board pending receipt of acceptable proposals.  In fact plans are under way to expand production at the three factories in conjunction with fishermen and trade interests.</P>
    <P>As I have stressed on many occasions, <Col N="914" /> it is imperative to provide a regular inflow of progressive and trained men into the catching side of the industry, not alone to make good normal wastage but to man the additional vessels needed for the more effective exploitation of our fishery resources.  Training and education are indispensable nowadays in any industry and this applies particularly to the fishing industry if the best possible use is to be made of the expensive vessels and complex modern equipment available.  We have reached what may be called the take-off stage in recruitment but more rapid acceleration must be attained if the industry is really to prosper.  Discussions are taking place between the Fisheries Division of the Department of Lands, the Department of Education and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara with a view to co-ordinating the efforts of all concerned with the education and training of fishermen.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme for training fishermen as skippers, 30 fishermen have so far completed courses.  A further 13 are at present attending a theoretical course at Galway in preparation for the examination for certificates of competency.  Incidentally, this is the highest attendance so far recorded at one of these courses and, if the increased interest continues, as I hope it will, additional courses will be organised.  Fishermen undergoing these courses are paid at the rate of £7 a week plus allowances for dependants.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme for training boys as fishermen, trainees receive allowances of £5 per week&mdash;which is a reasonable figure for a youth of 16 with no previous experience.  Thirty boys trained under this scheme are now working as full crew members and thirty-five more are undergoing training at present.  I do not regard this as adequate and my immediate aim is to double the number in training: indeed I would like to see it trebled as soon as possible.  Boys who successfully complete training will be encouraged, after further practical experience, to train as skippers and take command of valuable fishing boats. Two of those recruited under this scheme in 1959 are, in fact, being <Col N="915" /> trained as skippers at Galway at the moment.  With the facilities and incentives now available, the fishing industry offers opportunities of worthwhile careers at least equal to those in any other industry.  Boys of not less than 16 years of age are again being interviewed at convenient centres and, if Deputies know of any others who may be interested, I would be glad to get their names and addresses.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government decided to substitute Dunmore East for Passage East in the programme of development of major fishery harbours.  This change was made on the advice of the harbours consultant who considered that the subsoil conditions disclosed by trial borings at Passage East were unfavourable. A major scheme for the improvement of the harbour at Dunmore East has been prepared.  As a result of the boring surveys at Killybegs and Castletownbere, some variations in the schemes for those harbours have been decided on and detailed designs are being prepared.  Work is due to commence at these three centres this year. Site investigations at Howth and model investigations for Galway have still to be completed.  Facilities at other harbours and landing places are simultaneously receiving attention; some works are in progress and several proposals are in varying stages of examination.</P>
    <P>Research work is of the utmost importance in the development of our sea fisheries as so little is certain about sea life and the movements of fish stocks.  Scientists in the Fisheries Division are tackling these problems both by direct investigations and by collaboration in the international field through organisations such as the International Council for the Study of the Sea.  The very nature of the problems, however, is such that spectacular results are unlikely to be achieved within a short time.  The varieties to which particular attention is being paid by our scientists at present are herrings and mackerel in the pelagic group, whiting, plaice and hake among the white fish varieties, and lobsters, crawfish, Dublin Bay prawns and mussels <Col N="916" /> in the shellfish category.  The exploratory fishing vessel &ldquo;Cú Feasa&rdquo; has been of great assistance in the conduct of these scientific investigations as well as in searching for herrings and making surveys of the sea bed mainly on grounds off the south and west coasts.</P>
    <P>One of the objects of fisheries investigations is the conservation of fish stocks which is frequently achieved by the imposition of an appropriate minimum size limit.  I recently had occasion to declare a new minimum size for lobsters related to the rigid body-shell rather than the more elastic overall length.  As the question of prohibiting the taking of &ldquo;berried lobsters&rdquo;, i.e. female lobsters on which eggs are visible, may be raised again in the course of this debate, may I repeat that special consideration was given to that problem before the new order was made.  The advice tendered to me, however, was that it would be more effective to enforce a size limit which would permit of spawning, adequate for maintenance of the stocks, to take place before the lobsters attain that size.  The removal of berried lobsters above that size should then have no adverse effect on the stocks.  Every female lobster is a potential berried lobster and there would be little advantage in prohibiting the taking of a lobster which could be legally taken before becoming berried. I appeal for the full co-operation of all fishermen in observing the minimum size limits that have been prescribed for various species of fish.</P>
    <P>As the &ldquo;Cú Feasa&rdquo; alone cannot cope with the demand from several areas along our lengthy coastline, an initial provision is made in this year's Estimate for a sister ship.  A vessel somewhat comparable with the largest type of fishing boat in use here will probably best serve the purpose.  Inquiries are proceeding and a decision will shortly be taken as to the most suitable type and size of craft.  The vessel will be constructed at an Irish boatyard.</P>
    <P>As the sketch plans approved for the fisheries research station at Galway were related to the particular site selected, the preparation of working drawings has had to be delayed <Col N="917" /> because of the reluctance of the Galway Harbour Commissioners to complete the transfer of the site.</P>
    <P>As to the question of extension of exclusive fishery limits, we have missed no opportunity of seeking to secure international agreement on this issue. A further opportunity may present itself at a conference of European countries to be held later this year on the initiative of the British Government to consider fishing rights, access to markets, rights of establishment and policing.  Our interest in an international rule of law in this field is well known but we would hope that the proposed conference will produce an agreement of at least a regional character.</P>
    <P>On the inland fisheries side, I can report that the past year has been a good and profitable one for the industry and that much useful work has been done towards increasing the productivity of our inland waters.</P>
    <P>Last year's salmon catch was the best for many years and salmon exports totalling 19,000 cwt. valued at £673,000 were the highest since 1951. From about the end of June, grilse arrived in the mouths of most of our rivers in considerable numbers.  Conditions for netting were favourable and rain came in good time to bring up adequate runs for anglers.  Reports on the subsequent spawning told of an abundance of fish on many of the spawning grounds.</P>
    <P>Reports this season speak fairly consistently of a spring fish run better than the average of recent years; this may be due to a continuance of the favourable factors affecting the sea life of the salmon which produced last year's phenomenal run of grilse.</P>
    <P>Another helpful factor should eventually be the scheme of salmon river improvements which continues from year to year with the aim of opening up new spawning areas and improving existing ones.  Though the effects may be gradual and the benefits to the stocks not immediately perceptible, it is certain that work of this kind gives a better chance to the brood fish and must help to increase the runs into our rivers.  The protection of stocks from depredation by poachers <Col N="918" /> is, of course, indispensable for the welfare of the fisheries.  The law dealing with this problem has been strengthened in the past year and will facilitate determined action by the protection staffs of boards of conservators to suppress illegal practices.  Staff of the right calibre are needed for this, particularly at the upper level, and proposals are being considered for the future recruitment of key personnel who would be established on a pensionable basis with fixity of tenure.</P>
    <P>In view of misconceptions from time to time about the income of the Salmon Conservancy Fund, I should like to draw attention to the extent of the State grants payable into the fund.  This year's grant of £22,000 provides more for general purposes than last year's figure which included an exceptional item of £4,500.  Payments from the fund are in the main made to boards of conservators to supplement their normal income.</P>
    <P>Two major improvement projects financed through the Fund have now reached the finishing stages.  At the salmon hatchery and rearing station at Cong, County Mayo, the hatchery building has been completed and the holding ponds and other works are under construction.  This station is expected to be in full operation for the coming spawning season.  The main construction work on the fish passes at Ennistymon, County Clare, was completed in time to enable numbers of salmon to travel upstream to the spawning beds of the River Inagh last year.  There remain only some minor works now in course of completion and the stocking of the river system has already been commenced by the planting out of fry.</P>
    <P>Scientific and technical investigations being carried out by biologists and engineers on the inland fisheries side include surveys of salmon and eel stocks, problems of fish predation and the effects of arterial drainage and of hydro-electric schemes on stocks of migratory fish.  As is the rule with fishery research work, the investigations are of a fairly long-term nature and in most cases will take some years to bring to the stage where conclusions can be drawn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> The investigations into the effects on fish life, fish food and spawning grounds of arterial drainage work on the River Moy are proceeding.  The drainage authorities and officers of the Fisheries Division are maintaining close liaison in the carrying out of the drainage work in order to minimise interference with the very valuable salmon fisheries of the Moy system.</P>
    <P>Investigations into the sharp decline in the runs of salmon in the River Lee are also being continued with the active co-operation of the Electricity Supply Board, the Inland Fisheries Trust and the Cork Board of Conservators.  While the work done last year did not yield conclusive results, it indicated that predation by pike in the reservoirs appeared to be a major factor in the loss of salmon smolts and that reluctance on the part of the smolts to use the existing fish pass arrangements was also a serious problem.  This year's programme for the Lee accordingly includes large-scale operations to reduce the number of pike and also experimental work designed to make the fish passes more attractive to smolts.</P>
    <P>The investigation into the effects of effluent from bog workings on fish life and fish food, for which a biologist was seconded to the Salmon Research Trust late in 1961, has not yet reached a sufficiently advanced stage to produce useful conclusions.</P>
    <P>The eel fishing programme this year will again be aimed at the demonstration of improved methods of capture and the examination of the efficiency of certain types of eel fishing engines in operation at present.  I am happy to say that exports of eels in 1962 at 2,038 cwts., valued at £33,772, showed a welcome recovery on the corresponding figures for 1961, viz. 1,869 cwts., valued at £25,678.</P>
    <P>There is a further substantial increase this year in the grant-in-aid to the Inland Fisheries Trust whose State funds are now derived entirely from the Fisheries Vote.  The provision of £75,000 represents an advance of £12,000 on the corresponding figure for last year and it has been decided <Col N="920" /> that the grant-in-aid will be maintained at the level of £75,000 per year for the next three years.  I think it will be agreed that this is money well invested.  The steady rise in income from angling tourism year by year is more than adequate justification for the expenditure.</P>
    <P>The results of the first year of the new five-year angling development plan have been assessed and it is estimated that the number of angling visitors increased by some 12 per cent over the figure for 1961 which was approximately 52,000.  Income from angling tourism likewise increased from £1,200,000 to some £1,346,000. This is particularly satisfactory when one considers that economic conditions in Britain in 1962 were not conducive to such an increase. Arrangements continue to operate for co-ordinating the Trust's development work with promotion work by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>The progress made in attracting angling tourists is a tribute to the success of the work being done by the Trust and Bord Fáilte and by those local organisations which, I am happy to say, are co-operating so wholeheartedly in the work.  The assurance of a fixed income over a number of years should facilitate the forward planning of the Trust's programme, but I must stress that there is a limit to the amount of work that can be undertaken in any particular year.  I would appeal for patience on the part of all concerned where, for one reason or another, the Trust is unable to fit into its programme all the numerous requests for development of fisheries.</P>
    <P>Three demonstration fish farms in five-pond units which were set up over the past few years are operating successfully and are showing a reasonable profit.  A double, or ten-pond, unit in course of construction near Mullingar is nearing completion and is expected to be stocked this summer. Two private five-pond units, one at Thomastown, County Kilkenny, and the other near Holycross, County Tipperary, are also in operation.</P>
    <P>The commercial fish farm at Wood-enbridge, County Wicklow, operated by Irish Trout Industries Ltd., has been <Col N="921" /> operating to capacity and that at Waterville, County Kerry, set up by Rainbow Ltd., has recently begun to market its output on the continent. There is every reason to believe that exports of rainbow trout will, in the future, form an important part of our fish exports.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act of 1962 is now in operation and the heavier penalties it provides for fishery offences will, I hope, enable the courts to deal severely with serious offences such as the use of poison which not only kills off the adult fish but destroys the young fish on which the future of the stocks depends.  The Act should serve as an indication to the courts of the seriousness with which the Oireachtas views these offences.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may here refer to a suggestion made when that Bill was under discussion in the House that I might take some action in regard to waters where title difficulties were claimed to be hindering development of trout fishing or coarse fishing.  I may say that these waters, which have been described as abandoned fisheries, have not forced themselves on the notice of the Inland Fisheries Trust: indeed, that body is more than fully occupied with development work on waters which present no difficulty as regards title.  I have, however, invited members of the Trust and also members of the Trout Anglers Federation to report any cases of which they are aware.  If some real problem arises from these title difficulties, my present view is that statutory provision for acquisition of such fishing rights by the State should be confined to cases in which a responsible body, such as the Trust or a board of conservators or a reputable local association,</P>
    <P>(1)  has sound proposals for development of a fishery;</P>
    <P>(2)  finds the implementation of those proposals hindered by intractable title difficulties affecting the whole or part of the fishery; and</P>
    <P>(3)  is prepared to pay an appropriate rent for the fishery if vested in the State.</P>
    <P>I would, of course, prefer to see any fishery owners concerned asserting <Col N="922" /> their title and taking steps to preserve their fisheries or to make them available to some appropriate body for development.  I think I have shown that excellent progress is being made in the development of our sea and inland fisheries.  To enable the good work to continue, I confidently recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. </P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the reorganisation of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, to the fact that a permanent chairman has been appointed, and that the new chairman will devote all his time and energy to his duties. It is only right that on an occasion such as this tribute should be paid to the outgoing chairman, Mr. Séamus Mallon.  For many years, he devoted all his talents and bent all his energies to the discharge of his duties as chairman of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and it is only right that on his retirement from the chairmanship of the Board, an expression of appreciation of his services should be placed on record.  Of all the men with whom I came in contact during my years as Parliamentary Secretary in charge of Fisheries, I met none so keenly interested in the welfare of the industry in general, of all branches and sections of it, and particularly in the fishermen themselves, as Mr. Mallon.  He did more than his share in all the years in which he was associated with the Board.</P>
      <P>We could not on this side of the House have been described last year as critical of this Estimate.  It was the Parliamentary Secretary's first year in office and naturally one did not expect him to perform miracles in his first year.  This is now his second Estimate and, having listened to his speeches, read his speeches, read of the various promises made and undertakings given to fishermen throughout the country, one would have expected to have had from him today, particularly in view of the reorganisation of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, comprehensive details of the Government's future policy in relation to the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to his speech this afternoon, my reaction is one of acute <Col N="923" /> disappointment.  I expected details of various schemes to be put into operation for the benefit of those engaged in the industry, whether it be catching fish, building boats, marketing and distributing fish, or anything else.  The only conclusion I can come to now is that the Government are completely bankrupt of a fishery policy and that the various speeches made by the Parliamentary Secretary can only be described as loud talk without action. Now, an ounce of action is worth a ton of talk.  I am keenly disappointed with the manner in which the industry has operated over the past 12 months. The past year was a trying one in the fishing industry.  Certain changes were made.  May I say that I believe we are not very far from a change of Government and, whatever reorganisation took place in the past, there will certainly be reorganisation by Fine Gael when there is a change of Government?</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months, the Government have sold the fishermen, hook, line and sinker, to the fish merchants and the fishmongers.  It is no harm for me now to give the fishermen a little confidence in the future; when a change of Government takes place, the fishermen around our coast will not be thrown to the mercy of the fish dealers and the fishmongers.  I believe that the vested interests in this industry are anxious to hold the fishermen in the hollow of their hand and squeeze them out of existence.  The fish dealers and fish mongers want to get fish as cheaply as possible and sell it as dear as possible.</P>
    <P>I am sorry An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have now gone out of fish marketing. In 1932, the Sea Fisheries Association was set up and a strong case was made by the fishermen then for that Association to participate in the marketing of fish, the idea being to protect the fishermen from exploitation by the vested interests in the industry.  I do not know what has taken place since that has changed the situation so far as the fishermen are concerned.  The Irish Sea Fisheries Association engaged in marketing and the fish merchants and fishmongers could not then <Col N="924" /> squeeze the fishermen out of existence.</P>
    <P>I know from experience that for many years now the fishmongers have been trying by every means in their power to put An Bord Iascaigh Mhara out of fish marketing.  It is on record in the Parliamentary Secretary's office that during the term of Deputy Dillon, when I was Parliamentary Secretary, I was approached on many occasions; the case made was that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should not be allowed to participate in the marketing of fish.  I visited many fishing ports throughout the country, notably Killybegs, Galway, Schull, Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Arklow and other areas.  In all those places, I addressed a question to the fishermen concerned. I asked, both privately and publicly, if the fishermen would like to see the Board going out of the marketing and the reply I always received was that they did not wish to be left to the mercy of the fishmongers.  I refused point blank, and would have refused in these circumstances, to allow the fishmongers to hold the fishermen as they are holding them at the present time and trying to squeeze them out of existence.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is a background, that there may be an ill-conceived and evilly-disposed background, to the manner in which An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have acted in regard to the marketing of fish to the fishmongers who are out to make big profits for themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not offer any apology in this House or outside it for saying that my sole interest when I was in charge of fisheries was to protect the livelihood of all those engaged in the fishing industry.  It was the aim of the Minister for Agriculture at the time to ensure that whatever happened in the industry, the fishermen and their families would be protected and, whatever action might be taken by any vested interest, it was our responsibility to save the fishermen from being thrown to the mercy of a small group who were out to make themselves fatter and richer while those who had to do the hard work of catching the fish grew poorer and poorer.  I want to say that I am disappointed that the <Col N="925" /> Parliamentary Secretary, in his weakness, has yielded to the appeals of the vested interest, those who are now enjoying the squeeze-out of the fishermen, those few who feel they have the fishing industry in the hollow of their hands.  I want to place it on record that as soon as the change of Government takes place, we will take the necessary steps to protect the fishermen again and to see to it that they will not be left to the mercy of these people.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what guarantee has he that as a result of the reorganisation of the Board, there will be no redundancy in staff.  I have heard from a reliable authority that it is likely that as a result of the reorganisation of the Board there may be certain staff redundancy.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give a guarantee that associated with the reorganisation envisaged in the White Paper that has been issued there will be no redundancy whatever.</P>
    <P>No doubt, the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that the fishing industry has received a great deal of lip sympathy time and again.  It is time now that the industry should be tackled bravely and courageously. There should be no question of tinkering with it.  The time has come when substantial sums of money should be voted by this House to put the industry on a sound basis.  It is extremely difficult to understand why it is that in this island country that has some of the best fisheries in the world around its coast, where French, Spanish and other foreign trawlers come to fish practically on our doorstep, the industry has not been put on a sound basis so far.  Recent statistics show that there are fewer persons engaged in the fishing industry now than previously.  The aim of the Government should be to increase the number employed in the fishing industry.  Government policy has not been directed to that end.  There has not been encouragement.  The fishermen do not seem to derive sufficient profit from their labour.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Lands have appealed <Col N="926" /> to young men to participate in the Government's scheme for the training of skippers and in the management and control of boats.  The response has been so poor that the Parliamentary Secretary has made a further appeal here to-day.</P>
    <P>There is large-scale emigration from the west and from the areas near the Cork coast.  Yet young people are not offering to take part in the Government's scheme of training and do not seem eager to participate in the fishing industry.  Did the Parliamentary Secretary ever ask himself why?  The reason is that they do not see any future in it.  They do not see a profit in it.  A man is attracted to an occupation by the reward he will get in it.</P>
    <P>An effort should be made to secure greater employment in the fishing industry.  The policy of our Party has been made known in that respect in the last general election and since then. We propose to expand and to develop the fishing industry on the basis of the boat-owning fisherman on the coast. If that is not done, the fishing industry will cease to exist.  We must ensure that the boat-owning fisherman, on whom the industry depends, receives a margin of profit for his work and has a market for his catch.  In addition, in areas such as Dunmore East and Killybegs, an effort should be made to encourage fishermen to supply fish for processing into fishmeal as well as for marketing.</P>
    <P>Our policy is to provide credit facilities for boats and gear.  They will be made available for the further expansion and development of the industry.  I am not at all surprised that the policy of the Board and the Government in relation to credit facilities for boats and gear is not meeting with the measure of success one would wish for.  Additional financial assistance should be given, and it is about time, now that the Board has been reorganised, some consideration were given to that aspect.</P>
    <P>Our policy is also to press forward on research into the marketing and processing of fish, in consultation with the fishermen.  I should like to hear very clearly from the Parliamentary Secretary if, when the Board was being reorganised, and when Bord Iascaigh <Col N="927" /> Mhara was going out of the marketing of fish, and handing it over to the fishmongers, the fishermen were consulted, and if they were satisfied to be left at the mercy of those people, to be treated as they saw fit.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our policy is to provide up-to-date and safe anchorage and landing facilities.  That has not been done, despite the fact that the Minister for Lands and Parliamentary Secretary were very loud in undertakings to provide safe anchorages for our fishermen all over the country.  I am sorry Deputy Corry is not here.  He was very loud, when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, in his demands for an extension of the pier at Ballycotton.  He could not understand a 24-hour delay in 1954.  This is 1963, and not one inch has been added to the pier at Ballycotton, despite the fact that Deputy Corry and the Cork County Council urged that the pier should be extended to provide safe anchorage for the fishermen.</P>
    <P>I understand that safe anchorage is essential in order that the fishermen may know that when bad, stormy weather comes their boats and gear will be safe.  It is very depressing to see, as we have seen time and again at Glengad and elsewhere, fishermen's boats smashed against the piers in rough seas and bad weather.  It is the duty of the Government to provide harbour facilities and safe anchorage in areas where groups of fishermen are entirely dependent for their livelihood on their catches, and where they are anxious to remain in the industry.  The Government are embarking on the provision of four extensive fishery harbours.  We wish them luck, but does that mean that, with the exception of the four centres which have been recommended for conversion into major fishery stations, others piers and fishing ports are to be neglected?</P>
    <P>A certain amount of work has been carried out at Skerries, Arklow, Kilmore Quay and Kinsale.  There are a number of areas on the Mayo coast such as Murrisk, Blacksod, Foulmore and other districts for which a sound case was put forward to the Fishery Division and the Office of Public <Col N="928" /> Works, backed up with local knowledge that the work could be carried out economically.  I fail to see that any provision has been made in that regard.  Some work was carried out at Clogherhead about 12 months ago. I cannot say to what extent, because I have not seen it since.  Clogherhead is one area in which a major scheme should certainly have been undertaken to provide safe anchorage and better facilities for the fishermen.  I am glad a start was made, and I hope to call there within the next month or five weeks to see the work undertaken during the past year.</P>
    <P>I cannot say whether the Parliamentary Secretary has ever been to Kilkeel, County Down.  The wonderful harbour facilities which are there for the fishermen should be provided in most areas around our coast.  With the exception of Killybegs, Galway and Dingle, very few places can be compared with Kilkeel.  For that reason, I hope the Fishery Division will get in touch with the Office of Public Works and endeavour to provide safe anchorage for all our fishermen.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a duplication of work as between the Office of Public Works and the Fishery Division.  One Department should be responsible for the improvement, extension and reconstruction of fishery harbours.  The money should be provided and expended when the engineering reports are made available.  There is very little use in providing safe anchorage and piers for fishermen when the fishing industry is extinct in an area and the fishermen are gone.  I want to express my disappointment that there has not been a greater degree of expenditure on our piers and on safe anchorage facilities.</P>
    <P>Our policy proposes to meet the needs of a progressive fishing industry, and we will endeavour to expand the boat building industry.  The Parliamentary Secretary made little or no reference to the extension of that industry.  A very strong case was made for the extension of that boatyard at Dingle.  I raised it on this Estimate last year.  I presume that in the course of its reorganisation the Board took <Col N="929" /> no action during the year, but I should like to hear whether it is proposed to extend the boatyard in Dingle.</P>
    <P>Again, I understand there are fewer people employed in Baltimore.  The Parliamentary Secretary will recall that there was an occasion during the term of office of a Fianna Fáil Government when the boatbuilding industry at Meevagh was completely closed down.  It was opened by Deputy Dillon.  I should like to know how many workers are employed on boatbuilding.  Boatbuilding has been undertaken in Arklow by private enterprise, by the firm of Messrs. Tyrrell who have been known for generations in boatbuilding, and whose boats are recognised throughout the world as the best.  Apart from those employed by Messrs.  Tyrrell, I should like to know how many people are employed in boatbuilding at Baltimore, Killybegs, Meevagh and Dingle, how the figure compares with the past five years, and what orders are in hand.  Are apprentices being taken on? The boatbuilding industry is very important. For that reason an effort should be made to guarantee employment, to encourage boatbuilding and not allow the craft to die out.  In cases where there is room for expansion, it should be carried out.</P>
    <P>In regard to inland fisheries, I should like to express appreciation of the wonderful work being done by the Inland Fisheries Trust.  The Trust deserve the highest praise for their wonderful achievements.  Every angler in the country should be a member of that organisation.  Our fisheries are a great tourist attraction and when we see that private planes are chartered over here by fishermen from England and elsewhere who come to spend weekends or weeks fishing here, I believe it is the Inland Fisheries Trust who deserve the credit for that.  I hope the excellent work they are doing will continue.  It is no harm on every Fisheries Estimate to give the little reminder of the fact that the Inland Fisheries Trust was established by Deputy Dillon when Minister for Agriculture. At that time, Deputy Dillon foresaw the wonderful advantage such <Col N="930" /> a body could be in the building up of our inland fisheries as a great tourist attraction.  We are glad to see they have been successful in doing that and hope they will have an even greater measure of success in the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary if there has been any progress made in recent months in regard to the extension of our fishery limits.  I understand that a conference&mdash;I do not know whether it has taken place or is to take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and that international agreement will be sought. Naturally enough, international agreement will be necessary if the limits are to be respected.  I hope the Department will bear in mind the need for an early and favourable decision in regard to the good case which has been made by our fishermen and others for an extension of our fishery limits.</P>
      <P>I notice again that the Parliamentary Secretary refers to the grants made available to boards of conservators for protection purposes, and again he refers to the Salmon Conservancy Fund.  I know very well that boards of conservators require money in order to have proper protection for our fisheries.  I was expecting again to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what scheme he had in mind for the general improvement in the staffs of boards of conservators.  Has there been any progress in recent months in regard to the provision of employment? Will water bailiffs be employed full-time with pension rights or how is it proposed to provide a good and proper service in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied, as the Parliamentary Secretary appears to be, that the full amount of the Salmon Conservancy Fund is going to boards of conservators for protection purposes. My opinion is that this levy which has been imposed on those whose incomes have been very limited is an effort to relieve the Exchequer rather than to provide protective services for our salmon fisheries or inland fisheries. It was a bad move and one which has certainly imposed an added burden <Col N="931" /> on the fishermen whose incomes are already very limited.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything further beyond expressing my disappointment that the Parliamentary Secretary appears to talk very loudly outside this House, in the country, in regard to these proposals for what he describes as the revival of the fishing industry.  He has spoken at dinners and other functions and on Telefís Éireann, as he did on 6th November last, and may I say it was not to his credit that he availed of the opportunity to express an opinion on &ldquo;Newsview&rdquo; which should not have been expressed. If such an opportunity is to be taken again, where questions are addressed to the Parliamentary Secretary, they ought not to be designed for political purposes.  If they are solely to be related to the interests of the fishing industry, the questions should be addressed to those directly concerned with the fishing industry.  The questions addressed to the Parliamentary Secretary on that occasion were rightly criticised and described as a disturbing trend in &ldquo;Newsview&rdquo;.  Talks of that kind are not very helpful.  I express the hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will make an effort within the next few months to implement some of the undertakings and the promises he has been making to fishermen outside the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bewildered by the activities of the Parliamentary Secretary. I often wonder should we ask him is he Parliamentary Secretary for fisheries or for fishmongers.  When I was Minister in charge of fisheries and Deputy Flanagan was Parliamentary Secretary, we made no concealment of the fact, and made no apology for it, that we regarded ourselves as custodians of the interests of the fishermen on our coasts.  I was never a believer in high protection and I never made any concealment of that but I justified protection of fisheries because it has not only an economic but a social purpose and because it is desirable to keep intact the social fabric of the fishing community of the western, northern and southern coasts of this <Col N="932" /> country and the mixed social pattern of the farmer-fisherman in these areas.</P>
      <P>To that end, I was prepared to ask the fish consumer of this country to pay a marginal extra price for fish but always remembering the fish we got in Ireland owing to the pattern of our fishing industry, was fresh fish.  It was not fish that was caught on the way out to the trawler grounds, kept in ice for maybe a fortnight or three weeks and then discharged when a trawler returned to Grimsby or some other British port after being anything from 14 to 21 days at sea.  While admittedly our fish was dearer than it was in Great Britain, it was superior in quality and was providing a livelihood for a large section of our community who had no alternative means of existence.</P>
      <P>A part of that general scheme involved an undertaking on the part of the Government, which was implementing it through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, that we would provide a guaranteed market for all white fish landed by our fishermen; that the markets would be operated primarily to ensure that their total catch would be taken when it was landed and that they would get a fair deal; and that the bulk of the ultimate retail price payable by the consumer would go to the people who caught the fish and not to the middlemen.</P>
      <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara purchased all the fish, distributed it through the wholesalers.  During times of periodic scarcity, as a result of bad weather or something of that kind, if there was a temporary shortage of fish on the Irish market, the Board was the sole importing agent.  From time to time An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, acting under that warrant, brought in fish to fill a temporary shortage on the Irish market and made substantial profits on the transactions, but we insisted that every penny of profit derived from such casual transactions would be put in a fund and used for purposes beneficial to the fishermen and the fishing industry.  It was called the Fishery Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of these casual profits made on the importation of fish went to the personal profit of anybody associated <Col N="933" /> with the industry.  As far as I know, all that has now been swept aside and we are involved in a kaleidoscopic change of schemes for marketing fish, the main result of which as far as I can see is that the fishmongers can do pretty well as they like and the fishermen have to get along as best they can.</P>
    <P>I notice in the course of the Parliamentary Secretary's statistical material the following astonishing boast:</P>
    <P>In 1962 landings of demersal or white fish increased by over 17,000 cwt. to 230,000 cwt. and their value rose by £46,000 to £867,000. Whiting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>anybody in this Chamber who is familiar with the manner and customs of the Irish fishing industry smiles when he hears mention of whiting&mdash;</P>
    <P>was the most important species in both quantity and value.  Indeed the quantity of whiting was almost as high as that of all other demersal species together.</P>
    <P>You are telling me! That was one of the chronic problems with which we had to deal perennially, that there were certain elements among the fishermen who, when the whiting began to act like pelagic fish, as they do from time to time, sailed out a few hundred yards from the shore and scooped up these fish and then dumped them on top of us and flooded the market when there might be a material shortage of prime fish which they would not bother to go out to get. I would be interested to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what, in his judgment, was the effect of the landing of these massive quantities of whiting. In fact, so difficult a problem was that when I was in office that it was the only form of demersal fish which we were prepared to say we would not accept on a guaranteed price basis at all times.  When they tried to bring in excessive quantities of whiting by the device I have described, we used to sell it on the open market and they had to take what they got for it.</P>
    <P>That is the remedy which operated to bring that highly undesirable practice under reasonable control.  I do <Col N="934" /> not know why the Parliamentary Secretary is so pleased with this increase and I should be glad to know how he got rid of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be captious but does the Parliamentary Secretary not think it silly to be producing statistics in which he says that the landings of demersal or white fish increased by over 17,000 cwt to 230,000 cwt and the value rose by £46,000 to £867,000 and then when I am investigating the matter, tells us that it was landings of whiting the transport of which he had to subsidise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only the surplus.  We are only talking about the surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Really the Parliamentary Secretary ought not to be cod-acting in that way.  It is just cod. It is a particularly undesirable cod because it is not edible cod.  It is just &ldquo;cod&rdquo; cod.  The real truth of it is that the Parliamentary Secretary through his own folly is promoting a fishery practice which is notoriously undesirable, that is, to go and rake in shoals of whiting which are acting like pelagic fish and flooding the market and creating the problem of subsidising their transport to fishmeal factories.</P>
      <P>I would sympathise with the Parliamentary Secretary if he had said that this practice had reasserted itself and caused some embarrassment but when he proceeds to boast about it and when it emerges that he had to subsidise their transport in order to get rid of them in the form of fishmeal, then it is not only cod but &ldquo;cod&rdquo; cod. It is good enough for the dinners and dogfights he goes to because there is nobody there to answer him but he should not get up here and try to get away with what is good enough for the meals Fianna Fáil are always anxious to consume.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If instead of statistics of that character we were given any clear picture of what the marketing procedures are now, or what they are <Col N="935" /> to be in the future, I would appreciate it very much more.</P>
      <P>I notice for the first time that the Minister gives us no statistical information about the payments on boats. We all know there has been difficulty in the past with regard to the payments of instalments on boats.  I think we brought that substantially under control by a system which was generally acceptable to the fishermen and that was the percentage deductions by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara from the fisherman's catch in reduction of his loan on the boat.  In my experience that worked well and it was a system which was operated in a humane and sensible way by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  If a fisherman ran into a slack period, nobody took him by the throat.  They were prepared to waive the instalment but now this crazy idea of abolishing this whole system of a centralised market which had operated was introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary and we found that instalments fell very much into arrears.  I do not know what the position is now.  We had to write off some large sum which was irrecoverable. I do not know what the current position is, but the Parliamentary Secretary should have told us how the repayments on boats were running and whether they are being kept up to date regularly.</P>
      <P>In regard to the <i>Programme of Sea Fisheries Development</i>, the Parliamentary Secretary states:</P>
      <P>The Board's policy as a development body is to unify all sections of the industry into a cohesive force geared for expansion at all levels. </P>
      <P>That means &ldquo;sweet Fanny Adams&rdquo; to me&mdash;it is just talk.  It means nothing at all.  I should be much more eager to hear what precisely the Board intend to do.  If it is their intention to bring in larger quantities of whiting for conversion into fishmeal, then all I can say is that the fruits of their activities do not speak very highly for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as making an attack on An Bord Iascaigh Mhara under its new chairman, and so on.  I should be very glad to see it succeed.  I do not know the new chairman; I <Col N="936" /> have never met him and I do not know his qualifications for the position. Whoever or whatever he is, I should be delighted to see him make a good job of whatever he puts his hand to.  However, I should like to see some evidence other than pious hopes and statistics which, on examination, prove to be highly illusory and which I do not think get us anywhere at all.</P>
    <P>I note with interest that 30 boys trained under this scheme set out here for training fishermen are now working as crew members and that 35 more are undergoing training at present. What percentage of the trainees does that represent?  Do the 30 boys represent the entire number of fellows who did the training?  Have some dropped out?  What percentage have we retained?</P>

      <P>I have nothing but congratulations for the Parliamentary Secretary; we shall have to watch to see how that succeeds.  I understand some of the boys come from fishing families and others from a different background altogether.  That is all to the good if it works out.</P>
      <P>I do not want to depart from this Sea Fisheries business without emphasising that I am not at all satisfied with the marketing arrangements at present available.  I do not fully understand them.  I gather the old system which we operated has disappeared. I find no evidence that there is in existence at present a marketing system which makes adequate provision for the due protection of the fishermen's interest and for the reasonable collection of the instalments that fall due on the boats so as to keep the fishermen up to date and secure in their ownership of their own boats.</P>
      <P>I come now to Inland Fisheries. That amply justified itself.  I want to say a word about the salmon conservancy fund.  That is simply a silly Fianna Fáil gimmick to collect an insignificant intake for the treasury. The yield of the salmon levy goes into the salmon conservancy fund.  I do not know if the Minister says anywhere what the salmon levy yielded last year but it is simply a tax on men who fish for salmon.</P>
      <P>When you speak of a man fishing for salmon a great many people think of a man in knickerbockers and a deerstalker cap fishing with a rod on an expensive preserve of water.  Of course, these are not the people who export the salmon.  It is true that there are some wealthy proprietors of estuarine fisheries who export salmon. I am thinking of the fishermen in Teelin and such places in their boats paying a substantial licence to catch salmon off the seacoast outside the estuaries of these rivers and making their living by selling them.  To me, it is a regrettable concept that they should have levied upon them a tax for export.  They are the only export known to our trade which is taxed at the point of export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> Think of wealthy manufacturers being solemnly exempted from all income tax and all corporation profits tax on any trade they do by way of export and then think of a Teelin fisherman with 20 or 30 salmon to send out and being blandly informed that he must pay so much on every pound of salmon he exports.  It is all done out of vicious political spite.  We had taken it off; Fianna Fáil put it on; we took it off and it is clapped on again.  It represents a trifling amount collected to the Exchequer and it is issued out again as a grant to the salmon conservancy fund.</P>
    <P>Every standard of decency, equality and justice demands that that export levy on salmon should be abolished.  It cannot be justified by any canon of decent administration.  It is a public scandal, and every Deputy knows it to be so, that there should be one solitary export from this country bearing a tax at a time when all other exports are declared to be free of income tax and corporation profits tax.  That shameful anachronism should be put an end to.</P>
    <P>I notice that the provision this year for the Inland Fisheries Trust is £75,000 which, the Parliamentary Secretary says, represents an advance of £12,000 on last year.  I think I am right in saying that that offsets&mdash;does it not&mdash;a contribution by Bord Fáilte towards the work of the Inland Fisheries Trust?</P>

      <P>I am glad.  I wonder if it is sufficient.  I do not complain. Here, the Parliamentary Secretary says we cannot do everything at once; that we must marshal our resources and proceed from year to year in steady progress.  When we bear in mind that he estimates that the income from angling tourism this year will amount to £1,346,000, we begin to ask ourselves whether, perhaps, if we made a little more money available&mdash;a few thousand pounds&mdash;for the next few years&mdash;if we made that grant £100,000 for the next five years&mdash;we might make very valuable progress in stimulating a tourist attraction which would continue to grow.</P>

      <P>I gather there is some delay in work the Inland Fisheries Trust would like to undertake owing to scarcity of money.  I agree we must do things in steps but where a very valuable tourist amenity is ready to our hands, the Parliamentary Secretary would be justified in impressing on the Government that the grant to the Inland Fisheries Trust could, with advantage, be increased from the proposed figure of £75,000 to £100,000 a year, certainly over a five year period, to see how they get on.</P>
      <P>That brings me to a topic on which I have often spoken but to which I want to return with emphasis because of the dinners and dog-fights at which the Minister for Transport and Power has recently been functioning.  He is always ready to give anybody a lecture on any subject in the world except transport.  He will talk about cooking, about wines or about housekeeping, any topic in the encyclopaedia, apart from transport and power to which he seems to be allergic.  He is always flirting with the idea of filling up the canals.  He is either going to park motor cars on them or ride bicycles on them. He always has some charming idea about them except to leave the water in them.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he has a vital interest in the canals and should keep a vigilant eye on the Minister for Transport and Power who suffers from this passion for wrecking the canals because if they are blocked anywhere, they are blocked everywhere.  There is a very grave danger that some daft idea will enter the head of the Minister for Transport and Power and before we have time to get him under control again, he will have blocked the canal. Then we shall be told that nothing can be done about it and that the best thing is to fill it up from whatever point he has blocked it right up to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems utterly insane to me. <Col N="940" /> Canals are very useful from the amenity point of view in themselves. In addition, they are an incalculable asset as a tourist attraction to a type of tourist for whom this country is admirably fitted to cater and who is readily accessible in the midlands and north of England and who will come here to fish for coarse fish in the canals.  They will be brought into a part of the country which otherwise gets little or no share of the tourist traffic.  The sea coasts get their share, like the scenic areas around the Gaeltacht, but the midlands, owing to our geographical structure, have relatively little to attract tourists except this exceptional asset of the coarse fishing.</P>
    <P>Anybody with experience of a county like Monaghan realises the revolution coarse fishing has wrought there where there was little or no tourist traffic and a corresponding dearth of hotel accommodation.  Now, I think it is true that Monaghan town, Clones, Castleblayney, Ballybay and Carrickmacross, all have quite a substantial tourist income stretching from February practically to November. The pike fishers turn up in February. It is hard for those not accustomed to the ways of fishermen to imagine anybody desiring to fish in February but they do, and these waters are rich in coarse fish and the fishermen stay in public houses, small hotels and guest-houses that would otherwise get no business of this kind.</P>
    <P>Monaghan is fortunate in having a very large number of small lakes rich in coarse fish.  Prudently and sensibly, they divided up the lakes, some for trout and some for coarse fish and preserved them accordingly.  There are wide areas in the midlands with no lakes and usually where you have lakes, they are trout lakes and it is only right to develop them for that purpose.  There are such lakes around Mullingar and Cavan is famous for the mayfly fishing.  Naturally, the tendency there is to depress coarse fish as far as possible, to protect game fishing, but flowing all through the country, from here to Carrick-on-Shannon and from here also south to Banagher, we have the canals.  If they <Col N="941" /> are developed for coarse fishing, we have the additional advantage that there is a towpath all along the banks on both sides.  That makes them very agreeable places for coarse fishing. The fishermen do not have to climb over barbed wire fences and other obstructions to do a day's fishing.</P>
    <P>The canals extend for miles through most agreeable country and for that reason I believe they are a very precious asset and should engage the constant and vigilant care of the Parliamentary Secretary and the tourist administration.  If they do not, as sure as we are in this House, if the &ldquo;Empress of China&rdquo; is let loose upon them, they will be closed up one of these days and we shall be told that some obscure purpose is served by that procedure.  Then it will be too late to do anything.</P>
    <P>Does it strike anybody else as odd that we cannot make any use of the canals for transport?  I am not asking that the Parliamentary Secretary be made responsible here for transport.  I am fighting for the canals as a tourist amenity and as a fishing centre.  Public business recently brought me repeatedly to Strasbourg which is on the Rhine and which is much larger, of course, than a canal.  But the amount of traffic passing up and down there is quite dramatic and seeing, as you travel along the Rhine the number of canals that find their way into it, you realise that these are regarded as almost main arteries of traffic all over the Continent.  It makes me wonder why in this country canal traffic seems to be utterly unthinkable.  However, it would be trespassing, perhaps, too much on the patience of the Chair to pursue that reflection at present because we are dealing with the fishery aspect of canals but it would strengthen the hand of the Parliamentary Secretary if some use were made of canals other than fishery which I am advocating.  While it may be true that because of the short distances we have to travel in this country, the canals may not be as useful as on the Continent for bulk transport, one wonders when you hear of people boating on the broads of Norfolk and spending that kind of holiday there, <Col N="942" /> would it not be possible to develop an analagous holiday attraction in this country?</P>
    <P>Before we started developing coarse fishing here, there was a tendency to regard anybody who advocated it as being a bit eccentric.  The idea of offering as a tourist attraction the opportunity of fishing with a worm was regarded as quite peculiar, but those of us who represent counties that have benefited from this amenity realise only too well how wise we were to encourage it.  I sometimes wonder, if energetic measures were taken to expand the boating facilities of the Shannon and the canals, whether there might not be some very substantial direct benefit to be derived from it.</P>
    <P>I was never in Killaloe in my life until about a year ago.  It is not until you get there you realise what a beautiful place it is.  I saw a whole lot of young people water-skiing in Killaloe.  You cannot help wondering, when you come by chance on such an attraction as that, whether we are unconscious of the things we have to offer to strangers.  I came on it as a stranger.  If I had come on it on the continent, I would have sent home a coloured postcard to describe its beauty.  Recently I was in Cyprus. There is beautiful embroidery to be bought there in Paphos, but if you ask anybody there to sell you Paphos embroidery, they look at you as if you were a kind of half lunatic.  They say they have beautiful materials there&mdash; manifestly deriving from Birmingham, Paris or Germany&mdash;but they brush to one side the Paphos embroidery.  I bought all of it I could.  In Dublin, it looks like a dream; in Cyprus, it looks like a duster.  I sometimes wonder if some of the things we have in Ireland, which look to us quite pedestrian, could not be made to appear to strangers something similar to what Paphos embroidery appeared to me.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is pressing the interests of the canals and the Shannon right down to Killaloe, he has something there that could be of great benefit to his own constituency.  I can see him as a knight in shining armour addressing <Col N="943" /> meetings in Athlone describing how he salvaged the Shannon.  I offer him that as a general election parable.</P>

      <P>Has it?  I shall guarantee this.  If he will adopt that war-cry, I shall commend him&mdash;for some responsible post outside politics! I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for having regard to certain problems in relation to the title of fishing waters where there were title difficulties involved in their comprehensive development.  What he suggests is, on the whole, a reasonable approach to the situation.  I gather from the terms in which he makes the suggestion that, if any unforeseen problems arise, <i>ad hoc</i> proposals can be devised to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to deal with the general problem of poaching, but here I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to use with Draconian severity the powers he got in the last Fisheries Act to control the buyers of illegal salmon.  If there is no buyer for illegally caught fish, there will be very few fish caught illegally.  I do not want to make any reckless affirmation, but I always maintained when I was Minister for Fisheries&mdash;and I think Deputy Oliver Flanagan agreed with me&mdash;that the man who fished by legitimate methods with rod and line was never really any serious enemy of the public interest.  He might be a trespasser on another's property, but I, as Minister for Fisheries, never felt I was very seriously involved in controlling the activities of a man who was fishing by legitimate methods on another's restricted fishery.  It was for the owner of the fishery to have regard to the processes of the civil law to defend his property and sue the offender for trespass, if he was in fact guilty of it. But I had an altogether different approach to either the fishery owner or trespasser who sought to destroy a fishery for his own private profit by the use of illegal methods.  It is not only poachers whom I found capable of activities of that kind.  On more than one occasion I found the proprietor of <Col N="944" /> a valuable fishery seeking to exploit it by illegal methods.  On one occasion I well remember such a person approaching me to stay proceedings and telling me it was unthinkable that this could have happened.  My reply was that, if that were so, he could very easily satisfy the court to that effect, but in the meantime he should let justice be done.  I do not think he did satisfy the court subsequently.</P>
    <P>There should be no mercy shown to persons who use illegal methods to catch fish.  Far more evil, in my opinion is the person who buys the illegally caught fish.  In my judgment &mdash;and I have some experience of it&mdash; 90 per cent of the illegally caught fish is purchased by people who know it is illegally caught.  Hotel-keepers of considerable standing have been detected in practices of that kind.  That is the place to hit.  That is the place that can be reached.  Decent hotel-keepers do not do it.  But the position is made far more difficult for those who abide by the law and pay the price for legally caught salmon because of the necessity for them to compete with hotels trading in illegally caught salmon.  Those dealing in illegally caught salmon ought to be severely punished.</P>
    <P>I see the Parliamentary Secretary is becoming rather uneasy.  I do not blame him.  If he can get in now, he is very welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House I shall not delay the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am glad the scheme for the buying of boats has been extended to boats of all sizes.  It was wrong to have it confined to the larger type of boat costing £13,000 or £14,000.  I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the silting of our small harbours. The bigger harbours have been mentioned, but the smaller harbours are silting up more than three-quarters way.  Some time ago, I was brought by the owner of a Bord Iascaigh Mhara boat to Clifden harbour.  He showed me where he was trying to anchor his boat. When the tide is in, it is all right; but when the tide goes out the side of the pier is silted up.  If he does not put a <Col N="945" /> chain or a rope on the boat, she falls over on her side.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should examine all the piers at which boats arrive to land fish, particularly Bord Iascaigh Mhara boats.  I should like to know also, either by way of reply when the Parliamentary Secretary is concluding or in written form, whether fees are paid by Bord Iascaigh Mhara boats at piers supervised by harbour masters.  If that is so, it should be discontinued.  Some of these small fishing vessels cost £4,000 or £5,000 and they should be allowed to come into piers, unload their catches and either pull out again or stay overnight without being charged fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the constructive contributions by Deputies who spoke.  Indeed, one particular aspect that struck me forcibly was the anxiety of all Deputies to ensure that we improve our fisheries, both sea and inland.  In any comment I make in which I disagree with views expressed on the promotion of that ideal by Deputies on the opposite side, I hope I will not be taken in any sense as being in conflict with the principle.</P>
      <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan, in particular, made a great point of the fact that fishermen were in some way being let down by the policy pursued by us since the initiation of the programme of sea fisheries expansion in April of last year.  The facts since then do not bear out his contention.  In fact, as I pointed out in my opening statement, the value of landings of sea fish in the year ended 31st March last, rose by ten per cent compared with the corresponding period of the previous year, and the value of exports of fish and fish products increased in the same year by 36 per cent to a record figure of over £1,600,000. These cold facts show that the programme of expansion which has been initiated in regard to fisheries, both inland and sea, has had very real success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole purpose of the reorganisation of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is further to increase the catching power of the industry so that the figure for landings will increase progressively in the years ahead.  This means of course, that while increasing the catching power <Col N="946" /> of the industry, we must raise the incomes of the individual fisherman so as to provide attraction for them as well as to encourage new recruits into the industry.  That aim is being pursued in a very practical way.  The number of boats issued by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the past 12 months increased by 16.  The boatyards Deputy O.J. Flanagan spoke of are maintained for the work of building boats of various sizes for the different branches of the industry.  There has been no diminution of effort in that respect.</P>
    <P>The whole emphasis of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara work is on further assisting fishermen to increase their catching technique, to seek out new fishing grounds for them, to provide an advisory service analagous to the agricultural advisory services for farmers.  A special division has been established in An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to provide for regional advisory officers located around the coast and in a position to keep fishermen aware of up-to-date techniques and to advise them generally on how best to go about the catching and the selling of their fish.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in my opening statement one practical example of success already achieved&mdash;the port of Dingle where An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have transferred their premises to a co-operative society financed by local fishermen.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have seconded their staff there to the co-operative society and the fishermen in that port are now handling and distributing their own fish, not on the basis of sending it to Dublin and getting it back for regional distribution, but on a completely local regional basis.  We hope, and indeed it will be the major endeavour of the advisory officials appointed to various locations around the coast, to encourage that sort of development at many other ports around the coast.  If we can organise co-operative marketing in that way, where the fishermen will participate in the sale of their fish and in the profits therefrom, that system must appeal as being a positive approach towards some of the problems mentioned by Deputy O.J. Flanagan and Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>In addition to all that, An Bord <Col N="947" /> Iascaigh Mhara are also concerned with market development, with developing our inland markets through assistance to retailers to present fish properly by way of promotion work, and also by way of building their exports by giving them advice on how best they can export fish to the various markets abroad.  I might say there is no great problem in regard to selling our fish abroad at the present time. There is a buoyant world market for fish and fish products and that shows every sign of continuing.</P>
    <P>The Board's main concern, and the concern of the various private firms engaged in export, is that our fish, when exported, is of top quality so that Irish fish will be universally recognised as of high quality, whether in natural or processed forms.  I am confident that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Fisheries Division, through the various schemes I mentioned in my opening statement, can ensure that in future there will be an increasing volume of landings, matched by an increasing volume of sales, both on the home market and on the export market.  That is the object we have set the Board.  As I have pointed out, we have reorganised the Board, appointed a wholetime working chairman, and I am confident that the work will be carried out.</P>
    <P>On the inland side of the industry, there again the figures show that very real progress has been made.  Last year, the estimated income from angling tourism rose by 12 per cent. That has been due to the co-ordinated efforts of the Inland Fisheries Trust on the development side, and of Bord Fáilte on the promotional side.  This will ensure that the promotional work is properly handled and I agree fully with Deputy Dillon that there is tremendous scope for the industry in this direction.  Angling is an attraction which we have and other countries do not have.  For that very reason, this work is bound to continue to prosper and our rising national income from this source will continue.</P>
    <P>I have every reason for confidence that the trend which has shown itself in recent years will continue and that, <Col N="948" /> through the work of the organisations I have mentioned, we will ensure that both in the development and in the promotional sense, there will be a vast co-ordinated effort to attract more and more people here to avail of the marvellous resources given to us by nature.</P>
    <P>Question, &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration,&rdquo; put and declared lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I asked the Minister for Justice today:</P>
      <P>If he has received a complaint concerning a recent class 1B police duty examination; if he has investigated the matter; and, if so, with what result.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>I received an anonymous complaint in relation to the matter in question at the same time as I received notice of this parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to pay heed to anonymous complaints but, in this instance, because of the publicity given to the complaint by this parliamentary question, I have had the matter investigated by the Commissioner and he has informed me that while his investigations have not been fully completed all the indications go to show that there is no foundation whatsoever for the complaint. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully realise that we have in this country the finest police force in the world.  There is probably no city in the world in which the police rank so highly in quality, integrity, honesty and decency.  I raise this question now because that standard has been disturbed.  I cannot understand why the Minister has not heard before this of the disturbed feeling there is, particularly in the DMD.  I hope now to enlighten the Minister fully on the facts, though I feel the Minister must have some information, conveyed either directly or indirectly to him, in <Col N="949" /> regard to this matter.  The position is well known to the members of the Force.  A superintendent was one of the examiners.  His name has been furnished to the Minister.  I am prepared to give the Minister outside of this debate whatever information is at my disposal.  I will give him all the assistance I can.  It would not be fair to give that information now because the Minister has told us the Commissioner has not completed his investigations.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which stinks in the nostrils of all decent members of the Garda.  A superintendent, an examiner, hands out examination papers prior to the examination with instructions to a detective-sergeant attached to Mountjoy Station; in turn, the detective-sergeant hands the papers to his own friends competing in the examination.  That is not the worst aspect.  There were 100 per cent passes on the part of those who got the examination papers from the detective-sergeant in Mountjoy Station.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter.  It is liable to create very wide suspicion and a great degree of distress amongst honourable men in the Force.  I should like the Minister to give a guarantee here in public that any members who come forward to give information will not be victimised.  The reason the Minister received a letter without a signature is that it is known from past experience that members who volunteer information against senior officers, such as the superintendent who was conducting this examination, find themselves subsequently victimised.  Married men with families and homes in Dublin will not come forward and give information because they fear they may later be demoted, transferred, or prevented from being promoted because they will not be recommended by their superior officers.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give a guarantee to this House that any man who comes forward to give information will not be victimised and will be treated with all proper respect?  The Minister knows there are at least four instances in which Garda officers did their duty and were subsequently <Col N="950" /> victimised.  If men come forward now, will the Minister guarantee they will not be blacklisted?  I want a guarantee then against that.</P>
    <P>This is something that must stop.  It is something rotten which must not be allowed to continue.  Surely the Minister appreciates that it is wrong and dishonourable for an examiner to give anybody the examination papers prior to the actual examination?  I should like to know how many papers were printed for this particular examination. Into whose hands did they go?</P>
    <P>The Minister has the name of the detective-sergeant who handed out these papers to his friends.  Is it not a fact that when the superintendent gave them to the detective-sergeant, he said: &ldquo;You know your friends.&rdquo; They all passed because they knew what they would be asked.  That is not fair to those who were not on friendly terms with the detective-sergeant.  The action on the part of the superintendent was a dishonourable one.  He should not be allowed to sit on future examinations. The fact that the Commissioner has seen fit to make inquiries and that those inquiries are not yet completed gives ground for grave suspicion.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to cancel that examination.  I should also like to know from the Minister what information he has from the Commissioner as to any check on these papers.  How is it in the power of one of the examiners to have the papers in advance?  Why should he give them to a detective-sergeant? Was it the duty of the detective-sergeant to select his friends? This matter is the talk of the DMD. Not alone is it the talk of the entire Force but it is the topic of conversation in high places&mdash;at meetings.  It was discussed recently at a well-known golf club where a number of senior Garda officers were present, who looked upon this with the greatest possible suspicion and thought it wrong that it should have taken place.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, these examinations should be conducted in strict confidence. Naturally enough, we are told that the results of examinations, particularly in the Garda Force, are to be strictly in accordance with merit.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister regard a <Col N="951" /> situation of this character in which a Class 1B police duty examination is held and those who are sitting for the examination already know what they will be asked and the paper that is set for them?  Does the Minister think it is right or honourable, or does he think you could have a contented Garda Force if you have men at the top who are prepared to see that their own friends are given the plums of the Force, whether they are entitled to them or not?</P>
    <P>I respectfully submit that this examination has a bad smell, that the big percentage of those who have passed it and who had got the papers in advance from the detective-sergeant in Mountjoy Station have passed this examination unfairly and in unfair competition with those who did not get the examination papers in advance.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter, certainly not with the intention of embarrassing the Minister, but in the interest of the good name of the Force.  Everybody in this country knows that the Force is to protect life and property and that the Guards are the friends of the people. We want to create the atmosphere that the Guards are the friends of the people but we do not want to see a small clique in the Force victimising the greater section of the Force for any reason.</P>
    <P>It is such work, underhand, deceitful and victimising, that is responsible for undermining the good name of the Force and for reducing its standards considerably.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give the House whatever information he has at his disposal in relation to this matter so as to relieve the minds of many men in the Force who are very much concerned? I do not know what investigations the Commissioner is still carrying on but I notice from the Minister's reply that inquiries have not been fully completed.  I understand from that that there are other inquiries to take place.  The Minister cannot anticipate what decision the Commissioner will come to in relation to the matter.  It may be rather unfair to the Commissioner that this matter <Col N="952" /> is raised in the House before he is given an opportunity of finishing his inquiries, but I feel that this is the time to raise it, while the matter is under investigation, so that it may go out from this House that if any member of the Force wants to help the Commissioner, the Commissioner will appreciate his services in clearing up this matter.</P>
    <P>If there has been anything of an irregular character in this matter, that superintendent should be immediately stripped and fired from the Force. It is not right that this matter should be allowed to continue now that public attention has been drawn to it and the Minister has received a letter which is without signature.  I can assure the Minister that when I put down this question, I was unaware of the fact that he would be receiving a letter at the same time as he was receiving notice of this question from the Dáil Office because I understood that the Minister already was made aware of this distressful practice.  This is something which should not have taken place.  I have raised the matter in the most friendly spirit, in a spirit of helping and giving the members of the Force confidence that there is somebody looking after their interests, that there is somebody to protect them against this kind of underhand methods. I feel the Minister will accept that am raising this matter in the friendly spirit in which I do raise it, entirely in the interests of the Force.</P>
    <P>Certainly, if I were Minister for Justice and had definite information to the effect that the superintendent who was an examiner at this examination gave out the papers, I would have no hesitation in taking very serious and drastic action.  I hope the Commissioner will take his time in making the inquiries and will not have a very hasty, slipshod inquiry that will not reveal the facts to him.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the superintendent at this examination will not admit that he gave the papers to the detective-sergeant in Mountjoy Station but that there are members attached to that station and to other stations in this city who know that the papers had been given out.  That is why I <Col N="953" /> would ask the Minister to have this matter fully investigated so that the air will be cleared for all time.</P>
    <P>I do not know the contents of the communication which the Minister received but I expect that the names of the superintendent and of the detective-sergeant at Mountjoy station were given to the Minister in order to focus attention as to where the Minister and the Commissioner should make their inquiries. If they have not been given, I am prepared to give the Minister the name of the superintendent who was the examiner and the name of the detective-sergeant who got the examination papers from him.</P>
    <P>The matter is disgraceful and I only hope and trust that for the honour of the Force, for the good name of the Force, for the high standard of the Garda Síochána, the Minister will not allow this to be tolerated and will give a guarantee that any member of the Force who comes forward with information in this matter so that it may be cleared up and any injustice may be put right and this disgraceful practice may not be carried on again of disclosing papers in these examinations, will not be victimised in any way.  I am reliably told that certain undertakings were given to members of the Force some time ago on another matter, where irregularities were alleged against superior officers and reported, but that the guarantees of no victimisation were not honoured.  That is why members of the Force are so terribly slow to come forward.</P>
    <P>These men have jobs and are very slow to risk losing their jobs.  Some of them have reached the age when they will not get jobs anywhere else. They must protect themselves for the sake of their wives and children.  That is why I am raising this matter.  It is dirty work going on in the Force.  It is against the young men and against those who are entitled to a fair crack of the whip and are not getting it from certain men in high positions in the Force.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan has asked that I give the House all the information in my possession about this alleged incident <Col N="954" /> and I propose to do exactly that.  I think that from what I have to say the House will be completely satisfied that this allegation is without any foundation whatever.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan's whole case rests upon the allegation that the examination papers at this particular examination were given out by a particular superintendent to a detective-sergeant prior to the holding of the examination itself.  The inquiries I have made to-day satisfy me beyond any shadow of doubt that such a happening never, in fact, took place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan asked if I had been given the names of the superintendent and the detective-sergeant in question. I want to assure him that I have and that we are, in fact, talking about the same two people.  I shall deal first with the superintendent.  The superintendent concerned is a man with 40 years' unblemished service in the Garda Síochána.  He is within a couple of months&mdash;five or six months perhaps &mdash;of retirement from the Garda Síochána.  It is now alleged that after 40 years of unblemished service&mdash; during which no criticism of any sort was ever levelled against him&mdash;he would, in the final stages of his career, be guilty of this completely dishonourable and disreputable practice.</P>
      <P>The superintendent has been questioned about it and denies categorically that such a happening ever took place. All the senior officers, from the Commissioner down, who have investigated the matter, are satisfied that what the superintendent says is true.  The superintendent in question did take a part in the preparation of the examination papers, but it has been clearly and definitely established that he himself never, in fact, saw the examination papers in their final form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The superintendent and the detective-sergeant in question have been questioned separately, and both have independently stated that they have not been in touch with each other, that they have not spoken to each other, or communicated with each other in any way, for over 12 months.  The investigating officers are satisfied that what the superintendent and the detective-sergeant say independently in <Col N="955" /> that regard is true.  It is established as clearly as it can be that these two men have not had any communication of any sort with each other for over 12 months.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the allegation that the papers concerned were handed out prior to the examination and thereby this detective-sergeant was enabled, not only to pass the examination himself, but to enable his friends to pass it as well.  Deputy Flanagan says the papers were given out by the detective-sergeant to his friends in Mountjoy station, and that 100 per cent of the people in that station passed the examination.  The results are otherwise.  In Mountjoy station, six persons sat for the examination: three qualified and three failed. Lest it might be thought that the three men who qualified were in a certain category, the results, in fact, show that of the three who qualified at the examination, one was a detective-sergeant and two were uniformed sergeants.  The three who failed were uniformed sergeants.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister did not understand me.  I said 100 per cent who got the papers in Mountjoy Station and outside it.</P>

      <P>We will deal with the whole situation.  It has already emerged that the detective-sergeant in question is stationed in Mountjoy.  Now we find, as a significant piece of evidence, that of the people from Mountjoy station who did the examination three failed and three passed, so they did not get the papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave them to his friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the suggestion is that he gave them to his friends, we find that one detective-sergeant passed and two uniformed sergeants passed. There was no question of giving them to a particular section of the Force as two who passed and three who failed were in the uniformed branch.  If, as is alleged, the papers were floating around Dublin, freely available, one would expect that the percentage of passes in Dublin would be very high. <Col N="956" /> One would expect that it would be higher, for instance, than the rest of the country.  What, in fact, are the figures?</P>
      <P>The total figures for the country are that 126 persons sat for the examination and for the whole country 53 passed.  That is an average for the country of 42 per cent.  In Dublin, 47 persons sat for the examination and 15 out of the 47 passed, an average of 32 per cent.  So, on a percentage basis, Dublin was significantly lower than the average for the whole country.</P>
      <P>If we compare Dublin with the rest of the country, it emerges that 79 persons outside Dublin did the examination and 38 passed, which is a precentage of 48.  So, in Dublin, where the papers are supposed to have been circulating, 32 per cent of those who sat for the examination passed, and in the rest of the country, where no papers were available, 48 per cent passed.  Those figures alone are sufficient for my purpose.  They prove, apart from any other consideration, that no papers were, in fact, given to anyone before the examination started.</P>
      <P>I had quite a check made of the situation in the other Dublin districts. We find that in A district, two passed and two failed; in B district, 11 sat and 11 failed; in C district, 11 sat, six passed and five failed; so the situation throughout the Dublin districts is what you would normally expect it to be The whole tenor of the results goes to show and establish that there was no question of anyone having any prior notice of the examination.</P>
      <P>As I said before, it would be a remarkable thing for this superintendent who, for 40 years, had an honourable record of exemplary conduct in the Force, to behave in the last few months of his service in this extraordinarily disreputable and dishonourable fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have already explained that this superintendent&mdash; and we are both talking of the same man&mdash;had a part in the preparation of the papers but never, in fact, saw the <Col N="957" /> papers in their final form.  I accept, and all the Garda authorities who have investigated this matter also accept, as correct this superintendent's statement to the effect that the allegation against him is without foundation.</P>
      <P>The detective-sergeant has a similar reputation.  All those who have investigated the matter, who have questioned him, and considered the situation, accept his statement that he did not receive any papers, that he did not pass on any papers, and that he has not, in fact, been in communication with the superintendent in any way in the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one final point I want to make.  Fifteen men passed this examination in Dublin.  I want to remind the House that this is not an examination which automatically gives anyone promotion. It is simply a qualifying examination.  It does not provide direct access to promotion, but it puts a person in a position in which he can in future be selected for promotion. As I said, 15 men passed the examination in Dublin out of a total of 47 who sat.  All the responsible officers, both the Dublin Metropolitan Division officers concerned and the headquarters officers, are satisfied that every single one of these 15 men is, in his own right, of sufficient <Col N="958" /> calibre, intelligence and so on, to pass the examination, and that there is not one single one of the 15 about whom anyone can say: &ldquo;That man could not possibly have passed this qualifying examination.&rdquo; From their records, their careers and their general behaviour so far, each one can clearly be pointed to as a person who, without any assistance, could be expected to pass the examination.</P>
    <P>I think what I have said should be sufficient to assure the House that this incident did not, in fact, take place. That can be established in two ways. First, it is clear from the results of the examination that no disclosure took place and, secondly, the direct investigation which has been carried out by the officers of the Garda Síochána charged with that task has satisfied them, and me, that this alleged incident, in fact, never happened.</P>
