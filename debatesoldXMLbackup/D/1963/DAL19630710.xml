    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 40 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the heading of this section, as being the first section in this Part of the Act, I want to inquire from the Minister the position in relation to the threatened publication by the Revenue Commissioners of a book dealing with stamp duties in a comprehensive way.  We were told that <Col N="512" /> it would be available to us during the course of 1962.  Although I am not absolutely positive about the date it was promised for, at least it was anticipated that it would have been available before now.  Quite apart from its availability&mdash;and I hope the Minister will be able at least to repeat his performance of yesterday, in relation to consolidation of income tax laws, of waving a draft printed Bill at me&mdash;it is essential that there be some sort of cohesion and co-relation between the Revenue Commissioners and other bodies who are responsible for endeavouring to ensure that the law is available to the public and to practitioners in the best possible form.</P>
      <P>I do not know whose fault it is and I want the Minister to be clear that I am not attributing any blame to him or the Revenue Commissioners, just as I am not attributing any blame to the Incorporated Law Society, but it does seem to me to be unfortunate that when there is so little available skilled manpower to deal with jobs of consolidation or explanation in the line of this type of revenue legislation, both the Incorporated Law Society and the Revenue Commissioners should be working side by side without either of them knowing what the other is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society last year published a booklet on stamp duty legislation as one of their modern law books, the second of that ilk.  It is a most helpful booklet and I am sure that the book that is to be published by the Revenue Commissioners, or by the Minister on the authority of the Revenue Commissioners, will be equally helpful.  It seems unfortunate, however, that both of them should be working on parallel lines without one knowing what the other is doing, instead of one branch working along one line and the other working along another.  I say that because it is common ground with every practitioner, be he barrister or solicitor or member of the public, that there are a very great number of Acts which require examination in this way in our tax law, both in relation to stamp duty and in relation to income tax and surtax as I referred to yesterday, <Col N="513" /> and indeed, I may add, to death duties.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the necessity of having a text book to bring the law up to date, and of having it explanatory in that way, there is an urgent need for the Government to publish in a single volume those sections of the law dealing with death duties since the establishment of the State.</P>
    <P>It is quite unnecessary to have to cope with the mass of full Acts in order to track down death duty legislation. Even when one does a job of home binding as I have done in relation to the Finance Acts from 1941 to 1954 and from 1956 to 1962, it is entirely undesirable that they should have to be dealt with in that cumbersome way.  The Minister should arrange immediately that there should be published in extracts those parts of the Finance Act that deal with death duties in one separate volume and those parts that deal with income tax in another separate volume and perhaps those dealing with corporation profits tax might be dealt with in the same way.  Otherwise, if anyone has necessity to have frequent recourse to these Acts one must examine one after the other because of the manner in which they are amended and the physical job of carrying them all around is one that impedes proper consideration of the problem.</P>
    <P>Section 40 is the first section under Part V which is that part of the Bill which refers to stamp duties.  So far as the section itself is concerned, I assume this is another part of the tidying up operation which was partly done last year.  I should like the Minister to tell us what amount of duty will be involved in the operation of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped to have the publication with regard to the stamp duties brought out in October.  As I told the Dáil yesterday, I was hoping to have the consolidation of the income tax Acts before the next Budget.  I do not know what progress has been made with regard to death duties but I presume it is being dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might give me some information with regard to the death duties if I raise it on a later stage of the Bill. Perhaps he will be able to tell me, if we cannot expect an early publication of the textbook or the consolidated matter, which is it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not going to be dealt with at an early date, I would ask the Minister to get the Stationery Office to publish in one volume excerpts from the Finance Acts since 1922 which affect death duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister also ensure that in any of this consolidation or textbook preparation or publication the Revenue Commissioners will keep in close contact with the secretary of the Bar Council and the secretary of the Law Society so that all three bodies will be aware of what the others are doing?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;41.  The First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891, shall have effect <Col N="515" /> as if the following exemption were inserted therein under the heading `Bill of Exchange or Promissory Note':</P>

    <P>This amendment is not very difficult to understand.  It is merely to make sure that a bill of exchange in the form supplied by the Revenue Commissioners will not be charged.</P>

    <P>When I put the provision in the Budget in relation to stamp duties on the transfer of shares, I had heard in the course of the British Budget that they had reduced it there and, if it was not done here, a great deal of Stock Exchange business would be transferred to London.  Then, in the Finance Act there, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer brought in a great deal of detail and we have to bring in a detailed table in much the same way in order to secure the business for our Stock Exchange.</P>

      <P>I should like a little clarification on one matter in relation to this.  It arises pretty regularly and I think it would be as well it would be clarified beyond question. As I understand the position&mdash;I would like the Minister to correct me if I am wrong&mdash;in relation to any document of personal estate, transfer or assignment, as long as one of the parties to that document is expressed on its face to be resident in Ireland, the document can be stamped in either England or Ireland by virtue of the double taxation agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite clear such is the position in a case where you have an ordinary transfer of shares.  At the same time, it has become to some extent the practice that documents are stamped not entirely with that procedure in mind but whenever it is more convenient. It seems to me it would be a means not of losing revenue but of gaining it if this Schedule we are discussing were brought slightly under the British Schedule instead of running exactly <i>pari passu</i> with it.  There are many cases, indeed, where residents in Ireland&mdash;by residents I mean persons whose addresses on the face of the instrument are expressed to be here &mdash; purchase property outside Ireland and yet the document is stamped on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree entirely with the Minister's point of view that we cannot have our rates of stamp duty higher than those provided for in the British Bill, that if we did, not merely would the Stock Exchange here lose business but the Minister himself would lose very substantial revenue.  I would like, however, to see explored the possibility of pushing that further.  I am not at all certain that if we did reduce the rate of stamp duty the effect might <Col N="518" /> not in fact be that documents would be stamped here in preference to being stamped in England and the greater volume of transactions thus brought here would lead to an increase in the yield from revenue rather than a decrease.  There may be an objection to that.  It may be that part of the double taxation agreement is that one would not undercut in that fashion.  If so, that would be quite understandable. I do not know whether that is the case or not but it seems to me that, in relation to a very large volume of transfer of stocks and shares where residents here are concerned, there could be something done to channel more of the stamp duty into our revenue instead of to the other side.  I should like the Minister to give that some consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this case arose, I very naturally asked the Revenue Commissioners if it would bring extra business here if the stamp duty were lower.  I was told there was a difficulty about that.  I had in mind the particular case the Deputy mentioned but there was a British security involved in that case and if it were a lower stamp duty there would have been certain difficulty involved in Britain and because of the trouble involved they might have had the whole transaction carried out in Britain instead of here.</P>

It is good if stamped <i>pro tanto</i> the stamp duty that is on it and if the stamp duty in the other country is at a greater rate then the addition must be put on at the other side.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> In subsection (1) (a) (i), lines 16 and 17, to delete &ldquo;(including goods sold before the 1st day of November, 1963)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I understand the effect of this section, as drawn in relation to subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (a), the effect of the manner of drafting is to provide that if I buy something now and do not pay for it until after November the shopkeeper concerned will be liable to turnover tax on that purchase.  We all know that the pattern of trading is such that in many parts of the country there is a regular system and habit by which accounts are settled once a year.  In parts of Kildare, the habit is that they are settled after the harvest.  I do not know enough about the pattern in the west of Ireland but I am told that in some parts of it the habit is that you pay your whole year's account when you come in to do your Christmas shopping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not that backward in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether, in fact, that operates before you make your Christmas purchases or afterwards is something of which I am not fully aware.  However, it seems clear that these three subparagraphs of paragraph (a) were quite deliberately drawn for the purpose of catching that type of transaction.  To put it mildly, it would appear most unjust and most unfair. I hope, therefore, I am correct in thinking that the Minister has had second thoughts about this matter and that the retrospective effect of a tax on such purchases will be abolished.  Not merely, of course, would that operate in respect of goods bought now, in respect of goods bought in August, September and October, but it would operate in respect of anything bought as far back as last Christmas or for whatever time the account obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without in any way, at this point, going into the merits of turnover tax as such or, shall I say, the demerits of it because they far out-weigh any apparent advantage anyone might see, it seems entirely wrong that where a credit account is collected such credit account should not be segregated and treated as a <Col N="521" /> segregated factor.  I notice in the ministerial amendment No. 32, the variation that if a person in the country is in the habit of settling his account, as often does occur, once a year and if that period of the year happens to be June or July then what will happen is that the purchases by that person in August, in September and in October will, even under the ministerial amendment, become liable for tax.  As I understand it, the ministerial amendment purely clears purchases in respect of November or any other four succeeding months, that is, December, January, February and March.</P>
    <P>What will be the result?  There will be a complete credit squeeze on anyone who has got credit from a shop between now and then.  It will be a question not merely of ensuring that the person pays in the ordinary way but if a person does not pay before six months for goods on credit then the effect will be that turnover tax will be charged on the shopkeeper in respect of that debt.  In consequence, he will have to start at once to ensure that not one penny is owing to him on 31st March, 1964, in respect of any debt incurred before 31st October, 1963.  It will mean a flood of proceedings.  It will mean pressure on people throughout the country as a whole and it will have a totally and entirely undesirable effect.</P>
    <P>I am not debating at this stage the effect of a turnover tax as such.  That matter will be dealt with later on today.  But whether or not you have such a tax it is clearly and obviously wrong that a person should have to pay such a tax in respect of any bargain that was struck before 1st November even though the money for that bargain may not, in fact, be collected until after that date.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, in amendment No. 32 the Minister has come some part of the way to meet the point in these three amendments but he has not gone the whole way.  This matter requires attention and proper consideration if the whole pattern of life in rural Ireland in relation to trading is not to be upset.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> Other Deputies from other parts of the country may know the times when it is traditional to pay accounts in their area.  The harvest in Kildare is the traditional time.  If we have an early harvest, accounts can be paid in September.  Any accounts incurred after that payment in September and during October will not be discharged until the following year.  That is our regular pattern.  It may be a good or a bad pattern: that does not enter into it.  It is our regular pattern in our county.</P>
    <P>On this section, even if I give the Minister full credit for the amendment he has proposed, it means that the goods sold in the latter half of September and in the month of October on credit will have to bear tax though the tax will not come into operation, according to the Budget statement, until 1st November.  That seems a bad principle.  Whether or not it may make administration easier, it certainly seems wrong.  As far as the general pattern and picture of the three amendments as originally drafted is concerned, I shall defer having anything more to say on them until I hear the Minister's explanation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this form of turnover tax sometimes in some countries I believe it is collected on the sales made during the month and in some countries on the cash received during the month.  I thought that, as far as conveniencing the shopkeeper was concerned, the cash collection was the most simple method.  You only have to take account of your cash turnover and you do not have to give full returns of all your sales.  In cases where there are cash transactions it is obvious, if trade goes on fairly normally through the remaining part of the year, that the cash turnover in November will be in or about the same as the sales made.  They roughly correspond the whole year around. There may be exceptions, as mentioned by Deputy Sweetman, in the case of some country traders.  Bearing that in mind, it would appear to be logical and just to take the cash turnover in November, even though many of the sales were made during October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> The first matter which had to be considered was the case where a contract was made, whether that was by way of hire purchase or otherwise. That obviously had to be dealt with, because if a person had bought a machine or a car on hire purchase, in regard to the payments coming in to the hire purchase company&mdash;or if the trader operates what is equivalent to a hire purchase system of his own&mdash;it would be obviously unfair to tax that particular item in his receipts.  We decided, therefore, in the case of hire purchase agreements or contracts that they should be exempted until the contract runs out.  At the same time, I thought it might militate against the revenue if contracts could be entered into between now and the 1st November.  Therefore, I thought it fair to give notice that any contracts entered into, whether hire purchase or otherwise, after the 1st August will not qualify for remission of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>As regards ordinary debts or credit given by shopkeepers, the case made by Deputy Sweetman was the case I had in mind.  I was aware of the fact that in the country it is quite common for farmers and others to get credit from shopkeepers practically for the whole year.  They are paid whenever the harvest comes in, whatever the harvest may be.  In the grain and beet counties it is paid when the grain and beet harvest comes in, but I believe in the creamery counties it is paid around May and June when the big milk supply comes in.  There is usually a yearly repayment in these cases.  It would appear to me there might be considerable hardship inflicted on the shopkeeper if he had to pay 2½ per cent on that fairly substantial bill if it came to him after 1st November. Therefore, it was decided to put in this amendment that any debts incurred or any credit given before the 1st August and paid between 1st November and 31st March would, if properly certified, be free of the tax.</P>
    <P>I think it will be agreed that by giving them from the 1st November until 31st March we are giving them <Col N="524" /> a fairly long time to collect these debts.  We could not possibly go on for a long period allowing this particular relief of tax to operate.  Against that, I should like to mention that where a contract has been made or a hire purchase agreement has been made, it will go on until the end of that agreement, whenever that may be. Some of these agreements may go on for the next couple of years.  As we know, a person may get a three year hire purchase agreement on a motor car.  Perhaps even more is given in respect of agricultural machinery, but that does not apply here because agricultural machinery is exempted. In the case of a motor car, however, we will have to let it run until the contract expires.</P>
    <P>I received at least three or four groups of traders and they all appeared to be satisfied with the arrangements we were making. Naturally, they were perfectly satisfied with the contract and hire purchase side, and they certainly did not make any very strong objection even in the case of the ordinary credit given&mdash; that it should not extend to any credit given between 1st August and 1st November.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me to be the most extraordinary principle that has ever been introduced into taxation that you should create two categories of shopkeepers, one of whom is selling goods on credit between 1st August and 1st November and, when they get paid for the goods they have sold on credit, they are obliged to pay 2½ per cent on their turnover.  They are meant to trade side by side with merchants trading for cash, all of whose transactions during this period of three months are free from the 2½ per cent tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has spoken of the various practices in rural Ireland. Sometimes they pay at the harvest; sometimes in the creamery districts in the Spring; and certainly there is a very widespread practice in the West of paying at Christmas.  I suppose 90 per cent of the credit accounts in rural Ireland are settled between 1st and 24th December.  But, <Col N="525" /> over and above the problem that will be created and the injustice that will be done in rural Ireland, has the Minister's attention been directed to the volume of credit that exists in many businesses in the city of Dublin?</P>
    <P>The Minister may easily find cases where some £120,000 of credit sales are effected between 1st August and 1st November, on which the merchant will have to pay 2½ per cent turnover tax in respect of sales made during the months before the turnover tax came into operation at all.  He will either have to try and recover it from his customers starting on 1st August, in the knowledge that his competitors trading for cash do not have to collect the tax at all, or else he will have to bear the tax himself.  That seems to be so flagrantly unjust that I begin to wonder if we have retained any standards of taxation principles at all. This Finance Bill already adopts, so far as I am aware for the first time since the State was founded, the principle of retrospective taxation. That will do very grave damage but if we are now proceeding to the next stage and going to create two categories of persons engaged in exactly the same trade, subjected to two different standards of taxation, then every principle governing equitable and fair taxation seems to have gone out the window.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell me what the merchant is to do in respect of the trade he transacts in August, September and October on credit?  Does the Minister suggest he should pay the tax himself on account of having given the credit during those three months or that the merchant should notify his customers that credit will cost 2½ per cent for those three months?  Does he think it reasonable and fair to impose on one merchant that obligation while his competitor is free of it?</P>
    <P>To me the whole proposition is so redolent of injustice and unfairness that I find it hard to formulate the arguments against it because they seem as manifest as the arguments to demonstrate that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.  God knows <Col N="526" /> that seems to be evident enough but to prove it is by no means easy.  I suggest if this detestable tax is ultimately passed&mdash;I hope it will not be&mdash;that it should fall reasonably equitably on everybody and that the sensible thing is to say that any cash receipts in respect of sales made after the appropriate date, which is November the 1st, should be subject to tax and that cash receipts other than for sales made after the 1st November should be free of tax. If you are going to authorise exemption of cash receipts in respect of credit sales made prior to the 1st August what problem have you in exempting cash receipts in respect of credit sales made prior to the 1st November?  Once you admit the principle of segregation of credit sales receipts from cash sales receipts how does the date affect the calculation?  It is just as easy to segregate one as the other.</P>
    <P>Manifestly, the Minister has recognised, since he introduced the Bill, that his original proposal was fantastically unjust.  He has now gone half-way to improve the injustice which is surely the least desirable of all courses to adopt.  If you are going to be unjust, be unjust with a bang for the world to see but if you admit you are unjust the least suitable remedy is to repair one half of the injustice.  I could understand it if the Minister said: &ldquo;We are examining the situation sympathetically but we have concluded that to separate credit sales receipts from cash sales receipts is impossible and we must make the tax apply to all cash receipts after the 1st November.&rdquo;  But he does not say that.  He recognises it would be impossible to justify on any grounds that proposition and he provides that credit sales prior to the 1st August shall be exempt from tax.  Once that principle is admitted the only just thing to do is to say the tax operates from the 1st November and no sales made prior to that will bear the tax. It cannot make any material difference to the Exchequer but the difference it could make to individual merchants could be staggering if they are doing a large credit business, as they are, not only in rural Ireland but also in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In addition, it will remove the gross <Col N="527" /> anomaly of providing by our statute law that of two shopkeepers trading side by side one trades up to the 1st November free of tax while his competitor is obliged to trade from the 1st August to the 1st November subject to 2½ per cent tax which obviously, if he is to remain in business, he cannot effectively pass on.  We are simply loading him with the new tax which, according to the Minister, the Bill was never designed for but which for administrative reasons is convenient. Surely you cannot justify injustice on grounds of administrative convenience? You have admitted it is possible to segregate the two types of cash intake, cash sales from credit sales receipts, and once that is admitted I urge the Minister most strenuously to see full justice done and provide that credit sales receipts originating from sales completed prior to the 1st November should enjoy the same exemption as the Minister's amendment proposes to extend to sales completed before the 1st August.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Without discussing the merits or demerits of sales tax, I think the Minister has taken the ground from under his own feet and that by introducing his amendment it is made evident that if exceptions can be made for those who purchase before the 1st August there can be two different standards on which the shopkeeper is being asked to deduct 2½ per cent.  If there is to be an arrangement whereby those who pay within a period of four months, by the 1st March, are also going to be exempt it seems that the Minister has made it so complicated that the shopkeepers will not be able to operate it at all or he has admitted that it can be operated as the previous speaker suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very strong argument against any retrospective effect for this section because, while the case has been made about people who only pay accounts once a year and might be unfortunate enough to be caught for 2½ per cent on the full year's purchase if they were paying after November 1st, it cannot be overlooked that in country districts it is quite common during <Col N="528" /> periods when work is slack, towards the fall of the year, for the shopkeeper to carry quite a number of good customers who pay when they have the money.  The section means that people who may be unemployed from September until February may have to pay tax on goods advanced to them before the 1st November and before the Bill came into effect when they eventually get employment and have money to meet their bills.  The Minister should seriously consider the grave hardships that will result if this section, even with the amendment proposed by the Minister, is passed.</P>
    <P>I agree there is only one merit in the whole thing, that if the tax is put into operation this year this hardship cannot happen again, that we are finished with it after this year.  However, I still consider the case is strong enough against it because of the points which have been made by previous speakers and because of the point I have just made, and particularly, as I said at the start, because of the Minister's suggestion that it is possible to exempt those who purchase up to 1st August and exempt those who pay their bills before the 1st March.  If that can be done, then there is no reason why the whole matter should not be wiped out and only goods bought or services rendered after 1st November be included in the tax if the provision succeeds in getting through the House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears now that the effect of the ministerial amendment is different from what was believed. As the Minister knows, because of the late delivery of the Bill there was less time than there would have been normally for consideration of amendments for the Committee Stage.  I would urge you, Sir, that, as it has transpired during the course of the discussion of amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 18, notwithstanding we are on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, I would be at liberty at this stage to hand in an amendment to amendment No. 32 of the Minister to delete 1st August and to substitute 1st November. I am prepared to accept that the Minister's method of dealing with it by repayment might be better but it <Col N="529" /> certainly seems we are completely at cross-purposes because of the short notice and I would ask that I would be permitted to hand in an amendment now and discuss it at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reinforce what has been said here because, as Deputy Tully remarked, the fact that it is possible to grant remission or exemption back to 1st August means that it is administratively possible to do it, and the date should be changed to 1st November for the reasons which have been brought forward here.</P>
      <P>Most of the business which is conducted in rural areas depends on a settlement either annually or maybe twice a year, but that does not apply exclusively to the rural community. There is a great volume of business in the city of Dublin, in Dún Laoghaire and other cities and towns where trade is carried on on a credit basis and it is not necessary to elaborate here on the type of businesses in which credit is granted.  Anyone who has even a slight knowledge of business will recognise immediately that a very large volume of business is carried on on a credit basis.  It is true in the case of, say, farmers and rural dwellers paying off shop accounts but it applies equally strongly in the case of credit granted for business purposes where trade is carried on, not merely in business transactions directly with retailers but in a variety of undertakings. The period for payment may vary anything from one month to six months and even to a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I believe, in common with the other Deputies who have spoken, that if it is possible, as the Minister's amendment proposes&mdash;and I quite agree with the proposed amendment&mdash; to do that in respect of the 1st August it ought also to be possible to do it in respect of 1st November.  The fact that it is inconvenient or difficult does not justify imposing on certain traders or customers or other persons who are granted credit an increase in tax which does not apply where the transactions would have been paid for in cash.  Any possible loss of revenue will be very slight compared with the injustice and hardship which will be caused to a <Col N="530" /> number of traders and customers who normally, as the practice of the business concerned, are afforded credit and time in which to pay.  Consequently, this proposed amendment of the Minister should be further amended to allow this exemption or set-off to be applied not in respect of 1st August but in respect of 1st November.</P>

      <P>What we are doing is creating a situation whereby I must tell my customers who buy goods on credit from me&mdash;and a lot of them do &mdash;that: &ldquo;If you buy those goods in these three months before 1st November the invoice I send with the goods will be inaccurate to this extent that if you do not pay this account before 1st November I must add two-and-a-half per cent to it.&rdquo;  That is an unnecessary situation to create.  If the dateline can be set at 1st August, it can equally be set at 1st November.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman might have given the House a picture of a kind of credit which is peculiar to certain parts of the west of Ireland.  A great deal of the retail trade of this country is carried out on a credit basis and the big stores in this city and also in Cork and Limerick, which would have a turnover of £40,000 to £50,000 per month, would be supplying £20,000 worth of goods each month on a credit basis, and the accounts are not always even monthly accounts.  A very large section of the people of this country who are in the State service and in jobs in which they are paid monthly are in the habit of paying their accounts monthly and sometimes they take two months to pay.  It is the pattern of trade in this country.  Is it a fact that they must be told that if they buy goods in September or October, if they do not pay this account before 1st November an additional amount will be charged by way of tax?  The Minister should, I think, consult the large retailer organisations and find out for himself what, apparently, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance do not know, namely, that a great deal of the retail business is done on a credit basis.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I support the previous speakers.  The <Col N="531" /> Minister, when he first introduced this tax, provided that it would extend willy-nilly to all retrospective sales. He has now modified that and cut down the period to three months retrospective to 1st August.  I do not know whether that is an expression of a semi-conscientious approach on the part of the Minister or whether it merely represents a Revenue mind trying to anticipate anticipatory buying between August and November.  I suppose the worst kind of conscience with which a human being can be afflicted is a half conscience.  The fact that the Minister has made it retrospective to a period commencing on August 1st does not in any way take away from the objectionable features of the tax.</P>
      <P>We have a large number of shop-keepers who conduct their businesses on a credit basis.  It would be true to say that there is scarcely a shopkeeper who would wish to have his business on a cash basis because that is a very difficult basis.  I once had a store and my greatest difficulty was trying to avoid credit sales.  It is a difficulty with every trader.  Yet we find here now that credit traders, who are such not of their own choice, and who will have to pay bank interest and run an overdraft for the commodities given out on credit, are being penalised over this three months as against the lucky ones who can run their businesses on a cash basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is grossly unfair.  To my mind there is no difficulty whatever in the Minister securing a statement of debtors as of 1st November from every businessman in the community.  That is given every year in the ordinary audited return to Revenue.  The amount of money the Minister will get as a result of this three months' retrospective taxation will not amount to a great deal, but it will cause a great deal of annoyance.  He should remove this section.  He should get a statement of debtors from each trader on 1st November and then give traders a reasonable period in which to collect those debts.  I do not think the four months he mentioned is an adequate <Col N="532" /> period.  He should allow at least one year and any money collected within the year on the statement of debtors as at 1st November should be free of this 2½ per cent turnover tax.  If the Minister expects outstanding debts to be collected in rural Ireland in the months of December, January and February, then the ordinary trader will find himself in an extremely difficult position.  I suggest he should extend the period to at least one year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One Deputy has mentioned retrospection in this connection. That is, of course, unjustified because by putting this amendment into the Bill and having the Bill published with the amendment in it traders are put on notice that after 1st August any credit they may give will be subject to tax.  That covers that particular point.</P>
      <P>It must be fairly obvious to any Deputy who wants to see this tax, if it is passed, work satisfactorily from the point of view of the collection of revenue that it is not possible to select 1st November.  Is it not obvious that any amount of contracts could be made before 1st August for the supply of goods over the following three or four years?  Very large sales could be made on credit just before 1st November. Surely any Deputy who has any regard for the collection of revenue must see that these various devices to which resort could be had must be guarded against by putting in a date earlier than 1st November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The date 1st August was taken, as I said, because the Finance Bill will in the ordinary way be passed before 1st August.  Notice is given.  As I said earlier, too, I mentioned this amendment to at least two or three retail trade groups I met.  None had any objection.  They were pleased to know that contracts and hire purchase agreements could be carried on, if already made, and they were glad to know that sales made in the retail way before 1st August would rank for remission if properly certified.  One of these groups spoke very strongly on behalf of the country shopkeeper. They all appeared to be satisfied that we had covered the case adequately <Col N="533" /> by exempting from tax any sales made before 1st August.</P>
    <P>In connection with a point made by Deputy Hogan, the last speaker, I might mention that they were also perfectly satisfied that all outstanding accounts would be collected before 31st March next.  They were not very particular, I would say, as to whether this tax is or is not agreed by the Dáil.  I am sure they would be just as well pleased if it were not agreed but, on the assumption it will be agreed, they were looking after their own interests, and they were satisfied with the amendment as far as they were concerned.</P>

      <P>I find it rather hard to be patient in discussing this because it seems to me so manifestly unjust. The Minister says that anyone who has regard for the revenue must realise that the operation of this tax could not be deferred to 1st November in respect of credit sales.  What does the Minister anticipate?  Does he seriously suggest that people will go in and buy a ton of butter for the household prior to 1st November?  Does he seriously suggest a housewife will buy 10,000 eggs?  Does he seriously suggest anyone will go in and buy a whole sheep, or a whole bullock, and hang it up in the larder?  How can the Minister anticipate that situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If she is so concerned to anticipate this tax, as the Minister appears to apprehend, cannot she make these purchases in July?  Of course, any person with any experience of the retail trade knows perfectly well <Col N="534" /> that no amount of anticipation can be effected between July and November that cannot be effected prior to 31st July.  If a woman wants to buy a fur coat, and wishes to avoid the tax, what is to prevent her buying it before 31st July?</P>
      <P>This is not like a tax on tobacco, or beer, or a specific commodity the distributor of which can withdraw from bond in bulk in anticipation of the imposition of taxation.  We all recognised the danger of that type of anticipation years ago, and provided that the Minister for Finance would have power to instruct bonded ware-houses not to release goods except in accordance with a certain rota laid down by him prior to the Budget, so that anticipation of that kind might be avoided.  There is no danger of anticipation of this tax in a form that would in any serious degree jeopardise Revenue.  By requiring individual merchants to pay this tax themselves, you can place an unjust, and in many cases, a crippling burden on individual merchants who are constrained to meet the taxation themselves on sales made before the tax was scheduled under the Bill to come into operation.</P>
      <P>How can this House seriously legislate to provide that two shop-keepers in the same town, one selling on credit, and one for cash, are required by laws made by us to pay a different rate of taxation?  There just is not any rag of justice in such legislation. It is shocking to hear the Minister say that it is administrative convenience that induced him to attempt such an operation.  It does not make sense when he goes on to say that administrative convenience is met by excluding goods sold prior to 1st August, and cannot be met if we exclude goods sold prior to 1st November.  The Minister says: &ldquo;What I am concerned with here is to protect revenue.&rdquo;  Apparently his present anxiety is excessive anticipation if people had up to 1st November to make their credit purchases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In what categories of goods does he contemplate that anticipation is possible in the months of August, September and October that would not be possible prior to 31st July?  I do not <Col N="535" /> see how he can answer that inquiry, because there is not any answer.  I urge on him that the damage that could be done to an individual by this provision could be very grievous and substantial.  The damage to Exchequer receipts by altering the date to 1st November, and making it universally applicable, would be trivial.</P>
    <P>This House must always equate the burdens borne by individual taxpayers and the Exchequer.  A sum of money which may be relatively unimportant from the point of view of the Exchequer, could be ruinous to an individual trader.  In this case I believe there are several traders who will have to suffer quite crippling losses by meeting this tax themselves, or else, in an effort to recover it, suffer equally damaging losses by the unfair handicap this proposal imposes on them as compared with their cash trading rivals, for no greater offence than that they are giving credit to their customers.</P>
    <P>If there is no ground for this arbitrary fixation of 1st August other than the Minister's apprehension that there will be forestalling by way of excess purchases made in the three month period, would he give an indication of the kind of purchases he apprehends? Strangely enough, he is excluding the very kind of credit transaction that might be used for the purpose of forestalling this taxation on a substantial scale.  What hire purchase agreement could anyone make, for the purpose of forestalling this tax, in August, September or October, that he could not make in July?  If there is a real, serious intention to forestall this tax on a substantial and significant scale, what is to prevent the appropriate contract being made in the month of July?</P>
    <P>What essential difference is there between the ordinary credit extended by the ordinary merchant to regular customers and the credit extended by way of hire purchase transactions? I suggest to the Minister that this whole proposal is so riddled with inequity and unfairness that he should change the date to 1st November.  Seeing that the proposed 1st August now rests on the proposition that he apprehends substantial forestalling which would jeopardise Exchequer receipts in this <Col N="536" /> year, would he give some indication of the type of forestalling&mdash;on what merchandise or transaction&mdash;he contemplates as possible in these three months on a scale or of a character which would seriously interfere with the prospective Exchequer receipts from this tax?  Can the Minister indicate what type of forestalling he anticipates?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that in addition he apprehended some substantial with-holding of revenue by manipulation if this exemption were conceded.  I have put to him that inasmuch as this tax applies to food, fuel and clothing, I cannot anticipate any forestalling on the purchase of food which would be practicable on a scale which would seriously interfere with Exchequer receipts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is manifest that people cannot accumulate vast quantities of fuel in that no house is equipped to receive more than the winter's supply.  It is obvious, or at least I have sought to make it, that there is no anticipatory <Col N="537" /> purchase of clothes possible in the months of August, September, and October that is not possible in the month of July.  Anyone who wants to buy a fur coat can go and buy it now.  Anyone who wants to buy fashion apparel unless she is daft will not buy it to cover more than a period of 12 months because what is fashionable today will not be fashionable in two years' time. Of course, anybody who wants to buy durable clothes can buy them now on credit if he desires to anticipate this tax.</P>
    <P>The plain truth is that the character of the tax is so wide and comprehensive that there is not any field in which anyone will be tempted deliberately to anticipate the tax but what is going to happen is that the individual merchant selling on credit will be required to pay 2½ per cent in respect of payments for the three months for no reason that I can understand. I believe that originally the Minister had in his mind administrative convenience and then he justified it on protecting the revenue.  On neither ground can any reasonable case be sustained and why the Minister sticks to this date of the 1st August I cannot imagine.  Does he justify it on the grounds that postponement to November 1st would seriously impair the revenue?  How can the Minister say that?  What merchandise is there available that a person intending to anticipate this tax cannot purchase between now and the 31st July?  There just is not any.  That is so manifest to anyone who has any knowledge of retail distribution that the Minister's allegation that this is designed for the protection of the revenue just does not hold.</P>
    <P>When I ask the Minister what category of merchandise does he expect will be purchased he says he will not bother to tell me.  That approach to a Parliamentary debate simply reduces it to nothing.  There is not any use debating in this House if a responsible Minister will not answer rational questions.  If the Minister honestly believes that the revenue would be jeopardised by anticipatory buying between July and August and I make the case that in my experience of the <Col N="538" /> retail trade there is not any branch of the retail trade in which anticipatory buying can be done between 31st August and the 1st November which cannot be done between today and the 31st July&mdash;and I think I have demonstrated that clearly&mdash;then surely the Minister has an obligation to say: &ldquo;You have overlooked certain categories where, in fact, large scale purchases would be practicable and which could materially injure the revenue.&rdquo;  I submit that at present he has no case.  This is simply an arbitrary decision to invite a merchant to pay 2½ per cent himself when the demands are collected for transactions effected between 1st August and 1st November.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon would convey to the House that if I wanted to be sure that I would stop all this I should have said the 1st July but I could not do that because it will not be law.  Any reasonable Deputy will agree that forestalling is more likely to occur just before the Act comes into operation.  When a tax is coming along people say: &ldquo;We should get in so-and-so before the tax,&rdquo; and usually they leave it until the last week before the tax.  That is the time when the forestalling would take place.</P>

      <P>We have to stop any loopholes.  I know that the Deputies <Col N="539" /> over there will make any case or any argument that occurs to them, but any reasonable Deputy will agree that forestalling is very much more likely to happen in November.  By putting in August we are likely to stop more forestalling than if that date was not put in.  The Deputy mentioned goods that could be bought in advance like furniture and clothes and fuel and, of course, motor cars.  They are quite obvious but even in the case of ordinary weekly supplies Deputies know there can be a certain amount of forestalling.  That might mean half a month's revenue.  People can buy a lot of their groceries.  They can buy at least a fortnight's supply.  I do not want any Deputy getting up and saying that you cannot buy bread in advance.  I know you cannot but there are certain things you can buy. There are the packaged and tinned goods which can be bought long in advance and it is only sensible, therefore, that some provision should be made to deal with the danger of a movement of that kind.  It could amount to a very substantial sum as far as the revenue is concerned.  I want to make it clear that I do not see any difference between the administrative difficulty of bringing this in on the 1st August or the 1st November. It is all the same and the only thing I have in mind is how the revenue would be affected.</P>

      <P>The whole system in a democratic government depends on the officials of the administration being an efficient body and in the type of position we are discussing today nobody will yield to me in my admiration for the job that officials, as revenue collecting persons, do.  It is their job and they do it efficiently and conscientiously but our system of democratic Government means that we do not put experts in charge of Departments.  We put Ministers because they are supposed to take the responsibility of ensuring that the technical expertise is leavened with the commonsense of an ordinary everyday approach to life.</P>
      <P>That is the only reason we have politicians, Deputies or whatever you like to call them in charge of particular Departments rather than the experts, be they economists, collectors, doctors or anything else.  It is quite apparent from the Minister's Budget statement that he has failed completely to exercise that control.  He did not understand the Budget when it was introduced and he refused to answer questions on the Financial Resolutions largely because he had not exercised the duty put on him of scrutinising the expert opinions that were put before him.  Now he says he will not give the House any example of the class of goods which are likely to be anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has said that I can anticipate as much as I like, that anyone who has a bank account can anticipate as much as he likes.  They can draw out the cash on the last week in October, go to the shop and with that cash completely anticipate the effects of this tax on 1st October.  A great many of the people who will do this have got money in current account in the bank and, even if they have to pay 6 per cent, a little mathematical exercise will show that 2½ per cent absolute is more than 6 per cent for a limited period.  The way this Bill is framed now means that the person who cannot afford it, the <Col N="541" /> person who has not the money to buy now will have to pay the tax and the person who can afford it and who can get money from the bank on 1st October will be able to anticipate this tax.

He is clever enough not to do that although he is a bad politician as far as this tax is concerned and he knows it.  This is a bad thing.  The person who can afford to anticipate this tax can do so and the person who cannot afford to do it cannot anticipate it.  If there was a situation in which it was necessary <Col N="542" /> to say that we were going to hit everybody, rich and poor alike, there would be some reason for it but there is no reason in the manner in which the Minister is introducing it now.</P>

      <P>There was a communication this morning from RGDATA which I presume has been sent to every member of the House. This is the organisation which has been responsible for protest marches and for other forms of protest about the turnover tax.  It is also an organisation which helps its members, through MNC, to get the benefit of bulk purchases.  For that reason they have circularised their members to the effect that the turnover tax will not affect them at all.  At the present time it costs £100 to become a member of that organisation.</P>

      <P>Very few grocers in Ireland trade on a capital of less than £100.  A grocer would need to be in a very small way of business to have a capital of less.  If you stand alone in such a position, you can only purchase what a capital of £100 will enable you to purchase.  If you combine with 10,000 other grocers, you can then trade in regard to purchases measured on a capital of £1 million, and thus a small grocer can participate in purchases made on that basis and is accordingly put on a competitive footing with the largest grocers in the land.  The Deputy is, therefore, labouring under a misapprehension when he says RGDATA are operating on a scale designed to the disadvantage of the small grocer.  In fact a number of the large grocers evince a certain amount of resentment at RGDATA for having raised the level of the small grocer to that extent.</P>

      <P>This point has now been sufficiently debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that required to be clarified.  We have now reached the stage where the Minister enjoins on us that to move the date forward from 1st August to 1st November would place the revenue in jeopardy because, he says, there would be such an immense volume of retail purchases made on credit, particularly during the last two weeks of October. On being urged to state the categories of merchandise likely to be purchased in that way, he said he was not prepared to particularise but that there was ample scope for this anticipation. I must point out to him that if there is anybody who wants to anticipate and who can afford to anticipate, who has credit which would enable him to anticipate and is frustrated by the Minister's proposal in the Bill, there is nothing to prevent him anticipating on precisely the same scale for cash.  Now we are reduced to the point that a wealthy person can avoid the incidence of tax by buying for cash.  We are evidently providing here that a person who ordinarily commands a month's credit with a grocer, draper or hardware merchant is effectively debarred.</P>
      <P>My submission is that there is no real danger of a degree of anticipation that would place the revenue in any jeopardy, that the only result of this is to place an unjust burden on merchants who trade for credit.  It is fantastic to say that there can be any volume of goods of a character designed to jeopardise the revenue purchased for credit which could not be purchased for cash.  The only result of this arrangement will be that individual merchants will suffer crippling losses, that a principle will be established in our taxation code of which it is possible to say: &ldquo;We have passed legislation obliging shop-keepers side by side to trade on a different basis, one paying tax and the other paying none?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am utterly at a loss to understand on what basis of equity, justice or fair legislation this proposal is based. <Col N="546" /> Deputies may shrug their shoulders and say: &ldquo;We do not give a damn&rdquo;. They should give a damn.  We have a solemn obligation to legislate equitably and justly on this and every other kind of matter.  It is a bad thing. It is an unhealthy and wrong thing that just because we are too lazy to do what is right we should acquiesce in doing what is wrong.</P>

      <P>About half an hour ago I would have got in but I was expecting the Minister to reply to Deputy Dillon.  Perhaps he was afraid to.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that the Minister for Finance, coming from a rural constituency, refused to reply to a reasonable debate.  If a man has the advantage of getting credit from his grocer or from his merchant then anything obtained after 1st August will be taxed when he comes to settle his account three months later.  That is very unreasonable and the Minister knows it because in rural Ireland, especially in the Minister's constituency, the majority of the farming community settle their accounts after the barley and the beet harvests.  They will be in receipt of credit for the months of August, September and October.</P>
      <P>If the Minister and his experts consider there is great danger of a rush in the last fortnight, why not advance the date?  I have not had any consultation with my colleagues but I am sure we would be agreeable to that. It was surprising to me to look across the House at the Minister and one might say he was mute of malice: he would not reply to the debate.</P>
      <P>As far as forestalling and closing are concerned, I am quite sure that people who have accounts, and big accounts, can buy before 1st August if they want to do so.  I do not think that that will account for very much or that it represents any danger to the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I consider a sign of the times is how the Minister can treat the House so lightly and actually refuse to reply to the debate; how the Leader of the Government can issue threats against any members of the community who are organised.  Bloody noses were <Col N="547" /> threatened for RGDATA.  Today, the Minister said the NFA had been organised by Fine Gael to interrupt him in his constituency.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 29, lines 33 to 35, to delete paragraph (a) (vii).</P>
      <P>There are clubs or organisations throughout the country which run draws.  In certain instances, they apply for a licence to the district justice. Some of these draws are non-stop weekly draws.  I understand that the promoters are paid a commission on the money collected.  My reading of this is that the 2½ per cent tax would be payable on the gross takings.  These non-stop draws come under Section 28 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act.  A licence is granted annually by the district justice, for which the solicitor is paid four guineas.  Quite a lot of these draws are run for charity and for parochial purposes such as schools, churches and so on.  If the gross takings are taxed it will cause quite a hardship because, in addition, out of every shilling collected, in some cases, 10 per cent is paid to the collector. There is no personal gain and the money goes to charities of various kinds.  It would certainly be a great hardship if these words were not deleted.  It has been mentioned that you can secure from the superintendent of the Garda a licence for every ten to 14 days.  I am open to correction on that.  The trouble with a weekly draw is that they could not plan ahead if they had to apply for a licence every 14 days.  I also had in mind pongo, which is run on the same basis.  These clubs have to apply for a licence in that case also.  I would ask the Minister to consider deleting these words and leaving the position as heretofore: that there would be no turnover tax on any of these organisations.</P>

      <P>The House may not know that in these kinds of activities, particularly funds collected in this manner for charitable purposes, the net return for the objective is generally in the region of 4 or 5 per cent by the time the expenses of promoting the draw are paid off.  The subscriptions are very small, 6d. or 1/- a week.  It obviously cannot be levied on the people who subscribe.  Their subscriptions are generally given on a charitable basis and they say goodbye to their 6d. or 1/- when they give it to the collector.  It is very important for the purposes for which these draws are run that this source of revenue should not be closed.  That will be done if the promoters are compelled to bear this tax themselves.  It is a tax which cannot be passed on.  It is very desirable that this loophole should be allowed.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1) (a) (ix), to add at the end &ldquo;, other than those promoting athletic games or sports.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is possible that amendment No. 22, in the name of the Minister, covers everything this amendment covers.  If that is the case, then there is no necessity for me to pursue my amendment.  The difference there appears to be, however, is that the Minister has mentioned &ldquo;sporting events&rdquo; and I have mentioned &ldquo;athletic games and sport&rdquo;.  My wording is, of course, taken to follow Section 2 of the Bill, which deals with income tax as it was originally introduced at the time such amendment was handed in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that there would be an impossible situation for many amateur football associations, for example, if they had to pay two and a half per cent on their gate money.  Their margin of profit is not as much as that, when one considers what many of these bodies have to pay for hiring grounds and for the expenses of the promotion <Col N="550" /> of the individual match.  It seems to me, therefore, that whatever about the tax as such, which we dislike, admissions of that sort are not the type of admissions that should be made the subject of the levy.</P>

I do so because some people may imagine that neither betting nor racing need be considered essentials in the same way as the tax affects essentials such as food, fuel and clothing.  That is only a superficial consideration of the problem, and when this matter is considered in the light of all the facts, it will be recognised that the bloodstock industry is most valuable to the country and provides not only a valuable export trade but also considerable employment. When the manner in which that employment is given is considered, it will be seen that it is a most valuable kind of employment.</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides have frequently spoken of the encouragement given under different Governments to industrial employment and expansion.  Very large sums of money have been invested in industry and the State has directly encouraged industrial development by tax remissions on exports, by grants and so on, all designed to provide not only exports but employment and so strengthen the country's industrial <Col N="552" /> arm and facilitating and encouraging agriculture also.  These benefits and financial arrangements have been welcomed and recognised as a direct means of furthering economic expansion but it is true that, taken in the aggregate, that type of encouragement costs the State a good deal and while benefits have resulted, it involves considerable expenditure.</P>
    <P>In the case of the bloodstock industry, no such State expenditure is involved. In fact, while it is to a considerable extent regarded as a rich man's business, that is only part of the picture.  In the main, the industry is widespread and a great many small owners and breeders depend on it for a livelihood.  The fact that it has been possible to attract wealthy persons from abroad to establish or acquire studs here indicates the confidence these people have in the quality and standard of Irish bloodstock and their desire to own or operate studs here. Apart from the wealthy owners, in the main, the industry is maintained by individual breeders and owners in almost every county and certainly in the majority of counties and employment is provided at all levels throughout the country.</P>
    <P>For that reason, the obvious benefit to the community of maintaining the industry in a prosperous and expanding position needs no emphasis.  Recently the success of the measures taken to assist racing has attracted great attention at home and abroad, and since the establishment of the Racing Board and the provision of funds through powers granted to the Board to make a levy on bets with bookmakers or on the totalisator, a very considerable increase in stake money became possible. That, in turn, resulted in a recent development in Britain, one which was advocated many years ago by the late Aga Khan who recognised the advantages it had for racing here and who urged in articles and letters and in speeches to newspapers that the same thing should be done in Britain, a levy on bets.</P>
    <P>As a result of the consideration given the matter there, a levy is now operating in Britain and the first full year's <Col N="553" /> operation of the levy has, I think, just been completed.  It is known that the estimated revenue from the levy in Britain will be £3 million a year.  It will be administered by a statutory board and used for purposes similar to the purposes for which it is used here.</P>
    <P>A sum of £3 million is a very considerable sum and shows the extent to which the Irish racing and bloodstock industry will have to compete with funds made available in Britain through the British Racing Board and which will in future be used to step up considerably the stakes provided there.  Recently, in addition to stake money provided from the levy here, there have been notable cases of races sponsored by industrial concerns.  The most notable example this year and last was the Irish Sweeps Derby at the Curragh.  In addition, Messrs. Guinness, Messrs. Power and Messrs. Jameson and many other firms, apart from the brewing and distilling trade, such as the tobacco companies, have sponsored races and provided the entire stake or part of it.  That has been done because executives recognised that despite the considerable increase in stakes provided by the Racing Board, something more was necessary.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, some of the sponsoring firms have realised the publicity advantages attached to the sponsorship but the prime motive behind their activity was to assist racing.  In many cases, without the sponsored races, meetings would have suffered considerably and the fact that a particular meeting or race is sponsored has considerably added to the attractiveness of the meeting and has had the added advantage of attracting, in a number of cases, horses from outside the country to compete here.  The total money which is provided by the Racing Board for stakes amounts in round figures to £300,000.  That is made up, in the main, of two figures: one of £240,000 or £250,000 in respect of moneys provided for stakes and a sum of about £50,000 for the carriage of horses to race meetings.  In addition, there are some smaller sums in respect of measures taken to ensure that no doping is carried on and that horses <Col N="554" /> are tested but those are the main figures, £250,000 and £50,000.</P>
    <P>Those who are familiar with the economics of horse racing will appreciate that the cost of transport is a very considerable one and, like other costs, has risen considerably over the years. The reason I put down this amendment is that I believe it is important that we should maintain the industry at the present high level.  In fact, with the very substantial levy now available in Britain, it will be very difficult to compete because for the future we shall be competing with British racing on a different basis.  They will have in Britain for the future a vast sum from the racecourse levy which was not available in the past.  Undoubtedly costs are much higher in Britain but there they have recognised that if the prestige of British racing was to be maintained races like the Derby would have to be increased very considerably in value, and from next year as the result of the levy, the Derby will be worth a sum considerably in excess of what it has been worth in recent years.  That is not only to offset the attraction of the Irish Derby with its enhanced value as a result of being sponsored by the Hospitals Trust but also to counteract the very considerable sums that can be won in races on the Continent and particularly in France.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment, therefore, is to ensure that the sums which have been available in the past will be available in the future for the encouragement and expansion of the racing industry.  It is hardly necessary to say that racing is the shop window of the bloodstock industry and it is the principal way in which the horses bred here have their merits brought to the notice of potential customers. Those that are sold for export as yearlings or young horses are raised elsewhere but in order to maintain that valuable export trade, it is essential that racing here should attract and cater for the very highest standard of breeding and bloodstock generally.</P>
    <P>There is a very real difference between money wagered on betting and money spent on goods and affected by the turnover tax.  It is important to <Col N="555" /> stress to the House the actual difference.  A bookmaker's turnover and the totalisator turnover differ entirely from the turnover of a grocer, a draper or any other business person and I hope by an example or two to indicate the reason for that.  I hope to prove that the sum wagered on a racecourse is turned over a number of times.</P>
    <P>Take the example of a person who at a racemeeting starts with a sum of £20. He places £5 at 4 to 1 on the winner of the first race and he wins £20. The turnover is £5.  On the second race he puts on £10 at 6 to 4 and he wins £15.  The turnover there is £10.  In the third race, he puts £20 on the favourite and he loses.  There is a loss of £20.  On the fourth race, he has £10 on at 2 to 1 and he wins £20.  He is getting more courage and on the fifth race, he bets £50 to win £40 on a certainty and it loses, so he loses £50.  In the sixth race, he puts £5 on at 4 to 1 and he loses.  The sum he wins for the total of six bets is £55.  He loses £75 and the total turnover is £100.  Thus to complete the example, he loses his £20 but the turnover tax would have been payable on the £100.  If, on the other hand, he spent the £20 on a suit of clothing the turnover tax would be payable only on the £20.</P>
    <P>My contention is that it is not equitable to deal with a bookmaker's turnover or the turnover of the totalisator in the same way as that of a draper, grocer or some other retail trader where the turnover is paid on one particular transaction.  In order to equate the two, it is necessary that the bookmaker's turnover or the turnover in respect of the tote betting should be defined as meaning the amount spent on gaming or gambling just as the amount spent in a grocer's or a draper's shop is the amount spent on such goods.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment can be shown by that example.  What I want the Minister to consider, first, is that instead of the Racing Board paying the 2½ per cent on the tote turover of £2,700,000, which is approximately the sum which is wagered on the totalisator, <Col N="556" /> they should pay only on a sum of £270,000 which is the sum retained by the totalisator out of the sum wagered.  On the other hand, in the case of money wagered with the bookmakers, instead of a sum of, say, £60,000 or £70,000, they should pay between £6,000 and £7,000.</P>
    <P>I also included in this amendment the question of pools because I believe a number of worthwhile charities are involved.  It is not necessary to mention the well-known cases but there are a number of well-known pools run for hospitals and other charitable purposes and there again these pools would come within this provision.  There is an equally strong case for granting exemptions to them. The purpose of this amendment, as I have said, is to confine the turnover tax to the profit taken by the Racing Board in respect of bets placed with the tote and to the profit on course bets placed with bookmakers.  That would be a reasonable approach to it. It would provide the Minister with a fair return and at the same time, it would allow this industry, which is doing well but which is not without serious problems and which has done well up to the present, but now faces an entirely different situation, sums comparable with the very considerable sums which will be placed by the British Racing Control Board to the advantage of British racing and breeding, and which were not there up to this year, or up to a portion of last year, but which will be there in future, sums vastly in excess of anything that could be contemplated here.  That involves racing and bloodstock breeding in a challenge it has not had to meet in the past.  It involves it in future problems incomparably greater than anything it has met with in the past.</P>
    <P>In the main the sum wagered has remained static.  Despite increases in wages, salaries and money values, the sums wagered have remained largely static.  Indeed, for a very considerable portion of last year the sum taken by the tote at race meetings was down on the previous year.  Towards the end of the year, and in the early part of this year, bets made a recovery, but it is a <Col N="557" /> recovery to meet rising costs and rising charges.  As I say, the sum provided here in respect of stakes and in respect of the carriage of horses is substantially less than that which will be available in future in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I believe this is a most valuable industry.  Up to the present it has cost the State nothing.  We have designed measures to help industry and agriculture, with a view to attracting outsiders as well as inducing our own people to expand and develop.  This particular industry has attracted outsiders without any comparable State investment.  It has also attracted some few of our own people, who have put considerable sums into it, but, in the main, it is an industry which depends on the small man and on the small breeder.  It has spread widely throughout the country and gives good male employment.  It has spread throughout every province and into practically every county.  It is for that reason I believe we should endeavour to expand it, if not improve it.</P>
    <P>I believe the proposal enshrined in the Bill to impose a turnover tax on the industry will seriously affect the efficiency and economy of the industry. It is for these reasons then I move this amendment to confine the turnover tax to the sum actually won or retained by the Racing Board both in respect of bets placed on the totalisator and in respect of course bets placed with the bookmaker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with everything Deputy Cosgrave has said about the bloodstock industry, I should point out that he omitted to mention a much more important industry to my way of thinking.  I refer to the greyhound industry.  This industry is recognised as the poor man's sport and in my province practically every farmer and cottier keeps a greyhound with the intention of either selling the dog or winning a race with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would apply to the greyhound industry as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to put before the Minister the importance of the industry.  This is an industry <Col N="558" /> employing large numbers of men and boys on the tracks and in the trainer's quarters.  With regard to the industry generally, a Board has been set up within the past few years on lines similar to the much longer-established Racing Board set up for the benefit of the bloodstock industry.  While some may not agree with everything that is done by Bord na gCon, the fact remains that a good deal has been done to improve the greyhound industry.  In time, with perhaps some changes, bigger and better things may be done for the industry.</P>
      <P>I have been directly concerned with the greyhound industry for over thirty years.  I know something about it.  The employment given is larger in content than that provided by the bloodstock industry.  Both are, of course, self-supporting and operate independently, without any help from the Government or anyone else.  On average, there are four greyhound race meetings every night of the week, except Sunday, in the country.  Large numbers are employed, bookmakers' clerks, and so on.  There is already a tax of ten per cent.  If this turnover tax is added on that will mean a tax of 12½ per cent.  For every £ invested 2/6 will be mulcted at once for the Exchequer or the totalisator, as the case may be.  For the sake of illustration, suppose a man wagers a bet of £1 on A and credits £2 off that on to B, the tax charged will be 7/6. The bet will be interpreted by the Revenue people as a £3 bet whereas in actual fact only £1 will be invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now this kind of imposition can lead to all kinds of confusion. Eventually it will lead to evasion.  It may be argued that a tax on betting does not fall within the same category as a tax on fuel, food and clothing, but betting has become a part of our life and, if this additional tax is imposed, it will, I maintain, mean the closing down of a large number of small bookmakers, who are barely existing today, engaged in both the horseracing and the greyhound racing industries.  There is no other way out of it.  They will have to close down and get out, because they cannot <Col N="559" /> afford to carry this 2½ per cent tax on top of the burden they are already carrying.</P>
    <P>I know representations have been made to the Minister in connection with this Bill on different aspects, and by different people, but I would appeal to him to consider some way of exempting this matter.  Deputy Cosgrave made a good suggestion when he said that the tax should be on the original amount.  Otherwise it will have a snowballing effect and 50 per cent will be taken out of the amount the people originally had in their pockets. It is different from the woman who goes into a shop with the week's wages and pays 6d. in the £.  The amount taken out of betting has been falling and will fall further, and as a result bookmakers and their clerks and employees will have to get out of business. I appeal to the Minister, in view of his own experience and the experience of the Revenue Commissioners, to consider some approach on the lines suggested by Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The turnover tax is being imposed by the Minister on a permanent basis.  It is, therefore, entirely different from taxation which is imposed as an emergency measure for the purpose of damping down expenditure and damping down inflation. I am fully aware of the fact that no one likes being made part of a system of damping down inflation. They would not be human if they did. It was necessary that inflation should be damped down in 1956 and I was not going to shrink from that task even though it might be unpopular.  That was a purely temporary measure and I stated that on many occasions.</P>
      <P>This is a different situation.  This is a permanent tax, and it is entirely wrong in relation to permanent legislation that these two branches of a vital industry in rural Ireland should be penalised.  This is the only way for the horseracing industry, the greyhound racing industry or the coursing industry to sell their wares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw this amendment I asked for an interpretation because <Col N="560" /> I found it hard to follow.  I do not think the interpretation I got was what Deputy Cosgrave has in mind. The use of the word &ldquo;returnable&rdquo; would suggest that a person should not be taxed on his bet but only on his winnings.  In other words, if he bets £1 on a four to one winner he gets back £5 and he should pay tax on the £4 and not the £5.  I do not think that is what Deputy Cosgrave has in mind and, therefore, I will leave it. The arrangement at the moment is that the bookmaker is taxed on the total turnover exactly as he will be under this turnover tax.  As the excise tax is there, I think it would be logical to have the turnover tax on the same basis.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in another point made by Deputy Cosgrave when he suggested that it might have an adverse effect on the breeding of horses and dogs.  We must give very serious consideration to that matter. Deputy Cosgrave was worried that the Racing Board might find themselves adversely affected by this tax, first on the tote, and secondly on course betting, because it might have the effect of reducing course betting, or diverting course betting from Irish bookmakers to another place.</P>
      <P>The Racing Board sent me a memo before this tax was mentioned publicly pointing out their position and referring especially to the very big income of the racing authorities in England owing to the levy.  I studied that memo and when this proposal in regard to the turnover tax came along I thought it was better not to discuss this matter with the Racing Board until we had come to a final decision in regard to a turnover tax on racing. I intend to meet members of the Racing Board and Bord na gCon and if they convince me that this tax would have an adverse effect I shall be very sympathetic towards them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it hard to agree to remit the turnover tax on betting, lotteries, and so on because, as I have already said in another connection, I am convinced this tax will not be a success unless it applies all around.  We have made certain exceptions, but it would be difficult to justify making <Col N="561" /> an exception for betting.  Deputy Cosgrave made a very interesting suggestion in regard to the tote when he said that the tax should be put on the final receipts of the tote.  That suggestion is well worth consideration, but I do not know where we would stand in regard to bookmakers. It would be very difficult to assess what the residue in the bookmakers' hands might be.  We could easily find out what it is in the tote. Of course, the tote is used only by the Racing Board and Bord na gCon and, therefore, it would be just as easy to go light on them with this tax rather than to go heavy on them and have to subsidise them subsequently to help them over their difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to consider the point made by Deputy Cosgrave in regard to the tote, but I think it would be difficult to apply the same principle to the bookmakers.  I should say, perhaps, that this will require some investigation and some discussions, and I am afraid it would be impossible to promise to have anything ready for Report Stage. Deputies will realise that in this Bill the Minister has power to make an Order altering the tax downwards, and not upwards.  I can undertake to have this matter very thoroughly examined and to have discussions with the two bodies concerned.  If I can find a ready way of going easy on them, I would be prepared to make it right afterwards by order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say how much I appreciate the Minister's approach to this matter.  The difficulty he sees about the bookmakers could probably be resolved because, as I understand it, the Racing Board are responsible for the levy from the bookmakers as well as the levy on the tote. I imagine the returns which are furnished both by the bookmakers to the Racing Board, and by the Racing Board to the Revenue Commissioners will clarify any difficulty which may exist because the returns in respect of tote bets and course bets with bookmakers are made by the Racing Board. However, these technical details can best be discussed between the Minister <Col N="562" /> and the Board.  I appreciate the Minister's interest in the matter.  Because of the Minister's undertaking I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is the charging section for the new tax and it is around this section that there will be a main discussion on that tax. There are, of course, other sections and other amendments which will deal with individual aspects, such as the retrospective one we have been discussing partly this morning and which will come up again for discussion under Section 52; the inclusion of foodstuffs under amendment No. 59 which I have put down with Deputy Cosgrave, and which of course will include batch bread about which we <Col N="563" /> have read in the newspapers.  So far as the Act and the tax are concerned, Section 46 is the operative section.  It provides that the tax will be called a turnover tax.</P>
      <P>I want to raise now, as I did before, my mystification as to why, during the course of the progress of this Bill, the name was changed from retail tax to turnover tax.  When it was being considered by the Commission on Income Taxation in their Third Report, in Chapter IV, page 29 and thereafter, it was indicated that they were considering a purchase tax perhaps imposed at the wholesale level or retail taxes imposed at the retail sales level.  When we were discussing this on the income tax section yesterday, I reminded Deputies that the commission, when they were recommending either a purchase or sales tax, had done so on the clear understanding that it was to be in substitution for other taxation.  Of course, the introduction of this tax now in its present form is not in substitution for anything.  It is an additional tax imposed as an addition to the various taxes already collected in what most people feel is an already overtaxed community It is a burden which is to be added, if the Minister has his way, to the already excessive burden of taxation on our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many discussions in relation to the best form of expenditure, purchase, retail, manufactures, added value, wholesale and turnover taxes.  Many of them are multi-stage in their application; many of them are single stage, but they have all had this one universal factor, that wherever they have been introduced they have always been introduced at a small level and that percentage has been stepped up afterwards.  That of course is the intention here.  That of course is the reason why certain theoretical economists regard this as an excellent tax because they say it will be so easy to step it up.  Therefore, when we are considering this tax of 2½ per cent, we are considering that as a tax in the context not of a final one-fortieth but in the context of its being the thin end of the wedge <Col N="564" /> which will be utilised at a later stage for the purpose of being increased and getting further exactions.</P>
    <P>That has been the pattern everywhere and we have had references already in this House to the fact that in New York at present there is a campaign going on because a retail tax is being increased from three to four per cent.  I have no doubt whatever that if this proposal succeeds&mdash; and pray Heaven it will not&mdash;the same thing will operate here.  It is being said also that the pattern being set for this tax has been the operation of it in Sweden, Norway, in Canada, as well as in certain States in the United States of America.  At paragraph 3 of the Appendix to the Commission's Third Report, it was referred to:</P>
    <P>A single stage tax charged at the <i>retail</i> level is operated in France, Norway, and Sweden as well as by various local authorities in the United States and Canada.</P>
    <P>I understand that since that time France has abandoned that form of taxation and has gone over to what is now known as the added value tax instead.  I have before me a publication entitled <i>Taxation in Canada</i> which is published by the Bank of Montreal and which, to all intents and purposes, is official.  It is the only explanation that I have been able to obtain anywhere in the English language of the tax as it operates in any of the countries to which reference has been made by the Commission or by the Government in the White Paper to which I refer.  It is a most significant thing that in that Canadian example, I find, on Page 33 of this booklet, which was published in 1959, the statement: &ldquo;Amongst the articles exempt from the tax are practically all foodstuffs, the principal materials for building and machinery and materials used in buses.&rdquo;  Practically all foodstuffs are exempt in Canada but when the Minister and the Government were asked to give examples, no mention was made of that.</P>
    <P>This tax was mentioned in the Third Report of the Commission on Income Taxation as a means of switching <Col N="565" /> taxation from one section of the community to another.  It may be that the fact that it was passed by only one vote in that Commission may mean that the discussion on it was as evenly divided as the final voting.  Certain people had, prior to that, been attracted to a form of expenditure taxation promoted by an economist called Caldor, in the hope that such an expenditure tax could be substituted everywhere for income tax as such.  The manner in which Mr. Caldor explained his tax was beautiful in theory.  In theory, it meant that everybody was going to pay tax according to his means but, when it came to seeing how that was to be done, it would have meant in our circumstances that we would have to augment by ten times the number of officials necessary to implement his beautiful theoretical scheme and apply it to practical Irish conditions.  It was clear at a very early stage that any such scheme would have to be thrown overboard.</P>
    <P>Here in this tax we see something of the same theorising.  We see a scheme practical to operate in countries that have a decimal coinage being introduced into one where there is no such coinage and one in which the only suggestion made to meet the circumstances was that we should strike more farthings and even create a half farthing.  It is quite impossible in the circumstances of our coinage to operate administratively a system that can be operated in countries where there is a currency based on percentages and where it is possible to go as low as one per cent of the normal unit. Norway, Sweden, Canada, America&mdash;I do not know about Finland or Turkey &mdash;these four are always quoted here as examples of this tax and they all operate a decimal system of coinage.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to enter into any very long discussion as to whether the system of taxation proposed is regressive as such as I think it is patent to everyone that any system of taxation of this kind must, of its essence, be regressive.  It must be regressive because it transfers burdens from those who can afford to carry them to those who can least afford to carry them.  If there were in <Col N="566" /> this section a proposal to exempt the basic articles upon which people have to depend for their existence, then there might be some&mdash;I stress &ldquo;some&rdquo;&mdash; argument made against the claim that the tax is regressive.  In its present form, it is quite undeniable that this is bound to be a regressive tax and there has not been any serious attempt by the Government to deny such a contention.</P>
    <P>I put down a question on 2nd July, 1963, asking the Minister for Finance what the effect would be of imposing a 2½ per cent tax on certain items.  I did that because I want to make it clear that the method by which the Minister for Finance announced this tax in his Budget Statement was politically dishonest. I admit that he was facilitated in that by a lack of understanding of his proposals at that time.  I suggest to the House that he was deliberately trying to create that misunderstanding, that the whole purpose of the manner of the introduction of this tax was to create a smokescreen, to create confusion. One member of the Government was saying that the shopkeepers were to pay the tax and another member of the Government was saying that the consumer would have to pay it.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was asked for the precise effect of the tax on individual items, he refused to give that information. The whole purpose of the manner in which the tax was introduced at that time was to try to slide it through without its being realised by either shopkeeper or consumer where it was to be borne.  It is quite clear from the Budget as proposed this year that, in spite of what the newspapers said to the contrary, there will be extra taxation on tobacco, spirits, beer and petrol.  In fact by this method, the Budget has imposed an additional £2 million on these commodities.</P>
    <P>The Minister refused to answer me earlier when I asked him a question about the way the new tax would affect the individual commodities, and I was forced to ask the question in another way.  I found then, on the assumption that consumption remained static in 1963/64 as compared with the last financial year, that the effect of this <Col N="567" /> tax was to add £817,000 to the tax on tobacco&mdash;a tax on a tax, since in addition to the existing tax on the material itself, there will be this new tax.</P>
    <P>This new tax on the tax on wine will yield an additional £12,000, on spirits, £123,000, on beer, £273,000. On the boxes of matches, from each of which the Tánaiste advised the manufacturers to extract one match to protect themselves against the turnover tax, the additional tax on the tax will amount to £11,000. There will be an additional tax on tax on motor vehicles amounting to £87,000, an additional tax of £12,000 on motor tyres, £350,000 on the tax on petrol, despite what we have heard on many occasions from members of the Fianna Fáil Party to the effect that higher taxes on petrol increase distribution costs and in fact the cost of living generally.  This turnover tax means a new tax on the tax on hydrocarbon oils amounting to £62,000.  Assuming my arithmetic is correct, as I think it is, this tax imposes a new impost on those already taxed commodities of £1,829,000.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there is, in addition, the existing tax on all these commodities.  It is quite clear, therefore, that under these main tax headings, a sum of at least £2 million will be involved out of the £10 million to which the Minister has referred as being the apparent yield of this turnover tax, as far as he can gauge at this stage.  From discussions throughout the country on this tax, it is clear that because of the absence of an adequate system of currency to deal with it, it is bound to mean further penalties and difficulties for the ordinary retail grocery shops, while being comparatively easy for the supermarkets.</P>
    <P>When a housewife goes round a supermarket, puts the commodities in her basket and arrives at the end of the line, it is a matter of comparative simplicity for the cashier to strike another key on the cash register-cum-adding machine.  It is an entirely different matter, however, for the small shopkeeper on whose premises <Col N="568" /> only one thing is being bought, where in many cases purchases are made daily rather than bi-weekly or weekly.  The effect of this tax will be to place an additional burden on every article involved in the whole gamut of living costs.  It will have the effect of increasing the cost of living, from the loaf of bread, the lb. of butter, the lb. of sugar, all the way up to the fur coat, to take an extreme example.  I cannot for the life of me see any justification for any tax that imposes the same rate on the loaf of bread as on the fur coat.</P>

      <P>I cannot see where the justice or the equity comes in, if both are to be subject to the same rate of taxation.  The purpose of creating a broad base to our taxation is entirely different from creating an inequity, an injustice, by enabling the revenue to be collected at exactly the same rate on the necessaries of life as on luxuries or semi-luxuries.  It is quite nonsensical for the Minister, the Taoiseach or anybody else to suggest that the protests that have arisen throughout the country in relation to this tax have been generated by a political Party, be it Fine Gael, Labour or any other Party.  Speaking for my county, I know prominent members of Fianna Fáil have been just as vehement and just as vocal as the members of the Fine Gael Party.  It is not a question of politics, and in fact many people who are prominently associated with this Party have deliberately kept away from meetings in connection with this tax to ensure that their presence could not in any way be misrepresented. I can only speak for my own county, but I am told that in other counties the same thing applies.  In Monasterevan, the leading objector to this tax is a man who was on the Kildare County Council for longer than I can remember for Fianna Fáil.  In Newbridge, the chairman of the organisation there is the chairman of Fianna Fáil.  In Athy, one of the principal people organising the protest in south Kildare is a Fianna Fáil member of the Athy urban council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> When one knows these things and when one sees lists in the papers of the people who are agitating in every town in Ireland and when one goes walking down the street and sees posters in a shop window and knows the way the people in that shop perpetually vote it is nonsense to suggest that the protests that have been held are in any shape or kind organised, sponsored or channelled by a political party: they are not.  They are protests by the people concerned who know it will be quite impossible for them to work this tax as it was originally proposed; who know it will mean for many of them a harshening and worsening of their conditions and who know they will be turned into unpaid tax collectors by the Minister as a result of his proposals.</P>
    <P>We have all seen, over the years, the effect of PAYE in so far as it has meant that employers of all sorts have been turned into unpaid tax collectors to do the work that should be done by the Revenue Department.  However, it was essential that they should undertake that task because otherwise there was the danger that employees would get themselves into a mess and a muddle by reason of its being impossible to have their tax collected and deducted as they were given their pay packets and that they would find themselves in an impossible situation.  It was essential because, to a large degree, directions were being issued by the Revenue Commissioners under Section 23 by which employers were being directed to collect arrears from employees.</P>
    <P>But this, coming on top of that imposition, adds to the burden the shopkeeper already carries of providing the machinery necessary for operating PAYE.  When one adds to that the impossibility of adding this 2½ per cent tax to individual items, then one can easily see that it did not require any political considerations to organise these people into making a protest when their ordinary way of life appeared to be threatened.</P>
    <P>I still am completely unable to see how this proposal by the Minister can possibly work&mdash;how, for example, it will be possible to collect turnover tax <Col N="570" /> on a bottle of milk.  It is all right if you have a credit account.  At the end of the month, it is possible to make the calculations, but on the individual purchase of a bottle of milk, or of two or three bottles of milk, I cannot for the life of me see how the tax can be paid without a decimal coinage.  I am leaving aside the point that the price of milk is statutorily fixed by regulation in the Dublin area.  Presumably, if it were physically possible to deal with the matter by any conceivable means, another statutory order could be made but I cannot see how it can be done.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the turnover tax will operate in relation to the box of matches unless one adopts the measure which the Tánaiste so brightly suggested, namely, that every retailer should take one match out of each box and that when he has 40 matches he then has another box of matches which he can sell.  I cannot see where the retailer will get the new container for the 40 matches which he will gather.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>You go on from one impossibility to another.  Regardless of where one goes, you will find exactly the same thing.  It just will not be workable at the retail level in the way the Minister so calmly and so blandly suggested.</P>
      <P>I have read, as I am sure other Deputies have probably read, articles in relation to this tax in various papers&mdash;from the RGDATA Review to other types of trade journals as well as the main columns of our newspapers. It is a fact that in the past few weeks it has come to be realised that in the majority of cases, the bigger cases, the consumer will have to pay and it is inevitable.  Taking groceries, for example, it is clear to everyone that there is not the profit available to enable the trader to absorb the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that at an early stage the Minister thought that by saying nothing he would be able to force retailers partly, if not entirely, to absorb the payments.  But it is not absorbable on <Col N="571" /> profits at the level at which they are, particularly in the smaller concerns, in Ireland.  It will have the effect that concerns who make small sales of small items will gradually be pushed out of business and that the larger supermarkets and emporiums will gradually take over because of the greater ease of collection and, in addition, because of some of the other methods and manner in which our general executive life is oppressing the small trader.</P>
    <P>Everyone going through the country must be impressed by the fact that the smaller towns and villages of rural Ireland are finding the position more difficult than the big cities.  Of its essence, this tax must hit the smaller town and village shops harder than those in the bigger cities and particularly in the better class areas of the bigger cities.  It is a tax which appears to me to be unworkable, to be unjust in its incidence and unfair in its operation. It is a tax which has been greeted by the whole country as being quite inappropriate to our Irish way of life. It has meant that the Government are tottering and carrying on like a punch-drunk boxer, only in his case the bell saves him whereas in this case the bell is going to mean the end of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to return to the subject which I mentioned rather irrelevantly this morning, that is, the organisation sponsored by RGDATA called MNC, membership of which is available at a cost of £100. It has been announced to the members <Col N="572" /> of this organisation that the entire 2½ per cent will be absorbed.  As a result, it will not be necessary for a grocer who is a member to put up the prices of any of the essential commodities which have been mentioned <i>ad nauseam</i> by Deputy Sweetman and his colleagues over the past two months.</P>
      <P>The difficulty that will arise will be for the small trader, about whom Mr. Keogh is supposed to be so concerned, who cannot afford to lodge £100. Theoretically, this is supposed to be a deposit, but he must leave it with the co-op so long as he enjoys the benefits of membership.  I understand it is now proposed to be increased to £200.  I made the point this morning, and I make it again, that if the membership of that organisation were to be made easier, then the small trader would in fact be protected.  As Deputy Dillon rightly pointed out, he would be protected by virtue of the strength of the co-op as a unit as distinct from the strength of the small trader as an individual.  If this organisation is able to absorb the entire 2½ per cent tax on grocery items, then the man-in-the-street will not have to pay a halfpenny more for any of them.  The turnover tax, therefore, will not affect these essential items as far as purchases from any of these unit shops are concerned.  What I have suggested is that membership should be made easier for these people and not more difficult.  If RGDATA are sincere in their desire to help them, they can reduce the cost to small traders of joining in a co-operative big enough to absorb the tax and so protect not merely the customer but also the small retail trader himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The misconceptions that have arisen amongst other traders I find extremely difficult to understand. Some publicans, for instance, seem to have the most violent objection to the tax.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman when he says that not all of these people are supporters of the Fine Gael Party.  I agree that many of them are supporters of Fianna Fáil.  But I do not for a moment believe they understand why they are objecting.  I do not for a moment believe they are not victims, conscious <Col N="573" /> or unconscious, of propaganda put out by Fine Gael over the past two or three months.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that if the £11 million needed by the Government to balance their books is not forthcoming from a turnover tax or some other form of tax, we must go back to the old horses and flog them again&mdash;cigarettes, beer, spirits and petrol.  I have asked some of these publicans&mdash;and failed to receive an answer from them&mdash;how they would feel if £11 million was asked of them.  They cannot tell me the objection they have to a tax which at most could put a penny on a glass of brandy, when under the old system the half-one of brandy would probably cost from 3/6d. to 4/-.  The price of cigarettes would have to go to 4/3d. or 4/6d. and the price of petrol to 6/-, with consequent enormous dislocation to all the people directly or indirectly involved in these businesses.</P>
    <P>I wish to make the position clear in regard to essential grocery items, that neither the trader nor the customer fortunate enough to be a member of certain co-ops will in any way be affected as a result of the imposition of this tax.  That is the answer to those who are crying crocodile tears about the effect of the tax on the essential items the poor must buy.</P>
    <P>I notice that the provision made for the protection of these people by way of increased social welfare benefits is never mentioned at all.  The fact pointed out by the Minister replying to the Budget debate that 47½ per cent of the people of the entire country are either as well off or better off as a result of this Budget than before is conveniently mislaid by Fine Gael and other opponents of the turnover tax. Deputy Sweetman readily admitted today that he and his Party are not prepared to show their hand.  They say it is time enough to disclose their hand when they have won the pool.  Twice in the history of Fine Gael and this country, they were returned to government on the basis of decrying the measures taken by Fianna Fáil to keep our economy going.  Twice they were a failure because it was discovered that in fact they had no hand to show.</P>
    <P>If they get into government, Fine <Col N="574" /> Gael are committed to the abolition of the turnover tax.  Therefore, they are committed to the withdrawal of £11 million in revenue in a full year. According to their leader's speech at their Árd Fheis, they are committed to a programme of expansion on all fronts.  It is not incorrect to say that there is no suggestion from the leader or any other member of Fine Gael that they are now committed to any sort of retrenchment in agriculture, industry or tourism or any aspect of our economy.  Therefore, you have a Party committed to continue expansion and at the same time, committed to forgo over £11 million in revenue.  Expansion involves an increased revenue and the people are entitled to ask Deputy Sweetman if now is not the time to disclose his hand and, as shadow Minister for Finance, say how he will find the money that his Party are committed to spending and it is on the basis of that policy or programme or statement that they must seek the people's votes.  That is something Fine Gael have declined and still decline to do.  Deputy Sweetman announced this morning that they would continue to decline.</P>

I am prepared to abide by the verdict of time on this measure also.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is incorrect and unfair to say they have not a policy.  They may have an excellent policy but I think the people are entitled to know what it is.  It is very easy for Deputy Sweetman whose intelligence and ability are not in doubt to exercise his superior intelligence or knowledge to misinterpret the motives of the Government, and the nature and effect of the tax.  It is too facile to say there should be a distinction between the purchaser of bread and the purchaser of a fur coat.  As Deputy Sweetman said in admonishing some members of the House last night, I say to him now that he knows <Col N="576" /> a good deal better than that and could do much better if he wished.</P>

The retailer will be obliged to state on a simple form at the end of a month his turnover for the period and he will be asked to furnish a cheque to the Revenue Commissioners for 2½ per cent of that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>All he has to do each evening is to subtract the float from the money in the till, add that for every trading day in the month, and give 2½ per cent of the total.  It would be nonsense to suggest that there are not certain people who have been evading tax and getting away with it for years.  Both sides of the House agree that every effort should be made to bring them into the revenue net.  Some are certain to be found out as a result of the turnover tax and it is time they were found out.  I believe they represent a small minority and therefore the vast majority of honest traders who have been declaring their financial position to the inspectors of taxes over the years have absolutely nothing to fear from the operation of the new tax.  They need fear no <Col N="577" /> proliferation of forms or hordes of inspectors.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to knock down that bogey on account of which many people were misguided enough to join in the protest.  Literally hundreds gave me that reason as the basis of their opposition to the tax&mdash; more bookkeeping, more inspectors and more paper.  Only when the tax is actually operating will they see that it can be implemented in a simple way and lose that fear.  Many of them will opt out of the scheme altogether and their work will be done for them by the wholesaler, and I have some sympathy with the wholesaler who certainly will have additional work to do in that connection.  However, the cry that has gone up throughout the land is a cry of anguish on behalf of the small trader, the small man, the man who cannot afford bookkeepers, the man who cannot afford a reduction in his margin of profit.  I have dealt with every single one of these items in my speech and I believe that what I say will stand up to analysis at any time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt in my mind at all that the operation of the turnover tax will provide a certain amount of difficulty for traders, in spite of what Deputy Seán Flanagan has just said.  He also said in the concluding part of his speech that he has dealt with this tax as it might affect the different sections of the community. There was one very important omission from his contribution to this discussion, that is, the fact that the consumer will have to pay £11 million extra per annum.  I am concerned about the small trader and the annoyance that may be caused to him but primarily I am concerned with the type of person who will have to pay the bulk of this £11 million per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some spokesmen from the Fianna Fáil Party have tried to argue about this £11 million to such a degree that it becomes absolutely dissolved and Deputy Flanagan, whether deliberately or otherwise&mdash;I am sure not deliberately&mdash;gave the impression that this £11 million would be smothered in some way or other, that RGDATA as an association or the traders themselves <Col N="578" /> could absorb it and that it would be smothered to such an extent that it would never see the light of day.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said the traders can pass on this tax.  I admit this was in the heat of the Dublin by-election when Ministers of the Government were making every type of statement in an effort to convince the people in Dublin North-East that the turnover tax was not as bad as it seemed.  The <i>Irish Press</i> of 26th May reported a statement of the Minister for Finance which was issued through the Government Information Bureau to the effect that: &ldquo;There was no obligation whatsoever on the traders to bear any portion of the new turnover tax and that they would be at liberty to pass it on to the consumer by adjusting prices or quantities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Frankly, I am at a loss to understand the method by which the members of the Fianna Fáil Party are defending this tax, and one must say they are defending it in six or seven different ways.  Questions have been posed here and have been posed by some of the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party down the country such as &ldquo;Where would we get the money? We have to get the money.&rdquo;  This is a lazy tax.  This, according to Fianna Fáil themselves, is the last straw.  This, according to Fianna Fáil, is a situation in which they have scraped the bottom of the barrel in an effort to find money.  They have admitted by everything they have said and everything that is done in this Bill that they are absolutely bereft of any proposals for the financing of State services except this turnover tax.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of tax which might be advocated by a schoolboy of eight or nine years.  If one were to pose a question to a schoolboy: &ldquo;Where would you get extra money to run the State?&rdquo; having told him that beer, tobacco and cigarettes were taxed to the limit, the glib answer that the innocent child would give would be: &ldquo;Let us tax everything.  Put two and a half per cent tax on everything and we will get plenty of money.&rdquo;  That seems to be the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Government.  This tax was hastily <Col N="579" /> thought up and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the Government, when they decided on this tax, did not have an appreciation of what repercussions there would be.</P>
    <P>I concede that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands is not a member of the inner Cabinet.  I concede that he did not know up to the time the Minister for Finance introduced his Budget proposals what in fact these Budget proposals would be but when he addressed a meeting in Roscommon, Mayo or somewhere like that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is what the people thought.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary himself never thought for a moment that every single item would bear a tax and I am sure that he did not visualise at all that the Government would go to the utmost extreme and tax foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>A justification for this tax seems to be sought in the Income Tax Commission Report but there is no justification whatsoever in that report that the Minister can plead for the introduction of this tax.  Six out of the 11 members advocated, against five of their colleagues, a sales tax or purchase tax or something of that sort, provided income tax was reduced.  The other five were against the introduction of a sales tax, even if income tax were reduced.  They were against it in any circumstances. Therefore, there is no consolation for the Minister from any of the 11 members of the Income Tax Commission in his view that there should be introduced a turnover or a sales tax.</P>

    <P>Fianna Fáil think there is some great virtue or merit in flouting the opinion of the public.  They are bound to listen to the public.  They are bound to listen to the voice that was expressed so forcibly in Dublin North-East.  The <Col N="580" /> turnover tax was the definite issue in that election.  It was a challenge that was laid down by the Opposition Parties who contested that election and it was a challenge that was accepted by the Government, the evidence being that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Justice and various other front bench members jumped into the fray in defence, or should I say in different defences, of the turnover tax, and they were soundly beaten.</P>
    <P>It may be said by members of the Government: &ldquo;We cannot be stampeded by any section of the public.&rdquo; They said they will not be stampeded by members of RGDATA.  I have no intimate knowledge of the operations of RGDATA.  If there are friends of mine in it, I am not aware they are members of it but the Government must recognise that any demonstration that was carried on by RGDATA certainly was not provoked by any political Party.  It was provoked merely by the introduction of this turnover tax, and the demonstration of resistance by RGDATA must be regarded as a spontaneous one as far as they are concerned, one that has not been prompted by any individual politician that I know of or by the political Parties, and certainly not by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are opposed to the principle of a sales tax.  They are opposed to the principle of this turnover tax which will, in fact, be a sales tax as far as the ordinary consumer is concerned.  The Government themselves in April, 1961, in their comment on the Income Taxation Commission report with regard to the turnover or sales tax resisted the idea of a sales tax for certain reasons.  I will quote the report once again:</P>
    <P>It would shift so markedly the burden of taxation from single to married taxpayers, especially those with children, and from the higher to the lower income groups, as to be in the Government's view socially undesirable.</P>
    <P>They believed then that a shift to a sales tax, to indirect taxation as against a reduction in direct taxation, would be socially undesirable, but they <Col N="581" /> seem now to have abandoned their principles in respect of that sort of tax and, as I say, in desperation introduced it because they were bereft of any other ideas to raise money to run this country and pay for the various services.</P>
    <P>It has been said here, once again by the last speaker, that the social welfare benefits will compensate.  The social welfare benefits will not compensate. Apart from that, I think it is a shocking criticism of our attitude in the matter of social welfare, a shocking reflection on us to say that in a year in which we propose in the Budget to raise an extra £15 million or £16 million, all we can give to those in receipt of assistance benefits is the same old halfcrown per week.  I remember Budgets introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government and by other Governments where extra taxation was raised to the extent of £1 million to £3 million or £4 million and a halfcrown was given to social welfare recipients.  Here we are in a situation in which we are asking all the people to pay an extra £15 million or £16 million per year and we still shell out the usual halfcrown.  We shell out the usual halfcrown in 1963, the usual increase that was given from 1948 onwards.</P>
    <P>In the words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the increase in children's allowances will not compensate. He gave the example of the man with £10 per week, and with two children; he assumed he would spend 75 per cent of his income on articles that would be subject to the turnover tax.  Of course a man in that category, a man with £10 per week, would spend, in my opinion, much more than the 75 per cent the Minister says he would. He said that, even if he did spend 75 per cent of his £10 per week, he would be spending an extra 3/6 in this turnover tax, but that he would be compensated to the extent of 2/3.  He went on to say that a three-child family would get an increase of 3/3 per week, but he admits the breadwinner in that family would be spending more than the 3/3 compensation he would get by way of children's allowances.</P>
    <P>One thing that is forgotten in all this is the fact that these workers to <Col N="582" /> whom the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred will have to pay something like ninepence to one shilling extra towards the social insurance fund beginning from 1st January next. That is the category of man and family that can be given as an example in trying to demonstrate the justice, or injustice, of the turnover tax, but we are concerned also with the tens of thousands of other people who do not have £10 per week, who have not even £9, or £8, or £7 or £6 per week.  We are concerned about the people who are now forced to exist on wages of £6, or less.  We are concerned about the people who are dependent on social welfare benefits and the people who are dependent on social assistance. We are concerned about them because this turnover tax says that for every single thing they buy, especially in the line of foodstuffs and clothing and fuel, they will have to pay, if the traders, and they will undoubtedly take the advice of the Minister for Finance and pass on this tax, pass on this tax on practically every single thing they buy, apart from the money they may pay out in rent.</P>
    <P>This is done to some extent in the name of encouraging people to save rather than spend.  I think it is rather a joke, and somewhat ludicrous, to suggest that an old age pensioner, or an agricultural worker, or a forestry worker, or a road worker should be subject to this turnover tax in order that he may save out of the £6 per week the Agricultural Wages Board allows him, or out of the £6 10s. or the £6 15s. the Minister for Local Government says must not be increased in the case of the road worker, or out of the wages of the forestry worker whose wages are restricted by the decision of the Minister for Lands.  Will this be an encouragement for such a worker to eat less bread, less butter, buy fewer clothes, in order that he may put something into the bank or post office?  The Minister for Finance quoted what the Labour Party in Great Britain do in respect of the purchase tax there.  He ought to read page 12 of the report entitled <i>Direct Taxation</i> in which it is stated that the purchase tax as administered <Col N="583" /> at the present time in Great Britain varies in its rates as applied to different commodities from five per cent up to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, legitimate criticism to say that it is both inequitable and unjust that there should be a 2½ per cent tax on bread and the same 2½ per cent on a motor car, a fur coat, or some item of jewellery.  If they want to operate the tax as the Parliamentary Secretary wants them to operate it, they would be much nearer his policy if they adopted something like the British system rather than the lazy, inept method they are using now: we will tax everything because it is the simplest thing to do.  They seem to be determined not alone to go against public opinion in persisting in going through with this tax, but they do it against the view of the Income Taxation Commission.  They do it against the view of at least five of the members of that Commission who, as I had occasion to point out before, represent by far the vast majority of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil do not seem to be concerned about the opinion of the vast majority of the people of Ireland but seem to be concerned merely to stay on for another while in the hope that next year might improve&mdash;until, I suggest, they see the benefits that will undoubtedly be reaped from this tax if it is passed here this week, benefits to such an extent that they may have a substantial surplus next year.  I suggest that is what they are budgeting for.  They will penalise the people now by introducing this tax so that, prior to a snap election, they may have largesse to throw around.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that this turnover tax will not have any great effect on the cost of living but I cannot understand how anyone can argue like that.  The Minister for Finance in May said that this turnover tax may be passed on and there was no obligation on any trader to bear it.  That means that people are going to have to pay more for the various articles they buy to the tune of £11 million.  It is not merely a tax of 2½ per cent which the people will have to pay.  In any case that the trader will be expected to pay 2½ per cent, say on £100, the cost will now be £102 10s. to the purchaser.  That will represent a turnover of £102 10s. in respect of that particular commodity. Will he also be expected to pay 2½ <Col N="585" /> per cent on the £102 10s., which means in effect the amount that will be passed on, if the trader is to recoup himself, must of necessity be more than 2½ per cent?  We have to contrast all the effects of this tax with the cost of living and we must relate it to wages.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate on the White Paper, <i>Closing the Gap</i>, it was said that it was not a pay pause, that it was merely a painting of a picture and a forecast as to how the economy might best be protected.  We know now that what we said then has come true and there is in fact a wages or salary standstill order in respect of Government and semi-Government employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If you would follow Mr. Wilson in other things, perhaps I would listen to you.  If the cost of living is to be increased, surely the trade unions will not be expected to sit back and bear this increase and the various other increases, such as the increase in insurance stamps and other increases I have mentioned.  The workers are asked to sit back and bear this turnover tax and to heed the admonition of the Government that they are expected to refrain from seeking wage increases.  This is a hastily-conceived tax; it is a lazy tax and demonstrates that the Government are in fact lost for ideas for raising money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is suggested that the Opposition should disclose their hand in that respect, we should always take the example of the Taoiseach who, when he was in Opposition, said that it was not the business of an Opposition to provide solutions for a Government, that it was the Government's responsibility to make proposals and that it was the duty and the business of the Opposition to criticise.  If we should happen to be in government some day, that will be our responsibility. If others are in government, that is their responsibility, to make proposals in regard to taxation.  It is Fianna Fáil's responsibility now.  It is our <Col N="586" /> duty to be critical of them.  As far as we can see, this is a bad tax and it is going to have a detrimental effect, especially on the poor people and on salary and wage earners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan has revived today the Fianna Fáil thesis of the Dublin North-East by-election, that is, that this tax is designed to raise in a full year between £10 million and £11 million but that nobody will have to pay.  That was refined in the course of the by-election campaign into a statement that the shopkeeper would have to pay.  While that declaration was being made at one street corner by Fianna Fáil spokesmen, at an adjoining corner the Minister for Finance was declaiming that there was no obligation on any shopkeeper to pay any part of it and the proposal was to pass it all on to the consumer.  Deputy Seán Flanagan says today that according to his estimate, the consumer will not have to pay anything at all.  The Minister for Finance says that the consumer will have to pay and that he has taken the precaution to make provision for increased social services designed to offset the increase in the cost of living that recipients of social welfare benefits will have to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the dirty elements of this tax.  It is not merely a lazy tax; it is a dishonest tax.  It is the first time that a Government have ever come into this House ashamed to tell the people where a tax proposed by them is designed to fall.  They are ashamed to tell the people that they mean the tax to fall on the essential commodities without which ordinary people cannot survive.  They are ashamed to reveal to the people what the Minister for Finance himself blurted out in the course of the earlier stages of this Bill, that unless this tax fell on food, fuel and footwear, it would not yield the return that he requires.  Of course, it is going to result in an increase in the cost of living and, of course, that is going to have inevitable consequences. We are told, on the one hand, by Government spokesmen, led by the Taoiseach, that all must be on the alert to ensure low costs and make ourselves more competitive in the <Col N="587" /> export markets into which we have to face in order to maintain our balance of trade in the years ahead.  Does anybody suggest, when there will be an increase in the cost of living, to offset which the Minister has declared it will be necessary to provide extra social benefits, that we are going to secure in this society a wages stability which is so essential for the maintenance of low costs and a competitive position in the export markets in which we trade? Nobody but a lunatic would imagine that that was so, unless he believed we are prepared to embark on a protracted period of reduction of the general standard of living for the purpose of claiming a greater degree of competitiveness in the export capacity which we have hitherto enjoyed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that there is delay in supplying dentures to some applicants in the Waterford Health Authority area, more particularly in the city portion of the area. This is due to the fact that in accordance with accepted policy the services of the dentists are concentrated mainly on the provision of services for children and that until recently the full approved <Col N="592" /> complement of dental staff was not available to the health authority.</P>
      <P>Four dentists are now employed wholetime by the health authority and in addition a post of senior dental surgeon is being filled through the Local Appointments Commission.  It is expected that when this latter post is filled in the near future the delay in the supply of dentures will be considerably reduced.</P>

      <P>On 1st instant, the Cork Health Authority requested my approval to a proposal to acquire from the Cork County Council the site of a former pump-house premises at Douglas for the purpose of converting these premises into a dispensary for the district.  I presume this is the proposal to which the Deputy refers.  On 6th instant the health authority submitted a plan showing the alterations they propose to enable the premises to be used as a dispensary.  This plan does not include provision for caretaker's accommodation.  No estimate of the cost of the proposal has been submitted.</P>
      <P>I have made arrangements for an early inspection of the property in question to ascertain its suitability for the purpose envisaged and a decision in the matter will be conveyed to the health authority as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As stated in the booklet outlining the proposals for the turnover tax, there may be special problems for retailers in passing on the tax on prepackaged goods and on commodities sold in small quantities at standard prices.  The Revenue Commissioners are having discussions with manufacturers and wholesalers in order to obtain their co-operation in ensuring that the tax operates smoothly.  They have suggested&mdash;and it is a suggestion with which I fully agree&mdash;that in very many cases the retailers' difficulties would be met by adjustments in the weight or size of the manufactured product or by an appropriate alteration in the price recommended by the manufacturer for the retail sale of his product.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Turnover tax will be <Col N="602" /> charged on the total receipts form taxable activities, and not on the sale of individual items.  Where the retailer of newspapers is registered, he will be charged on the receipts from the sale of newspapers, along with the receipts from the sale of other goods.  If the newspaper seller is not registered, the supplier will be liable to tax on his receipts.  Persons whose receipts from the sale of goods do not exceed £500 per month may elect not to register.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have had discussions with representatives of the main newspaper publishers in this country and with the distributors of imported newspapers with the object of establishing procedures for enabling retailers and others concerned to provide for the tax.  These discussions are continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement to which the Deputies refer.  The firms established in the Shannon Industrial Estate operate on a commercial basis and they enjoy the same freedom of action in relation to transport as firms established elsewhere in the State.  At present air freight costs for some commodities are substantially higher than for surface transport but it follows that as the disparity between transport costs becomes less, firms will avail to an increasing extent of air transport.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company is actively engaged both in promoting freight facilities at Shannon and endeavouring to secure the best possible air transport terms for goods produced at Shannon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the future of Shannon Airport is to a great extent bound up with the expansion of the freight trade, and is it not a fact also that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, into which millions of the taxpayers' money <Col N="606" /> has been poured, was set up mainly to encourage the use of air transport for the carriage of freight?

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a similar question by Deputy Corish on 22nd May.  The ordinary rates of employment contributions payable under the Social Welfare Acts, and the lower rate applicable to males employed in agriculture, give cover for a wide range of benefits, apart altogether from unemployment benefit, and I can find no justification for the introduction of a lower rate of contribution for boys of 16 years of age.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar Question asked by him on 26th June.  Since then extensive tests and enquiries have been made and the results indicate that a satisfactory standard of service is being given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know exactly in what manner the Deputy was making the term applicable.  I know now he is making it applicable to the automatic exchange itself.  I have told the Deputy in my reply that extensive tests and inquiries have been made and the results indicate that a satisfactory standard of service is being maintained at the exchanges named by the Deputy in his question.  An officer of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs visited the exchanges in question and made a number of tests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say the Minister is being unreasonable in his answers in these matters.  The truth is that there is a very substantial difference between what the Post Office technicians call a satisfactory service and what the subscribers are getting. Proof of that is to be found in the fact that the Post Office recently had to change some subscribers from the Curragh when they needed to dial 10&mdash; all indicating that there was something wrong with the mechanism at the exchange.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not indicate that at all.  Hitherto Curragh subscribers dialling 10 were answered at Dublin.  That system has been changed because of further work that has been done in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something basically wrong with the mechanism in both the Curragh and the Newbridge exchanges.  Will the Minister keep the matter under observation with a view to providing a better service?</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1963&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Section 46, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was drawing the attention of the House to the fact that, despite Deputy Seán Flanagan's optimistic prognostications, the Minister for Finance anticipates there will be an increase in the cost of living.  He says to protect the recipients of social welfare benefits from the impact of that rise in the cost of living, he is making special provision for increases in old age pensions, widows' pensions and other benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this increase in the cost of living ensues, the inevitable result will be a general rise in the costs of production, with special reference to industrial production, with a consequent diminution <Col N="620" /> in our competitive capacity in the export markets, in which we are finding it progressively more and more difficult to operate profitably.  We already have an adverse trade balance of £105 million plus for the past 12 months of our trade.  If our competitive capacity for industrial exports is injured by this new taxation, the prospect of our reducing that adverse trade balance grows more and more remote.</P>
    <P>I am aware it has been the philosophy of Fianna Fáil for some years to have no regard to the cost of living and to say simply that it must be allowed to rise.  But, sooner or later, the people of this country must reconcile themselves to the fact that, if we are to compete in foreign markets for industrial goods, unless we keep costs of production down, we shall be completely blotted out of foreign markets, more especially if these foreign markets become more and more automated in their industrial processes, which reduces their dependence on paid labour.  In effect, this creates a situation in which their machines are competing with our men.</P>
    <P>The more we raise the cost of living to our own society, the more we increase the inevitable costs of labour and personal service of every kind, with a consequent increase in our costs of production and a reduction in our competitive capacity.  These facts are so elementary and obvious that it should not be necessary to reiterate them in this House, but the Budget proposed by the Government, the Finance Bill, with special reference to the section we are now discussing, all contribute to an increase in costs which is going to injure the economic life of this country, in my submission, very gravely.</P>
    <P>The true evil of this tax is that it operates to increase the cost of living. But the passing of this increased cost to the consumer is not altogether a simple operation.  It is going to wreak a good deal of havoc in the process of being passed on.  Is there any reasonable Deputy who accepts it as equitable that, if you are dealing with a shopkeeper doing a business of £250 a year in a grocery shop, this turnover tax is the equivalent of going to that <Col N="621" /> shopkeeper and telling him that as and from 1st November, he will be charged corporation profits tax at the rate of 62½ per cent before income tax?  We go on to say to him in so far as he is able to pass it on to the customer, but the net result of that notice to a great many medium-sized shopkeepers&mdash;all of whom are employing a certain number of assistants &mdash;will be a notice to quit.  They simply will not be able to carry on.</P>
    <P>This morning, a Fianna Fáil Deputy said it was illusory to suggest to shopkeepers that they would be subjected to repeated inquisitions by inspectors of the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not think that is true.  I think the Revenue Commissioners must, in the discharge of their duties, conduct a very strict inquisition.  At present the whole basis of the collection of income tax is founded on the certified accounts of chartered accountants.  In the vast majority of cases, the Revenue Commissioners accept such accounts as adequate evidence of the true profit earned by a business firm for the purpose of assessing income tax.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that shopkeepers who get these certified accounts for the purposes of income tax will have them accepted by the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of the turnover tax.  But those who know rural Ireland know that the vast majority of shopkeepers there do not employ chartered accountants at all.  They have now two alternatives.  One is to settle with the Revenue Commissioners themselves their monthly liability to turnover tax, or else employ&mdash;at considerable expense&mdash; chartered accountants to prepare returns and certify them to the Revenue Commissioners.  In either event, the cost in time and in convenience, and indeed in money, is a very substantial item for a small businessman.</P>
    <P>This whole proposal strikes me as being so grotesquely unjust that I find it hard, understanding it intimately as I do, fully to express to the House how unfair it is.  Many Fianna Fáil Deputies may profess to misunderstand the demonstration of 10,000 shopkeepers <Col N="622" /> against the tax in Dublin. They did not come here for fun and they are not the type of people who ordinarily resort to public demonstration. Deputy Seán Flanagan was the first Fianna Fáil Deputy frankly to admit that, to his personal knowledge, a great part of the demonstrating shopkeepers had been ardent supporters of Fianna Fáil.  They did not come to demonstrate for any political purpose but because they feel they are being unfairly treated.  I believe that if Deputies will wake up to the fact that in a grocer's shop this tax represents the equivalent of a corporation profits tax of 62 ½ per cent on all profits, they will realise that a very savage injustice is being done.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the outrage being perpetrated on this considerable body of respectable citizens, I suppose there are Deputies who have asked what is to become of them?  If some go, will not others benefit?  I think that is true. This will accelerate the pace at which the ordinary shop will disappear in favour of the multiple self-service shop which tends to grow in our cities and country towns.  It is true that the collection of this tax is much simpler for a self-service shop operated by a large corporation such as those at present arriving from Britain and buying up sites all over this country.</P>
    <P>As another Deputy pointed out, under the self-service system, a customer collects her parcels and on leaving at the door, has her bill made up. In the course of that transaction, it is relatively easy for the self-service store to pass on this cost by adding 2 ½ per cent to the total bill.  On the contrary, the average shop involving personal service is obliged to quote prices for each article purchased by the customer and, in effect, finds it progressively more and more difficult to collect the tax.  If it were physically possible for many of these people to absorb the tax, I am sure in defence of their own trade they would try to do so, but it is economically impossible for a grocer to absorb a corporation profits tax of 62 ½ per cent and survive.</P>
    <P>A great many will not survive and we shall have the pleasant feeling of <Col N="623" /> having eliminated a number of our neighbours from their traditional livelihood, the pleasant achievement to our credit of having broken up a considerable number of respectable families in rural Ireland who have earned their living in the distributive trade.  We shall have the satisfaction of knowing that we have put out of jobs a number of assistants.  Some will be young men and women but many will be people in middle age who will find adaptation of their lives to the new regime a matter of considerable difficulty.  To those who are, in any degree, familiar with rural life particularly, and urban life also, these are prospects that cause considerable concern.  They carry conviction to my mind that the whole proposal is iniquitous and unjust.</P>
    <P>As Leader of this Party I want to deal with the silly propaganda propagated by Fianna Fáil who begin by saying that this tax raises £10.5 million.  It is said that this money is needed&mdash;where do the Opposition propose to get it, if not through the turnover tax?  The answer is perfectly simple.  I do not believe that it costs or should cost £63 million per annum more to run the country in 1963 than in 1957.  If this tax is implemented, it means that the Exchequer is receiving £63 million pounds per annum more than it received in 1957.  I want an opportunity to examine that figure.</P>
    <P>I assume that Fianna Fáil Deputies are aware that there is no greater crime in politics than that of the Minister for Finance or Government colleague who would disclose Budget secrets before Budget Day.  I assume Fianna Fáil Deputies know that more than one British Chancellor of the Exchequer has been forced to resign from public life as a result of such revelations.  And the reason is simple: if such revelations were permitted, the opportunities for individuals greatly to enrich themselves as a result of advance information would be multiplied. They can so enrich themselves because they, as individuals can anticipate the tax as nobody else can but it follows from that, that if everybody can anticipate every sort of revenue contemplated <Col N="624" /> by a Government, then that form of revenue produces nothing at all.</P>
    <P>If it is true that after an examination and assessment of the national resources, it is necessary to raise this money, there are many ways in which a Government can tax but none is productive if announced six months in advance, thus giving everybody an opportunity of evading or defeating it. As I said, and I want to repeat, having given most careful examination to this whole problem, I am satisfied that if additional revenue was necessary there are at least four possible methods open to the Government, and two of them were rejected by this Government in favour of this infamous tax.  I say that without the advantage of any prior consultation with the experts of the Department of Finance or with the Revenue Commissioners whose business it is to submit proposals to the Minister for Finance when an increase in revenue is necessary for the essential purposes of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am aware that no rational Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party or indeed of any other Party in this House is ignorant of the facts which I am now stating.  I am aware that that will not prevent the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party continuing to thump tubs and proclaim that unless the Opposition are prepared to offer a substitute for this tax proposal, they are not in good faith.  I want to tell some of these Fianna Fáil Deputies who still retain some remnant of conscience even after their association with the Party to which they now belong, that that kind of conduct degrades themselves and does a genuine disservice to democratic politics in this country.  Any arguments put forward by a responsible public man which he knows himself to be fraudulent in some measure degrades the public life to which we all belong.</P>
    <P>I want to recall again a further evil element in this tax.  It is a tax which, according to the Government's White Paper on Direct Taxation laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 19th April, 1961, operates to place an additional burden on persons in the <Col N="625" /> lower income ranges.  &ldquo;It bears more heavily on married couples, especially those with family responsibilities.  A sales tax,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;might tend to have an inflationary effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, that is not the end of it. It was Deputy Colley who directed our attention to another interesting characteristic of this tax.  He pointed out that it had one beautiful quality: it had no point of diminishing return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy?  Deputy Dillon made that point previously.  He must be attributing somebody else's speech to me because I did not say that.</P>

      <P>I read the Deputy's speeches with close attention.  They are usually worth reading and, as I say, he suffers from the very serious handicap of sitting where he does, but when he talks, he often drifts apart from the Fianna Fáil Party line, being fundamentally an honest man.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Colley this tax has in it that great danger to the lower income groups in our society, that unlike the tax on tobacco, unlike the tax on spirits or on beer, this tax has virtually no point of diminishing return. This tax is to fall mainly on food, fuel and clothing.  The point of diminishing returns for this tax is when our people are in rags or when our people are hungry or when our people are cold, and until that time comes, there is no prospect of diminution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I unfairly misinterpret the Deputy when I point out that the logical sequence of his thought is that other taxes have a point of diminishing return, that this tax has in it the exquisite quality that its only point of diminishing return is when our people are in rags and experience hunger or are cold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather different from what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the logical sequence of the Deputy's thought.</P>
      <P>The attractive facet of this tax is supposed to be that it bears on all the place where the diminution of the yield will begin is when those least able to afford it can bear the burden no more, and it is perfectly certain that the diminution in yield from consumption must begin amongst the people with the lowest income.  They are the people who will first know cold, who will first know rags and patches, who will first know hunger in some degree, and it will be long after they have become familiar with such things that the well-to-do in this country will begin to cut down on their purchases of food, fuel and clothing.</P>
      <P>Do we want a tax of that kind of application?  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands did not want it.  He spoke to the Boyle Dáilcheanntar a fortnight before the Budget was introduced and he said: &ldquo;There are ill-intentioned people travelling throughout the country traducing Dr. Ryan, a mild and kindly man and a patriot to boot.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the very tone of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands who went on to say that this gentle heart had in contemplation nothing but a tax on jewels, furs and luxuries.  &ldquo;I want to warn you&rdquo; he said &ldquo;that evilly-disposed people will misread his intention and when they do, remember they are anti-national&rdquo;. He has changed his tune. That is poor Deputy Colley's difficulty. He is not so supple and finds it harder to change his tune than the Parliamentary Secretary.  This is perhaps one of the reasons why he is not a parliamentary secretary.  He should watch Deputy Lenihan's supple performance because he is now as passionately concerned to defend the tax as just and good as he was to condemn, when speaking to his own constituents, as the nightmare of a diseased mind any attempt to traduce the reputation of this mild and gentle patriot, Deputy Dr. Ryan, who would never dream of anything so evil as a sales tax of general application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not read the Parliamentary Secretary's speech but I trust Deputy Dillon's version of it is more accurate than his version of what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will find, on reflection, that both versions I have given to the House are substantially accurate and revealing.  What makes me a little uncomfortable&mdash;and for the moment I am not referring to Deputy Colley&mdash;is how does a man like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands reconcile this with his conscience?  How does he go back to Boyle Dáilcheanntar and say to them: &ldquo;Everything I told you this week-end I now want to deny.  I told you a tax such as is now proposed was unthinkable.  I want to deny that now and to say that it is sound public policy.  I told you that the present Minister for Finance was the kind of man who would never dream of such a piece of legislation.  I want to tell you now that <Col N="628" /> he has begotten and given birth to this horror amongst us.&rdquo;  He will remind the people of Boyle that he said this was something for which the Fianna Fáil Government could never stand, and that anybody who said they would defend such propositions was anti-national. How will he rebut that charge?  He must go back to Boyle and do in Boyle all the things he said represent treason to the State.  But he will do it.  It often makes me wonder what does it mean to be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>I remember in the old days we used to hear from old men the famine song, but it was always a song that was sung in derision: &ldquo;They sold their souls for penny rolls and lumps of hairy bacon&rdquo;. I wonder would I be unduly severe on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands if I said that it appeared to me that, comparing his performance today with his asseverations of a month ago, he has sold his soul for a penny roll and a lump of hairy bacon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from what the Parliamentary Secretary does or says, or does not do or does not say, this fact remains: if this tax is implemented, a number of decent business people in this country will be driven out of business. If this tax is implemented, the remainder, who stay in, will be under a permanent compulsion either to get certified accounts prepared for the Revenue Commissioners or to submit to pretty regular monthly or bimonthly inquisition by the officers of the Revenue Commissioners who test their returns.  The fact remains that the practice of self-service stores will grow to take the place of the existing shops driven out of business and these self-service stores, operating on a very narrow margin of profit, cannot afford to carry out of their profits a corporation profits tax of 62½ per cent, which is what this tax represents.  It will, therefore, be passed on to the public with two consequential results: first, the cost of living will resume its upward trend, with the inevitable increase in our costs of production and the consequences that will have upon our foreign trade.  But there is another <Col N="629" /> consequence of an increase in the cost of living which I regard as just as grave and which the Fianna Fáil Party only too readily try to forget.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of small farmers in this country who are working up to 14 hours a day and whose incomes are not going to expand, for they are virtually fixed by the measure of subsidy available from the Treasury to maintain their existing levels of reward. All of them will bear the impact of this increase in the cost of living.  It is one more twist of the screw to bring them lower down the scale than they have been heretofore.  I know that some of the new philosophers of the Fianna Fáil Party believe that it is a good thing to sweep them off the land.  I know that certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party accept the philosophy of the infamous Lord Lucan&mdash;the &ldquo;great exterminator&rdquo; is how he is known.  He believed that the right solution for Irish agrarian difficulties was to clear the people off the land, divide the land up into 500 acre holdings, and then hire the people back to work as servants on their own homes under Scotch factors.  Our people's grandfathers took him up on that and, when the dust died down, it was Lord Lucan who was gone and our people who remained.  Now the grandsons of these people are to be told that their standard of living is too low, but we are going to make it lower still because the money is needed and there is no other way to get it except through their food, through their fuel and their clothing.  It is from that source we will take it in ever-growing degree and, if they cannot meet the charge, why, then, let them clear off the land and make way for those who can work it more economically.</P>
    <P>I think you are all gone daft.  You are living in a kind of foolish fairyland. The fact that the Taoiseach's countenance appears on the covers of <i>Time</i> intoxicates you all.  The opinion of any rambling correspondent of an American news magazine, who lands here for a fortnight and takes a photograph of the Taoiseach, his children and his grandchildren, and all the whole nice party, holding forth upon us, persuades you everything in the <Col N="630" /> garden is lovely and that you have earned the approbation of those who count.

      <P>It was not my intention to intervene but I felt I had to do so after listening to the leader of the main Opposition Party and his usual dishonest tactics and his failure to discuss this on its merits without dragging the names of the Taoiseach and his family across the floor of the House.  It was unworthy conduct, far from gentlemanly conduct.  We would like to have listened to a constructive debate, but this was a personal attack, first, on the Minister for Finance and then on foreign correspondents who come here.  I am sure if foreign correspondents visited Deputy Dillon, he would also receive them but of course there is no such thing as clean debating in this House with a few Deputies. All they can do is to introduce filth and personalities.  That is the leader of the Opposition, the gentleman who is supposed to be Taoiseach one day, by misrepresentation.  They are trying it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was shedding tears <Col N="632" /> for the people and talking about what they are going to suffer because of this turnover tax.  What did the people suffer when he was a Minister in the inter-Party Government in 1957, when we had to take over the Government? What did the workers, the poor people, the old age pensioners, trades people and farmers suffer?  As far as the farmers were concerned, there was no money for the relief of rates or for grants or loans.  We are facing our responsibilities and if we are beaten by the people because of a decision which we have taken in the national interest, we will go down with our colours flying and we will come back again.  We are not going to run away from our responsibilities and we have never done so.  We put the national interest first.  We are not taking away the purchasing power of the people. We are leaving it with them.  We are trying to spread the taxes as fairly as possible over every section in order to ensure that the national prosperity will be safe during our time and for posterity.</P>
    <P>We have to listen to the double dealings of that gentleman over there. Recently I asked a number of questions about promises which he made at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis.  If all his promises were put into operation it would cost approximately £77 millions. To illustrate the dishonesty that is going on, may I point out that he was going to do this without increasing taxation at all, supported of course by the Labour Party.  Of course they are not a Labour Party at all.  They should move over with Fine Gael.</P>

Today he tells us that we are going to put the small farmers out of business and that we are going to put people off the land.  We are a national organisation concerned with every section of the people, irrespective of class or creed, and we want to leave this country better than we found it.</P>

He is going to give the farmers £1,000 free of tax.  I should like to see them getting £10,000 if the State could afford it, but that is the kind of hypocrisy we get from Fine Gael and from the tail of Fine Gael, which is the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>You will get it now. This has been referred to as a purchase tax.  Deputy Sweetman went into the matter very carefully this morning and said it was an additional tax.  I am not opposed to taxation but I am certainly opposed to any tax on foodstuffs and I will stick to that, regardless of the consequences.  The decision to have a sales tax was a wise decision.  A sales tax operates in the United States and Deputy Sweetman gave quotations from the United States and Canada when dealing with the matter earlier and said that it had been increased from three per cent to four per cent.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that by virtue of the fact that we have not got the same monetary system as these countries, it would create great difficulty here.  My suggestion to the Minister is that there is nothing to stop us adopting the system of tokens which is used in America in the transport undertakings. A person could buy three hundred of these tokens for 21/- which is the equivalent of three dollars.  It would only cost a trifle to set up such a system and the housewife would then be able to purchase these tokens to take care of her small expenses.  We tried that system in Limerick in 1920 and I am sure it would get rid of all the difficulties for the shopkeepers who may have to bring in an accountant or to employ additional staff.  The fact that we have not got the decimal system here should not give the Department of Finance any headache at all.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion on which I spoke on this matter, I said that a man with six or seven children can buy a pair of shoes for one child this week and for another child next week, but he cannot stop their appetites.  The same amount has to go out every week for food and there is no avoiding it. Why did we have the recent demonstrations in the city of Dublin?  We had them because these people were making the only legal protest they could against the increase in food prices.  Under this tax, you are going to increase the cost of clothing, food and fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not opposed to the raising of <Col N="636" /> taxation.  There are many mothers now who decide to purchase a washing machine in order to save labour.  Tax that, by all means.  Tax bicycles and all the things that are not absolutely necessary.  We are Teachtaí Dála; we are messengers to this House from the people and the people's message is that they do not want this tax on food.  I have heard no complaint from anybody except about the tax on food.</P>
    <P>The Minister has now become aware of the wisdom of introducing PAYE. It now amounts to 4s. 9d. in the £ and I do not think there would be any outcry if that figure were raised by 2½ per cent.  I do not think there would be any great outcry if it were increased by 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not detain the House very long on these occasions and I have no wish to indulge in the type of debate that is becoming all too common in this House.  If the Minister and his experts would consider the suggestions I have made, they would eliminate any necessity for the facetious suggestion by the Tánaiste, a former Minister for Finance, that the manufacturers take a match out of each box to meet this turnover tax.  I know that facetiousness is indulged in <i>ad lib</i> in this House but I would point out that this occasion is much too serious for that type of facetiousness.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman made a serious contribution to the debate today.  He went into the problems involved as a Minister for Finance would do, possibly anticipating that he himself would be in that position in the near future.  It is contributions of that description that people want to hear, not this harking back to 1957.  Sometimes I wonder if Deputies are not skipping a century and referring to 1847.  There is a saying in the west: &ldquo;We never died a winter yet.&rdquo;  Neither did we die in 1957.  There are many ways of producing the money needed without taxing foodstuffs and I think the Minister for Finance would do well to listen to the cry of the people in that respect.</P>

      <P>Irrespective of cost, the people have to suffer for it.  You might remember what day this is, what took place on this day.  It was the establishment of the right of the people of this country to govern this country.  The Parliamentary Secretary said he had got a mandate to govern the country.  If the Fianna Fáil Party think they are the masters of the Irish people, they are making a sorry and a sad mistake.  &ldquo;We have a mandate to govern&rdquo;, the Parliamentary Secretary said.  What they mean is that if they do not stick together at the bottom of the barrel, that is the end of them. That is what the Parliamentary Secretary meant and that is why the only concern of the Fianna Fáil Party and those who tack themselves on to them now is to make novenas that this debate will finish quickly and that this Dáil will be adjourned, not dissolved. This is a bad tax.  Mind you, the Irish people may not at times be vocal, may <Col N="639" /> not at times express clearly what they desire to be done, but they are the last people in the world one should try to cod.</P>

The shopkeepers were told : &ldquo;You pass that tax on to the long-suffering poor people of Ireland: pass it on&rdquo;.  At the same time, the Minister for Justice was saying to the people: &ldquo;We are imposing no taxation on the price of bread or anything else.&rdquo;  They were too cute: they were far too cute, but they did not cod the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;neither the shopkeepers nor anyone else.  I suggest that one of the things wrong with this tax is that it is not fair and I mean fair from a taxation point of view.  It will not be borne by all sections of the people equally.  Its impact will be inequitable and it is therefore socially unjust.  I should like to explain what I have in mind.  I say it will have a different impact on different payers and accountable persons, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many shopkeepers in this country who run two or three lines. They may have a grocery business attached to a bar trade or attached to a drapery business.  Many of these &mdash;I do not say all of them&mdash;particularly the bar cum grocery, will decide &mdash;I know they have decided in many places&mdash;to carry the grocery items at the same price and to carry the turnover tax in the bar.  The customers will not like it.  However, if there are two or three publicans in a small village and they all agree to do the same thing, it will be carried on all right.  But what will the effect be on the two or three other small grocery shops?  They will have no other line. If the bar of soap continues to be sold in the shop that has a licence at 1/4d and, across the way, by reason of the turnover tax, it must be sold at 1/5d, and if other grocery items <Col N="641" /> are increased in that way, the inevitable result will be that the shopkeeper with the single line cannot compete and must close up.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have expressed surprise because, up and down the country, vehemently, with determination, all sections of those engaged in the retail trade, even dyed-in-the-wool supporters of Fianna Fáil, have expressed their determination to oppose this tax. One reason is that it is inequitable. Some 25,000 or 30,000 small grocery shops that have no other line will find now, with conditions as bad as they are, that they cannot compete against the other shop immediately beside them which, by reason of the more general kind of trade done there, can carry the grocery items and carry the turnover tax without increasing prices. That is why this tax is unfair.  That was part of the thought that went into its formation.</P>
    <P>There is no obligation on any shopkeeper to pass on the tax.  The only shopkeeper who will pass on the tax is the one who has to do it&mdash;the shopkeeper who can find no other way of retaining his trade and meeting his liabilities to the Revenue Commissioners. That is the small, single-line shop and that represents 25,000 or 30,000 tiny little businesses in this country.  Maybe they should not be there.  I suppose these new masters of the Irish race will say that.  Maybe they are some sort of residue from bygone days.  Even so, they are there. They are maintaining to some degree a small family or perhaps maintaining in frugal comfort a mother or a father, the rest of whose family have already gone away.  These are being pushed out of business by this tax. They cannot compete.  That is why this tax is unfair.  It is inequitable.  It is socially unjust.</P>
    <P>That is why, last week, some 10,000 or 15,000 big and small shopkeepers came up here, peacefully, constitutionally, to demonstrate their determination, to express their opposition to this tax.  I saw them and I hope Fianna Fáil Deputies saw them.  I hope they recognised amongst their numbers many former supporters of Fianna Fáil.  That is why the Fianna <Col N="642" /> Fáil Party at the moment have butterflies in the stomach.  They know well their organisation has gone to pieces&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of what new tax might be proposed by any Government, it would be bound to be criticised. Certainly, if a Government were in a position to ask for the views of any section in relation to any tax initially proposed, there would be a reaction against it.  Most people are fundamentally fair and reasonable.  If the <Col N="643" /> Government felt they could make a case that the money was needed and if the people felt there had been a careful watch on national expenditure and requirements and that the end result was that a particular sum of money had to be obtained, then fairminded people would begin to examine whether the way in which the money was to be raised was the proper way or not.</P>
    <P>I want to apply that to the case now made by the Government for this tax. It would not be in order for me to discuss whether the case made originally in the Budget, that the yield from this tax of £10 million or £12 million is needed, is correct or not.  I must assume for the moment it is.  I suggest that, if that is so, the fairer way of introducing a broadly-based purchase tax is to tax every article as it is received by the retail trade.  If that is done, the loaf of bread, the tin of peas, the small article in the grocery and other lines will go into the shop at precisely the same price.</P>

      <P>That is just the point.  Deputy Lemass makes the case for me.  That is part of the duplicity behind your tax.  You speak with two tongues.  You say you are not taxing and then you say you are.  With a tax imposed in that way, it follows that the article will be dearer.  There is no doubt about it.  The result will be the same in either case.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary wants to say something? If the taxation were imposed at the source in that way, the people would know.  There would be no concealment. You would know, to the extent of whatever the percentage might be, how much an article had advanced in price.  It might not be popular, but there would be no concealment whatever.  As far as the retail trade are concerned, they would carry on.  Everybody would be equal.  The ordinary rules of competition would apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> What is happening now is that the same result is going to be achieved.  All these things are to go up in price&mdash;some of them, in the grocery line particularly, a great deal more than 2½ per cent, because the percentage there at present is so slim that this imposition is bound to have a disastrous result on food prices.  At the same time as that is happening, Government Deputies will be going around their constituencies saying: &ldquo;We are not taxing anything.&rdquo;  That is double dealing as well as double speaking.  It is dishonest and cowardly, but the very pleasing thing about it is that it fools no one. It is because it fools no one that the Taoiseach is afraid to take either a midday or a midnight journey to the Phoenix Park.</P>

      <P>It is easy to sympathise with Fianna Fáil Deputies at present.  This proposal is contrary to the views of the people.  It is understandable it should be so.  The tax itself will have an unfair impact.  If it had to be imposed, it could have been imposed in a different and fairer way. Whatever the position may be, I have little doubt that, if this tax is operated, it will cause considerable dislocation of our economy and will have a very serious impact on living costs.  For that reason, I read with interest, and indeed with some admiration, what I thought was the noble stand being taken by a Deputy who tabled an amendment dealing with the impact of this tax on an essential article of food, namely, the bread of the poor.</P>

I do not see that amendment on the Order Paper now, but it is worth referring to the fact that the Deputy who tabled it will have his opportunity today, not merely of saying he is tabling an amendment of that kind and getting due publicity for it, but of having the courage of his convictions and of walking into the Lobbies and saving the bread of the poor of this city from being increased in price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it should be reiterated here that we got from the Irish people last October 12 months a mandate to govern this country.  Implicit in that is the adoption of whatever measures of taxation or otherwise we deem essential from time to time to carry on the programme of expansion which was the main platform in our election campaign in 1961.  That programme of expansion has achieved a considerable degree of success and the second <i>Programme of Economic Expansion</i> is now in course of preparation designed to set out the target of national development over the next few years up to 1970 with an overall aim of securing 50 per cent rise in national income by 1970.  In aiming at that target, any Government facing up to their responsibility must adopt the taxation measures considered necessary in a particular situation to sustain the economic programme.  Faced with that situation, in the recent Budget, the Minister for Finance, among other taxes, decided on this measure in the section we are discussing, the turnover tax designed to yield £3 million or £4 million in the current year and £11 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that a logical way to approach any examination of the section we are discussing is to examine possible alternatives to this tax.  Are Fine Gael in favour of increased income taxation in substitution for the turnover tax?  Are they in favour of increasing income tax by 2/- or 3/- in the £?  Are they <Col N="646" /> in favour of increasing by 1/- or 2/traditional items of taxation such as beer, cigarettes, spirits or petrol?  They have not faced up to the problem in this debate that at this juncture it is necessary, irrespective of who is in Government, to adopt a more broadly-based tax system rather than continue depending on forms of taxation that have reached the limit.</P>
    <P>If income tax were pushed any further, it would be a depressing element in our community and the limited forms of indirect taxation have also reached their limit of taxable capacity.  Therefore, any responsible Minister for Finance seeking necessary additional revenue to sustain the economic programme must look around for a more broadly-based system of taxation such as that known as sales tax or purchase or turnover tax.  It is in existence in most countries and is accepted as a tax that is not psychologically depressive.  In our case, it stands at the low rate of 6d. in the £ or 2½ per cent over a whole range of commodities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We decided on that form of turnover tax because of the low incidence of taxation involved. There are other forms of such a tax that might have been adopted but any close examination of them reveals that you limit your tax to selected articles and you are driven to the conclusion that the incidence of a tax on selected commodities would be too high and defeat its purpose.  The turnover tax was selected as the least depressing and most broadly-based and therefore equitable in our circumstances and designed to yield the maximum revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael some months ago began their opposition to the Budget proposals by opposing absolutely any form of increased taxation, a typical Fine Gael starting point.  As an inherently conservative Party, their first cry was: &ldquo;Cut down Government expenditure!&rdquo; Deputy M.J. O'Higgins on the Second Stage and Deputy T.F.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire yield from the turnover tax for a full year could be spent on education alone with benefit to our economy.  If we are to have a modern education system to meet the needs of the future, we should spend twice the amount of money we are spending on education.  If we are to have the comprehensive system of education envisaged by the Minister for Education, providing for the progress of the ordinary man's child through the technical school and the technological institutes and into various trades and professions which are well paid today and which are open to the ordinary person, if we are to adopt a more highly-geared system of education such as the Minister has outlined, it will require more money.  If we are to have more scholarships it will require more money.  If we are to provide for a well-equipped system of university education designed to ensure its availability to all our people, it will require more finance.  It cannot be challenged that if we are to take our place as a modern nation we will need to spend the entire <Col N="648" /> return of the turnover tax for a full year in that one field alone, apart from the need to maintain industrial and agricultural expansion.

      <P>Since the publication of the Government proposals, Fine Gael have attacked all the proposals and the Budget without presenting any alternative.  From Deputy T. F. O'Higgins, we had some semblance of an alternative tax policy which I propose to deal with later.  So far, the major Fine Gael attack has been that this increased taxation is wrong. Having said that, they were inevitably driven into a position in which, if they are to defend it, they would have to say we should reduce Government expenditure.  Realising that, we see them in retreat because RGDATA, in recent days, have been making a constructive approach to these taxation proposals.  Their representatives have met the Minister for Finance and it is now clear that they are not against the increased taxation which they now realise &mdash; and most sensible people realise&mdash;is essential to maintain economic development.  They are not against increased taxation: in fact they are not against this tax at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the latest statement issued by RGDATA, their only quarrel now is in regard to the form of collection. There is public acceptance, even by a naturally vested interest organisation like RGDATA, of the fact that increased taxation of some kind is necessary in order to sustain the Government programme of economic expansion and that if there is to be increased taxation it should be of a broadly-based sales tax nature.  Even Deputy T.F. O'Higgins comes into the House and for the first time in this debate a Fine Gael speaker accepts the fact that increased taxation is necessary and he also, following the RGDATA <Col N="649" /> lead, makes the point that the form of collection is the thing that is wrong. It is now acknowledged that increased taxation is necessary because any retrenchment of Government expenditure would cause a depression and a slump.  There is universal acceptance by Fine Gael and everybody in the country that this tax proposal is necessary as being the least depressive type of tax and now the only quarrel is in regard to the form of collection with which I propose to deal.</P>
    <P>We have decided to collect the tax at the retail outlet level.  RGDATA suggests it should be collected at manufacturer level.  If the tax is imposed at retail level, there can only be an increase of 2½ per cent because that is the last point of sale but if this tax is put on at manufacturer level, the manufacturer will add his percentage profit, the wholesaler will add his percentage profit and so will the retailer.  To anyone who understands ordinary mathematics that will mean not 2½ per cent but an increase of perhaps eight per cent or ten per cent.</P>

      <P>If tea is taxed, as it has been in the past at the point of entry, and the increase is 2d. nothing more than 2d. can be added to that up through the scale.  Can that not be done in regard to this tax, put on 2½ per cent at the beginning and leave it at that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>It is elementary common sense that once a tax of this kind is imposed at a starting point, each successive dealer in the commodity will have an opportunity to put his percentage mark on the article and the net result as far as the public are concerned is a much dearer article than is envisaged by the tax.  If the tax is imposed at the last outlet level, it is not possible for more than 2½ per cent to be charged.</P>

The form of collection is now the only objection.  It is now accepted <Col N="650" /> generally, even by Deputy O'Higgins, by RGDATA, the most concerned vested interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with who said it.  The issue today is that the Fine Gael Party, through the declared pronouncements of its Leader, have offered themselves to the Irish people as an alternative Government, not with Labour any more.  Incidentally that is a very good thing for Labour.  Fine Gael have offered themselves as an alternative Government, and again we have Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Dillon emphasising the fact that Fine Gael now regard themselves as an alternative Government in <Col N="651" /> this House and in the country.  It is all very well for Fine Gael as long as they are resigned to Opposition to be indifferent but when they now have the ambition once again to participate in the Government councils of this country, they will have to do better as far as the people are concerned. They will have to present their alternatives to this and every other section of this Finance Bill, alternatives that can be seen, examined, assessed and adopted by the people.</P>
      <P>That has not been done by Fine Gael.  They have not faced up to their responsibilities in that respect.  They have no policy except the conservative policy of retrenchment and cutting down in regard to Government expenditure. As I said on the Second Reading of this Bill, the Labour Party are thinking much the same way as ourselves in acknowledging that Government expenditure is necessary and further expenditure is necessary in the fields of social and economic development.  They have not gone the whole way with us in facing up to their responsibilities which would involve a declaration of a policy such as that of this Government, that if such an expansion is to be brought about by Government investment, the necessary tax measures must be taken to sustain that Government action and to sustain that expansion.</P>
      <P>I believe that will be the issue in Irish politics in the future: whether people believe in the future of the country, whether they believe that in our circumstances it is necessary for the Government to take a decided lead in ensuring economic growth, and, above all else, whether they believe that in order to do that, we need to devise a taxation system to ensure the revenue necessary for such development. The people who believe that way are primarily in this Party and, to a certain extent, in the Labour Party.  They are not in the Fine Gael Party and Fine Gael are now presenting to the public an image of a Party concerned only with obstructive criticism and opportunist expediency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the rather left-handed <Col N="652" /> compliments paid to the Labour Party by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, I should like to explain that we in the Labour Party still think this Bill ill-conceived. As a matter of fact, it appears to have been pretty badly planned.  The evidence of that is that, following the Second Reading debate, the Minister found it necessary to bring in a number of amendments. It is not unusual, as we all know, to find amendments being brought in, but it is rather unusual to find amendments of the sort the Minister found it necessary to bring in.</P>
      <P>I refer in particular to the amendment which was accepted by the House to-day, the amendment in relation to the tax on sports.  It was proposed to tax the GAA, the Rugby clubs, the soccer clubs, and so on, of this country.  The Minister used as an excuse for his amendment today the fact that he found at the last minute that, as they would be taxing only the big matches in Croke Park, Dalymount Park, etc., the amount of tax collected would not be big enough to bother about&mdash;a pretty good excuse.  But surely the Minister in introducing the Bill must have known from the very start what in fact he was taxing; he must have known what the position was.  Or is it a fact that he hoped he would get away with it without anybody noticing until the Bill became law, and then there would be nothing anyone could do about it except grumble?</P>
      <P>The executives of these bodies obviously made their presence in the Minister's office felt because, following the reference here on Second Reading to this particular aspect of the proposed tax, pressure was brought to bear to have the position remedied.  I am very glad these bodies made themselves felt because, God knows, we are taxing a great many things but if we start taxing sport, and the national pastimes in particular, we will be sinking to a pretty low level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One extraordinary thing is that during the Second Reading debate and also in today's debate, with the exception of Deputy Seán Flanagan who made quite a good contribution, as he <Col N="653" /> usually does, the only person who contributed was Deputy P. J. Burke in one of his rare visits to this House. He proceeded to throw mud all round, and particularly at the Labour Party. Deputy Burke should remember that there are people in this House who have been attending the debates and taking part in them day in and day out.  Their concern is to try to improve legislation and the cheap sneers by certain people, particularly by way of interruption, are just not good enough. If Deputies get a rock back, as Deputy Burke did today, they should be men enough to take it and not get annoyed about it and become personal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman referred today to Caldor and said that he did not quite agree with the proposals he made because of the fact that they seemed to be all right on paper until one started looking at them a little closer.  We must remember that Caldor suggested that this tax should replace other taxes not be additional to them. That is an important point because the proposed turnover tax does not, in fact, replace other taxes; it is in addition to them.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands is quite correct when he says that the Labour Party are prepared at all times to stand up to the fact that, if we want something, we must pay for it; and, if we must pay for it, the money must come from some source, and the only point on which we differ is as to where the money should come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused to hear the suggestion made that since RGDATA seemed satisfied with the way the money could be collected, everything in the garden was lovely and we should not bother any longer about the tax.  I am not quite sure what Deputy T.F. O'Higgins said, possibly because of the interruptions, but I thought he was putting across a point of view he did not really hold; but the point of view I got was that he also felt it would not be so bad if the turnover tax were put on at wholesale level.  Now whether RGDATA believe that, or Fine Gael <Col N="654" /> believe it, I want to make one thing very clear; we in the Labour Party will not agree to a turnover tax at any level when that tax affects food and clothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make that very clear because the suggestion seems to be that if certain small, or not so small, pressure groups can be satisfied, then the members of this House should be satisfied.  The issue cannot be dismissed as lightly as that.  The tax in itself is bad.  The idea of the tax is bad. As someone said earlier today, 2½ per cent this year: what will it be next year and the year after?  The whole principle is wrong.  While it is not our job, as Deputy Corish said, to say where the money is to be found, most certainly it should not be found by way of a turnover tax.</P>
      <P>Another amusing thing occurred here today, particularly during Question Time and in the earlier part of the debate.  When questions were being answered, some Ministers seemed to be prepared to say that we are having a wonderful upsurge in the economy of the country and productivity has nearly got out of bounds.  In the next breath, they were explaining why it is necessary to have a White Paper on a wages standstill or wage pause.  One or other is wrong.  Either the economy is booming and the workers are entitled to a share in that booming economy, or things are going wrong and the Ministers in charge of the particular Departments should be prepared to come into this House and say where the economy is going wrong, or else resign.  We have had far too much of this cod, which reached its zenith when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands proceeded to say what we expected before 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not a fact that at the present time wages are tied down in the Government service?  Is it not a fact that generally throughout the country wages are tied down because of instructions given that in no circumstances are wages to be increased or hours of work improved where that reduction would have an effect on <Col N="655" /> wages?  We are told that whether the cost of living goes up or down, this situation must continue.  The Minister for Transport and Power said today that it was quite all right; if you had a tribunal you could go to the tribunal, make your case and get an award, which would be a fairly good award. That was grand.  There was no objection by the Government to that being done.  But dare the State or semi-State body pay that award until the Government said they could do so?  Is it not all like a comic opera ?  You can go to a certain stage and then, when the question of £ s. d. comes into the picture, these bodies must hold their hand until the Great White Chief waves his wand and says: &ldquo;You can go ahead.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to make this very clear, and for two reasons; no matter what happens, as we expect there will be a further increase in wages if this turnover tax comes into operation, the Labour Party and the trade union movement here will get the workers' share out of it.  Have no doubt about that.  That will be done, whether or not the Government consider they may have certain trade union officials in their pockets.</P>
    <P>People talk here about 6d. in the £. A great many people have been talking as if the only way in which people buy goods is in £s worth.  How many of our people buy not in £s but in sixpences, shillings and two shillings ? I do not think the Independent Deputy's suggestion of having farthings or half-farthings, or token coins, or anything else, will solve the problem. Poor old people, many of whom are depending on non-contributory old age pensions of 32/6 per week, some of them because the Minister for Social Welfare has put into a Bill a clause which was never before included in a Bill, are not going to be carrying around little bags under their arms full of small coins so that they will not be diddled when they go in to buy something in a shop.</P>
    <P>It brings it down to the level of the Tánaiste when he suggested that the tax could easily be worked by taking one match from a box, that the shopkeeper could get a clean box and put <Col N="656" /> the extra matches into that box and sell it and in that way the turnover tax would be collected.  It is that type of thinking that has produced the turnover tax, which is supporting it and which will put the people into very sore straits if they do not have second thoughts pretty quickly.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said it was a tax that was accepted.  It is a far cry from the proposal he made before the Bill was introduced when he said that he felt sure that the tax could only be on expensive cars, fur coats, and jewellery.  Nobody would object to a tax being put on those commodities but when we start to talk about taxing such things as batch bread, butter, margarine and all the small things necessary to life and then say there is nothing wrong with that and that the money must be found, it is a very different matter.</P>
    <P>I was amused at one of the arguments advanced by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Usually he is a clear speaker and follows his arguments pretty well to the end but sometime I must ask him how he works it out that if something is bought at wholesale level at £1 and is then sent to the retailer who adds his profit to it and it is then sold with the 2½ per cent tax added to it, it will cost less than if the 2½ per cent had been added at the wholesale level.</P>

If you buy something from a wholesaler at £1 and the retailer adds 5/- and then adds the 2½ per cent tax to the 25/-, it is going to cost the consumer more than the 2½ per cent on the £.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  One other point which should be considered carefully is what is likely to happen in regard to prices.  We heard a lot about RGDATA and I appreciate that they are going to have a certain amount of trouble.  They seem to be satisfied that they can get out of it, but I am not satisfied that the small trader will get out of it, even with the new facilities which the Minister is giving him.  I should like to know in what way the Minister proposes to arrange the collection of this tax so that there will not be overcharging.  The Minister is on record as having said that it did not matter what happens, the traders were entitled to collect the extra amount, and he did not care how they collected it.  In the <i>Irish Press</i> of 29th May, 1963, he is reported, in a statement issued by the Government Information Bureau, as having said that there would be no obligation on traders to bear any portion of the turnover tax and that they would be at liberty to pass it on to the consumer by adjusting prices or quantities.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, when the inter-Party Government were in power, the Opposition raised an outcry and accused the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, of reducing the size of the loaf.  Fianna Fail claimed it was a shocking thing to do and that anybody who did it was not entitled to be in public life. The truth is that the loaf was not reduced but now apparently it is quite a respectable thing to do because the Minister admitted this evening that his officials had been meeting manufacturing bodies with the idea of arranging adjustments in weights and sizes.  It appears that the bar of chocolate can be reduced by a little bit and that that will take care of the 2½ per cent.  I have no doubt that the marker for the icecream will also be changed but you will have trouble with the lollipops and you will be in trouble with fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins referred to <Col N="658" /> a trader who runs a public house and a shop and said that he was going to transfer all the cost to the public house.  That may be so, but I think the people who would be going to the public house would not do so for long because they would find another premises where the prices were not increased.  Finally, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, we are opposing the turnover tax on the principle that it is wrong and in no circumstances, whether it be at retail, wholesale or other level, will we agree to support a tax on food or clothing or the necessaries of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already dealt in some detail with our objections to this tax.  The glib self-assurance of the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lenihan, on this whole matter of tax is disturbing.  He appears to assume that there has been some easing of tension with regard to RGDATA and that everything now is all right and that they will have little to worry about.</P>
      <P>Our objection to the tax is based on three points.  The first is that it is a tax which accentuates the unjust difference of taxation on the general public, as opposed to a minority of wealthy persons, by increasing indirect taxation.  The second objection is its long-term implications.  Those probably will have the most serious results of all.  There are also the implications that the Government have come asking for an unprecedented sum of money, £11 million or £12 million, in the form of taxation.  That has the clear implication that both organised industry, the wealth-creating potential of industry, has failed on the one hand, and the wealth-creating potential of agriculture, on the other hand, has also failed.  The result is that the Government are faced with this dilemma, this crisis in the country's economic situation.</P>
      <P>The position of the Minister is merely that of an accountant who is trying to make both ends meet in a bankrupt situation and he has introduced this particularly unjust and dangerous tax because, I think, there is nothing else left for him to do.  This is a measure of the failure of the Government's actions over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> Because of that, they are forced to take this politically very unpopular decision, this politically very dangerous decision.  It is a direct result of their failure over the years to organise industry and agriculture so that enough money would be created that it would be possible to leave taxation as it is or even reduce it, while, at the same time, increasing social benefits as they say they are anxious to do.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands is seriously mistaken if he thinks that we are facing a time of easement.  When the Budget was announced by the Minister for Finance, I was astonished by the Press reaction at that time.  It is evident also that the Parliamentary Secretary and the members of the Government were astonished and delighted by the tone of the headlines of the time, by the announcement that there was to be no increase in taxation, that cigarettes and beer had escaped.  The general feeling among them then was that they had got away with it.  When I was speaking on the Budget, I pointed out that there was one paper, <i>The Kerryman</i>, that came out in the strongest critical terms of the imposition of this tax and announced its full implications to the public.  I said then that I believed it was only a matter of time before the national Press began to understand the full implications of the tax and that then there would be a tremendous storm of protest which would quite likely drive the Government out of office.</P>
    <P>Possibly the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands is right in thinking that there is going to be some easement of the situation but I think he is quite wrong if he underestimates the situation by thinking that this is the end of the story as far as the turnover tax is concerned.  He says that the present opposition to the tax is largely organised by RGDATA but it would be wrong to assume that, because that is likely to be satisfied, the public are also likely to be satisfied.  The fact is that the public have not yet felt the tax and will not feel it fully until early in the <Col N="660" /> new year.  It is then that the Government will face, if still in office, their greatest crisis and, what is more important, the country will find itself in its most serious economic condition.</P>
    <P>This tax is being introduced as a crisis measure at a time when all the indicators put out by the Government went to show that we were operating in conditions of economic stability.  We have seen the report of the Central Bank which makes very disturbing reading.  It shows a deficit on our external account of nearly £13½ million in 1962.  It shows a falling off in exports.  It shows a fall in the increase in the volume of output to a mere 2½ per cent.  It shows that the volume of agricultural production is unchanged and the whole picture is one which is particularly disturbing.  They make the point that this position of falling exports and stagnation in agriculture, this failure to develop our economy at the rate at which it should be developed, happens at a time when the terms of trade are in our favour.</P>
    <P>The Government faced a period in which import prices remained stable and a period in which export prices increased by three per cent.  If ever they were to make a success of this system in which they appear to believe, this system of private enterprise and capitalism, surely it was in the past few years and particularly since the Taoiseach came into office.  The Minister for Finance now demands an extra £12 million which he knows is practically political suicide for himself and which is likely to lead to the fragmentation of the great political organisation which Fianna Fáil once represented.  Surely he would not have done this if the economy of the country were not in a dangerously serious position.  That situation has arisen at a time when the economic potentialities were at their very best.</P>
    <P>This is the situation in which the Minister now takes this step, the end result of which will be that referred to by Deputy Tully a few moments ago, a legitimate demand, which cannot be put aside, for wage and salary increases and those will be substantial wage and salary increases.  There can be no doubt about that.  There may be <Col N="661" /> some compliant trade union leaders but there will be a number of them who will understand their responsibility to the workers of all sections and they must insist that if the Government fail in their social and economic policies, then the scapegoats cannot be the people concerned, whether the white-collar worker or the manual labourer. In this instance, the trade union leaders must insist, as I am sure they will insist, that there must be substantial wage and salary increases in order to compensate for the substantial increase in the cost of living which must follow this tax, encompassing every single commodity.</P>
    <P>One of the points made by a number of Government speakers was in relation to the sacrosanctity of tobacco, beer, petrol&mdash;that they could not be touched any more.  They ignore, of course, the fact that they are being touched by this tax.  We have seen already that the civil servants have submitted their legitimate wage and salary demands based on a cost of living increase of seven or eight points. They have decided they will wait until November, or whenever they are satisfied they have determined the true increase in the cost of living arising from the imposition of this turnover tax.  They are to put in a wage claim which will involve something between £1 million and £2 million, a very substantial wage demand for such a relatively tiny sector of the wage and salary earning classes.</P>
    <P>Do the Government fully understand the very serious implications of the inevitable trend which must follow this decision ?  Do they appreciate that the implications of these increases in wages and salaries can mean only one thing ?  The sad thing is that, there being no price controls, our prices will go up in order to meet the new wage and salary demands, and there will be inflation when the workers realise how little their income is worth.  However, we will have something far worse.  We will have the effects of the progressive elimination of tariffs, the reduction of protection in various directions, in quota and tariff restrictions, and the opening of our country, of our industries and our agriculture, to outside <Col N="662" /> competition from industries very much better organised than ours, industries which we cannot compete against even now when all the economic indicators are in our favour.</P>
    <P>Up to now, our industrialists could operate in a community in which, as the Report of the Central Bank points out, labour costs were low as compared with European labour costs, where fringe benefits were low compared with those in Europe, where payments were high for those fringe benefits compared with the payments in Europe, where taxes were relatively low.  We have had that type of social fabric, in many ways comparable with Japan of which it was said they could undercut easily because of their cheap labour.  Our industrialists were operating with cheap Irish labour yet we were never able to make a serious lodgment in any of the markets abroad.</P>
    <P>Even with that scandalous advantage of being able to exploit the worker, we failed to develop export opportunities.  To fail to do so with all those facilities is, of course, the most serious indictment of Irish industrialists, of their failure to organise our industry so that the unfortunate workers could maximise productivity by means of proper mechanisation. One after another report indicts the industrialists for having failed the workers.  The result of that failure is that the worker must now again pay in this turnover tax and in nine months' time, when he gets his wage or salary increased, he will find that any chance he might have had of benefiting from our industries breaking into the European markets will have been completely eliminated.</P>
    <P>The Government will then have no alternative but to come to the Dáil and tell us the same stories about agriculture stagnating, about industrial output not increasing, about exports not expanding sufficiently.  The result is that they must ask the consumer for more money by way of heavier and heavier taxation.  With emigration at its present level, of course, we are taxing a continually reducing people who can less and less afford to pay those taxes.  It all goes back to the <Col N="663" /> basic failure, to which none of the Government or Opposition speakers has referred at all, to organise our society so that it would be possible for us, by increasing the inter-use of land, labour and capital, so to increase the national income and national product that we would not need these appalling penal taxes.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy for the Minister coming in here demanding this money and taking all the opprobrium and appearing to shoulder all the responsibility for the total failure of his colleagues over the past 30 years or so.  He is asking a shrinking population to provide greater and greater taxes, without the compensation of any significant advance in social services. The basic failure lies, of course, in the fact that you cannot operate private enterprise capitalism successfully to achieve your objectives.</P>
    <P>It is no good for the Taoiseach to say he is going left.  He may be with his heart, giving slightly better benefits to the aged and the sick, but he simply cannot do it and try, at the same time, to operate private enterprise capitalism. The fact is that private enterprise capitalism has achieved its objective in Ireland; it has made a lot of money for a few people; it has given prosperity to a few families in this country.  That is what it was intended to do.  In the United States, they have much the same problem as we have: they have this five per cent unemployment rate, with 30 million living on the edge of poverty, because President Kennedy, a man with a great heart who would like to change those conditions, is unable to do so because his society is organised on the same lines as ours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I believe that most of the politicians here would probably like to do it for our own people.  We have had the position here in Ireland for many years that we have had surplus labour.  At present we have 40,000 or 50,000 unemployed.  We have had anything up to 80,000 or 90,000 of our people unemployed.  This <Col N="664" /> is money used in a negative sense.  It is money lost in paying out unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  There is no return to the community for it.  I am not opposed to that but, from the point of view of creating wealth for the nation, it is completely negative.  There is also the fact that these people could be positive producers.  Instead, they are a drain on our society.</P>
      <P>In addition, the best part of one million people emigrated one time or another.  They are more people who could be creating wealth for our society and who have not been given the opportunity of doing so because the organisation of industry requires only a certain number of people, quite a relatively small number of people, in order to create a lot of wealth for a family, one family, whoever it may be &mdash;Guinness, Jacobs, or Rowntrees or any of these others.  The result is that we have not been able to provide employment and we must find whatever money we require for better social services from this tiny salaried and wage earning group&mdash;and this burden is increasing each year as time goes on.</P>
      <P>There is an alternative.  I can understand a certain amount of the exasperation of the Government in facing the criticism of the Opposition.  They say they want more benefits and, on the other hand, they do not want to pay more.  However, that is not the equation.  It is possible to find the money otherwise than through this system of taxation.</P>
      <P>Take countries such as Denmark, Switzerland, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway&mdash;most of these countries have found it possible to organise what are basically agricultural communities and to bring a maximum measure of social justice to their population.  I believe it is regrettable that this tax will be introduced.  If only the Minister understood and if the Opposition understood that the failure has been the failure, not of a profit and loss account on the part of the Government, but a basic failure in regard to industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industry has been organised in a particular way.  It has produced a lot of money for a few people but it has not produced it for the mass and it can produce it for the mass only when <Col N="665" /> the mass own and control that industry, because then they have a vested interest in seeing that the total amount of wealth required for themselves&mdash;for better health services, for the care of old people, for better educational services for their children and so on&mdash;will be created.  The minority of wealthy people who own and control newspapers here and dominate political life here are not concerned for the mass but for their own individual family and the small group around them.  That is the type of society we have created here for the past 40 years: there should be no misunderstanding about that.</P>
    <P>The serious decision for the time being is the 2½ per cent turnover tax but the very much more serious decision is the one which will come in from nine to 18 months' time when, I believe, there must be very considerable, industrial unrest that will, no doubt, be solved as a result of struggles of one kind or another that should not have to take place by the unfortunate worker&mdash;strike action, labour difficulty, conflicts, of one kind or another.  However, without a doubt, they must come and after those must come the increase in prices which will make it quite impossible for us to earn the wealth to have the things the Parliamentary Secretary talked about&mdash;better educational facilities, health, social welfare, and so on.</P>
    <P>I believe that is the great failure epitomised by the decision to introduce this tax.  For the Minister, it is an insoluble dilemma, using his present economic terms of reference.  It is a question of trying to do certain things with too limited resources and they are too limited because of these people in a particular firm or organisation in industry and agriculture.  Until the Minister or somebody in Opposition decides to make the fundamental change referred to years ago by Mr. de Valera, the former Taoiseach, going outside the existing system, we shall not solve our economic difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is the old story of the loaves and fishes, of too few loaves and fishes to feed too many.  In this case we lack the Divine power to increase them and <Col N="666" /> to make it possible to look after our people properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak about four main points in connection with this legislation.  A variety of hares have been started which it would be very pleasant to chase but it would take too long and there will be other opportunities to deal with these rather irrelevant matters.  I am not concerned at the moment with any discussion on whether this tax should have been imposed at retail or wholesale level.  When reporting, the Income Taxation Commission said the Revenue Commissioners considered that a tax at retail level was the ideal one, and they said they considered it very difficult to administer.  If any extra cost arises from paying it at that level, no doubt it will be on the consumer as well as the 2½ per cent.</P>
      <P>Also, I do not feel inclined now to argue as to whether there is some expansion which requires new financing. I should like to know where the new expansion is.  The Government secured office by a promise of 100,000 new jobs in five years.  Instead, there are about 50,000 fewer people employed in this country than there were when they took over.  If that is what is called expansion, then I think that financing of that type of manoeuvre or performance would hardly be worth while considering.</P>
      <P>The significant fact about this year's Finance Bill is that the Government want to extract from the people in the year that we are in £17 million more than they got from them last year. There has been a lot of talk about whether Deputy Colley said this tax was flexible or so on.  It does not matter whether or not he said it.  I thought he, too, was merely echoing what he had been properly taught in the Party room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This tax has been boosted by Fianna Fáil spokesmen as being a new system and they are celebrating, while we are mourning, a new system of taxation. We were told in his Budget speech by the Minister for Finance that the good old reliables &mdash; food, drink, oil, and income tax &mdash; had reached saturation point and that, as more revenue was <Col N="667" /> required, we had to look for a new system of taxation.</P>
    <P>In this Budget we are dealing with a revolution in regard to the system of taxation.  We are now going to tax the necessaries of life.  I remember, years ago, on another Fianna Fáil Budget, when we objected that the necessaries of life were being taxed, one of the Ministers of that Government, now deceased, said: &ldquo;What is left to us to tax except the necessaries of life.&rdquo; That is what we were reduced to, according to him, and that is what we are reduced to now.</P>
    <P>This is a new system of taxation. The others, according to the Minister, in his Financial Statement, are not dependable and, without a more dependable system of revenue, it would be impossible to proceed with any programme of tax reform &mdash; and the new system is the turnover tax.  That turnover tax is not likely to reach the stage of diminishing returns quickly. People must eat; people will drink; people have to cloth themselves; people have to warm their houses.  So long as these things are necessary or nearly necessary, then if an excessive turnover tax hits these things, the period of diminishing returns is far off.</P>
    <P>The calculation has been made and accepted that the turnover tax in a full year will bring in £11 million.  Of that, £7 million is to come from food, clothing and fuel.  A sum of £4 million might come from items not nearly so necessary as food, clothing and fuel. Why not face it and admit it?  We are now taxing food, the food people must eat to sustain life.  A calculation has been made by a trade union economist who has often spoken on economic matters with a great deal of certainty and figures backed up by results afterwards. He has calculated that the greater part of that £7 million will come from people who are either State-supported or on very low incomes or else middle-class people.  A sum of £7 million out of that £11 million is to come from food, fuel and clothes. That is the new system.  If the Minister for Finance finds he wants more money, he still has an increase possible in the turnover tax.  If it is kept on <Col N="668" /> food, fuel and clothes, he can get his increase, because the people cannot avoid buying these things.  Therefore, the period of diminishing returns is far off and this is what the Minister for Finance desires&mdash;a dependable tax.</P>
    <P>That is the situation.  This is the new system.  We are leaving the old reliables of beer, spirits, petrol and income tax.  We are coming now to something we can depend on for increases in the future.  We start at 2½ per cent.  What it can go to can best be left to the imagination&mdash;what the Department of Finance have in store if they are allowed to manage or mismanage things in the future.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to say what is the alternative.  I do not think there is an alternative required.  I do not know for what this money is wanted. I turn to the Explanatory Table issued with the Budget and I find the revenue the Minister is looking for is to come as follows: £2 million from revenue balances; £3 million from corporation profit tax, which means this retrospective tax adding on 50 per cent to the previous level; income tax and surtax, rents and anti-evasion measures, £1 million; turnover tax, £3½ million. That is all that is required this year. It will be greater in a full year.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the other side.  We are giving away £1.7 million by way of subvention to Agriculture; £1.9 million for Social Welfare and the £12 million for public service pensions.  We can call the reliefs to Social Welfare and payments for public service pensions, £2 million.  A question was put in the House asking why not remit the turnover tax on food, fuel and clothes.  The Minister's answer was that would rob him of £7 million of the tax, but it does mean he can get £4 million from the turnover tax on articles not food, fuel or clothes.  He has £3 million from corporation profits tax.  That makes £7 million.  That would more than pay for the Social Services money.  Maybe there is £500,000 in it.</P>

      <P>In a full year.  That is my calculation.  Work it out.  We are talking about elementary mathematics. That is the most elementary mathematics I have come across in this Budget.  I do not know for what this money is required.  We are dealing with this as if everybody had passed both sets of calculations.  I do not believe in that at all.  In other years, the Minister allowed quite a big amount of money in respect of over-estimation errors.  It is astonishing that in the highest Budget he has ever brought in he allows this year only £2 million.  It could easily be £4 million.  In my time as Minister for Finance, I often challenged the Departments to spend the money they put up to me at the beginning of the year as what was required to meet their operations during the year.  They never spent the money.  Go through the reports of the Revenue Commissioners. You will find one item recurring again and again: &ldquo;Carried over balances.&rdquo;  This year, the modest sum of only £2 million is allowed for errors of estimation.  I believe that will prove to be illusory and that it will be £4 million or £5 million.  It must be, in a Budget of this type.</P>
      <P>It is supposed to be necessary, when objecting to a tax on food, to suggest some other tax.  I remember being faced with that challenge in 1947-48, when all my colleagues, together with those who belonged to Labour and Clann na Poblachta, campaigned in the country against the taxes put on by the Supplementary Budget of 1947 &mdash;taxes on beer, spirits, entertainments and oil.  We said they were not required. We said we would find something else to tax instead of them.  We were not a fortnight in office until we decided to carry out our promises with regard to the reduction of the taxes on these four items.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can deal with intelligent interruptions, but when I get mumbled incoherencies from the back benches, I do not know what to answer.  We got rid of these taxes by emergency orders.  We had to face up to meeting what was a deficit in the Budget.  The present Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, said the taxes we remitted were necessary in order to provide subsidies.  He said we were faced with the dilemma of either reducing the subsidies or finding new methods of taxation. Speaking on 9th March at columns 228 and 229 of the Official Report he said that there were only four dependable sources of revenue, of which one was tobacco, another beer and spirits and another income tax.  He said that presumably, having reduced certain taxes on entertainment, beer and spirits, we were not going to be cynical enough within a month to put them back again.  His calculation was that we would have to turn to income tax.</P>
      <P>At column 229 he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The yield of income tax is roughly about £1 million for every 6d.  in the £ tax and to replace the £4 million or £5 million which the supplementary duties upon beer, tobacco and <Col N="671" /> cinema seats would reap in a full year, would mean an increase in the standard rate of income tax by about 2/6d. in the £1.</P>
    <P>That is what we were faced with.  We had taken off taxes on beer and spirits and entertainment and all the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now Taoiseach, could say was that we would have to put 2/6d. on income tax.</P>
    <P>He had not to wait very long to see the falsification of his hopes.  In my first Budget, we allowed for a loss of £7 million through the relief of taxes on beer and tobacco.  We allowed for a loss of £1 million by the remission of 6d. in income tax.  We allowed for other reliefs that were minor but amounted to £.5 million.  That was £8.5 million.  In addition, we increased old age pensions at a cost to the State of £2.5 million.  We gave subventions to the Garda, the Army, the teachers and others, costing £1.8 million.  We gave an extra tea ration which we had to subsidise at a cost of £1.5 million. Those items add up to £4.8 million. Adding that to the revenue we had lost by remission of taxes, the whole thing amounted to £13.5 million.  We did not put on one extra tax.  We remitted more than £13.5 million and there was no extra taxation.  The reason was that the Fianna Fáil Government had gone mad, as I think they have gone mad this year also.  They exaggerated their likely expenditure and then looked around for a method of financing expenditure and put on taxes in a Supplementary Budget on beer and spirits and so on.</P>
    <P>That was the calculation made to us, that it would take 2/6d. in the £ even to carry the loss of beer and spirits and so on instead of which, in our first Budget, we were able to remit £13.5 million and not one extra penny of taxation levied on the community. Fianna Fáil will never know how that was done and I do not propose at this late stage to try to teach them.  I do not believe this money is required but if it is and if I am faced with that position, I should think of other ways of raising money instead of taxing food, fuel and clothes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> My second main point is that this is an exhibition of old-time Fianna Fáil policy.  The Commission established to deal with income tax said in their Third Report that they were in favour of a certain type of purchase tax.  They had been asked to report on it as an alternative or part alternative to income tax and very precisely in the pages of the report they say that they are only concerned with supplementing, not finding an alternative to, the levying of income tax which everybody then thought was very high. As they say themselves, it was not the income tax system that was wrong but the rate at which it was levied and they suggested a remission of 2/-in the £ in income tax to be made up by purchase tax.</P>
    <P>Very precisely they recommended&mdash; those who did recommend it&mdash;the exclusion from purchase tax of goods essential for agricultural production, goods essential for industrial production, all exports agricultural and industrial, food, particularly essential food and fuel and, among a whole lot of other things, household non-durable goods.  Their recommendation, as an alternative to 2/- in the £ on income tax, was to put on a purchase tax of a particular type, excluding food and fuel.  Whether the non-durable goods include clothes or not, I do not know. It is difficult to point out what they mean as they give so many definitions of various things.</P>
    <P>That recommendation was carried by the votes of six people on a Commission of eleven.  The other five reported dead against it.  They said it in one phrase that is easy to understand and is found six lines from the bottom on page 75 of this report.  It is brought in incidentally but it is a marvellous phrase.  It indicates the hostility there was to the tax that had been proposed.  They say : &ldquo;A purchase tax under any disguise is a wage cut.&rdquo;  Those ten words, 13 syllables, are full of meaning.  Is it accepted that a purchase tax is a wage cut?  As this discussion has gone on since the introduction of the idea of a purchase tax, we have heard a lot about disguises but the background is that it is a wage cut.  It is accepted as such.</P>

      <P>On what part of the community?  There are 175,000 people who pay income tax.  They would be charged but the others would not.  The men who said that were well-known economists in trade unions.  I could describe them all as well-read men.  They were put on the Commission to examine this problem, to consider the use of purchase tax on different levels and the different types of tax.  A minority, by only one, wound up by saying that they were against purchase tax and gave a recommendation that purchase tax under any disguise is a wage cut.  It is a wage cut.  What is the reaction to that?  It is a demand for increased wages.  Is that going to be resisted? If so, are we not in for a period of very heavy industrial disturbance and upset also in the ranks of the Civil Service, Garda, teachers and the Army?  This is, I think, where Fianna Fáil policy outcrops clearly.</P>
      <P>We had this booklet, <i>Closing the Gap.</i> The concluding paragraph was understood by us to mean, and we stated it more than once, that there was to be what would amount to a standstill order on wages.  That was denied.  Paragraph 21 is worth quoting in full.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of considerations set out in this White Paper, the Government deem it necessary that Departments and State-sponsored organisations should not accede for the present to any claims for increases in wages and salaries, or for changes in conditions of work having the same effect, which would arouse expectations of similar increases in other employments.  They trust that there will be a full appreciation of the fact that the Government should not, in respect of persons whose remuneration is provided directly or indirectly from public funds, or whose employment arises in the provision under <Col N="674" /> statutory authority of public services, follow a course they are convinced would be contrary to the national interest.  It is not envisaged that conciliation and arbitration procedures should be put in suspense but rather that the findings should be considered in relation to their possible reaction in other sectors and, if necessary, not applied until this can be done without damage to the national economic interest.</P>
    <P>That meant a standstill order on wages and salaries.  Does anybody deny it?</P>
    <P>That was bad enough&mdash;no increases in remuneration.  Then on top of that, we now have a purchase tax or a turnover tax.  Even when wages are cut, there will be a standstill.  We are getting back again to that immoral situation which prevailed here for many years when certain people were prevented from getting increases in their salaries or emoluments through arbitration proceedings, while outside people, through being organised and powerful, could get such increases. The Army, the Garda, ESB employees, civil servants, all these categories, because they were under Government control, were denied this opportunity.</P>
    <P>This is in accordance with the whole policy.  When we were in government in 1948, we found the draft of the standstill order, the new standstill legislation that was coming around, the &ldquo;Industrial Emergency Bill, 1947,&rdquo; the long title of which was: &ldquo;An Act to make temporary provision for regulating the alteration of remuneration and conditions of employment,&rdquo; and then there was the legislation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was given control of wages which were to be kept at a particular level.  The Minister in charge of this was the Taoiseach, then acting as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It was made illegal for any employer to grant more than a particular wage; secondly, the protection of the Trade Disputes Act was withdrawn from any strike the purpose of which was to compel an employer to pay any wage that he was prohibited from paying by the earlier section, and the footnote was : &ldquo;PS. The duration of the Bill will be two <Col N="675" /> years.&rdquo;  And the last remark is: &ldquo;Penalty should be severe.  Seán F. Lemass.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the policy.  There were standstill orders up to 1947.  Then they had been removed and this was the rod that was in pickle if Fianna Fáil had gained office again after 1948. During the course of one of those election campaigns, the Party to which I belong made considerable use of a statement made by a previous Minister for Justice, now Senator Boland.  We produced a photographic reproduction from the <i>Irish Press</i> of Mr. Gerald Boland's speech in which he announced Fianna Fáil's determination to prevent wage increases: The idea was that you had to keep wage increases for Government employees and State-subsidised industry employees down because if you did not, the increases might spread to other workers.  There had to be a good example shown by coercing those who were under your thumb.  According to this Minister &ldquo;the increases in civil servants' salaries would cost about £700,000 in a full year.  The Army, Garda and teachers are also entitled to increases but the total cost is not yet disclosed.  Local Government officials will naturally expect increases as will workers all over the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was the terrible situation, that once the Civil Service had got an increase, workers all over the country would look for it.  Senator Boland's conclusion was: &ldquo;This was the situation which Fianna Fáil was determined to prevent and would have prevented if three of the six lost Dublin seats had been held, for that would have given Mr. de Valera a majority on February 18th last.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is what went on through the years.  There was a standstill in wages during the war and there was an Industrial Emergency Bill after the war. They lamented that teachers, Guards and all these other people got increases, which would have been prevented if Fianna Fáil had retained a majority. Then in 1952, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, produced the Budget which cut out most of the subsidies but left a few for picking up later and they were picked up later. This time they produced the White <Col N="676" /> Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> and the way the gap was to be closed was by not having increases in emoluments.  People in Government employment cannot get increases because that might spread and other people might also get increases.</P>
    <P>History is repeating itself again. When the subsidies were cut out, it was the same as imposing taxes on the majority of the community because if you made dear the things that people bought because they have to live by them, it was the same as if their wages were cut.  A lot of the subsidies were sliced off in 1952; some of them were sliced off later and we now have the White Paper announcing a standstill. Having achieved that purpose, even though it was denied as being the purpose, they now come to the point where they are going to cut wages, because a purchase tax in any disguise is a wage cut, and that cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>What are we in for&mdash;a whole lot of discontent amongst State personnel? The civic guards are at the moment very disconsolate because their claims have been fobbed off.  Only yesterday, we heard that a report was received from the new arbitration group and that probably will not be considered, once the House rises, until the House meets again.  The teachers are putting in a claim and the civil servants are promulgating another.  Even if their demands could be met immediately, they can make still further demands because once there is a purchase tax on food, fuel and clothing, that amounts to a wage cut and people will not be prevented from looking for increases particularly when they hear all the talk there is at dinner tables about the prosperity of the country.</P>
    <P>One item in particular has been talked off in this connection, that is, the ease of collection.  The Minister for Justice gets almost into a mood of ecstasy when he talks about the new electronic computer which makes it easy to extract the money from your pockets.  With this machine, it is the easiest thing in the world to collect money; in fact, you will hardly know the money is being taken from you. However, electronic computer or <Col N="677" /> otherwise, this £11 million extraction is going to involve somebody in a bit of discomfort.</P>
    <P>The ordinary pickpocket is generally described as being what is known as a light-fingered gentleman.  He can get a hand into your hip pocket or into a side pocket and remove your wallet and you will hardly notice the disappearance. This is a pickpocket tax and £11 million will be extracted, notwithstanding the fact that the Government doing this passed their test the other night by only one vote.  Is it right that the Government, after the shaking they got from North-East Dublin, should enter on a new field of taxation founded upon the mumbled incoherencies of Deputy Lenihan when he was discussing this?</P>

      <P>Great play has been made with the result of the Dublin North-East by-election.  In the <Col N="678" /> final analysis, Deputy Belton secured victory by some 5,500 votes.  I should like to feel that as in the case of a previous by-election in Dublin North-East, his victory represents a gesture of respect and goodwill by the electorate for the services of his brother in the past.  In the previous by-election in Dublin North-East, Deputy Paddy Byrne succeeded his father.  The majority at that time was some 4,400 votes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully got entangled in a discussion today with Deputy Colley. He could not understand why, if the tax was put on at the source, it would mean a higher cost to the consumer.  I do not know to what Labour group Deputy Tully belongs, but he apparently does not have to attend wage increase discussions.  Indeed, sometimes I wonder what sections of Labour some of these members represent and how they came to be chosen to represent Labour instead of the FUE.  Deputy Tully knows that when increased wages lead to increased costs the mark-up at the wholesale and retail level multiples the original increase as far as the consumers are concerned and that has been used by trade union negotiators to justify a larger increase than the manufacturer perhaps wants to grant so that the worker will be better off in real spending power and increase his income to a greater extent than the increase in the price of the commodities affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not intend to speak on this section but Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Opposition, made today a low, personal attack on the Minister and, not satisfied with that, also on my children and my nephews and nieces.  Deputy McGilligan asked us to look at history repeating itself.  I think it is time I gave a bit of history here.  The most outstanding feature of the developments in the last few weeks has been the organised attempts to intimidate Deputies to vote against their consciences. These attempts may have <Col N="679" /> persuaded one to change his mind but I think those Deputies who vote in accordance with their consciences are to be congratulated for resisting these foul attacks.  We are told that, so long as these Deputies vote for Fianna Fáil, that is an end of democracy.  I maintain that, if they are subjected to voting against their consciences by pressure groups, that is the defeat of democracy, the defeat which General O'Duffy, Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Higgins wanted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let RGDATA realise by what manner of man they are being led.  When my wife saw a RGDATA poster on the shop where she deals, she said &ldquo;I am sorry; I will take my business elsewhere&rdquo;.  I hope that other housewives who are in favour of continued expansion, more employment, better wages and better conditions will do the same thing.  If they do, the posters will quickly disappear out of the windows.  The surprising thing is that most of those who display them are amongst the exempted groups.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether traders believe the repeated allegation by Fine Gael that small traders will be pushed out of business because they will not be able to compete.  It will be the supermarkets, and Mr. Quinn, and all the other people who led them through the streets.  Who are trying to get monopolies?  Who are trying to open supermarkets?  Are the Government trying to take them over with the 2½ per cent tax?  If anybody puts them out of business, it will be the large combine very often financed from outside the State.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to see the Labour Party lining up with big business in this matter but as their former leader would only be eligible to be a member of the Federated Union of Employers, it is perhaps not so surprising.</P>
      <P>Mr. Wilson, the leader of the British Labour Party, on July 8th last speaking to the Transport and General Workers Union, advocated a pay pause and an economic policy based on expansion.  That is what we are doing here.  It is on that policy that we should get the support of Labour.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has come in here and attacked the Independents. I wonder does he remember that he was at one time an Independent Deputy supporting a minority Fianna Fáil Government?  There was nothing wrong with doing that.  I am quite sure there were no pressure <Col N="681" /> groups when he decided to vote for some tariff legislation.  In Volume 41, column 1269 referring to a tariff on clothing he said:</P>
      <P>I do not propose to vote against them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>that was the Government</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because their defeat would hopelessly and unnecessarily embarrass the Government... .  I do say this, that this tariff above all others is going to hit the poor and nobody but the poor.</P>
      <P>Then he marched into the lobby with Fianna Fáil.  If another Deputy is going to do that today, it is not right. Deputies realise that this legislation is not going to hit the poor so that their actions are far less blameless than Deputy Dillon's.</P>
      <P>I have many more quotations from this illustrious Leader of the Fine Gael Party from time to time but to quote them all would be ridiculous.  For instance, he came in at that time as an Independent fighting against these tariffs on clothing and at column 383, Volume 41 he said:</P>
      <P>Let him put back the tax on tea. Tea never did anybody any good. It is purely a luxury, and if they drank less tea they would be a great deal better off.  Those who cannot resist this stimulating draught, let them pay for their stimulation.</P>
      <P>At column 2037, in Volume 42 he said:</P>
      <P>Any person who feels that the 4d. tax will place a strain on their resources can, without depriving themselves of a luxury, arrange that their children will not have tea.</P>

      <P>I have read the life story of the Leader of the Opposition as reported in the Dáil Debates.  He has a solution to this problem and the solution he advocated year after year was: why not throw up our sovereignty and let England come in and clean up the mess?  Is that his solution today?  We must remember that the last Government were thrown violently out of office as a result of their inability and lack of courage to impose taxation when it was required. On 8th May, 1957, when the Minister for Finance.  Dr. Ryan, was introducing his Budget, he said:</P>
      <P>The deficiency in public savings last year was made up in two ways. Approximately £9.3 million was obtained from the banks and over £10,000,000 from departmental funds, partly from investment income but mainly from sales of securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that the way to do it?  In spite of that, there was still a deficiency of £9 million which had to be met.  At that time, and I said this before and I have been told that I am completely out of order in saying it, and Deputy Dillon becomes very cross when I say it, neither private business nor the bankers would advance money to the Government or accept their security as <Col N="683" /> good security and I have evidence of that.</P>

      <P>On April 16th the City Council were informed of a letter from An Taoiseach regarding the financing of the Corporation capital works for 1956-57 which indicated that if the Corporation were unable to raise the full £3,000,000 required, the Government would make good the deficiency by advances from public funds.  In the light of An Taoiseach's letter, An Coiste Airgeadais authorised me&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is, the City Manager&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to communicate with the Bank of Ireland with a view to securing overdraft accommodation from the bank for capital purposes pending the availability of money guaranteed by the Government.  The bank, on the 7th instant, stated that they were not in a position to assist the Corporation in financing its capital requirements.</P>

Fine Gael will agree that these taxes are high enough.  In 1946-47, we had it from Deputy McGilligan, Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Dillon and practically every Fine Gael <Col N="685" /> Deputy that some taxes were unnecessary, that they would cut down, that they would close the vehicle factory at Inchicore and go back to retrenchment.  We in Fianna Fáil are only interested in economic expansion and in bettering the conditions of the workers.  We want harmony between employers and employees.  We want the people to realise what we are doing. We publish our programmes in advance; we report on them every year so that nothing is hidden.  The thing we have to decide to-day is whether expansion or retrenchment is to be the policy.  I am surprised that the Labour Party have not come in with us on that issue because anyone who comes in with us on it is doing the right thing in the interests of the nation.</P>

If one examines that campaign closely, one finds that people are making a mountain out of a molehill.  Two groups are interested in the defeat of this Bill. One is the political Opposition because for the first time they have managed to get support that they could never hope to get again.  They have got support from certain small groups and from Independents who are frightened out of their lives because it would appear that public opinion is against this Bill.  The question of right or wrong does not enter into it at all. It is only a question of whether it is popular to be against the Bill.</P>
      <P>Not only have the political groups who aspire to Government got the support of the smaller groups and Independents but they have managed to get the monied group as represented by RGDATA behind them also.  About a week ago, we saw these monied people representing, from £80 million to £100 million, in this city.

      <P>The Opposition have aligned themselves with this monied group who hope to save themselves from any close examination by the Revenue authorities that might disclose something they do not wish to have disclosed.  So we have two parties very anxious to defeat this Bill.  We have the Opposition who, for once in a lifetime, have found such support that they are satisfied that if they could defeat the Bill, they would be in power for the next five years and we have the monied crowd who hope to save big money as a result of its defeat. It should be obvious to anyone that if the monied crowd are to save money, the people in need must necessarily lose.</P>
      <P>Simple people believe that if this Bill were defeated, it would mean the end of taxation.  They forget that we would have just as much taxation if there was a change of Government, whether it be by turnover tax, sales tax or any other form of tax.  There would still have to be £11 million collected from the public.  It is the consumer who pays and who always pays but this turnover tax gets at a lot of people whom a sales tax would not get at.  A sales tax would mean that the Government would put so much on certain goods but the monied crowd would put it on to the public and a little more along with it.  It would still have to come from the people. This tax gets at profits, at deposits in the banks, at gambling, at entertainment and all sorts of other services. Little or nothing escapes this tax and, because a certain amount of competition between the business community will be caused, it is held that the competition will force them to lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to get a substantial amount of money from the monied crowd, someone must gain.  The public must gain.  It is elementary commonsense that the public must gain. A sales tax could not be less than 1/- in the £ because this tax embraces so many things that if the same amount of money were to be obtained from a single sales tax, it would have to be increased or doubled to get it.  It is quite easy to explain it. If ten people booked a room for a <Col N="687" /> meeting and the cost of that room was 10/-, they would be expected to pay 1/each but if twenty people booked the room, it would only cost them 6d. each. When a thing is as all-embracing as this tax, we can afford to leave it as low as 6d. in the £ but if it were a sales tax, it would probably have to be 1/- in the £, with a probable increase in income tax in order to get the same amount of money.</P>
    <P>One has to have something within in order to have faith.  One cannot withstand the barrage of bribes and threats unless one believes.  I believe that the Minister will get the money he requires and if he does not, the poor will be the poorer and, instead of giving the social services needed, the Government will only be able to give out buttons.  I believe that at the end of a full year the Minister will be able to give many benefits to people in need and that is the reason why nothing will shift me from my stand.  There was a grand alliance to defeat the Bill.  The monied crowd thought this was a grand chance, a chance that would never come again.  The extraordinary thing is that the rank and file of the Opposition prayed that the Government would win.  My attitude is clear.</P>

      <P>Never mind.  I am always in the corner of the fellow on the floor.  All my life I have been trying and winning.  There have been five reductions in differential rents in Dublin in ten years and I got the five of them.  In the past two years, through my agitation, I have got the cripples an extra half-crown.  Do not worry.  I shall always be in the corner looking for a little more, but I will not do anything silly if I do not succeed.  I can always wait and get more in my own time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the RGDATA solution to this problem?  I have looked it over.  It does not contain a suggestion that there should not be a tax on food.  They suggest a sales tax on all goods.  They are the crowd who helped to win Dublin North-East.  The alliance is cracking up now.  It is each <Col N="688" /> one for himself from now on and here you have a last minute effort by this monied crowd, hoping that the Government may change their minds and have an all-embracing sales tax. They are not worrying what people will have to pay for food.  In the latter part of their circular, they talk about half the traders being exempt from registration, meaning that in their case the suppliers would have paid the tax.  They are concerned, first of all, about a sales tax on all goods, but if there is to be a turnover tax, that they be exempt from the necessity to divulge information.  In other words, their whole concern is for themselves all the time.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the Opposition's solution is?  If in Government, what would they do about the RGDATA proposals?  They will not repudiate them now.  There may be another election and they want those people on their side.  They are gravely mistaken. Once this becomes law, the alliance is finished.  I am prepared to admit this form of taxation is a bit of a nuisance but, in my opinion, it must right itself.  It always does.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he should have a smaller coinage.  I do not know whether this is possible or not, but I am told that if enough farthings were put on the market, it would ease things considerably.  This RGDATA circular says that the big stores will charge nothing extra for foodstuffs, that they will put it all on the larger articles.  What they are saying is that the working classes will benefit by increased social allowances but will pay no extra tax under this Bill.  Actually, these increased benefits this year were intended only to cover the cost of the turnover tax to individual householders in the poorer sections of the community.  No one could expect an increase in benefits in a year when we were facing a deficit of between £6 million and £7 million, so any increased social benefits given were aimed at covering this tax.  I believe there will be a further increase in the benefits next year and I do not think there will be any increased taxation. I believe this tax will bring in a lot more money than the Minister expects because a lot of people will be <Col N="689" /> found out in the same way as people were found out when PAYE was introduced.</P>
    <P>RGDATA say that the people will be charged nothing extra in the big stores, but they then go on to weep for the little shopkeeper.  All this talk sounds very phoney to me.  Why all those tears for the ordinary people if they are to get foodstuffs without extra tax and at the same time, increased social benefits?  How are the people to suffer if that is so, as RGDATA says it is?  Supposing the shopkeeper does suffer, why should the people worry?  Was this an idea to excite the people to march?  I say the Dublin North-East by-election was won by fraud.  You had one man in the Opposition telling the man in the street how much the turnover tax would cost him and you had RGDATA saying the big stores would not show the tax at all.</P>

They cheered up a bit when they realised the Government would win, when they saw my friend, Deputy Leneghan and I were here and that everything was all right.  What is the money from this tax required for? We want money and that is that.  I listened to Deputy McGilligan this afternoon.  Of course he is a lawyer. <Col N="690" /> Without meaning anything personal, lawyers can split hairs and can tell every lie in the calendar.  It is their job.  He said this turnover tax will mean an increase in the cost of living. What kind of tax would his Party impose, or have they any plan at all?</P>

      <P>Sometimes what Deputies say here is not intended for here: it is for consumption by people who take a very small view of things, who have not the experience to see overall implications.  That is why Deputy McGilligan spoke as he did today about the increased cost of living.  It might be a minor increase but what about his plan?  At least RGDATA, to give them their due, were prepared to be satisfied with money.  But they are not politicians. They only want money.  They do not want votes.  So they can afford a little honesty at this stage.  But the Opposition want votes: that is different.  The crowd would get wise.  This is not the time to talk about what they put on. Still, we have Deputy McGilligan saying that this could be an increase in the cost of living.  What about his figures?  I am trying to find out about them.  I asked to have it explained to me but I got no explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Still, you are asking me to turn against the Government&mdash;I who have enough &ldquo;savvy&rdquo; to understand all these arguments and who am convinced of the need for revenue.  Do not forget all the Private Members' motions for increased pensions for retired Gardaí, retired teachers, State pensioners, Army pensioners, and so on.  The money sought now is to help to meet people whom you have been promising to assist.  If there is money there, those people may be met but if money is not there, they cannot be met.  We must keep all the people on social services in mind.  We must keep <Col N="691" /> in mind an enormous number of people who cannot get what they want until the revenue is there to give it to them.</P>
    <P>You are trying to put it over on the simple folk that if you get into office, they will not have to pay any taxes, that some crowd known as the higher-luxury group will pay it.  How many of them are there?  I have heard it suggested that it should be imposed on fur coats.  How many fur coats are sold in the year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>You should know&mdash; not my associates, anyway.  This is a ridiculous sort of suggestion.  Of course, it is not broken down.  It is the usual stuff you get from politicians for the simple folk who do not think in that overall sense in which we fellows think because we have to think that way.  Yesterday, Deputy Dillon talked about housing.  We are not supposed to talk about housing but I shall say a few words on it.  I found out this about Deputy Dillon.  He can get away with murder.  He can ramble and tell us about the past and the future, crack jokes, and so on.  But, if we try it, we are often told we are out of order.  Yesterday, Deputy Dillon spoke about housing.  He referred to the buildings falling in the city.  I am the only representative in Dublin who gave evidence at that inquiry.  Why?  Because I know all about it.  I have spoken about this before.  The majority of Deputy Dillon's representatives know very little about it.  Do not forget that the evidence I gave was in front of all the corporation officials who could contradict me.  I said I brought 500 people out of dangerous buildings.  In the allocations section last year, I brought out 2,000 altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman wants to know what I do or do not do.  I am telling him what I do.  I could spend all day and night telling him.  That is why, if you examine this whole question, I can see the wood from the trees and, with no feasible alternative by the Opposition, I had no alternative but to vote for the Bill.  I am prepared to admit <Col N="692" /> that there is a certain amount of nuisance involved but it will be surmounted. If there are very serious defects, the people concerned will meet the Minister and I believe they will be ironed out.</P>
    <P>The fact is that we want the revenue. There will be further need of revenue in the future because there will be greater demands on it.  We were told the money we formerly got on imports will gradually decline, so, whether or not we like it, we need some form of taxation to meet the demands.  It has been brought home to us that as far as certain goods such as beer, cigarettes, and so on, are concerned, we have reached the limit.</P>
    <P>If I try to get something and do not succeed, I try again.  If you want me to tell you a lot more about what I have done for those people, I shall tell you but you had better be careful.  I am a fellow who has to work hard because I am on my Pat Malone.  I work all day, Sunday, Saturday and so on.  You do not.  None of your crowd does it much, either.  I do not earn one penny outside this House because I gave it all up for full-time work here. You would not do that.  I am damn certain you would not.</P>
    <P>I have a letter here from Limerick&mdash; not from one of my constituents.  He tells me he has been informed, in regard to bread, that shopkeepers will not put any money on batch bread, that they will put a little on fancy bread, so that bread will be just the same in price. He went on to say that he is aware that the RGDATA crowd, especially the Fine Gael side of it, paid some of their workers to come up to Dublin and gave them a free tricket&mdash;£2 each &mdash;and in many cases they raised their goods by five per cent to pay for it.</P>
    <P>You are not talking about the business people&mdash;profits up by 58 per cent last year.  I was looking at the paper the other day.  Despite Unidare's profits in Finglas, there is cribbing over 2½ per cent.  But they will not have to pay. Maybe it is that the other fellows are not so honest about this big percentage of profits and that that is why they are objecting.  I am very suspicious about all this business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> I shall not detain the House.  I know Deputy Dillon is anxious to come in and have a go at me while I am sitting down.  If he does, I shall get up and have a go at him.  I want the Opposition to know this much.  If, at the next election, whenever it is, the Opposition are returned to power, I can assure them that if I think they can function as a Government, they will get my vote.  There is one for you.</P>

      <P>We invite him and the Taoiseach to give the people an opportunity tomorrow of deciding what catapulting they will do. I do not believe this Government have any right in these circumstances to endeavour to push this tax down the throats of the people.  Surely it is not right, when the House is exactly evenly divided on a drastic new tax measure such as this, that, because Fianna Fáil have acquired and continued to get the support of two Independent Deputies, they should endeavour to force this through?  Even with the votes of those Deputies, they can secure the support of only one-half of the membership of this House.  Is it right in those circumstances that any Government should try to change so drastically the entire tax system and framework of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is at least open to doubt whether <Col N="694" /> this Government, under the Constitution, are entitled to remain in office to-day.  It is laid down in the Constitution that when the Taoiseach fails to retain the support of a majority in this House, he should resign.  On a vote that it was agreed was tantamount to a vote of no confidence on the Second Reading of this Bill, the Taoiseach did not get the support of a majority of Deputies.  He got the support of half the Deputies, which is not a majority of the House.</P>

      <P>We heard that kind of speech from Deputy Noel Lemass, and to the eternal credit of the Minister for Finance, let it be said he went out while Deputy Lemass was making it.  Of course, he cannot go out while his second-in-command is sitting beside him to make the same type of speech.  At least it is open to doubt whether this Government are entitled to remain in office in view of the vote taken on the Second Reading of this Bill.  It certainly is questionable whether any Government in any country are entitled with the support of only half the full representation of Parliament drastically to change the tax system.  It is admitted on all sides &mdash;even by Deputy Sherwin, who is described in one of today's papers as the lynchpin of Fianna Fáil&mdash;that public opinion is against this tax and that the people do not want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely one of the basic essentials of any democratic system of Government is that the voice of the people will be heard in the Parliament of the people? Is the voice of the people being heard in this Parliament today?  If it is being raised, is it being listened to?  Do Deputy Leneghan and Deputy Sherwin not know that the vast majority of the people are against these Government proposals?  Is it not manifest in the only constituency in which the people had an opportunity of passing judgment on these Government proposals, Dublin North-East, that the people voted against them and, without reflecting in any way on the individual candidate, that the Government sustained as humiliating a defeat as any <Col N="695" /> Government in office sustained at a by-election?  Is it any wonder, in face of that, we have the kind of bad-tempered speech we heard this evening from Deputy Noel Lemass?</P>

      <P>If the last two speeches are to be taken as samples of the arguments put forward in favour of these proposals, it is an excellent demonstration of how completely bankrupt the Government are of arguments in favour of them.  I want to make it quite clear&mdash;and I think in view of what Deputy Sherwin said it is necessary to do so&mdash;that neither I nor any of my colleagues in these benches hold any brief for any trade organisation.  But we recognise the right of RGDATA or any other trade organisation under the Constitution to make known their views on Government policy, legislation and proposals.  We are entitled to defend their right to assemble peacefully for the purpose of protesting against these Government proposals.  They are entitled to do that without being threatened, as they were threatened by the Taoiseach, with bloody noses if they voice their opposition to Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin quoted their proposals. I do not care what their proposals were.  At least they did make proposals.  They had a solution. Deputy Sherwin had a solution also and on the White Paper issued to Deputies that solution was made known to us&mdash;an amendment to challenge the Government to exclude batch bread from these proposals.

If Deputy Sherwin was asked by any voter in his constituency at the last election was he going to vote for a tax on food, for a tax on bread, for a tax on coal, for a tax on clothes, I am sure Deputy Sherwin would be honest enough to stand up here and say he would have told the questioner he had not the slightest intention of voting for a tax on food, fuel and clothes.  If the Tánaiste or any other member of Fianna Fáil were asked at the last election if they were re-elected as a Government would they by positive Government budgetary action tax food, fuel and clothes, is there any of them who would have stated on a public platform in the last election that they were seeking a mandate from the people for the purpose of taxing the basic essentials of life, for the purpose of taxing food, fuel and clothes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair can hardly be unaware of the fact that Deputies on the opposite side quoted reports from as far back as 1932.  I am referring to a speech of the Taoiseach last month.  The Taoiseach was reported as saying that he believed <Col N="698" /> that the Irish people had developed political maturity. He said he was willing to stake the political future of the Government and of his Party on their judgment and did not think he was taking any risk whatever.  I invite the Taoiseach to allow the people to exercise their intelligent judgment on this political question of the turnover tax in this Finance Bill.  Of course, as long as he retains the support of two Independents which enables him to secure the votes of half the House, he will not do that.  He will not stake the future of his Party or of the Government on the intelligent judgment of the Irish people on this political question.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a section of the Finance Bill relating to the turnover tax.  The first point I want to repeat, for the benefit of the last speaker in particular, is that the turnover tax will increase the cost of living. If allowed to go into operation, it will increase by 2½ per cent the prices of all goods and all services coming within its scope.  It will do that without making the slightest differentiation between luxury goods and Deputy Sherwin's batch bread.  It will not make the slightest differentiation between the person who at the end of the week, must spend all his weekly income on domestic needs and the person who is able to put away three-quarters of his weekly income in savings or spend it on luxury goods requiring only a quarter of it for domestic needs.</P>
      <P>This tax will mean that 2½ per cent more must be paid for the basic essentials of food, fuel and clothes and on the Minister's own calculation, of the £11 million he hopes to raise from this tax, about £7 million will be taken from the people buying these items. The operation of the tax will be complicated.  Many think it will be unworkable.  All those considerations are relevant to the section we are discussing.  Deputy Sherwin has followed faithfully in the footsteps of the directive apparently issued to the Fianna Fáil Party at their recent meeting that a good argument whenever a Fine Gael speaker refers to the turnover tax is to ask: &ldquo;What are you going to do instead?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Sherwin should remember that in 1947 the Party he is keeping in Government at the cost of the turnover tax introduced a Supplementary Budget in which they put savage impositions on a number of commodities.  Fine Gael, in common with other Parties, opposed them and they were told in effect by Fianna Fáil that the money had to be found, that the country was facing a crucial period and that money was needed to keep the ship of State on an even keel and that if there was a change of Government and if a new Government dared to abolish the taxes Fianna Fáil had put on in their Supplementary Budget in 1947, the country would have to face vast new taxation and the Government would have to put up income tax by 2/6 in the £.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin describes himself as a veteran and I am sure he remembers this as well as I do.  The change of Government came about and inside a fortnight, I think, the inter-Party Government, under Deputy John A. Costello, remitted all those taxes imposed by Fianna Fáil in 1947.  They gave social welfare benefits also.</P>

      <P>There was a general election and Fianna Fáil got back to office and introduced a Budget in 1952 in which their first effort was to wipe out half of the food subsidies. That was the first time in recent years that Fianna Fáil deliberately increased the price of food.  Would the Tánaiste ask me what happened in 1957?  I am going to tell him in any case. In 1957, they again got back to office and their first action in their first Budget <Col N="700" /> was to remove the remainder of the food subsidies to save the Exchequer £9 million which the previous Government had kept there to protect the weakest section of the community against food increases.</P>
      <P>Now, would Deputy Sherwin oblige by asking what happened in 1963? With the assistance of Deputy Sherwin and Deputy Leneghan, a Fianna Fáil minority Government, unable to attract the support of the majority of the House, again proposed by deliberate positive Government action to increase the price of food, fuel and clothing and a host of other commodities also.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins spoke about the mandate the people gave us.  The mandate the people gave us was to rule this country, as my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary said, but I remember the mandate they gave us in 1957.  I have a very clear recollection of the mandate they gave us at that time: &ldquo;Do what you like, but for goodness sake, do not let that Coalition back,&rdquo; and we are determined to keep that promise we gave the people at that time that they would never come back again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the Fine Gael speakers say that the people generally are against this tax.  Why, therefore, do Fine Gael think we are going on with it?  Can they suggest any reason whatever if the people are against us, and they say we know they are against us?  If that is true, what reason can they give for this tax being put on?  Is it not obvious the only reason they can give <Col N="701" /> is that we think it is for the good of the country that it should be done? There could be no other reason and I defy any Deputy on the Fine Gael or Labour side to suggest any other reason why we are going ahead with this tax.</P>
    <P>We do not believe there is this great feeling against the tax at all.  There are a lot of vocal protestations but we will not be intimidated by any organised opposition to this tax. I think we are to be congratulated because we are going to fight this intimidation from the point of view of principle and, to use Deputy Dillon's words, it is a much more pleasant feeling to fight a thing like that than to be selling our souls for penny rolls&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins made a long speech against this tax generally but he did not like to end his speech without throwing a sop to RGDATA.  He went on to say that if this tax must be imposed, it would be better to impose it at the wholesale level.  I should have imagined that speakers from Fine Gael and Labour would not consider any modification of this tax, that they considered it was wrong and that was the end of it. However, the attitude of the fine Gael Party is that whatever your principles may be said to be, at the same time, do not lose a friend.  They do not want to lose their friends in RGDATA so they put their point of view forward before this debate ends.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words about this proposition put up by Deputy O'Higgins on behalf of RGDATA that the tax should be put on at wholesale level.  Everybody knows enough about trade to realise that if the tax were put on at the manufacturer level, it would have to be made very much higher to get the same yield.  If the manufacturer's price is so much, there is a margin added on by the wholesaler and a margin added on again by the retailer.  It is obvious there must be a higher tax at the manufacturer level than at the retail level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the point that you cannot apply tax uniformly at the manufacturer level.  It would be necessary to put on a tax of four to five per cent at the manufacturer level to give the same yield.  That four or five per cent added on will itself be increased at the wholesale level and again at the retail level so that the consumer, as the Parliamentary Secretary said quite rightly, would be paying about six or seven per cent more than he would at the retail level.  At the retail level, he will not pay more than 2½ per cent if the retailer sees that the consumer pays the tax.  At the manufacturer level, the consumer would have to pay about three or four per cent more for his goods and the revenue would get no more.  Fine Gael, not wanting to lose the support of RGDATA, are in alliance with them in this regard, so let me say it would be a very bad bargain to impose a tax at the manufacturer level from the point of view of the revenue and, at the same time, the consumer would be paying more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Higgins tried to misrepresent speakers on this side of the House as sometimes saying the consumer must pay and sometimes saying the shopkeeper must pay. Of course, the Deputy has a right to express his opinion but I have been the principal spokesman for this tax all through and at every opportunity I said I was assuming that the consumer would pay this tax.  In the Budget, I made that point and I said I wanted to compensate the social welfare recipients for the increase in the cost of living which would be imposed on them as a result of this tax.  It would not have been necessary for me, as Deputy Sherwin pointed out, to increase the social welfare benefits if I did not believe that this tax was going to be passed on.  In fact, I agree with Deputy Sherwin that practically any tax goes on to <Col N="703" /> the consumer sometime or other, if it does not go on immediately.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke about the increase this tax would impose on the old age pensioner and other people of a similar class.  Deputy Tully must be very uninterested in matters in this House if he does not remember that in the Budget speech, I provided for an increase in the old age pension and for all other social welfare recipients so as to compensate them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is talking a lot of nonsense.  He is giving a half-crown and there will be about four shillings taken off, and he knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the greatest nonsense I have heard for a long time. Deputy Tully knows the old age pensioner has about 32/6d.  Sixpence in the pound is about tenpence on that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase is about tenpence on his expenditure, whatever it may be.  In fact, it would be somewhat less, because, as I pointed out in the Budget speech, the whole of his earnings will not be subject to tax. There will be certain things on which <Col N="704" /> he will spend money and which will not be subject to tax, for instance, if he has to pay rent, rates or bus fares. Therefore, the whole income will not be subject to tax, but if it were, the tax would not be more than tenpence, and we are giving him a halfcrown.  Deputy Tully is not interested in what people are getting; he is more interested in politics.  If he were interested, he would be more solicitous as to how we are to raise this money to give to the social welfare recipients.</P>

Where, however, the retailer gets his goods from a person who is accountable for tax, he can go to the limit of £500. For persons providing services, the option limit remains at £100 a month. If he is giving a service, he need not register up to £100 a month.  If he is selling goods which he has bought from a registered person, he can go up to £500 per month but if he has not bought them from a registered person, he can only go up to £250 a month.</P>

The effect of these amendments is that certain persons who, as the Bill is drafted, were not themselves responsible for the operation of the turnover tax are now, as a result of this batch of amendments, being made so liable to come in that category.  These are ones with a turnover of between £250 and £500 a month.  Is that not the correct meaning of those amendments?</P>

      <P>The position is that if the figure of £500 a month is brought up to £750 a month, it would eliminate a great many of the difficulties for the shopkeepers throughout the country. We all know from the ordinary public that there is no real objection to the 2½ per cent turnover tax and those people who came along and tried to bribe and intimidate myself and Deputy Sherwin were not the ordinary workers. They were people who were organised by politicians.</P>
      <P>My amendments is not designed to help out these people but I do realise that there are many people who have a much higher turnover than they are believed to have.  Many of these people have not got the means of collecting this tax.  They are one-or two-men businesses, or perhaps a business run by a man and his wife, or perhaps a man and his sister.  They have no method of calculating the tax and of dealing with it.  I feel that if the figure were raised to £750, it would smooth out the grievances of many of these people and I hope the Minister will agree to it.</P>

      <P>If Fine Gael are so pleased and excited about having lost the last division, they should contain themselves.  The House is still in session and up to Section 65 of the Bill will have to be dealt with tonight. I should like to support Deputy Leneghan on this amendment.  A number of people have misgivings about this matter, for the reason that they are afraid of having to keep books and of having to do complicated returns in order to pay the tax.  I should imagine that over 80 per cent of the businesses in the average small town would be covered by this amendment, <Col N="710" /> that is, businesses with a turnover of £9,000 a year or less.  It would give them the opportunity to opt out and thereby divest themselves of all trouble in connection with the tax.</P>
      <P>For reasons that I can appreciate, this would mean putting additional work on the wholesaler but it is, perhaps, not unfair to say that the wholesaler is well equipped to look after book-keeping matters.  It is only a matter of channelling some additional material into a machine or of having it otherwise recorded.  It cannot be said that a shopkeeper with a turnover of £9,000 or less is altogether a small trader.  I would regard him as having a reasonably sound business because he would have a profit of anything from £1,000 to £2,500.</P>

Deputy Leneghan proposes that the exemption be raised from £500 to £750 and Deputy Flanagan supports Deputy Leneghan.  I understand that Deputy Sherwin is associated with Deputy Leneghan's amendment.  So we have the fifth and sixth wheels of the Government wagon now proposing a direct negative to the proposals of the Minister for Finance. The Minister is proposing to reduce the exemption from the level of £500 to £250 and Deputies Leneghan and Sherwin are proposing to raise it from £500 to £750.  Let us put this to the issue now so as to determine how honest they are.  They will get a chance in the Lobby of demonstrating not only their honesty but their independence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I put down an amendment similar to that of Deputy Leneghan, I take it I will be permitted to discuss this.  One of the arguments used by the shopkeepers was that they did not want this accounting.  They said it would entail extra staff.  They would prefer that this tax was deducted at source.  A shop with a turnover of between £600 and £700 a month is not a very big business and a lot of those people do not have all that much money.  Many of them who drink and gamble a little, live from week to week. They do not want the responsibility of holding on to the money.  They find it itchy.  They would like this money taken away in dribs and drabs.  We know that before the introduction of PAYE many people found it imposible to hold on to money with which to pay their income tax.  Now they have no difficulty.  The same would apply to small shopkeepers, and it is in their interest that I would ask the Minister to accept this.</P>

      <P>I would support Deputies Leneghan and Sherwin in asking the Minister to accept this amendment.  Nobody could describe a man with £750 a month turnover as a big shopkeeper.  It is doubtful, in fact, if the business would be worth all the trouble of keeping accounts.  I believe, speaking generally, that this turnover tax will be most popular throughout the country.  The Opposition, of course, disagree, but they had a different story to tell when PAYE was being introduced. I should add that I speak on behalf of far more shopkeepers than does Deputy Sweetman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no conflict between my amendment and that of Deputies Leneghan and Sherwin.  My amendment was aimed at ensuring that a person who was not required to register would not be in unfair competition with a person in the same trade.  Take, for example, a butcher who buys his cattle direct from the farmer.  He might be in competition with a man who did not.  The same applies to milk.  It would be unfair. It is a type of competition that could go on between a person who got his goods untaxed and a person who got them taxed.  For that reason, I wanted to bring the limit down to £250.  The amount in the Bill is £500 and in principle, I have no great objection to raising that.  It makes very little difference to revenue because a smaller man registering is allowed a low rate on the first £50 and a reduced rate on the next £50.  If you take him against the person who is taking all his goods from a registered person and where they are taxed at wholesale rates, I am advised it would make very little difference.  The figure of £750 is not too high, but if it were very much higher it would mean there would be a loss to revenue.</P>

      <P>We were told there was a matter of simple mathematics involved in computing the profits and that every little added something to the tax if the person is taxed at the first stage.  Then you come back to the second stage to the extent of 80 per cent, according to Deputy Seán Flanagan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is the other way round.  The Deputy is talking about wholesale prices.  The wholesaler is taxed and he passes it on to the retailer.  If the retailer bought at wholesale prices he would pay the tax but he would pay it at a low rate on the first and second £50.  The revenue would be better from the wholesale point of view so long as the exemption is low.  If the exemption reaches a certain figure, we begin to lose.</P>

      <P>A member of the House has asked the Minister to define the section.  I have given him the definition.  I would just ask him to say whether or not my definition is correct.  The Minister should oblige a Deputy who asks him directly, through the Chair, to say whether or not that is the position.  I shall repeat this.  The Minister's amendment proposed to reduce those who will be exempted from registration and exempted from collecting the tax at retail level on a turnover of £6,000 annually to a turnover of £3,000 or less annually and the alternative amendment, if approved by the House, would exempt all those with a turnover of less than £9,000 annually.  Is that the net position so far as the two amendments are concerned?</P>

      <P>I have explained this more than once.  The effect of my amendments, Nos. 23 and 25, taken together&mdash;the rest are consequential&mdash; is that a trader who buys his goods from a non-registered person, for example, from a farmer, where no tax is paid, can sell only up to £250 per month without registering himself.  On the other hand, take a person who buys from a wholesaler who pays the tax&mdash; which would refer to the great majority of shops, grocers, drapers, and so on.  As my amendments go, they can go up to £500 a month without registering.  Now, Deputy Leneghan proposes that that go up to £750.  I have no great objection to it.</P>

      <P>What is in the Bill is what will become law.  We had enough about assurances when we had <Col N="718" /> the Taoiseach telling us on 9th May, 1959, when discussing the Transport Bill, that there was no need to embody them in the Bill.  He put that across at that time and subsequently dishonoured his assurances and obligations. Now the Minister for Finance wants us to accept a similar proposal from him that there is no need to embody this in the section.  I believe he should withdraw this amendment and make it quite clear on Report Stage by redrafting the section.  We will not accept these assurances any more, since the assurance we got from the Taoiseach was subsequently dishonoured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be some limit to the degree in which we are prepared to legislate for the impossible. A grocer standing behind his counter can fix the retail selling price of his goods.  The whole basis of the Minister's case is that a grocer can charge the turnover tax on any commodity in his stock on which he chooses to charge it but he need not charge it on some other commodity. There is nothing in this Bill, nor in the laws of the land that I know of, to restrict a grocer from selling tea at 4/6d. per lb. and then selling it to <Col N="728" /> the next customer who comes in at 4/- a lb.  Is there any limit or restriction or legal obligation on a shopkeeper to charge his customers any particular margin of profit on any particular item of goods?  Is there not a legal practice in the large discount houses of selling goods below cost price for the purpose of inducing custom?  If a self-service store in Dublin is seeking to knock out the small shopkeeper, it sells certain goods below cost.  I understand that they will be asked under this law to pay turnover tax on the price they actually charge.  I think I am right in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the current retail price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are legislating to say that if somebody sets up a self-service shop in any particular part of Dublin and for the purpose of wiping out all the local small shopkeepers and creating a monopoly of trade in a particular area, he is entitled to sell any commodity in his shop at any price he arbitrarily chooses to charge for it.  However, if a grocer in Ballaghaderreen, or in Baltinglass, or Wexford, or Limerick, or even in Belmullet, chooses to charge himself the wholesale price for a commodity which he proposes to take from his own store for use in his own home, he is committing an offence punishable by imprisonment under this Bill. Surely that is carrying legislation for the impossible beyond the limits of sanity.</P>
      <P>Does any Deputy desire to legislate that a shopkeeper in any part of Ireland who <i>bona fide</i> draws goods from his own shop for use in his home shall be liable to penalties which are not operative against a cut-price self-service store which is selling the goods next door to him, not at wholesale prices but substantially below wholesale prices, to his customers?  That seems to me to be so flagrant an absurdity to enact that I urge the Minister not to persist in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any good argument for putting the 2½ per cent on the retail price.  I assume that the <Col N="729" /> turnover is based on the income from the retail sales.  The shopkeeper buys goods at wholesale prices.  I do not think we could stretch our imagination to the extent that we could imagine the shopkeeper actually selling goods to himself.  He has paid the wholesale price and surely it should be sufficient to charge the 2½ per cent on that, where he takes goods for his own use.  There has been, in fact, no retail sale.  It would be as if he went to the other side of the counter and asked his wife, or the assistant, to pass him the money to make it a retail sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will have to agree that if you want to get this tax to work fairly, the person will have to account for any goods taken for his own consumption.  If we were to say: &ldquo;You can take all you like free of tax for your own house&rdquo;, there would be a great danger that he might be kind to his friends as well in regard to giving them goods and in his returns he might set out &ldquo;so much supplied to my own household&rdquo;.  We would have to stop that type of evasion.  When you come to stop it, how can you deal with it?  His customers are paying the retail price and the tax, to be fair, should be on the retail price as well.  It would be difficult to have two prices, the wholesale for him and the retail for the others.  In practice, of course, there will be an agreement.  Any reasonable shopkeeper would have an agreement with the Revenue representative in regard to however it may work out.  There might be £6 or £7 worth of goods supplied each week to the house and that will be the end of it.</P>

If I am in the furnishing business and I want to take a table out of stock for my own use and the wholesale price is £20, would it not be possible for me to say that the retail price is going to be the wholesale price?  It is up to me to determine the price so that in respect of all items the shopkeeper is entitled to fix his own price and deem it to be the actual wholesale price.</P>

      <P>As the Minister <Col N="730" /> knows, there are throughout the country a number of small grocers&mdash; who are probably of sufficient size to come in under this tax&mdash;who sell their own produce from an orchard or a garden in their shops.  There are the nurserymen who take flowers or shrubs for their own use.  I am not sure whether both of these would come in under this category of exemptions applying to sales by farmers of their own produce.  The Minister will appreciate, particularly in relation to the type of shop I am speaking of, that in the summer, the shopkeeper will sell appeals, or pears, or lettuce, or scallions in his shop.  Is the position of that proprietor that, provided he takes them direct from his garden to the house, it is all right, but if he passes them through the shops and they are brought into stock for a period and then consumed in the house, they are in, but otherwise they are out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that in such a case, where a shopkeeper has a farm or garden of his own, vegetables for his own house would be free.  That type of case is better dealt with under amendments Nos. 23 to 28 which we have just passed.  If a person is getting most of his goods from a farm and, say, is in the poultry or egg business, he would only be free of tax up to the £250 a month, not up to £500. I know there are shopkeepers in the country who sell one specific article from their own farms, say, butter, or milk, or cabbage, and it is not necessary to penalise these people so much. If they do not exceed 10 per cent of their sales from their farms, they could go up to £500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As this section stands at present, a shopkeeper can send his wife outside the counter of his shop <Col N="731" /> or commission her to act as a customer and I know of no provision in the law of this land that prevents a grocer or draper or furniture dealer putting any retail price he likes to the customer at the other side of the counter.  There is no reason under the existing law why the proprietor of a cut-price shop in Dublin, desiring to attract to himself a particular customer whom he knows can give him a big amount of business, cannot say to that customer that he will quote him any price he likes in order to attract him.  How do you then effectively legislate in the terms of Section 50 if you cannot prevent a shopkeeper from telling a customer that he will sell him a parcel of goods for 6d.?  So far as I know, the shopkeeper is entitled to sell those goods at 6d. if he wants to do so.</P>
      <P>There is no statutory definition of a retail price and there is no obligation on anyone to sell goods at a profit.  I suggest to the Minister that Section 50 is unenforceable and that any attempt to enforce it would be unjust.  You cannot say to a grocer that he must sell goods to his wife or to anyone else at a price that would make him a profit.  We all know that there are retail distributors selling goods at prices substantially below cost.  How can the Minister say that the shopkeeper who sells to the public below the retail price is breaking the law? It is fantastic to pass laws in this House which have no meaning.  Anyone with any experience of the retail trade knows that Section 50 has no meaning.</P>

You cannot make a profit out of yourself.  You are asking these people to pay a retail tax on goods sold to themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly the grocery trade is not the best example.  I do not know a lot about the purchase of groceries but I do appreciate that in respect of many of the articles bought by the ordinary housewife, tea, sugar, butter, jams and jellies, there is some regularity in the price.  I do not think it is fair that the owner should have to pay the tax on the retail price of goods used by himself but it is fair that he should pay it on the wholesale price.  As I said, the grocery trade is not the best example but there is great variation in price in the hardware trade and in the drapery trade.  I suggest that the Revenue Commissioners are going to have a difficult time if they try to establish the retail price for all the commodities in a hardware shop or a drapery shop.  You cannot say that such-and-such is the retail price of any article in a small town.</P>
      <P>If this tax is to be collected every month, the inspectors will have to determine, for the purpose of a proprietor taking goods from stock for the use of his family, what is to be the retail price of hundreds of articles in a hardware or drapery shop.  I think the Revenue Commissioners' job could be done much more easily if the tax in respect of these people were related to the wholesale rather than to the retail prices.</P>

      <P>This is a retail tax and, therefore, it would appear illogical not to take that tax at the retail price. It can be taken at the current retail price and I do not think there will be any great difficulty at arriving at what is the current retail price.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that a man can sell his goods at any price he likes.  A man can sell tea at one shilling a lb, if he wants to, but if he starts that, his <Col N="733" /> business would become so big that he could not deal with it.  The Revenue Commissioners hope that this will work out by coming to an arrangement with the persons concerned.  They can agree to take the figure of £6 or £7 a week and that will be the end of it.</P>

      <P>This is legislation.  We are legislating that certain goods shall be charged at the retail price current at the time of the withdrawal.  I suggest there is no such thing known to the law as the retail price current at the time of the withdrawal.  As far as I know the law, the retail price of a commodity is the price at which the merchant sells it.</P>

      <P>It is extremely practical. I want to know what does the law require a law-abiding citizen to do.  I am informed by this section that he is required to charge the current retail price for the goods withdrawn for his own or his family's use.  I suggest we are legislating for the impossible here.  The Minister says the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to take a reasonable estimate. But is not any taxpayer entitled to say he does not agree on an estimate? I submit the Revenue Commissioners have no right under existing law to challenge that election on the part of any law-abiding citizen, and having made that election not to make any estimate in respect of weekly withdrawals, I submit that in accordance with the law he is entitled to give goods to his wife and family at a nominal figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or to anybody.  The fact is it is common knowledge to anybody reading the <i>Garda Review</i> that a list of shops is given to members of the Garda Síochána in which a specified discount is given. The INTO publication gives a similar list of shops where members of that organisation are given a specified discount.  It appears to me that under Section 50 the shopkeeper will find himself in the astonishing position that while he is entitled to sell goods to members of those organisations, he is not entitled to assess the value of the goods at the same rate in respect of his own family.  There are well-established trade practices through which a shopkeeper's staff buy goods at a marked down price of five or ten per cent below retail prices.  Is it seriously argued that a shopkeeper serving his own family is not permitted to allow goods to them at the same prices as he sells to members of his staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> While I condemn this tax unreservedly, if it is to be enacted into law, let us make it a thing that law-abiding citizens in this country can observe.  That being so, I suggest Section 50 be omitted from the Bill. To suggest that we in Dáil Éireann deny to a shopkeeper the right to charge his own family the lowest price at which he has sold to anybody coming into his shop is fantastic. It is utterly wrong to place such an obligation on a body of people who are, after all, self-respecting, decent, law-abiding, whose rights should be regarded with some respect by this Legislature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quoted paragraph 10 of the pamphlet to the effect that reasonable estimates of withdrawals will be accepted.  It has already been pointed out, and I think it must be emphasised again, that neither what is in the pamphlet nor what the Minister says is the law.  What will be the law is what is in Section 50 of the Bill when it becomes an Act, not what is in the pamphlet.  Irrespective of what is in the pamphlet or of what the Minister may say, it is open to the Revenue Commissioners or any other authority concerned to say in later years: &ldquo;The law is what is set out in Section 50 and that is the only law that will be applied in this respect. No longer will we do business on the basis of estimates, however reasonable they may be&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is necessary the House should understand that clearly.  I accept the proposal that it should be accepted on the basis of the shopkeeper's estimate, but we must understand that that may not continue to be so.  Assuming the Minister is able to satisfy the House on the question of a definition, if that is possible, of the retail price current at the time of the withdrawal, the other consequences of which I speak may occur later and this idea of agreeing on an estimate may go by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I want to get clarification from the Minister on this point.  Section 50 deals not only with the withdrawal by a person for his own use but with the withdrawal by a person of goods from stock for his own use or for the use of any other person.  The Minister <Col N="737" /> must know that very frequently in this country where sales, bazaars or functions of one sort or another are run in aid of charities, it is quite a common custom for businessmen to give gifts out of stock.  We do it by way of food for consumption at a function or flowers for decorating a church, or so on.  I should like to know from the Minister if those will be chargeable now with tax as withdrawals from stock, even though they are not for the person's own use and are intended purely for charitable purposes of that sort.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great interest to what has been said from the opposite benches.  I can understand their difficulty.  I see Deputy A.

A shopkeeper does not have to go through the performance described by Deputy Dillon of calling his wife down from upstairs and saying to her: &ldquo;You need porridge for tomorrow's breakfast.  Go out there and buy it.&rdquo; It is all nonsense.  The purpose of this section is to cover whatever the shopkeeper uses, whether he pays or not. As a matter of fact, the turnover tax does not specifically say cash sales only.  It includes also credit sales.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this section is that the shopkeeper, at whatever price he sells his goods, will pay the 2½ per cent &mdash;if he does not come to an agreement with the Revenue Commissioners &mdash;on the consumption by himself and his family of those goods.</P>

It was being deliberately sold at less than cost in order to attract people to buy other goods.  If this tax becomes law, the shopper will have to pay 2½ per cent, including the butter at 4/- per lb, at the exit.  If I withdraw from my own shop a pound of butter for my family and charge myself 4/- for it, according to this I will be expected to give 2½ per cent to the Revenue on the current retail price.</P>

The position is at the moment that, if he withdraws goods from his own shop for his own use, he does not charge a profit against himself.
